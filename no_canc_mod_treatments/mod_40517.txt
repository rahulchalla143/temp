Admission Date:  [**2137-7-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / IV contrast  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: fatigue, weight gain, lower extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis   History of Present Illness:  65 male with a history of NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CAD s/p CABG, DM2 on insulin, PAD s/p bilateral iliac stenting presents with a 6 week history of increasing abdominal distention, fatigue and worsening lower extremity edema.
The patient was first diagnosed with cirrhosis [**8-/2136**] and underwent a TIPS procedure [**2137-6-13**].
During that admission, he was treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose/rifaximin, and SBP with 5 day course of ceftriaxone.
Discharged on prophylactic ciprofloxacin 500mg daily.
Course c/b [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr rising to 1.4, and he was diagnosed with HRS type 2 after he did not respond to albumin administration.
He has a history of diuretic refractory ascites, and required 2 paracenteses during the admission.
Was discharged off diuretics given worsening renal function and concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
During the admission, his chronic hyponatremia worsened with administration of Bumex and spironolactone, and improved when these meds were held.
1 day PTA, he presented to [**Hospital3 **] for repeat paracentesis.
Patient received zofran for nausea.
Liver consulted, who recommended fluid restriction.
Was admitted for further work-up and treatment of hyponatremia and cirrhosis.
- CAD s/p CABG - DM2 - PAD s/p iliac stenting - Psoriasis - s/p roux-en-y gastric bypass   Social History: Married.
3x2 cm scar tissue lateral to umbilicus on the right side attributable to chronic insulin injection EXTREMITIES: Warm, well-perfused wih 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT IMAGING: [**2137-7-21**] liver ultrasound with doppler IMPRESSION 1.
Mild elevation of velocity in distal TIPS stent to which attention can be paid on follow-up.
Due to [**Last Name (un) **] on prior admission at [**Hospital1 18**] discharged [**7-10**], patient has not been on diuretics.
Patient was started on hypertonic saline drip in the ICU and improvement of Na to >120 was noted by hospital day 2 and hypertonic saline was discontinued prior to transfer to the liver service.
Patient was managed with fluid restriction and salt restriction.
Creatinine finally improved with aggressive albumin resucitation and maximum doses of midodrine and octreotide.
If renal function worsens again and cannot recover, may need repeat creatinine clearance, as if GFR <25 for 2 weeks he may be a candidate for combined liver-kidney transplant.
At time of discharge patient was back to about baseline on midodrine alone.
- Continue to hold diuretics - Continue midodrine 15mg TID PO - Follow up in transplant clinic as scheduled  # Cirrhosis: NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, cirrhosis complicated by HE, SBP, HRS,  MELD on transfer from MICU was 20, decreased to 15 at time of discharge.
Patient approved for transplant waiting list during this admission.
- SBP: h/o SBP, neg diagnostic paracentesis x2 this admission, on cipro ppx - Hepatic Encephalopathy: on lactulose, rifaximin.
AMS resovled, no asterixis at discharge - Varices: None on OSH EGD, not on nadolol - Ascites: Off diuretics for HRS, fluid and Na restriction; TIPS patent on US [**2137-7-21**] - Patient will follow up in transplant clinic  #Malabsorption: Severe nutritional deficiency as evidenced via physical appearance of cachexia, bitemporal wasting, and albumin of 3.1.
Pt currently on tube feeds [**12-20**] malabsorption in setting of NASH cirrhosis, gastric bypass surgery.
He will need to be on tube feeds indefinitely.
As pt has distorted anatomy due to roux-en-y gastric bypass, and will likely have recurrent large volume ascites, a PEG tube is not a viable option for tube feeds, so must use dobhoff.
Nutrition was consulted, patientn was on nepro tube feeds for hyperkalemia early in the admission, transitioned back to isosource prior to discharge as was normo-hypokalemic.
- Continue tube feeds at home via dobhoff  #DM: Sugars were difficult to control during this admission while on tubefeeds and octreotide was also likely contributing factor.
Was discharged on slightly increased basal insulin dose, and octreotide was not continued at discharge.
