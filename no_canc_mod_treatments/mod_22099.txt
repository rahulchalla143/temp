HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old man who has no prior history of coronary artery disease who had an abnormal EKG during a routine physical exam prompting a further workup echo that revealed an ejection fraction of 40 percent.
An ETT done on [**2161-9-25**] was stopped secondary to EKG changes with ST depressions in the inferior leads and inferoseptal hypokinesis as well as chest heaviness.

The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery.
His bypass time was 84 minutes with a cross- clamp time of 71 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He had Neo- Synephrine at 0.2 mcg/kg/minute as well as propofol at 20 mcg/kg per minute.
His anesthesia was reversed.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his operative day only requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
However, he was able to be weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine drip during that period of time.
His chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
On postoperative day 3 his temporary pacing wires were removed, and on postoperative day 4 it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be discharged to home.
