Right internal jugular vein hemodialysis line placement (removed by ICU team).
On [**6-15**], he was admitted with hyponatremia at which point tolvaptan was increased from 30mg to 60mg and diuretics were held.
On [**6-24**], he was readmitted for weight and hyponatremia.
Tolvapatan was continued but diuretics were held during admission and at discharge.
He was started on torsemide given its equal parenteral bioavailability as the patient is known to not follow his sodium restriction at home.

Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo male with hep C cirrhosis presented with hyponatremia, mild confusion, and acute kidney injury, after very recent hospitalization during which he was started on torsemide for mild diastolic heart failure.
He was seen by nursing and other staff members to go to the kitchen and bathroom and drink large amounts of water, in regular violation of the free water restriction of 1800 mL/day.
Lastly, he removed his PICC line at a time when he was being treated with a continuous furosemide infusion for volume overload.
He was warned that we did not feel he was medically ready to go home; he was at the time still being treated with continuous furosemide infusion.
He was transitioned over to torsemide 30 mg once daily.
Spironolactone was also held.
Simvastatin is likely of little benefit for primary prevention given his overall poor prognosis with end-stage liver disease (MELD 28-29), and this medicine was also held.
This was likely a result of decreased effective circulating volume due to poor oncotic pressure despite total body volume overload.
He was recently started on torsemide during his last admission and discharged on torsemide and spironolactone.
He did not tolerate ultrafiltration due to agitation, despite haldol 5mg iv.
A lasix gtt was initiated.
Nephrology was following and the decision was made to continue the lasix drip.
Patient diuresed well with the lasix drip over 48 hours, net negative 4-5 L.  He was also temporarily placed on low dose dopamine for diuresis, which was discontinued..  Encephalopathy started to clear with liquid lactulose.
Lasix drip discontinued due to staffing concerns.
Patient given Lasix 40mg IV x1.
Subsequently, he triggered as he became asymptomatically hypotensive to 80/40 with SOB requiring 2L nasal cannula.
He was given two doses of albumin 25g and his blood pressures improved.
Patient was ultimately discharged on torsemide 30 mg once daily.
However, his fluid status continues to be difficult to manage and his diuretic regimen may need further optimization.
He was continued on tolvaptan 60mg daily with an 1800cc fluid restriction.
Tolvaptan was held at time of discharge due to changing goals of care.
Lactulose was uptitrated and rifaximin was continued.
