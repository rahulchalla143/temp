His tox screen showed presence of benzo and methadone which he normally takes.
Therefore, the psychiatry service assisted with medication adjustment to prevent worsening of his respiratory drive.
Patient's mirtazepine and gabapentin were held.
He was given CPAP while in house at night given that he was noted to have O2 sat in the 70% when he falls asleep.
He responded to the CPAP with O2 supplement, and his O2Sat came up to the 90% when asleep.
Patient was given CPAP with O2 supplement so that he would continued to get bridge therapy while in the psychiatric hospital, awaiting for sleep study.
One can consider decreasing Xanax to TID from QID and use Vistaril 12.5-25 mg q6-8 hr while awake for breakthrough anxiety/restlessness.
Possibly secondary to alleged toxin ingestion, although none was found.
Psychiatry assisted with medication adjustment to prevent worsening of his somnolence.
His somnolence improved with holding mirtazepine and gabapentin and with use of CPAP.
Patient takes methadone at baseline.
His medication were adjusted with discontinuation of mirtazepine and gabapentin.

Psychiatry suggested decreasing Xanax to TID from QID and using Vistaril 12.5-25 mg q6-8 hrs while awake for breakthrough restlessness and anxiety, but this can be done in the psychiatry hospital.
He was continued on levothyroxine.
