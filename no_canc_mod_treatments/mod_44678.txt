A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out deep vein clot, superficial clot, or phlebitis.
The patient is now stable for discharge to [**Hospital6 1766**] Acute Care Facility, where she will be continued on heparin drip and Coumadin.
Her INR was 2.8 today, thus heparin drip needs to be continued for another 48 hours, to insure a 72 hour overlap of therapeutic INR of 2.5 to 3.5 and heparin.
Once the heparin is discontinued a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is desired.
Of note, the patient is status post a total abdominal hysterectomy, unclear if ovaries remain.
As the patient with massive bilateral pulmonary emboli, it was felt that inpatient cystoscopy is not possible in light of need for probable anesthesia sedation in order to perform either cystoscopy or GYN examination appropriately.
