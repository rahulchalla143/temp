The patient briefly required a non-rebreather to maintain oxygenation, but his respiratory status rapidly improved, and by [**2103-12-4**], the patient was maintaining good oxygen saturations on room air.
The patient was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
His PICC line was noted to be oozing, and withdrawn into a midline position.
ESRD on HD: The renal service was consulted, and the patient received hemodialysis per his usual schedule.
On the medical service, concern was raised based on erythema at the site of his AV fistula.
Hypertension: All anti-hypertensives except metoprolol were initially held due to concern that patient could become septic as his infection evolved.
Capropril was added in place of lisinopril in order to allow closer titration in the ICU setting.
Upon arrival to the medical floor his home regimen was resumed, including lisinopril, minoxidil, amlodipine, metoprolol.
Speech & Swallow evaluated the pt and he was made NPO again including pills as below.
He resumed his oral medications once he was again cleared by Speech & Swallow, and his Minoxidil was titrated up to 5 mg po bid on [**12-11**] for persistent hypertension.
Alzheimer's dementia/agitation: The patient was initially disoriented and agitated, pulling off face mask and climbing on bed rails.
This was thought to be secondary to dementia with delirium in the setting of infection.
Due to this, he required olanzepine briefly.
With ongoing treatment of his underlying medical conditions, his mental status and agitation improved, and did not require further antipsychotics.
He was also started on scheduled Tylenol in case he has underlying pain which may contribute to delirium.
His swallow function improved with improvement in his underlying medical conditions, and he subsequently passed Swallow evaluation with recommendations for nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
The following day, pt was noted to have some bleeding from his penile meatus, which is thought due to this trauma in the setting of Heparin 5000 units TID for DVT prophylaxis.
If patient continues to pass blood off of heparin, consider outpatient evaluation with his Urologist.
