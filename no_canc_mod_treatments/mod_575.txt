Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 6xyo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and enterococcal bacteremia.
Received ampicillin and gentamycin, and there was suspicion for aortitis vs infected clot.
Patient left AMA on linezolid after refusing vascular surgery intervention.
COPD, not on steroids, per pt never intubated 8.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66yo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and enterococcal bacteremia.
His hospital course is summarized as follows: He was initially followed on the medical floor for medical management of his MI and bacteremia but then transferred to the MICU on [**7-29**] when he became hypoxemic with an associated respiratory acidosis.
PICC was placed for longterm antibiotic therapy.
Diuresis with Lasix plus albumin with minimal response.
Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially intubated for respiratory distress with subsequent multiple failed planned and self-extubations throughout MICU course.
Hypoalbuminemia due to nephrotic syndrom also playing large role as pt reaccumulated fluid s/p thoracentesis and additionally, he has underlying COPD.
[**8-26**] R Thoracentesis removed 1.8 L, stopped due to hypotension requiring levophed temporarily.
Pt started on levophed [**8-3**].
Tried dobutamine trial ~[**8-6**] and [**8-11**] , pt failed (became hypotensive, tachycardic).
Attempted vasopressin [**8-12**] w/ goal of levophed wean: unsuccessful.
D/ced vasopressin [**8-15**].
Continued steroids w/ 6 day tapering course, finished [**8-25**].
[**Date range (1) 6230**] while on steroids pt w/ stable BP.
[**8-29**] pt hypotensive when in chair, standing valium decreased to 2.5 TID (from 5), and hydrocortisone restarted at 50 q 6.
Given hypotension, the fentanyl patch and valium were d/c'd and Fludrocortisone 0.2mg daily was started for orthostasis.
Evaluated by psychiatry given pt refused HD and unclear if he is competent to make any decisions.
Zyprexa started [**8-21**], Started SSRI, celexa [**8-25**], using standing valium to wean from midazolam drip s/p trach.
After psych evaluation began Haldol 5mg IV BID, then held Celexa in setting of poor renal function.
On D/C haldol 5mg TID has been working well and soothing his agitation.
Continue cefepime (had started cefepime and vanco [**8-13**], changed temporarily to ceftriaxone for better gram - coverage prior to sensitivites, reverted back to cefepime [**8-18**])through [**9-2**] for 15d course .
After successful levophed wean pt attempted on HD trials: trials of intermittent HD successful thus far, pt has tolerated fluid removal and remained hemodynamically stable.
Pleural effusion: reaccumulated w/i 48 hrs s/p thoracentesis on [**8-9**], quick reaccumulation suspected to be related to hypoalbuminemia.
IP performed thoracentesis on [**8-26**], removed 1.8 L on [**8-26**], stopped fluid removal secondary to hypotensive episode.
Vertebral osteo: osteomyelitis at L2-3, L4-5, C5-6.
Treatment continues wtih ampicillin for osteomyelitis.
Continue ampicillin x8 weeks.
Enterococcus bacteremia per OSH (E. Faecalis):  Was on amp/gent from OSH for synergistic coverage for presumed endocarditis.
at [**Hospital1 18**] was on vanco/zosyn [**Date range (1) 6231**], changed back to amp on [**8-5**].
8 wk course = ampicillin until [**9-28**] for osteo and endocarditis.
The pts sugars elevated when steroids started so insulin drip was used.
Aortitis: There was a oncern for infrarenal aortitis on OSH studies.
Per vascular surgery- no surgical intervention necessary.
[**Name (NI) 6233**] Pt started on amiodarone bolus/drip started [**8-9**] and subsequently converted to PO.
