GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP BIL US  [**2195-10-22**] 1:34 PM  GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP; GUIDANCE PERC TRANS BIL DRAINA  Reason: for drainage  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old woman with acute cholecystitis, poor operative candidate REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: for drainage ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY  CLINICAL HISTORY: Cholecystitis, poor surgical candidate.
The advantages and complications of the procedure were explained to the patient.
A preprocedure timeout was called to confirm the patient's identity and type of procedure to be performed.
Lidocaine 1% was used as a topical anesthetic and a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 11025**] [**Last Name (Titles) 45890**]l and Versed intravenously.
Under ultrasound guidance, an 8 French catheter was inserted into the gallbladder.
The catheter was coiled and ultrasound demonstrated proper placement of the catheter.
The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily.
IMPRESSION: Status post ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy with placement of an 8 French drainage catheter.
The patient is status post G-tube placement which appears to be in good position.
There are multiple gallstones within gallbladder and thickening of the wall and inflammatory changes around the gallbladder consistent with the known diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
These do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder.
BONE WINDOWS: The patient is status post posterior spinal fusion of L3/L4/L5/S1.
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 5 IU/L 0 - 40   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) 9 IU/L 0 - 40   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) 222 IU/L 94 - 250   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Alkaline Phosphatase 68 IU/L 39 - 117   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Amylase 41 IU/L 0 - 100   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Bilirubin, Total 0.3 mg/dL 0 - 1.5   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year-old female with MMP p/w nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for pancreatitis, metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure, which improved with electrolyte repletion and hydration.
Chronic cholelithiasis, thickened gallbladder wall, and dilated CBD were seen on ultrasound dated [**10-16**], but no overt cholesytitis on exam dated unchanged from prior studies.
Patient was kept NPO and started on IV fluids, and her enzymes trended down initially.
Patient was followed by the ERCP team, who recommended MRCP first before ERCP as patient was poor procedure candidate given her MMP and clinical status.
On day 7 of hospital admission, patient spiked a temperature while on Imipenem/Flagyl (for Klebsiella UTI and presumed cholecystitis).
Patient was evalued by ERCP and surgery, and it was felt that patietn was poor surgical candidate, and decision to place percutaneous cholecystostomy tube by Interventional Radiology was finally reached.
Patient tolerated procedure well.
As patient is poor surgical candidate at this time, tube will be left in place for at least 4-6 weeks; she has follow-up with general surgery scheduled, at which point further management options will be assessed.
Patient will continue on Imipenem/Cilastatin for 14-days after procedure.
As patietn had been NPO for several days, tube feeds were re-started and patient's PO diet was advanced as tolerated.
Patient received Anzement q8h PRN for nausea, and symptoms began to resolve once drain was placed.
Diarrhea Patient with a history of chronic C. Diff colitis, for which she has been treated with Flagyl several times.
Patient had been started on PO Vanc at OSH, but there was no evidence that her C. Diff was Flagyl-resistant, so patient was re-started on Metronidazole 500mg PO TID on [**10-16**], for 14-day course.
Patient's diarrhea improved with treatment of acute cholecystitis, but patient continued to experience intermittent loose, non-watery bowel movements of multifactorial etiology (re-starting tube feeds, possible C. Diff colitis, medication-induced).
Nutrition Due to pancreatitis and then cholecystitis, patient had been kept NPO for several days.
Once drain was placed, patient was re-started on tube feeds, as patient's nutritional status had declined significantly - Albumin was as low as 2.6.
Goal was to have temporary tube feeds in place with concurrent PO intake, and to d/c tube feeds once PO intake was adequate.
Renal Failure Patient's Cr on admission was 3.0, with baseline Creatinien around 1.9-2.0.
ACE inhibitors were avoided for BP control in this setting.
With fluid hydration for pancreatitis, patient demonstrated signs of fluid overload.
Patient was diuresed with PRN lasix IV, and she symptomatically and clinically improved.
HTN: Blood Pressure medications were held initially in the ICU and on the floor, as mesenteric ischemia was on the differential for patient's complaints -- within limits, HTN was allowed for better gut perfusion; once diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, Metoprolol and Norvasc were restored, and Hydralazine was added to the regimen.
Anemia Patient with baseline renal insufficiency, required 1 unit PRBCs for HCT < 28.
There was a question of possible transfusion reaction after event vs. fluid overload, as patient presented with shortness of breath necessitating NRB mask after xfusion, which improved with IV Lasix administration.
Patient also had low-grade fever, but patient had spiked a temperature the evening before and was being treated for her cholecystitis.
Hypothyroidism During period of inadequate PO intake, patient was placed on IV levothyroxine.
Once PO/tube feeds restarted, Levothyroxine PO instituted.
