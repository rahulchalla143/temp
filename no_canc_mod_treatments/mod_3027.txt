Admission Date:  [**2120-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-10-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Poison [**Female First Name (un) **] / Metallic Poisoning, Agents To Treat / Naprosyn / Silvadene / Adhesive / nickel metal  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Referred for repeat flutter/pulmonary vein isolation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary Vein Isolation   History of Present Illness: 67 yo F with hx of bacterial endocarditis s/p porcine MVR in [**2112**] and MP/MR, Afib/flutter s/p cardioversions, and pulmonary vein isolation in [**9-/2119**] who intially presented for repeat flutter/pulmonary vein isolation and subsequently became hypotensive requiring pressor support in the cath [**Year (4 digits) **] after sedation.
During her admission quinidine was d/c and metoprolol was initiated for rate control.
She was discharged on metoprolol 150 mg daily.
In the cath [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] anesthesia report the pt was intubated and given fentanyl, propofol and midazolam.
She was started on phenylephrine for pressure support.
She was given 3L of NS and then 20 mg IV lasix with 1L of UOP.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, DOE, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Atrial Fibrillation s/p 7 cardioversions -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -History of bacterial endocarditis [**2108**] -Porcine mitral valve replacement [**2112**] -Hypothyroidism -Rheumatoid arthritis -History of bleeding ulcer -Low back pain -Status post foot surgery with titanium implant -Laminectomy -Appendectomy -Endometriosis -Right oophorectomy  Social History: -Tobacco history: denies -ETOH: denies -Illicit drugs: denies   Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo F with atrial flutter s/p multiple cardioversions and pulmonary vein isolation in [**9-/2119**] who presented for repeat pulmonary vein isolation.
#Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive to the 90s systolic during pulmonary vein isolation procedure and initially required pressor support in the cath [**Year (4 digits) **].
This hypotension was most likely due to the fact that a) this patient's baseline SBP is in the low 100s and b) the anesthetics used during the procedure (she received fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam) contributed significantly to a drop in pressures.
In the cath [**Year (4 digits) **], she was started on phenylephrine for pressure support and she was given 3L of NS and then 20 mg IV lasix with 1L of urine output.
In the CCU, the pt was mentating well, her hematocrit was stable, she had no signs of infection, and she maintained good urine output so pressors were weaned the same evening.
She received a 500cc bolus of fluid and her calcium channel blocker was held.
#Atrial flutter/fibrillation - Pt is s/p multiple cardioversions and a previous pulmonary vein isolation and she presented for repeat pulmonary vein isolation.
She received 5mg IV Lopressor, 50mg PO Lopressor and 40mg PO verapamil with some improvement of her rate but no conversion of her rhythm.
Per electrophysiology, she was started on verapamil 40 mg po TID and quinidine 648 po q8.
Patient was discharged on quinidine; her beta-blocker and CCB were held in the setting of her low blood pressures (again though this is likely pt's baseline) and she was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was instructed to follow-up with EP.
#MR s/p porcine valve replacement - Stable.
Continued anticoagulation with coumadin.
Patient will follow-up with EP this week regarding her medication adjustments and her [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts event recorder results.
