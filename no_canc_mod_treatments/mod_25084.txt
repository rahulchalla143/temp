DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5785**] Approved: WED [**2102-5-10**] 4:48 PM    Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on [**2102-4-27**] and had a repair of bronchopleural fistula, closing of the [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window, a pedicled pectoralis muscle flap that was put into the second interspace and then a free anterolateral thigh flap with a free vastus lateralis flap for coverage and closure of the defect.
The patient underwent bronchoscopies with/without fibrin glue applications on [**2102-5-3**], [**2102-5-4**] and [**2102-5-5**].
The patient tolerated all of these procedures well.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid 0.2-0.6 mg IV Q4H:PRN PAIN with poor effect.
He was increased to Dilaudid 0.6-1.2 mg IV Q3H:PRN PAIN and Lorazepam 1 mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN was added for anxiety.
Unfortunately this was also not adequate pain control so in the morning of [**2102-4-28**] patient was placed on a dilaudid PCA--> Dilaudid 0.12 mg IVPCA Lockout Interval: 6 minutes Basal Rate: 0 mg(s)/hour 1-hr Max Limit: 1.2 mg.  Gabapentin 300 mg PO/NG TID was also added to his pain regimen.
During the evening of [**2102-4-28**], patient was transferred to the floor and was experiencing increased levels of pain so his PCA was increased to Dilaudid 0.25 mg IVPCA Lockout Interval: 6 minutes Basal Rate: 0 mg(s)/hour 1-hr Max Limit: 2.5 mg with good effect.
On [**2102-4-29**], the Dilaudid PCA was discontinued and patient had the following for pain control; Dilaudid 2-4 mg PO/NG Q4H:PRN pain with Dilaudid 0.25 mg IV Q4H:PRN for breakthrough pain.
On [**2102-5-2**], patient expressed that he was actually unhappy with his current regimen and requested that he be placed back on a pain regimen that had worked well for him the past.
The dilaudid was discontinued and the following pain regimen started; Oxycodone SR (OxyconTIN) 10 mg PO Q12H pain with OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5-10 mg PO/NG Q3H:PRN for breakthrough pain and Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg PO/NG TID:PRN for muscle spasms.
This regimen actually worked very well for the patient until [**2102-5-3**], s/p his bronchoscopy when he requested an increase in his Oxycontin dosing to accomodate an increase in his pain.
His oxycontin was changed to 20mg PO Q12H with good effect.
The left chest cavity drainage was maintained by two chest tube drains.
A leak was noted to both chest tube drains on [**2102-5-2**] and they were placed back to Pleurevac drainage system.
Patient then underwent several bronchoscopies and fibrin glue applications to try and locate/eliminate air leaks.
One chest tube drain continued leaking and was eventually placed to 'pneumostat' device prior to discharge.
Left chest flap: The flap viability was monitored via flap protocol with flap checks including visualization of flap coloring, tissue swelling, capillary refill along with doppler pulse checks and Vioptix monitoring.
Drainage of flap was maintained by three JP drains.
All flap drains were removed prior to patient's discharge.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake.
He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement.
On [**2102-5-6**], patient complained of constipation so his lactulose dosing was increased to 30 cc PO Q8h PRN.
Foley was removed on POD#2.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was maintained on Voriconazole 200 mg PO TID throughout his inpatient stay.
He was also given 10 days of IV Vancomycin per Infectious Disease recommendations.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
He was discharged to an extended care facility with 1 anterior chest drain to 'pneumostat' device.
His left sided chest/axillary flap had good color and warmth and was viable.
His left upper thigh split thickness skin graft (STSG) 'donor' site had primary dried xeroform dressings intact which will be left in place and not changed until seen for follow up visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23606**].
His left lateral thigh flap donor site/STSG recipient site appeared to have healthy muscle beneath the pink/warm skin graft site.
This site will be smeared with Bacitracin once a day to keep the site moist and then left open to air.
