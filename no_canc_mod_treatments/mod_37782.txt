Admission Date:  [**2102-7-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-11-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old female with multiple sclerosis and a history of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in [**2093**] who developed hematuria one day prior to admission.
She received one dose of Levaquin at home and had a slight fever.
The patient's tracheostomy was attached to the ventilation, and on ventilation the arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.36, CO2 of 50, and oxygen of 318; however, her blood pressure dropped to the 70s with no response to wide-open fluids.
Peripheral Neo-Synephrine was then started, and right subclavian catheter was placed.
Microbiology history:  In [**2101-10-11**], there was a urine cultures which grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin (which it was resistant to).
The patient was started on phenylephrine drip on the day of admission ([**7-29**]) which was discontinued later on during the day due to resolving hypotension.
UROSEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient was started on ceftazidime 2 g intravenously q.8h.
and metronidazole 500 mg intravenously q.8h.
The patient was originally started on vancomycin to treat enterococcus until these sensitivities came back from enterococcus being sensitive to ampicillin.
Thus, vancomycin was discontinued on [**8-2**] and ampicillin was started.
A new tracheostomy was put in place, and the old tracheostomy was removed.
Thus, ceftazidime was to be continued to complete a 14-day course.
The patient received a computed tomography of the trachea without contrast and with reconstruction prior to going to the operating room for tracheostomy removal and replacement with a new tracheostomy.
This was most likely due to hypovolemia as the patient's sodium level responded to intravenous infusion of normal saline.
The patient without to resume tube feeds with ProMod with fiber.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient received prophylactic care of H2 blockers, subcutaneous heparin, and pneumo boots.
ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient will also need intravenous access for continuation of antibiotics at home for the enterococcus in the urine and the Pseudomonas in the sputum (i.e.
The patient was to be evaluated today for a peripherally inserted central catheter placement to complete a 14-day course of ampicillin for enterococcus and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged after peripherally inserted central catheter line placement.
SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS:  Tracheostomy tube changed in the operating room on [**8-2**].
Ceftazidime 2 g intravenously q.8h.
Ampicillin 1 g intravenously q.6h.
The patient was to continue all her home medications; which I have verified with her home nurse that she has refills of these medications at home.
