Daughter and [**Name2 (NI) 802**] initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Emergency Medical Services were called.
She was given Atropine and a second shock and went into an atrial fibrillation rhythm with a rapid ventricular response.
The patient was started on Lidocaine drip and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room.
Total time pulseless was approximately 15 minutes.
The patient arrived to the Emergency Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure in the 80s and was started on intravenous fluids.
The patient was not taken to the Catheterization Laboratory but was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.

and intravenous replacement with a rapid rise in potassium to 3.5 on the first day of admission.
The patient was started on Thiamine and Folate.
She as switched to Captopril and her Lopressor increased and converted to a normal sinus rhythm by day #2 of her admission.
I received two additional loads of Phenobarbital with a goal level of greater than 40 which eventually started to break her status epilepticus.
She did continue to have episodes of epileptiform activity on her bedside electroencephalogram and so Valproate was added to her regimen at that point.
After extensive discussions with the family it was felt that the patient would want to be continued on longterm care as long as life was viable.
As a result the plan was made for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy which initially was held up due to elevated INRs which corrected slowly with the addition of Vitamin K.  The patient was started on tube feeds which she tolerated well.
On [**7-25**], showing no further epileptiform activity and with a corrected INR the patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy tube placed.
Her Lidocaine as previously mentioned was discontinued on day #2.
She has continued to perfuse will throughout her hospital stay here, occasionally requiring a small Lasix dose.
Lasix on [**7-24**].
Pulmonary status - The patient is currently on a ventilator at assist control with title volumes of 500 set at 10 times 10 breaths per minute with an FIO2 of 40%.
The patient has had no difficulty with her oxygenation, however, after trials of pressure support mode, the patient developed apnea and required to be placed back on assist control mode of ventilation.
At this point given her neurologic status we see little prospect of further improvement and was given a tracheostomy.
The patient is well controlled on small doses of Lasix p.o.
Gastrointestinal - The patient is getting feedings through her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, is tolerating it well with low residuals.
