A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and showed an EF of [**10-17**]% and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on a dobutamine drip for a heart transplant and evaluation for her cardiac transplant here.
She had a PA catheter placed and was found to have a CVP of 9, PA pressure of 42/22, cardiac output 4.5, and index of 2.5.
She was weaned from a dobutamine drip without any changes in her PA catheter numbers.
She was maintained on fluid restriction, started on digoxin and Coumadin for her low EF.
The previous admission culminated and the feeling that she did not need a cardiac transplant at that time.
It started spontaneously when she was at the outside hospital and was worse with inspiration and unrelieved by sublingual nitrogens.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 13.1 with normal differential and no bandemia, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.1, MCV 98, platelets 336,000.
Sodium 133, potassium 4.4, chloride 96, bicarbonate 24, BUN 12, creatinine 1.1, AST 13, ALT 6, LDH 198, alkaline phosphatase 112, amylase 70, total bilirubin 0.5, total protein 6.9, albumin 3.1, calcium 9.6, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 1.9.
Digoxin 1.6 and normal.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed while in the Cardiac Catheterization Holding Area which was found to show no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade with anterior portions of pericardial fluid loculated an echodense.
As she was stable at that point, the decision was made not to proceed with pericardiocentesis and monitor the patient with medical management.
The following day, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s and was started on dopamine on the floor.
She was weaned off dopamine in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit after a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.
NONISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY:  As described in the history of the present illness, the patient was diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy in [**2135-3-29**], approximately two months prior to current admission.
She was evaluated for a cardiac transplant at that point and was found not to need one at the current time.
She has been managed with diuresis at home and just prior to current admission had been doing excellent.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled during this hospitalization and were negative times three sets.
She had some chest discomfort during this hospitalization which was thought secondary to her large effusion rather than ischemia given her normal coronary arteries per cardiac catheterization two months prior.
Lasix with 10 mg IV Lasix p.r.n.
NSVT:  While on the Cardiac Floor, she was seen by Electrophysiology initially for evaluation for pacemaker placement who felt that it was not necessary at this time.
Her digoxin level, TSH and chemistry panel were checked following these episodes and were found to be within normal limits except for mildly elevated TSH given her hypothyroidism.
She was started on Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
for which she will complete three weeks of therapy and then switched to 400 mg p.o.
She is being sent out of the hospital on a Holter monitor given her initiation of Amiodarone.
A urine culture was performed when a Foley was placed in the Intensive Care Unit and was shown to be contaminated.
The Infectious Disease team was consulted while she was in the Intensive Care Unit given her Swan numbers of increased cardiac output to 7.3 and a decreased SVR to around 700 for evaluation of infectious etiology of her pericardial effusion and hemodynamic instability.
She did not have the procedure performed and it was felt that her effusions would regress with appropriate diuresis.
Her gout remained well controlled on Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.
RIGHT SHOULDER PAIN:  After pericardiocentesis, the patient complained of right shoulder pain which was evaluated by upper extremity ultrasound as this was the location of her central venous catheter while in the Intensive Care Unit.
She was not sent out on Coumadin as her only indication was for cardiomyopathy/decreased EF and CVA times two.
Instead, she was placed on Aggrenox for CVA prevention and Coumadin will not be continued.
