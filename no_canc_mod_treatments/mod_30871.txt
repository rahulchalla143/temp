She was treated with an ERCP and biliary stenting.
During that hospitalization, she was also found to have a severe COPD and required significant pulmonary toilet as well as steroids and inhalers.
The patient was actually discharged on home oxygen with 02 sat in the 80s.
Advair 1 puff b.i.d.
Levoxyl 50 micrograms p.o.
Percocet 1-2 tabs p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Albuterol nebulizers.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
She was significantly aggressively fluid resuscitated and managed with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Her pulmonary status continued to be poor and a central line as well as an arterial line was placed.
She was started on stress-dose steroids in order to control her COPD flare.
Her white count continued to come down and her steroids were slowly tapered.
Her oxygen saturation improved and she reached a sat of 98% on a face mask but continued to have poor oxygenation on blood gases.
She was continued on vanco, Meropenem, and fluconazole for prophylaxis with the necrosis of her pancreas.
We began gentle diuresis on [**2181-1-23**] in order to improve her pulmonary status.
She was also consented for a tracheostomy as well as a G/J tube.
Postoperatively, the patient tolerated the procedure well.
She continued to have severe pulmonary issues and required increasing ventilatory support.
Her NG tube was removed and she was fully advanced on her tube feeds.
She was kept on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control as she had elevated blood sugars from her diabetes postoperatively as well as from her extensive pancreatic necrosis.
Antibiotics were stopped on postoperative day #3 and her white count continued to come down.
Her TPN which was started preoperatively was weaned off on postoperative day #4 after her tube feeds reached goal.
Her JP drains which were placed in the pancreatic bed continued to put out a large amount of fluid and were working well.
Speech and swallow was consulted also for Passy-Muir valve as the patient was able to remain extubated for multiple days.
The patient began having high secretions from a pulmonary standpoint and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vanco and Zosyn.
Interventional radiology placed a pigtail drain of the fluid collection upon repeat imaging.
She was also started on fluconazole after her peritoneal fluid from her JP had mild fungus.
She was placed back on a ventilator as she began to slowly tire out.
Again, the patient had a brachial A line placed in order for blood gas evaluation and hemodynamic monitoring.
This showed that the patient continued to have very poor oxygenation and began having high PC02 levels even with complete aggressive pulmonary management.
She was restarted on her TPN and her antibiotics were changed to linezolid, meropenem, and caspofungin.
A Quinton catheter was placed and the patient was placed on CVVH.
A new A-line was placed on the 25th and the patient continued to have significantly poor oxygenation and 02 sats slowly began to drop.
She was completely paralyzed and sedated and was started on Levophed for blood pressure support.
She was given continuous bicarb drip through her CVVH to correct her acidosis.
The family decided to make this patient comfort measures only and her pressors were stopped as well as her ventilator.
The patient expired at 10:40 p.m. on [**2181-2-9**] after removal of her pressors.
