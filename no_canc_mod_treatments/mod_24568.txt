He was noted to have a NIHSS of 12 and given IV TPA prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Carotid Dopplars: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Right vertebral antegrade artery flow.

No evidence of atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale with saline contrast and maneuvers.
Symptoms have had a stuttering course and he was given IV TPA for NIHSS 12 prior to transfer.
#Neuro: He received IV tPA prior to transfer, so was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU.
Echocardiograms were notable for mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%) suggestive of prior hypertension.
Patient was started on Simvastatin.
Given his risk of stroke recurrence (3-5% per year) and age, he was started on coumadin daily (goal INR [**1-25**]) with ASA bridge until therapeutic.
#CV: The patient was hypertensive on admission, and reported that this was a problem his PCP had been following for several years, recommended dietary changes at this time.
Given his relatively young age, he underwent an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, including a renal ultrasound which showed no signs of renal artery stenosis, and plasma renin, aldosterone and metanephrines which are pending at time of discharge.
Given persistently elevated SBPs (150-170s) mmHg even 4 days after the CVA, he was started on Lisinopril 10mg daily.
No change in Cr was observed after tx initiation.
Due to LDL of 127 and CVA, he was started on Simvastatin to control the RFs.
The following studies will require follow up (pending at [**Hospital1 18**]):  -Anticardiolipin antibodies -Protein C/S -AT III -Factor V Leiden -Metanephrines, plasma -Prothrombin mutation -Renin level  Neurological exam notable for:  Alert, oriented to time, place person.
