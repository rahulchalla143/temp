She was started on lovenox in addition to coumadin.
This was felt possibly related to ventilator plugging, atelectasis, PE's or worsening MG. By report, she was due to have head CT, however, was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] before this could be performed.
At the time of transfer, she was on pressure support ventilation 15/5, Fio2 of 40%, saturating in high 90s.
She was also treated for a UTI with most recent negative urine culture.

# HYPERCARBIC RESP FAILURE: (requiring mechanical ventilation on admission) The patient was intubated at OSH prior to arrival to the MICU and was in stable condition.
She was weaned off the ventilator on HD2 without complications.
The details surrounding the acute decompensation event that lead to intubation are unclear.
Anticoagulation was started with lovenox and warfarin with plan for at least 6 months of anticoagulation.
We recommend that she have a screen for inheritable hypercoagulable mutations as an outpatient because there is a family history of DVT/PE.
She is discharged on weight based dosing of therapeutic lovenox to bridge her coumadin until it is >2.
- Continue warfarin with lovenox bridge until therapeutic .
Dose of cyclosporine was increased.
She should follow-up with her outpatient neurologist: in particular, whether there could be hypercoagulability related to cyclosporin and whether EMG is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of MG.
# Hypertension, benign: Patient remained well controlled on: (dose reduced given stable BPs) -  Lisinopril 10 mg PO/NG DAILY -  Atenolol 25 mg PO/NG DAILY .
# Latent TB: Patient has a history of +PPD and therefore was started on treatment in [**3-/2158**] prior to starting immunosuppressive meds for MG. - continued isoniazid 300 mg PO DAILY and pyridoxine 50 mg PO DAILY .
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine  #Hematuria: developedo n [**6-5**] PM, no gross clots being passed, painless.
