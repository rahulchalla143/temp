It was also felt that due to her recent antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, a likely etiology of her diarrhea could be Clostridium difficile.
She was started on empiric antibiotics with Flagyl.
She reported subjective improvement with intravenous hydration; however, she remained tachycardic.

The plan was to discharge the patient if her white blood cell count improved on Flagyl therapy and if the Clostridium difficile toxin assay was positive.
