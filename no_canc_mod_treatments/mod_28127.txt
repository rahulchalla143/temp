Low-density retroperitoneal lymph node as described above, which may be seen in the setting of tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infections,seminoma, metastatic squamous cell, Whipple's disease.
IMPRESSION: Possible mitral valve endocarditis.
He was initially started on Vanc/PCN but was switched to PCN/Clinda per ID recs.
He will complete a 6-week course of IV PCN, however, as his mitral valve was not completely normal and thus endocarditis could not totally be excluded.
- He was tachycardic and hypotensive on arrival so he was given > 6 L of IVF in boluses to maintain his pressure and was transiently on phenylephrine.
He received 2 platelet transfusions for plt count of 10 but his platlet count was normal on discharge.
Also, a RIJ was placed w/ Swan for venous access and hemodynamic monitoring.
- He was tachypneic on arrival but initially maintained his sats on a non-rebreather but was intubated on HOD2 for increased work of breathing.
He did have a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis of his R Lung at which time we took off 1.2 L.  The fluid was consistent with exudate but did not grow any bacteria.
- He was delirious after extubation, which was thought to be from overwhelming infection and sedating medications received during intubation.
He was evaluated by Vasc [**Doctor First Name **] who determined that there was no indication for surgical intervention.
ASA was started once plt count had resolved.
