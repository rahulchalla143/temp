Nasogastric tube is coiled in the oropharynx.
[**5-31**] Cerebral Angio-  [**6-1**] ECHO- Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
CXR [**2164-6-6**] ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube can be traced to the upper stomach but the tip is indistinct.
Status post coiling of large left PCOM aneurysm with expected  redistribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage and no evidence of new hemorrhage.
Right transfrontal external ventricular drain with blood products along the EVD track and decreased post-operative right frontal pneumocephalus from [**2164-6-10**].
Stable intraventricular hemorrhage with blood products in the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and layering posteriorly within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm.
A right PICC line catheter tip is in the upper SVC.
CT head [**2164-6-13**] Unchanged position of the right frontal approach internal ventricular drain catheter with slightly increased adjacent pneumocephalus.
subdural fluid collections as described above, better characterized on the prior CT head studies.
mastoid fluid and mucosal thickening.
[**6-14**] MRI C-spine: 1.
Right central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
ET tube and the NG tube are in appropriate location, unchanged since the prior study.
Right frontal approach shunt catheter has an extraventricular course, terminating at the septum pellucidum.
Status post ventriculostomy catheter placement from right frontal approach without a definitive intraventricular course as described on prior report.
Similar appearance of air and blood products around the course of the ventriculostomy catheter within the right frontal parenchyma.
She was started on Nimodipine 60mg Q 4 hours and Seizure Prophylaxis.
IVF were discontinued and Lasix ws given for diuresis with goal of 2L negative.
Ancef 2 gm TID was added for empiric EVD coverage as the EVD site was slightly edematous and warm on palpation.
On [**6-16**] in the early AM the EVD required TPA infusion again for non-drainage.
The family was in agreement with this plan and asked for EVD and ET tube to be removed as soon as possible.
He was started on a morphine gtt and these were both performed.
