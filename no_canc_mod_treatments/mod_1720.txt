He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-26**] for further management and here he was started on a ten day course of vancomycin/meropenem for a cavitary pneumonia although sputum cultures were largely negative.
His course was complicated by a COPD flare of which he was treated with a prednisone taper and a mild episode of CHF after fluid resuscitation and also C. diff.
colitis for which he was treated with Flagyl.
Per reports, he had been doing well at [**Hospital1 **] but had remained on 4 liters nasal cannula since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 **].
He was given vancomycin, gentamicin and Bactrim at [**Hospital1 **] and then transferred to the Emergency Department.
The blood pressure was 78/40 with an initial lactate of 4.8 and he was then treated per sepsis protocol.
He received an additional three liters of IV fluids, received Decadron and also added clindamycin.
An IJ was placed with CVP initially at 215 and a mixed venous O2 sat monitor was placed and were showing sats in the mid 70's.
He was placed on 100 percent nonrebreather with saturations at 91 percent on 6 liters and he was stable and transferred to the ICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post CABG three years ago, unclear of results of anatomy of CABG and also reports having a cath in [**2181**] with also unknown results.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Albuterol nebs qid, aspirin 81 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qhs, Advair 500/50 Diskus one puff q12h, folate qd, Humibid Long Acting 1200 mg po q12h, heparin 500 units subcu q12h, Atrovent nebs, iron sulfate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **], Bactrim tabs one q12h on the 18th, vancomycin 250 mg q6h, vancomycin 1 gm given on the 18th, Prevacid 30 mg qd, Synthroid 75 mcg qd, Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 40 mg qd, Vioxx 12.5 mg qd, Colace, multivitamins, Senokot.
Also of note, he received 300 mg of IV gentamicin and also insulin sliding scale.
His albumin was 2.7 and lactate was 4.8 subsequently improving to 1.6 after fluid resuscitation.
He had a chest x-ray on admission showing persistent right upper lobe opacity with question of a possible pneumonia when compared to prior chest films.
1, the patient's blood pressures were well over 100 and attempts were made to begin weaning off his Levophed.
He was refractory to both diltiazem and beta blockade, but later was started on amiodarone which resulted in conversion back to sinus rhythm with heart rates back into the 60's and 70's.
However, as the patient converted back to sinus rhythm, the patient was subsequently easily weaned off of his pressors.
He was later placed on a Lasix drip and diuresed nearly 4-6 liters over the span of the later course of his hospitalization with subsequently markedly improved blood pressures.
First, he is being started on an ACE inhibitor which is being aggressively titrated up.
As mentioned above, he had been loaded on amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Ultimately, it was decided that the patient, given his old age and likely risk of possible bleeding or falls, would not be an ideal candidate for anticoagulation but would optimize the goal for rate control.
He is being restarted on a beta blockade and will be placed on an outpatient dose of PO Lasix.
Meanwhile, he will be continued on his aspirin and statins for his coronary artery disease.
Nevertheless, he was somewhat tenuous on 6 liters of nasal cannula and then nonrebreather.
Since that time, the patient's oxygen requirements have now decreased to where he is back on 6 liters nasal cannula with sats into the mid 90's.
However, given his severe structural disease and his cavitary lesion, he would benefit from alternating prophylactic antibiotic regimens with Bactrim and amoxicillin to try and decrease his bacterial pathogen load.
He will need strict aspiration precautions.
He also has been on a slow steroid taper of prednisone for COPD which was started on his last hospitalization.
He will continue on his inhalers.
He should have strict aspiration precautions.
toxins were positive and the patient was empirically started on Flagyl.
Per discussion with Infectious Disease, the patient should continue on Flagyl 10 days following completion of his most recent course of antibiotics, this being the ceftazidime on [**6-25**].
Initially, given the patient's hypertension, the patient was felt to be mildly dehydrated and his creatinine did improve with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.
His creatinine should be monitored over the next couple of weeks especially with the addition of an ACE inhibitor.
He will need to be restarted on his iron therapy.
This was felt to be possibly secondary to malnutrition and the patient will receive Vitamin K for this.
He has been exposed to heparin and a heparin antibody will be sent which will need to be followed up by his primary care physician.
Endocrinology:  The patient was initially maintained on insulin drip while being treated for possible sepsis.
However, in the setting of atrial fibrillation, this was decided to be deferred until outpatient for titrating up his medications further.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on steroid taper.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol nebs q4h, aspirin 81 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qhs, Advair 500/50 Diskus one puff q12h, folate 1 mg qd, Humibid LA 1200 mg SR q12h, Atrovent nebs q4h, iron sulfate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **], Prevacid 30 mg qd, Synthroid 75 mcg qd, Colace, multivitamins, Senokot, Captopril 25 mg tid to be continued to be titrated as the patient tolerates, prednisone 30 mg qd and we will have an addendum for taper instructions, Toprol 25 mg qd, amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], sliding scale insulin.
The patient will go home on nasal cannula and Bactrim one tablet double strength [**Hospital1 **] starting on [**7-2**] to [**7-8**].
