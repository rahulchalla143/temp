She received stent to the LAD, left circumflex and had episodes of bradycardia to the 30s which required placement of a dual-chamber pacer, as well as rapid afib.
During the course of that hospital stay, the patient underwent hypoxic ventilatory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation x 3.
The patient eventually recovered and was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on [**8-22**].
On arrival in the ED, the patient had a pulse of 75, blood pressure 91/61, respiratory rate 25, satting at 100% on a nonrebreather face [**Month/Year (2) **].
The patient became acutely hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 70s and was placed on a dopamine drip.
The patient got 100 of IV lasix with 230 cc of urine output.
The patient was started on heparin due to concern of acute coronary syndrome.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for coronary artery disease, two-vessel disease, status post stents to the LAD and left circumflex in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, congestive heart failure with a known ejection fraction of less than 20%, moderate-severe mitral regurg, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 200 mg po qd, aspirin 325 mg po qd, lisinopril 5 mg po qd, metoprolol 12.5 mg po tid, Lipitor 5 mg po qd, lasix 60 mg po bid, Synthroid 100 mcg po qd, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Celexa 20 mg po qd, Ambien 5 mg po q hs prn and B12 SC q month.
The patient was breathing at 19, satting 98% on a nonrebreather face [**Month (only) **] and 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
IMPRESSION:  In short, this is an 89-year-old female with CAD, CHF, admitted with subacute shortness of breath, and presented with hypotension requiring a dopamine drip.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM - 1) CARDIOVASCULAR - CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient on admission was on aspirin, Lipitor, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor.
She was bolused with fluid and was able to be weaned from the dopamine drip overnight the first night.
The patient became acutely short of breath two nights after admission and hypoxic to 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
She was given lasix and diuresed with symptomatic relief.
Given the question of pacer migration and hypotension, perforation was ruled out with echo.
She was covered initially with vancomycin and Levofloxacin empirically and pancultured.
Vancomycin was discontinued.
Thus, the patient was continued on Levofloxacin.
4) RENAL:  The patient presented with a creatinine that was slightly elevated above her baseline of 0.9-1.2.
This was felt to be consistent with the patient being started on amiodarone a month prior to this admission for her afib.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Levofloxacin 500 mg po qd for 9 days, Plavix 75 mg po qd, aspirin 325 mg po qd, digoxin 0.125 mg po qd, captopril 6.25 mg po tid, lasix 60 mg po bid, ranitidine 150 mg po bid, Atorvastatin 5 mg po qd, Celexa 20 mg po qd, amiodarone 200 mg po qd and Ambien 5 mg po q hs prn, as well as Synthroid 100 mcg po qd.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], within the next week or so to consider restarting her beta blocker as an outpatient.
