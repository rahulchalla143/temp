Admission Date:  [**2141-8-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-9-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-3-31**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CAR [**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 73 year old with a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2120**] and also a history of severe mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation, severe cardiomyopathy with EF of approximately 10%.
Despite medical care, patient made very little progress and subsequently was evaluated by cardiac surgery and underwent high risk mitral valve replacement operation on [**2141-9-7**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**9-7**] patient underwent mitral valve repair with a porcine valve and tolerated the procedure well.
Postoperatively patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit and required epinephrine drip, Levophed drip, milrinone drip, propofol drip, insulin drip and intra-aortic balloon pump.
Given patient's low ejection fraction and poor risk for operation, patient's drips were turned down very slowly.
Intra-aortic balloon pump support was also turned down very slowly.
Nevertheless, on post-op day three patient's pressor drips, which included Levophed, epinephrine, milrinone and intra-aortic balloon pump were all able to be turned off and the balloon pump was discontinued.
On post-op day six the pulmonary artery catheter was discontinued as well as the Foley catheter.
On [**9-14**] patient was suddenly hypotensive and severely acidotic which required her to go back on pressors which included Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, propofol as well as dopamine.
Patient was also given multiple amps of bicarb to correct her acidosis.
Patient was quickly placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
General surgery was then consulted who agreed that patient was at high risk for mesenteric ischemia and given her clinical picture, this may, indeed, be the diagnosis.
At this point the nephrology service was also consulted and they placed patient on CVVHD to help control her acidosis as well as her renal decompensation.
Eventually these gram negative rods turned out to be Enterobacter which was sensitive to the antibiotics she was placed on.
She was placed on Zosyn, gentamicin and vancomycin.
Moreover her pressor drips were able to come down very slowly.
Patient underwent ultrasound which revealed thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid and sludge in the gallbladder, all of which could be explained from previous laparotomy as well as her septic physiology.
On [**9-18**] patient was taken back to the operating room of reexploration of her abdomen.
Intraoperatively once again there was no obvious pathology found, however, a cholecystostomy tube was placed given the fact that patient had the ultrasound which suggested that she may have cholecystitis and she does have evidence of stones.
Postoperatively, however, patient did not improve clinically and continued to require tremendous amounts of pressors which included dopamine at 10, Levophed at 0.5, milrinone at 0.5, Neo at 10, Pitressin at 0.1.
Her extremities became more and more mottled secondary to the tremendous amount of pressor agents that she was on.
Status post mitral valve replacement.
Status post exploratory laparotomy times two.
