He can participate in the physical therapy, but he is not able to walk with his walker as well as before.
While in house previous admission, Aspirin was stoppd and coumadin continued.
Patient was also complaining of new stool incontinence, was found to be c. diff positive per PCR and was started on 2 weeks of metronidazole to be completed on [**2182-8-2**].
Admission was c/b initially difficult to control Afib/RVR which was finally controled with diltiazem CD 120 mg po daily and metoprolol tartrate 75 mg po daily; also had fluid over load (known CHF with LVEF 45%) which was treated with IV diureis.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis cannot be adequately assessed.
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamnic compromise  RENAL ULTRASOUND [**2182-8-9**]: 1.
Persistent though improved high resistance waveforms throughout the arterial system including intrarenal and main renal arteries.
RIGHT AND LEFT CARDIAC CATH [**2182-8-12**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo M with a PMHx of moderate to severe AI with decreased EF s/p bioprosthetic AVR [**2182-6-27**], recently admitted [**Date range (1) 57819**] for BRBPR, now presenting with weakness and fluid overload, cardiac echo significant for worsening pericardial effusion, going for pericardiocentesis on the day of admission, with hospitalization complicated by renal failure requiring dialysis, klebsiella urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with RVR.
He was transferred to the CCU following pericardial drainage for aggressive diuresis.
He was started on a Lasix ggt with moderate UOP.
He was below goal of 2L daily and metolazone was added with minimal improvement.
Diuresis was eventually held in the setting of rising creatinine and poor UOP and ultimately dialysis was initiated for removal of fluid (see below).
Cath [**8-12**] showed elevated R and L-sided pressures but preserved CI and CO.  Due to progressive renal failure of his renal graft, he commenced HD via temporary catheter and had a tunnelled line placed for more durable access.
With volume removal during HD, his respiratory status and peripheral edeam improved.
Pt had bloody pericardial drainage with drain placement, felt to be [**1-17**] high INR (4).
Oxygen saturations improved following pericardial drainage and diuresis.
He continued to have SOB and and an O2 requirement and a right sided thoracentesis was performed which drained 2L of exudate with many RBCs.
With diuresis and later HD, his volume overload and oxygen requirement likewise improved.
He was febrile and hypotensive at time of diagnosis and treated broadly with vanc/cefepime prior to narrowing to ceftriaxone.
Pt's PICC line was removed as (+) BC was drawn from it.
He completed a total 2 week course of CTX ending [**2182-8-18**].
#Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: CHADS2 score of 3, on coumadin at home.
Coumadin was held intially as INR was supratherapeutic on admission, but resumed prior to d/c.
Prior to admission, pt was rate-controlled with metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] and 120mg daily of diltiazem.
On [**Hospital1 **], doses adjusted to toprol xl 100mg daily and diltiazem CR 180mg daily.
#Renal Failure: He is s/p renal transplant 25 years ago for PKD and has a baseline creatinine of 1.6.
He was initally kept on home cyclosporine and prednisone for immunosupression.
Pt's Cr continued to trend up with diuresis to 3.9.
Further diuresis was held at as pt was believed to be pre-renally intravascularly depleted despite being fluid overloaded.
he did not respond to albumin and ultimately became oliguric.
Given anasarca and lack of response to diuretics, HD was initiated.
He received a tunnelled HD line on [**8-20**] for durable access.
His CSA was discontinued initially but was restarted on [**Month/Day (4) **] to attempt a 2 week trial course to rescue his graft.
Will need HD MWF at LTAC, followup with renal and transplant surgery.
He recieved 1 unit pRBCs this admission for anemia felt to be [**1-17**] decreased epo in the setting of renal failure and phelbotomy.
He had marroon stools for about 5 days without signfiicant HCT drop in the setting of heparin gtt, likely diverticular.
He was not aggitated but rather endorsed delusions of grandeur and hypoactivity.
#Hyperlipidemia: Patient was maintained on home on atorvastatin 20mg daily.
He was maintained on home SSRI.
#Gout: Febuxostat was changed to renally-dosed allopurinol in the setting of renal failure  #depression: started citalopram 10mg daily, will need titratrion up if depressive symptoms continue over next several weeks.
PO diet: thin liquid and regular consistency solids.
Meds whole with thin liquid or applesauce.
Transitional Issues: - will need titration of warfarin for INR goal [**1-18**] - f/u with renal and transplant surgery - f/u with cardiology and CHF for volume management - HD MWF - Trial of cyclosporin 100mg daily for roughly 2 weeks.
