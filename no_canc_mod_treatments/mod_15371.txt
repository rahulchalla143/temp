The patient was therefore transferred to the ICU for intensive pulmonary support including chest physiotherapy, high flow oxygen, and empiric iv antibiotics.
At her worst she had an A-a gradient of >500 and required oxygen by non-rebreather mask to acheive a oxygen saturation in the low 90's.
Both were negative however, changes consistent with emphysema (previously undiagnosed), were found on the chest ct.  Over the following week, the patient had a slow recovery of her pulmonary function through judicious diuresis and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
By POD #9, she was back to nasal cannula at 2lpm without respiratory distress, saturating in the mid to upper 90's.
She was treated with appropriate antibiotics.
Her pain is well controlled, her wound is improving, and she is tolerating a regular diet supplemented by full strenght tube feeds through her jejunal tube.
She will be transferred to a rehab facility for an anticipated 1 week for additional help with pulmonary toilet, wound care, and physical therapy.
