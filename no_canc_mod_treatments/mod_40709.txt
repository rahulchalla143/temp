She started to speak again in the ED and reports that she just did not feel right after her HD session yesterday.
Attempts at a-line placement were unsuccessful.
Central line placed in groin after attempts at IJ and subclavian.
She was started on phenylephrine and self-converted to sinus in 90s, with improvement of hypotension.
EKG was notable for ST depressions, felt to be rate-related vs. demand ischemia per cards after a TTE negative for any new wall motion abnormalities; given ASA PR.
Due to persistent hypoglycemia, she was started on maintenance D5-1/2NS with KCl + D10.
Broad antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl due to concern for sepsis with a temp of 97.8, bair hugger placed.
She was also given hydrocortisone 100mg x1 due to concern for adrenal insufficiency with hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities.
Vitals on transfer: 97.4 (will transfer on Bair Hugger), 100s/80s, RR 18-20, O2 98-100% on 2L  On arrival to the MICU, patient on a Bair hugger and BPs have been consistent in left forearm, quickly weaned off phenylephrine.
Past Medical History: Bipolar disorder Hypertension HLD ?Atrial fibrillation Gastritis GERD GI bleed [**5-/2145**], EGD showed erosive esophagitis & duodenal ulcers ESRD [**1-20**] lithium, on HD AV graft thrombosis on left "cardiac arrhythmia with bradycardia" in [**State 108**] CAD, LAD stent [**1-/2143**] Ascending aortic aneurysm s/p repair [**1-/2143**], + ectasia of descending thoracic aorta (largest diameter 4.8cm) L3/L4 discitis s/p 8 weeks of IV antibiotics Goiter, s/p thyroidectomy [**2128**] Osteoarthritis, s/p L total knee replacement Restless legs syndrome   Social History: Currently resides at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1820**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Married, retired professor at [**Hospital1 3278**] (retired in [**2145-3-19**]).
Patient ambulates with a walker and needs help getting out of bed.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T: 34.5C BP: 130/57 P:70 R: 18 O2: 100% on 2L ; FSBG 187 General: Alert, oriented, obese female in mild respiratory distress on Bair hugger HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL (3->2mm) Neck: supple, JVP not elevated but difficult to assess given obesity, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, ?soft RUSB systolic murmur, no rubs or gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation on inspiration, some rhonchi on expiration likely upper airway, no wheezes or rales.
EEG [**11-22**] IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence at the beginning for what would be considered electrographic status epilepticus that seemed to respond positively to the infusion of Ativan and then later to the infusion of phosphenytoin.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old female with history of ESRD [**1-20**] lithium toxicity on HD with recent AV fistula thromboses and failed placement of right AV fistula, bipolar disorder, likely AF, HTN/HL, CAD s/p LAD stent in [**2142**], L3/L4 discitis on 8-week IV abx therapy, and hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy, initially presenting with hypothermia, hypogylcemia, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation with hypotension, consistent with septic shock along with numerous electrolyte abnormalities.
After numerous failed attempts at IJ and subclavian central access, a right femoral line was placed.
Upon admission to the ICU, she was continued on phenylephrine.
Her dialysis line did not look erythematous.
She was monitored on a Bair hugger for 1 day until her temperatures returned to [**Location 213**].
Antibiotic coverage was initially CNS coverage with Vanc/CTX/Acyclovir, then switched to Vancomycin and Cefepime with her chronic doxycycline.
Her pressor was weaned and she seemed to improve on broad antibiotic coverage despite not uncovering a source.
She was then transferred to the floor and continued on vancomycin dosed renally for dialysis, and cefepime.
However, despite these findings, the patient was kept on antibiotics since her clinical picture did not improve and an infectious etiology remained on the differential.
# ESRD on HD per temporary line: Patient was a chronic dialysis patient who received dialysis throughout the majority of her stay.
The patient would complain of odd feelings all over her body, but was unable to verbalize what it felt like and would seem strange or inappropriate.
Unfortunately, her mental status improved at best to wakefullness and partial orientation but she remained without insight into the cause of her hospitalization.
It appears that she had been taken off amiodarone prior to admission.
Anticoagulation was not started given her history of bleeding.
While on the floor, the patient was initially given oral metoprolol up to 50 TID for control of her A fib.
However, this control was poor so the patient was switched to IV lopressor.
On transfer back to the ICU, the patient was on IV lopressor 5 mg Q4H:PRN and was using all the PRN doses.
Once the decision was made to make the patient CMO, we stopped monitoring her Afib and she did not receive treatment for it.
Upon conferring with her husband, her psych meds were held.
Once the patient was made CMO, the decision was made to continue olanzapine, but none of her other psych meds were re-started.
She became progressively more encephalopathic after discontinuation of HD and passed away on [**2145-12-9**] with her sister at her side.
