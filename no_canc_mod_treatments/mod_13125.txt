The patient was treated with IV steroids, pancrease and cholestyramine for pancreatic insufficiency and bile stone malabsorption.
On [**8-16**], she underwent colonoscopy to the neoterminal ileum notable for anastomotic opening slightly tight and friable lesions which were biopsied.
At the outside hospital en route to [**Hospital1 **], the patient received a total of 2 liters of normal saline, 6 units of FFP, and 6 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient experienced respiratory distress while in the ambulance and was intubated and given 80 mg lasix.
Her last admission to the hospital for Crohn's was in [**2185-4-26**] for a Crohn's flare for which she was treated with steroids;  2) Status post right hemicolectomy;  3) Status post anteriorly.
4) Status post small bowel resection.
MEDICATIONS:  1) Creon 10 mg 3 tablets tid, 2) gemfibrozil 600 mg [**Hospital1 **], 3) atenolol 25 mg qd, 4) Aciphex 20 mg qd, 5) Effexor 35 mg qd for 7 days, then increase to 75 mg qd, 6) cholestyramine 1 package tid.
In summary, this is a 77-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, status post right hemicolectomy, status post coil embolization for massive lower GI bleed, who is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management of lower GI bleed.
The patient was admitted to the MICU following the embolization procedure on [**2185-8-17**].
In the Medical ICU, she was volume resuscitated with several units of packed red blood cells and IV fluids.
2) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  During the course of her stay in the Medical ICU, she was vigorously resuscitated with fluids and blood, and subsequently was found to be in florid CHF.
After arriving to the floor, we continued to treat her with carvedilol and captopril which was later changed to lisinopril.
For the duration of her stay in the hospital, she did not require any pharmacologic agents for diuresis.
She was started on Levofloxacin and Zosyn initially until culture results revealed pansensitive Klebsiella in the sputum, at which point Zosyn was discontinued.
Levofloxacin was continued.
A bedside swallowing study revealed aspiration of thin and nectar-like liquids.
In the meantime, an NG tube was left in place.
Aspiration precautions were taken, and she was continued on her Protonix prophylaxis 40 mg po bid.
A few days after her transfer to the floor from the ICU, the patient underwent a video swallowing study which revealed, again, aspiration of thin liquids and nectar-like fluids.
The decision was then made to establish a semipermanent feeding tube placement to obviate the need for an NG tube.
The patient was taken to Interventional Radiology where she underwent placement of a gastrojejunostomy tube.
Following the procedure, there was a small amount of bright blood refluxing from the nasogastric tube which cleared several hours later.
The GJ tube was found to be in good working order, and she was restarted on her tube feeds via her new GJ tube.
The NG tube was then discontinued.
5) CROHN'S DISEASE:  The patient has a longstanding history of Crohn's disease and is status post right hemicolectomy and small bowel resection.
She currently has stable disease now on a regimen of prednisone.
7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  During her stay in the Medical ICU, her creatinine was found to be elevated over the first two days in the ICU with a peak at 1.4.
8) MCA ANEURYSM:  When the patient had undergone a head CT for evaluation of her vocal cord paresis, an MCA aneurysm was incidentally found.
While in the Medical ICU, laboratory tests revealed an elevation of her troponin levels to a maximum of 0.44, evidenced when she arrived to the floor she was given a Persantine MIBI test to evaluate for any ischemic myocardium.
10) VACCINATIONS:  The patient received pneumovax x 1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1) prednisone 35 mg po qd 2) Levofloxacin 500 mg po q 24 h until [**2185-8-31**] 3) lisinopril 5 mg po qd--hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 95 4) carvedilol 6.25 mg po twice a day 5) Creon 10, 2 capsules po four times a day 6) pantoprazole 40 mg po q 12 h 7) cholestyramine 4 gm po twice a day 8) venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg po qd 9) Insulin sliding scale 10) acetaminophen 325-650 mg po q 4-6 h prn fever 11) heparin 5,000 U subcutaneously q 12 h 12) Vitamin D 400 U NG qd 13) multivitamin qd, 1,000.
