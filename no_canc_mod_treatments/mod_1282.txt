Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-12-20**], posterior and lateral hypokinesis now present.
Imaging: CT CHEST, W&W/O CONTRAST ([**2136-12-15**]): There is a 4.8 x 2.8 cm consolidative opacity within the left upper lobe with surrounding nodularity and ground-glass opacity, as described above.
Neoplasm is also on the differential, and followup evaluation should be obtained after treatment to evaluate for resolution.
The nodules lack multinucleated cells that would be diagnostic for HIV encephalitis.
The distal CX thrombotic lesion was angioplastied using a Maverick and a Voyager balloon with lesion reduction from 95% to 10%.
No stents placed given brain lesion and risk of bleeding with Plavix and Integrilin.
The chest pain resolved with 1mg IV morphine sulfate.
The pt's pain was relieved with 1 SL Nitro and 1mg IV morphine.
The pt was maintained on a beta-blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor and Statin (low dose, on HAART).
His dose of beta-blocker was decreased prior to discharge in light of low [**Doctor Last Name **] pressure.
The cardiac cath was also significant for an elevated wedge pressure in 20's, severe hypokinesis of posterior and lateral walls, trivial mitral regurgitation and no effusion.
HIV: The pt was on anti-retroviral medications on admission.
On admission he was on a regimen of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fum and Primaquine.
He was maintained on his regimen while admitted in the hospital.
The was placed on TB precautions until TB was ruled out with acid fast smears from induced sputum and a bronchoalveolar lavage which revealed Pneumocystis Carinii on immunofluorescence testing.
The pt was subsequently taken off precautions and was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7991**] for the final report.
He was started on Keppra and was noted to have a non-specific hypodensity in the right temporal lobe on CT. During that admission the pt had an EEG that showed the unknown hypodensity to be a likely source of his seizure activity.
The pt underwent a planned brain biopsy which showed no diagnostic Toxoplasma gondii or multinucleated cells, scattered gram-positive cocci isolated and in pairs, not directly associated with microglial nodules (the nodules lacked multinucleated cells that would be diagnostic for HIV encephalitis), the acid fast stain was negative for bacilli and the GMS silver stain lacked fungi or yeast forms, tissue gram stain showed infrequent gram-positive cocci scattered over the tissue, sometimes near sites of pathology and sometimes in otherwise normal brain.
A decision was made to discharge the patient on his HAART regimen, cardiac medications and PCP pneumonia treatment.
No treatment was indicated based on clinical correlation (no mental status changes, no signs of meningitis or clinical signs of infection).The pt was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7991**] who will discuss the final results of the biopsy (brain) and pending microbiology studies.
FEN: The pt was maintained on a cardiac and heart healthy diet.
