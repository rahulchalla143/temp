He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with bilateral claudication and underwent a right SFA angioplasty and a left femoral popliteal.
He returned to the hospital on [**5-19**] with a left groin wound dehiscence and bleed after days of an unsteady gait.
The wound was explored at [**Hospital1 1474**] and a Prolene stitch was placed and the wound was closed over the graft.
Vancomycin 2.
Tequin 3.
Lopressor 4.
Aspirin 5.
Thiamine 6.
Right SFA angioplasty [**1-/2170**] 2.
EXTREMITIES:  Left groin - there was a 4 inch x 1.5 inch open wound with serous drainage without the graft obviously exposed.
Dry dressings tid or qid were advised, as the wound was still wet.
Myocardial infarction management per cardiology and antibiotics to continue from the outside hospital which included Tequin and vancomycin given his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient did relatively well overnight and was given diuresis by the cardiology service as well as afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor.
The graft was noted to be grossly infected and required arterial debridement.
At this time, in the Operating Room, the patient underwent a removal of the femoral portion of the femoral popliteal graft, debridement of the femoral artery and vein patch angioplasty, rotational sartorius myoplasty and retroperitoneal exposure of the iliac artery for proximal control.
At this time, he underwent a left profunda femoris artery to anterior tibial artery bypass using non reverse right saphenous vein as well as the profunda femoris endarterectomy and profundoplasty, a left lower leg fasciotomy, ligation of the popliteal artery, intraoperative angiogram performance, [**Doctor Last Name **] catheter, thromboembolectomy and vein patch angioplasty repair of the proximal graft.
He received 4 units of blood during the operation, 5 liters of intravenous fluids with an estimated blood loss of 1500.
On postoperative day 1, he was continued on vancomycin and propofol for sedation.
He continued to rule out for myocardial infarction and was started on intravenous beta blockade, as well as aspirin.
On postoperative day 2, he was started on some dopamine for low blood pressures.
He was continued on vancomycin for this and his pressors were weaned.
Postoperative day 4, he was only on a small amount of pressor support, received 1 unit of blood as well as some diuresis, but remained intermittently agitated.
The patient continued to wean off pressors and continued to slowly improve.
By postoperative day 5, he was continued on vancomycin, Ativan and Dilaudid for sedation and a small amount of dopamine.
He had received 2 units of blood and his hemodynamics were stable.
He was totally weaned off of any pressors and his Swan was changed over to a triple lumen due to his improving hemodynamics.
At this time, sputum and wound grew out yeast and he was started on fluconazole in addition to his vancomycin.
Additionally, the vent was weaned as tolerated.
His leg continued to deteriorate slightly, so at this time, on [**5-6**] he was taken to the Operating Room for a wound debridement of his groin and mid wound and partial closure and packing, as well as a left guillotine amputation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications and returned to the Intensive Care Unit.
He was continued on vancomycin and fluconazole.
His guillotine amputation site looked really well.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone for further coverage.
He was started on Zosyn for coverage of his abdomen and was continued on total parenteral nutrition.
At this point, his antibiotic regimen was vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl and fluconazole.
He was continued on his antibiotics.
He started on tube feeds which he began to tolerate and again his line was changed for fevers.
On the [**5-14**], the patient went to the Operating Room for a completion amputation.
He underwent a left below knee amputation and incision and drainage of his open thigh wound by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
At this time, he spiked a fever postoperatively which was felt to be due to atelectasis and removal of necrotic tissue during the operation.
He was on 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support on CPAP.
He required 40% FIO2 and 10 of PEEP at this time.
His tube feeds were restarted and the patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy on postoperative day 22, 14 and 6, uneventfully at the bedside under bronchoscopy guidance.
He tolerated this procedure well and was quickly weaned back to CPAP with minimal pressure support which he tolerated well.
His antibiotics were slowly decreased.
The fluconazole was discontinued after one week.
He underwent, on postoperative ay 23, 16 and, a PICC line placement for a long six week course of vancomycin for his infected graft, as well as a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube placed in Interventional Radiology for tube feeds.
He is on trach mask 40% with oxygenation and PO2 in the range of 190, getting gentle diuresis each day, tolerating 70 of Impact with fiber tube feeds through his PEG.
