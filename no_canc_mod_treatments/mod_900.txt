MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Signal abnormalities at both posterior frontal and parietal convexity region on FLAIR and T2-weighted images without corresponding enhancement or diffusion abnormalities.
If the patient has prior MRI examinations, comparison would be helpful.
C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2136-3-1**]: Successful placement of a 14-French 20-cm double-lumen hemodialysis catheter by way of the left internal jugular vein with tip in the superior vena cava.
[**Numeric Identifier 7670**] FLUORO 1 HR W/RADIOLOGIST  [**2136-3-8**]: Successful conversion from a temporary left internal jugular to a tunneled hemodialysis catheter (27 cm from cuff to tip).
On admission to the emergency department, patient was only briefly hypotensive with systolic in 70's which responded to IV fluid resuscitation and required transient peripheral levophed.
Patient was also empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics and given PO charcoal.
Patient remained intubated for airway protection.
Patient sating 94% on 5L nasal cannula after extubation.
Also, metabolic derangement including hypokalemia (2.8 on admission) and hypocalcemia (5.9) may have contributed or caused the rhabdo but unclear etiology of electrolyte abnormalities ?opioid overdose.
Patient was intially aggressively hydrated and his urine was alkalinized with HCO3 to avoid further renal damage from myoglobin.
He was also given mannitol to osmotically diurese which was eventually held on [**2-26**].
There was an unsuccessful RIJ line placement on [**2-29**], no hematoma was seen on neck US.
IR placed temporary dialysis catheter in LIJ on [**3-1**] and then switched over a tunnelled cath into LIJ on [**3-8**].
Patient initally required daily dialysis and then three times a week.
Electrolytes were followed carefully and phosphate binders were used as needed.
He will need to have his electrolytes (Chem 7, calcium, magnesium, phosphate) checked in 48 hours, 1 week, and two weeks to ensure recovery of kidney function.
He will need removal of his tunneled hemodialysis catheter in two days, on [**2136-3-14**], to be done by interventional radiology.
The renal consult service will decide when patient will be able to have his tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology.
Chronic pain/R LE pain: Patient with history of right ankle injury requiring multiple surgeries between [**2126**]-[**2130**].
Had been on methadone and dilaudid PO as an outpatient.
Pain medications were held until patient's mental status was at baseline and then he was started and gradually titrated up on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough.
IV diladudid was used as breakthrough which was subsequently switched to PO dilaudid and then discontinued due to adequate pain control.
Please obtain pain management consult for pain control if pain is unable to be controlled with fentanyl patch with oxycodone.
Psychiatry was consulted regarding the opiate overdose and felt that patient required inpatient admission for suicide attempt.
Paitnet received 2 units in hemodialysis on [**3-5**].
R UE brachial DVT: Patient received anti-coagulation for 1 week with IV heparin and then for a short period of time on coumadin.
Review of US with radiology showed distal location of possible clot and low risk for embolization and so no further anti-coagulation was planned.
Patient will not need to have heparin SC injections for DVT prophylaxis if he continues to ambulate.
Patient initially empirically covered with vanco, levo and flagyl.
On [**2-26**], antibiotics were discontinued given low suspicion for infection.

If pain is not well controlled on the fentanyl patch with oxycodone, obtain pain management consult.
Patient does not need heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis if he is able to ambulate.
