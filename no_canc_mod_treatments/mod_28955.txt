The patient presented with an oblique left femur fracture which required surgical correction by orthopedic surgery.
However, given elevated troponins, echocardiogram with multiple wall motion abnormalities in the setting of low EF (35%), and patient's complaints of chest pain on admission, the patient's surgery was postponed until cardiac risk assessment was completed.
The patient was initially maintained with ASA, Nitro patch, metoprolol, SL NTG, and morphine PCA pump with resolution of chest pain.
The patient's warfarin was initially held given the amount of blood loss and need for surgery.
On [**2189-4-1**], the patient had a pin placed with 15 pounds of traction by orthopedic surgery at the bedside.
He was maintained on phenylephrine gtt for his hypotension.
Once in the CCU, his phenylephrine was discontinued and he was started on peripheral dopamine for blood pressure support.
The source of his shock was initially unclear (sepsis vs cardiogenic shock vs secondary to pulmonary embolus), and a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed under fluoroscopic guidance.
He was started on a heparin gtt, electively intubated, and underwent a CT angiography which showed no evidence of PE as above.
The etiology of hypotension was not entirely clear but PA catheter numbers were not consistent with cardiogenic shock; the shock was presumed secondary to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia and postoperative hypovolemia.
Further CCU course significant for supportive care initially including pressors and IVF.
After fluid resuscitation, pressors were weaned several days later.
The patient completed a 7-day course of Zosyn and a 14-day course of vancomycin started [**2189-4-4**] for MRSA in the sputum and [**2-12**] blood cultures with S. faecium.
The patient's pacemaker rate was increased to 90 to decrease the QT interval.
The patient should not receive any QT prolonging agents in the future.
The patient was intubated for airway protection during the arrest but extubated easily the day after.
The patient does not require ICD placement for this reversible etiology of VT arrest.
The patient was evaluated for ICD placement because of his depressed EF, but this was not further pursued because of the patient's decreased mental status.
The patient was started on metoprolol for rate control.
The day of transfer to the floor, the patient received diagnostic/therapeutic cardiac catheterization to evaluate for ischemia given the history of NSTEMI early in his hospital course.
The patient is discharged to rehab for further physical therapy post ORIF.
The patient is discharged with a cardiac regimen consisting of ASA, plavix, BB, ACEI, and statin.
The patient was restarted on coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and should receive INR checks regularly at least twice weekly until stable to ensure that INR is at goal [**3-14**].
The patient is taking tylenol and tramadol as needed for left hip pain.
The patient should follow-up decreasing the pacemaker rate in the future if the QTc is back to normal range and should have pacemaker interrogation per his primary cardiologist.
The patient should have further management of COPD diagnosed on chest X-ray as needed.
