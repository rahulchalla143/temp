Brief Hospital Course: RV Perforation: The patient underwent pacemaker placement on [**7-25**].
The EP procedure was complicated by RV perforation, and subsequent tamponade.
She had a brief loss of pulses (~20s) that returned upon drainage of her pericardial effusion and placement of catheter (600cc in the OR and then an additional 450cc in the ICU).
The patient was also emergently intubated and an arterial line was placed in the right femoral artery.
The patient underwent serial TTE that did not show tamponade and her drainage of her catheter stopped within 24hrs.
Her drain was removed on [**7-26**] and repeat TTE did not show further accumulation.
R LEG ISCHEMIA: During the patient's EP procedure on [**7-25**] a femoral a-line was placed.
After placement of the line pulses were lost in her right leg.
Wound care was consulted for the right groin site, the site was kept dry with desitin.
Per Vascular Surgery, staples in the Rt LE are to stay in until 4 weeks from [**7-24**] ([**8-23**]-15).
She was empirically started on vancomycin/aztreonam/cipro given her PCN allergy and for double coverage of pseudomonas.
Her sputum culture subsequently grew pseudomonas and was changed to meropenem for a planned 14 day course.
However, daily CXR began to show increased RUL consolidation and treatment with Levofloxacin was started [**8-3**] for a full 10 day course.
CORONARIES: Patient presented to OSH on [**7-20**] with chest pain and found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned to PO dilt and digoxin.
The patient was started on a Heparin gtt, Aspirin, and the patient received a plavix load of 600mg for her NSTEMI.
Percutaneous intervention attempted but unsuccessful and given patient's other comorbitidities, patient was not a surgical candidate.
She was medically optimized and continued on ASA 325mg, plavix 75mg, atorvastatin 80mg.
She was restarted on metoprolol and lisinopril after her blood pressures had stablized.
She was transfused 5U pRBC and given ~3L IVF after her RV perforation and right leg ischemia.
Her CXR [**7-27**] showed volume overload and she was given 40mg IV lasix x2.
She continued to have worsening edema and started on a lasix gtt for diuresis.
She was net negative 2.5L the first day and then 1-2L negative the following days, her gtt was stopped on [**7-30**].
The patient was transiently hypotensive after aggressive diuresis and required neo intermittently.
She then received Lasix PRN to maintain euvolemic status and then started on a standing dose.
The patient was in a-fib w/ RVR at the OSH and required IV diltiazem and digoxin at OSH for rate control.
She underwent EPS and pacemaker placement that was complicated by RV perforation and right leg ischemia on [**7-25**].
She was treated with IV/po metoprolol then IV amio on [**7-29**] followed by PO loading.
She again had a-fib with rates in the 100-120's, so that her amiodarone was increased to 400mg [**Hospital1 **].
She will continue amiodarone 200 mg PO daily and metoprolol 25 mg PO TID as an outpatient.
Anti-coagulation was not started given her RV perforation as well as her fall risk.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated after RV perforation during her EP procedure.
She was aggressively diuresed with lasix gtt and volume overload improved.
She was initially maintained on TF for adequate nutrition to prevent aspiration/desat's, but was cleared by S/S on [**8-4**].
She was started on IV solumedrol 80mg q8 for COPD flare.
She was transitioned to po prednisone on [**7-22**].
However, after her intubation she started back on IV solumedrol 40mg q24.
After extubation, she was started on 60mg PO prednisone daily, to be tapered extremely slowly.
