Admission Date:  [**2139-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-9-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Ceclor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**] Chief Complaint: s/p Motor vehicle crash - multi-trauma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-2-16**] ORIF posterior pelvic ring bilaterally, ORIF anterior pelvic ring on right side, I&D elbow open fracture, ulnar nerve expliration and placment of external fixation [**Doctor Last Name 1005**] [**2139-2-18**] 1.
Cardiac arrest on scene, received CPR in ambulance.
Large volume rescucitation, and bilateral chest tube placement in ED during code, no blood or air return.
A tiny focus of hemorrhage may not be visualized in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle suggestive of redistribution.
He was actively coded while bilateral chest tubes were placed, a Cordis was placed in his right groin and a central line was placed in his left subclavian.
He regained pulses before losing them approximately 10 minutes later, and was coded for an additional amount of time prior to regaining his pulses and remaining stable thereafter with several units of blood and crystalloid being infused.
There was concern for urethral injury and a catheter was not placed at this time.
They also performed a retrograde urethrogram at this time which demonstrated an intact urethra and placed a Foley catheter at this time.
He returned to the Trauma ICU stable not on pressors, but intubated and sedated.
Stable, he was taken to radiology for further radiologic workup revealing the following injuries:  Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage basal ganglia Posterior scalp laceration Right parietal subgaleal hematoma Right distal humerus and olecranon fractures Right renal lacerations with subcapsular hematoma Right posterior 11th rib fracture L2-4 transverse process fracture Right iliac crest fracture Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures Left SI joint diastasis  He was taken to the or on [**2139-2-16**] by the orthopedic team for ORIF right hip/acetabular fracture as well as I&D and ex-fix of his right elbow.
His hospital course by systems as follows:  Neuro: Neurosurgery was consulted early on due to his brain injuries - seizure prophylaxis was started, serial exams and head CT scans were followed as well.
He was kept intubated and sedated through his initial days in the TSICU.
His sedation was weaned for extubation on [**2-19**] and he was treated with IV Dilaudid for pain control.
He was started on Trazodone at HS to help regulate his sleep/wake cycle given his brain injury and this has seemed to help.
He was initially tachycardic after extubation and intermittently after transfer out of the ICU remained tachycardiac.
He was stated on beta blockers which has brought his heart into the 80's-90's range.
Resp: Initially placed chest tubes were removed on [**2-17**] (right side) and [**2-18**] (left) without complication.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis did not reveal an obvious source of fever but he was placed in the ICU, antibiotics were broadened and he recovered well.
This was followed with a CTA on [**2-23**] which confirmed this finding in the left lower lobe basilar segments and he was started on a heparin drip.
GI: Initially started on tube feeds via OGT then advanced to a regular for which he is tolerating much better now with improved mental status.
GU: His Foley catheter was found to be placed in the urethra with balloon expansion in the urethra on MRI after Foley placement in IR.
Urology was following for both of these issues and recommended conservative management wit keeping Foley in place for 3-4 weeks and repeating urethrogram at the end of that time.
ID: He maintained on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Ancef/Levo/Flagyl) for his open fractures and after placement of orthopedic hardware given high risk of infection.
The antibiotics were eventually stopped.
Heme:  An IVC filter was placed given his multiple fractures.
Afterwards was deemed okay for heparin (per neurosurgery) and was started on heparin SQ as prophylaxis which was maintained throughout the hospitalization.
He was started on a heparin drip on [**2-23**] to treat a pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe basal segments.
And now on Coumadin as mentioned previously.
He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
