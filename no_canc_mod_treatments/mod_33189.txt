Reports he has been giving himself 1/2 dose glargine over this course, and that his blood sugar was 138 yesterday afternoon.
Patient was given 10 units insulin SQ, then 10 units IV and 5units/hr gtt, which he is currently on.
Got no potassium in the ED.
He was admitted to the MICU and started on an insulin drip and IVF.
Once the serum glucose<200, he was changed to D51/2NS at 150-250cc/hr and reduced to regular insulin infusion to 0.02-0.05U/Kg/Hr IV to keep serum glucose between 150-200.
Once the pt was able to eat, he was started on SC multidose insulin regimen.
He was discharged on home Insulin regimen.
However, given gastroparesis was precipitating factor and continues to be an issue, he was scheduled for follow-up with his endocrinologist who he had not seen in a while for better insulin regimen and management of gastroparesis.
The patient was treated with compazine and zofran PRN in the MICU and transitioned to home reglan and erythromycin when he started taking POs.
Medications were initially renally dosed and nephrotoxic meds were held (ACEi).
When the patient presented to the ED he had very elevated pressures but did not receive medications there.
He is on clonidine and lisinopril at home, but stated he had been unable to take his doses PM and AM prior to admission.
Given lisinopril was held during admission his BPs continued to trend up.
When he tolerated POs he was restarted on home meds but still did not experience good control, with DBPs notable for being in the 90s-110s.
He received a few doses of IV hydralazine for pressure control in the setting of headaches.
He was started on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to supplement home meds and will continue further management as an outpt with PCP.
Was somewhat decreased with IVF and starting metoprolol.
