Admission Date:  [**2183-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-1-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-8-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old with known cardiomyopathy and dilated ascending aorta, found to have a question of aortic dissection on catheter on [**1-3**].
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2183-1-18**] for a repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, aortic valve replacement with 25 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], 28 mm dacron aortic and 8 mm dacron innominate resection of right non-coronary leaflets and vein plaque, right coronary.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 266 minutes, cross-clamp time was 218 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was subsequently taken to the Intensive Care Unit, where an attempt for extubation failed secondary to increased agitation, at which time he had to be sedated and switched to SIMV with pressure support.
On postoperative day two, the patient converted to atrial fibrillation with first degree AV block, and was placed on amiodarone drip as will as a nitrite drip.
On postoperative day one, the patient received Ativan around the clock for delirium tremens prophylaxis, and the patient was weaned for attempted extubation.
On postoperative day three, the patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm, at which time the amiodarone drip was stopped.
The team suggested that the patient was in delirium and the patient should be maintained on Haldol at least three times a day to decrease the agitation.
The Psychiatry team also agreed with administration of Haldol and doses of benzodiazepine to decrease any possibility of alcohol withdrawal which, at that point, was unlikely.
The patient's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status was noted by the nursing staff as well as Physical Therapy, who tried to walk the patient, with occasional success.
