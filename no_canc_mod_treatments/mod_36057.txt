He received an integrilin and heparin boluses, clopidogrel load, and a nitro GTT.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for emergent CABG, but deferred due to anticoagulation load.
He denied dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CT surgery consult for non-emergent coronary artery bypass grafting.
Cardiac surgery was immediately consulted for a CABG and felt that the risks of bleeding, as the patient had received a plavix load, was greater than the benefits of immediately proceeding to CABG.
As the cath was complicated by a small groin hematoma, heparin and integrillin drips were stopped.
However, when cardiac surgery scheduled the patient for a CABG on hospital day three, both heparin and integrillin were restarted as he was thought to be a high risk for rethrombosis.
Plavix was held in anticipation of CABG.
The patient was maintained on aspirin, high-dose statin, beta-blocker, and was started on an ACE-I.
He responded to IV morphine and was also started on toradol after clearing the use of a NSAID with c-surgery.
After intubation and several rounds of CPR and epinephrine and atropine, the patient was rushed emergently to the OR where he was found to have a perforated wall of his ventricular cavity.
The patient expired and an autospy was requested and accepted.
On the first hospital day, he required a total of 3 L of IVF boluses to maintain his SBPs > 90.
A beta-blocker was started on admission and titrated up, but was eventually held due to Wenkebach (see below).
An ACE-I was also started for afterload reduction.
His fever was thought to be due to a combination of atelectasis and post-infarction epicardial inflammation as above.
