HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital6 6640**] for management of enterocutaneous fistula.

The patient was readmitted to [**Hospital3 8544**] for a small bowel obstruction and underwent on [**2164-7-3**] exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and multiple enterotomies, repair of enterostomies and loop ileostomy approximately 165 cm from ligament of Treitz, nasogastric tube insertion.
Postoperatively, the patient was being treated with Levaquin and Flagyl and Fluconazole for positive wound culture that grew out yeast _______, S viridans and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans and positive blood cultures for bacteroides fragilis and developed enterocutaneous fistula by postoperative day number five with increasing output and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for this management.

The patient had a Whistle tip catheter that was placed and long angiocath and ostomy ______ with continuous wall suction to control the fistula stump and the stump was flushed with normal saline and the patient was placed NPO with intravenous placed and TPN.
The patient was covered with Flagyl for the increasing white blood cell count and the culture data as above.
The G tube was changed that day and the stump was changed as well.
The patient on [**2164-7-12**] ileostomy had not put out anything and the patient continued to do well, but continued to have a fistula.
The patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition.

The patient's T tube was planned for po meals on [**7-18**].
However, the patient did not do well with po diet, therefore the patient was placed NPO and wait for the bowel function to return.
The patient will continue on total parenteral nutrition and had a tube feed placement getting half Impact plus fiber by the tube at nights and wait for the bowel function to return.
However, on [**7-21**] the patient felt nauseated again, therefore tube feeds were stopped and continued with total parenteral nutrition.
The patient continued to feel nauseated therefore the patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition and kept NPO with Reglan to treat nausea.
On [**7-22**] the patient had repair of the ostomy and continued the management and waiting for the bowel function to return.
The patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition.
The patient had an increase in stump output, which was replaced one to one and continued with total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was continued on the current management, increasing nutrition and total parenteral nutrition at goal.
By [**8-5**] the patient's fistula on the lower aspect healed almost over and total parenteral nutrition was continued.
Continue the stump management, total parenteral nutrition and NPO throughout the course.
The patient was managed with total parenteral nutrition and kept NPO.
Immediately postop the patient's pain was well controlled, extubated and hemodynamically stable, kept NPO with the G tube placed to gravity and the patient continued to have good urine output.
The patient continued on total parenteral nutrition and LR for fluid management and continued on Vanco and Flagyl during the postop period.
The patient was started on tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition was continued on [**8-31**].
On [**8-31**] the patient had good bowel sounds with increasing tube feeds to 30 cc an hour and continued total parenteral nutrition.
On [**9-1**] continued on total parenteral nutrition and diuresed.
The patient's tube feeds were advanced on [**9-3**] and the patient's tube feeds were cycled on [**9-4**] and the patient continued to improve.
The patient's G tube was clamped 2 out of 4 on [**9-6**].
Patient continued to improve on tube feeds running at 50 cc overnight on [**9-7**] and ambulating.
