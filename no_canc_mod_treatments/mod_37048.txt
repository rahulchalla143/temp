The patient was thought to have neuro-ocular syphilis and was started on Penicillin G 4,000,000 Units IV q4 hours after PCN desensitization in the MICU.
Vancomycin was discontinued on hospital day 3 as Staph uveitis was a less likely diagnosis.
Acyclovir was discontinued on hospital day 5 when CSF viral culture showed no virus isolated so far.
