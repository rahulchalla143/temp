Antenatal echocardiogram revealed aortic stenosis, bicommissural, thickened and dysplastic aortic valve, increasingly dilated ventricles with poor ventricular wall motion.
Elective cesarean section for fetal cardiac anomalies.
Due to post ductal saturations 40%, and apnea, the infant was intubated with a 3.5 French endotracheal tube secured at 9 cm.
The infant tolerated the procedure without incident.
A chest radiograph after intubation showed 8 rib expansion bilaterally, increased cardiac silhouette, diffuse opacification consistent with surfactant deficiency.
Preductal saturations were 85% prior to Surfactant administration.
The infant was on ventilator, placed on ventilator settings of positive inspiratory pressure 26, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, rate 25 with oxygen saturation to keep above preductal saturations, 85 to 90%.
An arterial blood gases drawn after Surfactant administration showed a pH of 6.94, carbon dioxide 56, pAO2 39, pCO2 of 13, base excess -23.
At that time, ventilator settings were increased from a rate of 25 to 35 and positive inspiratory pressure was increased from 26 to 28 and the infant received 2 mEq/kg of sodium bicarbonate.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], cardiologist from [**Hospital3 1810**] is aware of the infant's delivery and ordered intravenous Prostaglandin to be infused immediately after delivery.
Prematurity 34 weeks gestation male 2.
