On the day of delivery she was taken for cesarean section due to arrest of descent.
Cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia due to inadequate epidural.
Rupture of membranes occurred 10 hours prior to delivery, mother was treated with antibiotics beginning 5 hours prior to delivery due to GBS unknown, and no maternal fever was noted.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  Upon admission to the newborn intensive care unit, [**Known lastname 32348**] was placed on CPAP for mild respiratory distress.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: [**Known lastname 32348**] remained NPO until day of life 2 at which time she was started on enteral feeds of breast milk ad lib.
The episodes were not clearly related to choking or discoordination of feeding, but would present as mild gagging followed by apparent apnea with airway obstruction, often requiring stimulation and oxygen.
These were initially thought to be due to immaturity, but with persistence of these episodes beyond full term, various interventions were tried, including treatment with reglan and zantac, thickening of feeds with rice cereal or 'Thicken-up', and feeding of breast milk alone or formula alone.
A modified barium swallow (swallow study) on [**5-21**] showed better coordination of thickened feeds, although there was no aspiration with thick or thin liquids.
A 12 hour pneumogram with pH probe was also done on that day that was within normal limits.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 32348**] required two days of phototherapy for a peak bilirubin of 13.7.
[**Known lastname 32348**] completed 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamycin, which were discontinued with negative blood cultures.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  [**Known lastname 32348**] is stable in room air, tolerating full volume feeds and has been free of desaturation episodes with a stable temperature in an open crib.
Feeds at discharge: At demand of Neocate 20 calorie with     rice cereal which is made with 60 ml of Neocate 20     calorie with 1 tablespoon of rice cereal.
Immunizations received while here in the newborn     intensive care unit: Hepatitis B vaccine on [**2178-3-31**].
[**Known lastname 32348**] has not received her 2-month vaccination.
This infant has not received Rotavirus vaccine.
