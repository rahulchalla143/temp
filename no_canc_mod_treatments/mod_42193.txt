Admission Date:  [**2169-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-6-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transhepatic Intrajugular Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 71-year-old male with crytogenic cirrhosis complicated by portal HTN with ascites and recently developed right sided hepatic hydrothorax presenting with hypotension.
At OSH, he underwent pleurex catheter placement for his right pleural effusion in late [**2169-4-4**].
He noted excess drainage of fluid around the catheter site.
Diuretics had been discontinued a week previously due to excess drainage from catheter site and low BPs.
At OSH, pleural fluid from [**2169-5-16**] grew pseudomonas, staph, strep B.  Vancomycin and zosyn were started on [**2169-5-19**].
He has required levophed to maintain blood pressures.
Past Medical History: crytogenic cirrhosis hepatic hydrothorax s/p pleurex placement insulin-dependent DM HTN HLD diabetic peripheral neuropathy pancytopenia secondary to cirrhosis recurent hyponatremia septic arthritis involving right ankle s/p I & D DVT but felt not to be anticoagulation candidate due to cirrhosis, chronic coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia  (pt does not recall ever being told he had DVT)  Social History: Lives alone.
DISCHARGE EXAM: vitals: Tm100.2 Tc:97.9 BP 90/56 83 18 100%RA I/O: 10mL chest tube tract drainage in last 24H GEN:  Conversational, comfortable in bed HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclerae CARDIAC: S1, S2 regular rhythm, normal rate, I3/VI holosystolic murmur heard throughout precordium but best heard at LUSB LUNGS: diminished breath sounds right base, improved from prior.
s/p right chest tube removal with minimal drainage at site, ostomy bag in place covering site with clear straw-coloredn fluid ABDOMEN: BS+, soft, non-tender, nondistended.
The parts of the tube are projecting over the right upper quadrant.
Right PICC line in unchanged position.
Large right pleural effusion with chest tube in place.
A right-sided chest tube was placed.
He was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
ID was consulted and he was started on vanc and zosyn until cultures showed pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin at which time he was narrowed on [**5-24**].
However, antibiotics were continued.
Eventually, VRE would grow from the ostomy bag that was put over his drain site.
Although this may have been contamination from skin/bag, he was switched to linezolid anyways, as he had been having low grade temps on the vanc/cipro regimen.
# Hepatic hydrothorax: Pleural fluid from OSH grew multiple organisms as outlined above.
Chest tube initially placed, then removed, per above.
Repeat fluid cultures here showed small amount of GNRs in broth thought to be due to catheter inoculation rather than true infection.
The chest tube was clamped after TIPS and was removed approximately 24 hours later.
Chest x-ray the day after removal of the drain showed no re-accumulation of fluid.
After the procedure his transaminases and bilirubin rose for 2-3 days, as expected, and then began to trend down.
# DM: Continued Lantus at 35 units daily, w/ humalog insulin sliding scale.
