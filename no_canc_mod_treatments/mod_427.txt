There was concern for possible headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia, so given the concern for meningitis, a spinal tap was done.
Given these findings and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside hospital.
Given the concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside hospital.
She last used heroin 3-4 days prior to admission; she began using heroin one year prior to admission.
The right IJ central venous catheter was in place.
She had mild, but not true CMT on pelvic examination.
Her ALT was 529, AST 150, alkaline phosphatase 97, amylase 46, lipase 23, and albumin 2.3.
Her urinalysis had greater than 50 red blood cells, [**7-2**] white blood cells, and leukocyte esterase and nitrate were negative.
The patient received several doses of Ambisome at the [**Hospital1 69**], but once it had been confirmed that the finding of yeast was a false-positive, her Ambisome was discontinued.
Once this definitive speciation was made, the patient's antibiotic regimen was tailored to include oxacillin and gentamicin; the gentamicin was used for only four days in order to aid in the clearance of her bacteremia.
Also of note, a MRI of the head had been done on hospital day two in order to further evaluate for the possibility of meningeal inflammation.
Following the initiation of the appropriate antibiotic therapy as noted above, the patient slowly began to improve clinically.
Of note, however, the patient did develop mild elevations in her alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase following the initiation of oxacillin therapy.
It was thought that these elevations may have been secondary to oxacillin, but the elevations did not persist and had begun to trend towards normal at the time of discharge.
Given these normalizations, and given that the patient's hematocrit had been remaining stable (thus indicating that there was no significant myelosuppression as a result of oxacillin therapy), the patient was discharged with a plan for six weeks of continued oxacillin therapy.
A similar, but less apparent abnormality was also seen along the sulcus of the left occipital region.
She received azithromycin 1,000 mg once during her hospitalization for treatment of this chlamydia.
Cardiovascular:  Given that the patient had significant endocarditis, a Cardiology consult was obtained early in the patient's hospitalization for evaluation of whether or not the patient was a surgical candidate for her endocarditis.
Given her bilateral pleural effusions and mitral regurgitation, the patient was transiently on furosemide during this hospitalization, but had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure at the time of her discharge from the hospital.
She was started on a 14 day course of naproxen for treatment of the inflammation and swelling in her hand.
The etiology of this anemia was ultimately thought to be multifactorial due to a combination of anemia of chronic disease, recurrent phlebotomy, menstruation, and oxacillin induced myelosuppression.
Given that the patient's hematocrit was low, she was started on iron supplementation during this hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, however, the patient's hematocrit had been consistently stable for over one week, and the decision was made to continue her on oxacillin for the time being with twice weekly hematocrits following her discharge from the hospital.
In addition, they recommended analgesia as necessary, including with narcotic medications if necessary, in order to adequately control the patient's pain.
The patient was subsequently started on an atypical antipsychotic, and her narcotic medication dosing regimen was increased, with excellent therapeutic affect.
Oxacillin 2 grams IV q4h through [**2143-4-15**].
Naproxen 500 mg po bid through [**2143-3-29**].
Pantoprazole 40 mg po q day.
Ferrous sulfate 325 mg po q day.
Quetiapine 25 mg po tid.
Hydromorphone 1 mg IV q4h prn pain.
