The patient was in his usual state of health except for mild fatigue for the past two days until the night before admission when he noted some bright red blood dripping after a bowel movement.
The patient was given 2 liters normal saline, ceftriaxone 1 gram for variceal prophylaxis and an Octreotide drip was started.
Per the wife, the patient has not taken his Nadolol for the past two days.
He states that he has never had a colonoscopy and his blood pressure usually runs in the systolic of 80.

Levofloxacin 250 q. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Epivir 50 once a day.
Nadolol 10 once a day.
Glyburide 5 once a day.
The patient also did have a colonoscopy during his hospital course which demonstrated two 5 mm polyps, one in the ascending colon and one in the sigmoid with no active bleeding.
Given the bleeding from the internal hemorrhoids, the patient was discontinued on the Octreotide and restarted on Nadolol, continued on an IV proton pump inhibitor and changed to p.o.
For the purposes of ultimate treatment of the rectal varices and hemorrhoids, the Hepatology Service recommended no current intervention as far as hemorrhoidectomy is concerned and that banding would probably just cause infection as the hemorrhoids sloughed off and that the definitive treatment would come via liver transplantation or portal systemic shunting.

A therapeutic paracentesis was performed on [**2137-12-26**] and 7 liters were removed as per the patient's normal each week.
No diagnostic tests were done off this since it was done for therapeutic reasons and not for a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The patient was placed on stool softeners and an attempt to decrease the amount of straining that he would have to do which could likely cause further bleeding and for definitive management.
