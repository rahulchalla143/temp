Admission Date:  [**2177-1-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-2-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2177-1-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient, twin #2, is a 1065 g female infant born at 28 and 3/7 weeks gestation to a 30-year-old, gravida 2, para 02, mother, who had prenatal screens of blood type O-, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, CF negative, [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] negative, GBS unknown.
There was spontaneous onset of labor which was refractory to tocolysis and progressed to cesarean section for breech presentation of both twins.
Betamethasone was delivered shortly before delivery.
The baby was [**Name2 (NI) 43619**], palate intact, red light reflex equal bilaterally, moderate costal retractions with fair breath sounds, regular, rate and rhythm, no murmur, no femoral pulses, benign abdominal exam with three-vessel umbilical cord, no organomegaly, anus patent, normal female genitalia for gestational age, normal neurologic exam for gestational age, hips stable.
She remained on CPAP through day of life #12, at which time she was weaned to nasal cannula oxygen.
She continues on 200 cc of flow by nasal cannula oxygen with FIO2s of 21-30%.
She has been trialed a couple of times on nasal cannula.
Caffeine was initiated at the time of extubation for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
The apnea and bradycardiac episodes improved after treatment of the bacteremia and anemia.
Cardiovascular:  There was a murmur noted on day of life #1 that was consistent with a PDA, and Indomethacin therapy was initiated; however, after a single dose of Indomethacin, there marked oliguria, and the Indomethacin was discontinued.
The murmur persisted, and an echocardiogram on day of life #3 revealed a moderate size patent ductus arteriosis measuring 3.3 mm with continuous left-to-right flow.
Given her persistent oliguria, Indomethacin was not restarted; however, the murmur spontaneously decreased in intensity, and a repeat echocardiogram on day of life #5, showed a small patent ductus arteriosis that intermittently closed during the echocardiogram.
Since [**1-23**] (day of life #7), enteral feeds have been successfully advanced to full volume feeds of 150 cc/kg/day and breast milk supplemented up to 30 kcal/oz with ProMod.
She currently receives 150 cc/kg/day of breast milk 30 with ProMod over 1??????
She is on Vitamin E and Iron supplements.
Gastrointestinal:  Phototherapy was initiated on day of life #1.
Phototherapy has subsequently been discontinued with a rebound bilirubin of 3.5.
The patient received a transfusion of 15 cc/kg of packed red blood cells on day of life #13 secondary to a hematocrit of 27.7.
Ampicillin and Gentamicin were initiated and continued until the blood cultures had no growth for 48 hours.
Antibiotics were not initially started given the benign differential, but were started when the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus epidermitis at approximately 24 hours.
Vancomycin and Gentamicin were started on [**1-26**] after a repeat blood culture was sent.
Antibiotics were initially given through a PICC line; however, the line was discontinued after a repeat blood culture also grew an identical organism with identical sensitivities.
Gentamicin was continued for 48 hours.
The Vancomycin was continued for a full 7-day treatment course.
The patient over the past several days has had some clear eye drainage which has been treated with warm soap.
No culture has been sent, and no antibiotics have been started.
Neurology:  Routine HUS done at seven days of life was unremarkable.
Routine healthcare maintenance:  Newborn screen was sent of [**1-19**] and was normal except for a borderline thyroxin of 5.0 (normal values greater than 5).
No immunizations have been given.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Caffeine, Vitamin E, Fer-N-[**Male First Name (un) **].
Status post surfactant deficiency.
Status post patent ductus arteriosis.
Status post Indomethacin mediated oliguria.
Status post Staphylococcal epidermitis sepsis.
