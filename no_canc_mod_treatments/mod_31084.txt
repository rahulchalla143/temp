Brief Hospital Course: 92-y/o-man with past medical history of COPD on home O2 who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory distress and PNA, now s/p intubation for PNA with bradycardia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP evaluation.
Pt was initially treated with BiPAP but tired out with rising pCO2.
His pneumonia was covered broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline (he completed an 8-day course) and he was started on a prolonged steroid taper (methylprednisolone 60 mg x6 days switched over to prednisone on hospital day 7).
Steroids and antibiotics were continued, and his ventilation mechanics improved.
24-hours post-extubation he was transferred to the general medicine floor.
He can continue his home COPD regimen after discharge as well as a 2 week prednisone taper.
Patient is recommended to have wear autoset CPAP on 3L of supplemental O2 at nights  # Bradycardia.
