Seen at [**Location (un) 47**], CT head neg, LP with Tube 1: 18,000 RBC, Tube 4 with 34,000 RBC.
Following this, contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the head was obtained using departmental protocol.
Enhancement and T2 hyperintensity of the prevertebral space of the cervical spine extending from C2 to the C5 level which is concerning for cellulitis/phlegmon.
It was ultimately felt that the  patient's months long headache course was likely related to analgesia rebound phenomenon - taking too many pain medications and requiring more and more to quell the headaches as the tissues that respond to the medications learn to require more and more of them.
Nortryptiline was started to prevent headaches.
Fioricet, tylenol, ibuprofen and hydromorphone were used PRN to help with headaches.
Because sampling/biopsy could not be performed on the retropharyngeal collection, the decision was made to give the patient 6 weeks of antibiotics for broad-spectrium coverage to continue until the end of Novemeber: vancomycin 1 g IV q 12 hrs, ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q 12, and flagyl 500 mg po q 8 hrs.
A PICC was placed so that he could continue home infusions of vancomycin.
The patient was advised to gradually reduce his analgesic regimen as an outpatient with the hope that nortriptyline would continue to provide effectie prophylaxis.
He has follow up with ID, who will follow weekly CBC, BUN, Cr, LFTs and vancomycin troughs while on therapy.
