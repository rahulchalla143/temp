Neurologically, right knee dependent reflex was increased approximately 3+ with clonus.
However his hematocrit decreased from 33 to 28 and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight.
The morning of the day after admission, he underwent endoscopy which revealed a cratered 7 mm ulcer at the anterior bowl of the duodenum with a visible vessel.
This was treated with epinephrine and BICAP electrocautery.
After the endoscopy, the patient was moved back to the floor and overnight he had another very large melanotic stool and more coffee ground emesis and his blood pressure decreased to 70/40 at which point the decision was made to transfer the patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for emergency endoscopy.
