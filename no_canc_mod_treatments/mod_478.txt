[**2180-5-4**]: SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Left-sided pacer lead ends in the expected location of the right ventricle, unchanged.
A left-sided chest tube ends near the apex.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
[**2180-5-11**]: LVOT VTI in baseline pacing mode = 10.7 cm RV pacing alone: LVOT VTI = 11.5 cm LV-RV 10 msec offset: LVOT VTI = 12.8 cm LV-RV 20 msec offset: LVOT VTI = 13.3 cm LV tip to ring (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 14.0 cm LV tip to ring (LV-RV offset 30 msec): LVOT VTI = 12.3 cm LV ring to RV coil (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 13.2 cm LV ring to RV coil (LV-RV offset 30 msec): LVOT VTI = 11.2 cm LV tip to RV coil (LV-RV offset 0 msec): LVOT VTI = 13.3 msec     Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with PMHx of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**], mild-mod MR/TR, DM, ICD, Afib on coumadin, gout, hypothyroidism, CKD p/w vtach and ICD firing, also with decompensated CHF.
Will continue amiodarone as outpatient and decrease to 200mg Daily after 1 month.
ECHO on [**5-11**] evaluated his heart function after change in lead placement and it showed marked improvement in squeeze of his vintricles.
Diuresed on lasix gtt with [**Hospital1 **] metolazone and was euvolemic after several days.
CRT was considered as it would potentially benefit patient with low EF, wide QRS, so EP was consulted for upgrade to [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer.
Pt was transferred to surgery for epicardial placement of [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer for CRT.
Upon transfer to the floor he was placed on Levophed/Milrinone with a lasix gtt and these were titrated to keep MAPs >60 and UOP>30.
His digoxin was also continued.
To increase efficiency of systolic function and increase time in BiV pacing, he was betablocked with metoprolol and his pacemaker rate was increased to 80.
His BP improved as well as his creatinine.
At the time of discharge his fluid status was optimized, he was off of milrinone and doing well and he will be sent to Rehab.
On coumadin at home, however INR supratherapeutic at 4.0 so was held on admission.
Pt was given 5 mg vitamin K prior to EP attempt at BiV pacer, and again prior to epicardial lead placement.
His coumadin was then restarted.
His coumadin was held and on the day of discharge his INR was 3.1.
He will have his INR checked at Rehab and they will restart his coumadin at 2mg when his INR is between [**3-2**].
He needs to have his TSH, total T4, T3 resin in 1 week and follow up with endocrinology.
