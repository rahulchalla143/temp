Comminuted fracture of the right femoral head with associated cortical breakthrough and step off of the right acetabulum .
cardiac disease presenting with one week history of right hip pain and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypotension of uncertain etiology and right hip fracture.
Hypovolemic shock may be possibility although no clear history of dehydration, and BP did appear to respond to IVF (currently 5.5 L NS total received on admission) with CVP 15.
His blood pressures stabilized while in the MICU, he was taken off of pressors and transferred to the floor.
# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure Etiology is likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema during fluid resuscitation and also respiratory compensation for severe metabolic acidosis although did have superimposed respiratory acidosis from likely from tiring out before biPAP.
Patient was placed on BiPAP in ED and for a period of time while in the MICU.
Renal failure likely pre-renal +/- some element of intrinsic disease +/- drug side effect from numerous NSAIDs on medication list.
Patient's Cr was monitored during admission and was noted to have down trend in Cr following IV hydration.
# Right Hip Avascular Necrosis: Patient received CT Pelvis to evaluate for Fournier's gangrene in setting of scrotal skin changes, was negative for Fournier's, but concerning Right hip changes were noted.
#New Onset Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response While in the MICU, the patient had two brief episodes of AFib with RVR; once requiring a dose of IV metoprolol, and once self-converting into sinus rhythm.
His metoprolol was increased gradually, but because of persistent episodes of AFib the decision was made to convert the patient from short acting to Metop XL 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Given 5mg on [**7-31**], 5mg on [**8-1**], INR was 4.0 on [**8-2**], so coumadin stopped.
Restarted on indomethicin and stopped allopurinol in the acute setting.
CHRONIC ISSUES # Diabetes - The patient was maintained on [**Known firstname **] insulin sliding scale during his hospital course.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES The patient will need to follow up with our [**Hospital 9696**] Clinic in order to plan possible operative intervention for his right hip avascular necrosis once he is more medically stable.
The patient will need close follow up to monitor his INR given the initiation of anticoagulation therapy during his hospital course.
Will need to restart allopurinol after acute flare.
