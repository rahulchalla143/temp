PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a nephrectomy secondary to renal stones in [**2087**], a hand operation and a hysterectomy in [**2083**].
MEDICATIONS:  At home include Glucotrol 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Glucophage 1,000 mg [**Hospital1 **], Zestril 20 mg q d, Aspirin 81 mg q d and Estratab .625 mg two times per week.
Following her catheterization, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.
She was accepted for aortic valve replacement and on [**10-11**] she was brought to the operating room for an aortic valve replacement and a CABG times one.
In summary, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #21 pericardial valve and a CABG times one with a saphenous vein graft to the RCA.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She was A-paced at a rate of 90 beats per minute and she had Propofol infusing at 20 mcg/kg/minute.
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period, however, after several hours in the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit she became hypotensive with increasing chest tube output and she was brought back to the operating room for re-exploration of her mediastinal bleeding at which time it was found that she had a coronary sinus injury.
She tolerated the re-exploration well and was brought from the operating room back to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, after which she remained hemodynamically stable without any further bleeding.
She did, however, remain intubated throughout the evening and on postoperative day #1 her sedation was discontinued, however, she was slow to awaken from her anesthesia and sedation and she remained intubated throughout the day on postoperative day #1.
On postoperative day #2 the patient was more responsive and she was weaned from the ventilator to C-pap, however, she was still somewhat sluggish and therefore she remained intubated throughout postoperative day #2.
Throughout postoperative day #3 the patient continued to be somewhat sedate, therefore she stayed on C-pap from a respiratory standpoint with good gas exchange.
Captopril was added to her regime of Nipride to try to control her blood pressure.
On postoperative day #5 the patient was extubated, her Lopressor and Captopril were increased, allowing us to wean her from her Nipride and by postoperative day #6 her Nipride was off and she was transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days the patient remained hemodynamically stable, her activity level was increased on a daily basis with the assistance of physical therapy and on postoperative day #8 it was decided that the patient would be appropriate to discharge to home with the assistance of VNA for nursing assessment and physical therapy on the following day.
Aortic stenosis, status post AVR with a #21 pericardial valve.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting with an SVG to the RCA.
Status post hand operation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 75 mg [**Hospital1 **], Aspirin 81 mg q d, Captopril 50 mg tid, Glucotrol 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Glucophage 1,000 mg [**Hospital1 **], potassium chloride 20 mEq q d times 10 days, Lasix 20 mg q d times 10 days and Regular insulin sliding scale.
Physical exam at time of discharge, vital signs, temperature 96.6, heart rate 81, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 132/70, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 96% on room air.
