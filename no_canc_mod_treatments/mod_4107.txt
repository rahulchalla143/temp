[**MD Number(1) 21890**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute renal failure, status post renal transplant.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute renal failure, status post renal transplant.
Catheterization of the right external iliac artery and     the transplanted renal artery.
Balloon angioplasty of transplant renal artery stent.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease, who is status post renal transplant.
Real-time visualization needle puncture into the right common femoral artery was achieved with the ultrasound.
Using a micro sheath the right common femoral artery was accessed.
This was followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire in the abdominal aorta and a #5 French right tip sheath.
A pelvic angiogram and transplant renal arteriogram were performed.
Using a Glidewire and an Omni flush catheter, we selected the renal artery.
The catheter was then exchanged for a slip cath and a spider coil wire was then placed across the stent.
As there was no lesion, we elected to terminate the procedure at this point.
All catheters and wires were withdrawn and the right common femoral arteriotomy was closed with a Perclose device.
The transplant renal artery was widely patent, without     stenosis.
A 6 x 20 mm [**Location (un) 21892**]     balloon was used to angioplasty within the stent,     however no stenosis was noted.

His EKG showed no difference to prior EKGs and only Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.05.
#Renal disease:Patient was noted to have elevated creatinine from baseline elevation (2.5-3.5).
He did not report being very dry and had this high creatinine in the setting of high BPs so he was considered also for renal artery stenosis (he is s/p stenting in transplant kidney renal artery).
The team was also worried about chronic kidney rejection and/or glomerular nephropathy from diabetes and longstanding HTN.
He continued to produce adequate urine despite his Lasix being held.
He was taken to the OR for renal artery angiongram and possible intervention on 3 different occasions.
On the first two no intervention could be taken as he was unable to lay flat on the operating table.
He was started on lasix and his orthopnea improved.
He developed mild respiratory failure after extubation, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the MICU.
In the MICU he was continued on diuretics and was successfully weaned off NIPPV.
He was transfered to the floor on [**8-25**] where he was continued on diuretics and his RF improved.
He also commented on abdominal distension and so CT scan was ordered to assess for ascites, which would also be a mechanism for pressure on the diaphragm.
He developed mild hypercarbic respiratory failure after extubation during renal artery angiogram, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the MICU.
In the MICU he was continued on diuretics and was successfully weaned off non-invasive ventilation.
He was transfered to the floor on [**8-25**] where he was continued on diuretics and had no more respiratory problems off O2.
The option of nightly use of NIPPV was discussed with the patient for treatment of OSA but he refused.
#HTN: His HTN was very hard to control while in the hospital, his medications had to be adjusted on several occasions because of SBP up to 200s.
While in the MICU he was treated with a labetalol drip that effectively decreased his BP.
On transfer he was transitioned to PO labetalol.
He was started on his home dose of NPH but this did not manage his sugars well and so we switched to 20units AM and 10 units PM and a sliding scale.
He was started on cinacalcet to treat this condition.
