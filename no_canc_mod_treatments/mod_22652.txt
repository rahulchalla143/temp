He was given 1gm IV vancomycin and 2L normal saline.
He was started on a heparin gtt without a bolus.
He has been on prilosec and zantac in the past but is not taking these currently.
In the past two weeks, he has been started on Peptamen as well as a low-fat diet.
Past Medical History: R Kidney Tumor treated with partial nephrectomy 2 years ago S/P Retinal Detachment and cataract surgery bilaterally Inguinal Hernia Repair Appendectomy 4 years ago ?
Radiology: MR ENTEROGRAPHY ([**Numeric Identifier 46893**]&[**Numeric Identifier 46894**]) SBFT	Study Date of [**2117-7-27**] 7:08 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend evaluation with colonoscopy if not recently performed.
The right PICC line tip can be seen till the level of low SVC at least.
[**8-15**] MRI Abdomen: No hypervascular tumors; no evidence of neuroendocrine tumor   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 85187**] is a 70 yoM, Greek-speaking only, who initially presented for work-up of chronic diarrhea (protein losing enteropathy, possible lymphangectasia), who was incidentally found to have MSSA endocarditis with arterial thrombus to mesentery; also with PICC line LUE DVT, bil.
pleural effusions; recently started on TPN .
Blood cultures grew MSSA and the patient is on Nafcillin 2g q4h to complete a 6 week course; last day of antibiotics is [**2117-9-7**].
The patient should have a repeat Echo and blood cultures at the end of therapy to be certain he has cleared the infection.
He has had problems in the past with pulmonary edema and was on Lasix 40 mg qd at home in [**Country 5881**].
Lasix was started and since the 11th, the patient has maintained stable weight.
He was discharged on a regimen of PO Lasix 120 mg qam, and 80 mg q6pm.
He may need either up or down titration of this regimen depending on his diuresis.
He has also required regular potassium repletion during active diuresis.
#LUE DVT: The patient was found to have a PICC line associated thrombus in his L UE on [**8-6**] so the PICC line was removed and a new PICC was placed on the Right.
Hematology recommended anticoagulation therapy for 3 months.
The patient was initially on a heparin drip but was transitioned to lovenox and coumadin.
On the day of discharge, the patient was still subtherapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 1.2.
He was discharged on 7.5 mg coumadin qday as well as lovenox 70 mg [**Hospital1 **].
#Atrial Tachycardia: While in the ICU and the beginning of his stay on the floor, the patient was noted to have a murmur (likely aortic vegetation), as well as bursts of tachycardia up into the 150s, which one night required the usage of PO and IV Metoprolol.
Cardiology was consulted, and after examining the EKGs felt that the patient's tachycardia was likely atrial tachycardia vs sinus tachycardia with very frequent PAC, and recommended starting him on PO Metopolol.
The patient responded well to Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO/NG TID, and did not have any further bursts of tachycardia during his stay.
He was recently started on a low-fat diet and a medium chain triglycerides, which are a large part of the Peptamen formulation, and found some improvement in his diarrhea, which was therefore thought to be evidence consistent with intestinal lymphangiectasia.
A colonoscopy and enterography were concerning for TI and IC valve ulcers, but the gross appearance of the proximal transverse lumen and jejunal were unremarkable.
His Hct stabilized during his hospitalization at 23-24.
It reached a nadir during his stay at 73; Heme/Onc was consulted, and they felt that his thrombocytopenia was likely due to consumption and infection, particularly as it normalized to ~200 at the time of his discharge following treatment of his endocarditis and nutrition via TPN.
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin drip/pneumoboots/lovenox or coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
