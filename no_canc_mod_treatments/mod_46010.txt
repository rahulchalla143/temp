Given that the patient was on lovenox and there was some blood at the time of the PEG placement, it was thought that there was a small amount of bleeding into the site caused by anticoagulation.
Therefore the hct was closely monitored and the patient was given a transfusion of PRBCs.
The lovenox was held after hct decrease, but should be restarted as the patient is at significant risk for DVT after hip fracture.
