HD catheter tip is in the right atrium.
The diameter of the left basilic vein ranges from 0.19 to 0.29 cm and left cephalic vein ranges from 0.12 to 0.48 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 3228**] is an 85 year old woman with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic diastolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (stage V) who was initially admitted for volume overload, and hyperkalemia requiring initation of hemodialysis and pneumonia.
Hospital course was complicated by worsening hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation and upper GI bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer.
#Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Acute on chronic renal failure, stage V: Patient was admitted with decompensated heart failure, volume overload, and hyperkalemia.
Patient responded only mildly to high dose diuretics and required ultrafiltration for volume removal and dialysis for electrolyte disarray.
She underwent tunneled right IJ catheter placement on [**2147-4-11**] urgently without complications.
She was transitioned from calcitriol po to IV hectol to be given with hemodialysis.
She was started on calcium acetate and nephrocaps.
She will be followed at [**Location (un) **] Dialysis with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1366**] on a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday hemodialysis schedule.
She will discuss potential transition to peritoneal dialysis with her nephrologist as an outpatient.
Sputum grew Moraxella so patient was started on doxycycline [**2147-4-15**], as she has antibiotic allergies to cephalosporins, azithromycin, and quinolones.
In the MICU, antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and zosyn; she completed a course for HCAP and respiratory symptoms improved.
She also has chronic RML and RLL collapse which may be worked up for a potential obstructive lesion.
She was initially continued on home labetalol as her beta blocker but it was discontinued in the setting of GI bleed and then restarted upon discharge.
Please see below for info on aspirin/anticoagulation as the decision was made to discharge patient off all antiplatelet and anticoagulation due to GI bleed, but the decision to restart aspirin or therapeutic anticoagulation should be revisited in outpatient follow up based on the patient's clinical condition.
Given the significant bleed anticoagulation and aspirin were held.
In 2 weeks, aspirin 81mg daily can be restarted with the decision to increase aspirin to 325 or start therapeutic anticoagulation to be determined by the patient's PCP and GI depending on ulcer healing.
#Low grade fever: Pt had Tmax 100.6 on the day before discharge, however there was no clear infectious source, pt clinically appeared very well, and afebrile thereafter until discharge off antibiotics (>24 hrs).
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - patient to discuss potential switch to peritoneal dialysis with her outpatient providers - possible workup of RML and RLL chronic collapse - monitor HD catheter insertion site, which has had some intermittent bleeding requiring pressure dressings.
- Pt should have PCP follow up made when discharged from rehab -- she will need to have a hematocrit drawn within [**2-6**] wks of discharge and if stable (last value stable at 29.6) then PCP should consider restart ASA 81 for AFib, if appropriate, with decision for full dose aspirin or Coumadin to be decided in conjunction with GI depending on ulcer healing and persistent risk of GI bleeding -Gastroenterology follow up appointment is being worked on and patient should follow up within 2 wks.

You were also found to have worsening heart failure, which caused a lot of extra fluid buildup in your body.
This was treated during a procedure called an EGD and the bleed seems to have resolved.
