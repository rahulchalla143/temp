She was treated with Glucagon Insulin, D50, Bicarbonate, Atropine, and Calcium Gluconate.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2132**] with LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
She is also status post catheterization with a stent to the left circumflex in [**2135**], and is status post catheterization in [**2140**] showing patent grafts.
Most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2143-3-28**] showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with prominent V-wave and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing, preserved cardiac output, left main coronary artery with a 95% hazy lesion extending into the proximal left circumflex.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis times two months.

MORPHINE SULFATE REPORTEDLY CAUSES ANAPHYLAXIS.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.1, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 258; INR 2.8; potassium 5.0, this potassium was obtained after treatment for a hemolyzed potassium of 7.9, creatinine 10.1, BUN 66, glucose 194, magnesium 2.7, calcium 9.2, sodium 135, CK 42, MB not applicable.
Arrhythmia:  His bradycardia and hypertension was attributed to a combination of Amiodarone and beta-blocker used in the setting of end-stage renal disease with hyperkalemia.
Withholding of Amiodarone and beta-blocker together with treatment of hyperkalemia and dialysis allowed the patient to return to normal sinus rhythm.
It should be noted that the patient has had in the recent past a subclavian to subclavian graft constructed in her left upper pectoral/anterior deltoid region.
After return of heart rhythm to normal sinus at a normal rate, the patient still required Dopamine for blood pressure support.
After a couple of days of antibiotics and monitoring of her blood pressure in the right arm, the patient was able to be weaned off Dopamine without problem.
Amiodarone and beta-blocker were held throughout the hospitalization, and she remained in sinus rhythm at a normal rate for the rest of the duration of the hospitalization.
After dialysis, she was weaned to pressure support and extubated.
She was continued on hemodialysis while in-house every other day with removal of 2.0-2.5 L of fluid by ultrafiltrate at each dialysis session.
She was followed by Nephrology while in-house and was continued on Nephrocaps while her Remegel was increased to t.i.d.
with meals, and she was also started on PhosLo.
She was also eventually placed on a 2 g sodium diet with a 1500 cc/day fluid restriction.
Dialysis with removal of fluid allowed for complete resolution of these symptoms.
Sepsis:  After the patient was able to maintain herself in sinus rhythm at a normal rate, she required Dopamine for blood pressure support as indicated above.
She was empirically started on Vancomycin and Levaquin, both dosed renally.
After about five days, her Vancomycin was discontinued, and she was continued on Levaquin.
A respiratory source was suspected, as blood cultures remained negative, urine cultures remained negative, and one respiratory culture showed rare growth of ..................  She will be continued on renally dosed Levaquin through [**2143-5-18**], to complete a 10-day course.
Anticoagulation:  The patient is maintained on Coumadin as an outpatient for her left ventricular thrombus.
Her Coumadin was intermittently held to allow return of her INR to a therapeutic range.
On the day of discharge after holding her Coumadin for two out of the three previous nights, her INR was still 4.1.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] Coumadin will be held at discharge, and she will receive 5 mg p.o.
Vitamin K prior to leaving the hospital.
Hyperkalemia:  A Nutrition consult was called to discuss a proper renal diet with the patient.
Her Lipitor and Plavix were continued.
Given that her blood pressure remained on the low side of normal throughout her hospitalization with a normal sterile fashion and rate, her Atenolol, Isosorbide Dinitrate and Losartan were not restarted.
Diabetes:  Glucose control was initially difficult, and while on the ventilator, the patient was maintained on an Insulin drip.
This was converted to a sliding scale and eventually converted back to her home dose of Glargine 20 in the morning and 10 at night with a sliding scale.
She was advised not to restart her Elavil, Gabapentin, Meclizine, ................., Isosorbide Dinitrate, Atenolol or Losartan until authorized to do so by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and/or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4251**].
She will not resume taking her Coumadin until authorized to do so by her primary care physician.
