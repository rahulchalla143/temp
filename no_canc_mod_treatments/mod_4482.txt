Source of infection thought to be right subclavian HD catheter vs b/l internal jugular and subclavian thrombosis (septic thrombophlebitis).
He had been treated with vanco at HD since his last admission for MRSA bacteremia.
He received Linezolid and Ceftaz initially for concern for Pseudomonas and VRE.
He will be seen in the [**Hospital **] Clinic to determine the need for further treatment at that time.
A right groin tunneled dialysis catheter was placed on [**8-31**] and his temporary Right IJ line was removed.
Consider EP consult for AICD placement as an outpatient once his infection and thromboses have resolved.
He was maintained on a heparin gtt (HIT ab negative) until his tunneled dialysis cath was placed.
He was started on Lovenox 30mg qd as a bridge to a theraputic INR.
His initial coumadin dose was 10, then 7.5, then he was discharged on 2.
The Lovenox will be stopped once his INR is above 2.
Elevated INR (5.5) on admission thought to be secondary to coumadin and malnutrition.
He initially received FFP and Vit K prior to dialysis catheter removal.
If they do not return to baseline he should f/u with a hematologist.
His ASA and plavix were restarted prior to discharge.
His Plavix was held [**1-6**] to low platlets and it can be restarted after checking a CBC in a week.
His was continued on lisinopril 5 mg daily and metoprolol 50 mg tid (B-B was titrated up as tolerated).
