Admission Date:  [**2171-1-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-4-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal insufficiency secondary to bilateral renal artery stenosis who presents from Spinal [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for intractable hypertension.
Ultimately, it was discovered that his relative hypotension had resulted in significant end-organ damage including an anterior spinal artery infarct resulting in T11 paraplegia, acute renal failure, and a troponin leak.
The patient was sent to neurologic rehabilitation at the end of [**Month (only) 359**].
His course has been marked continued hypertension that is refractory to four antihypertensive medications including minoxidil.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in the setting of sudden hypotension.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post aortobifemoral bypass.
Recent hospitalization in [**2170-9-1**] for a right upper lobe pneumonia requiring intubation for one month, status post a long course of levofloxacin.

His oral antihypertensive medications were held, and he was started on a Nipride drip to keep his systolic blood pressure between 150 and 170.
He had a single episode of chest pain associated with a systolic blood pressure of 220 while on the Nipride drip, so a nitroglycerin drip was added as well.
He was then taken to the catheterization laboratory where he received a left renal artery stent for a 90% proximal stenosis.
After the procedure, he was weaned off of the Nipride and nitroglycerin drips and changed to oral antihypertensives.
To that end, he was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
q.6h., captopril 50 mg p.o.
t.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
He continued to have systolic blood pressures in the 170s to 200s after two days of this regimen, so minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
Thus, his regimen was changed to metoprolol 200 mg b.i.d., captopril 25 mg t.i.d., and minoxidil 10 mg q.d.
If he then has systolic blood pressures greater than 170 on a regular basis after stopping the minoxidil, he should have his captopril dose increased to 50 mg t.i.d.
He received hydration and Mucomyst prior to catheterization.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  He was treated with a course of Flagyl for his Clostridium difficile colitis.
He had no diarrhea during his hospital stay, and his stool was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin times two.
He received 2 units of packed red blood cells with good response, and his hematocrit stabilized after that.
ENDOCRINE:  He was continued on his steroids, methotrexate, and leucovorin for his eosinophilic fasciitis.
LINES:  He had an arterial line initially for intensive blood pressure monitoring while on Nipride that was removed after his drips were stopped.
He came with a Foley catheter, and when we spoke to him, he said that he preferred having an indwelling Foley to intermittent straight catheterization, and so the Foley catheter was left in place.
