Admission Date:  [**2165-5-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-5-13**]   Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery bypass graft, pacemaker, Type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who was recently admitted for acute cholangitis with failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography attempt and biliary drain placement who returns with acute renal failure and repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Given the concern for continued cholangitis, the patient received Gentamicin during that admission.
Since his discharge on [**4-24**], the patient has been using Levofloxacin and Flagyl for cholangitis and Escherichia coli positive blood cultures at a prior outside hospital.
The procedure was completed successfully with stent placement and removal of percutaneous drainage tube.
He was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on ventilatory support.
The patient's desaturation was likely due to medications received during the procedure and the patient was easily weaned from the ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft 15 years prior.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Insulin NPH 50 q.
AM, 12 q. PM; Protonix 40 q. day; Aspirin 325 q. day, stopped [**5-8**]; Levofloxacin 250 q. day; Flagyl 500 t.i.d.
; Pentoxifylline 400; Valsartan 160; Gabapentin 300 t.i.d.
; Detrol 2 mg q. day; Metoprolol XL 75 q. day; Multivitamin q. day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.9, heart rate 120, blood pressure 182/74, respirations 30, sating 100% on ventilatory support.
A biliary stent was placed during this procedure and percutaneous biliary drain was removed.
The patient was continued on empiric antibiotics of Levofloxacin and Flagyl, though no further biliary cultures were obtained.
He was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for nine days post procedure.
Given the patient's recent history of antibiotics the patient's stool was checked for Clostridium difficile and culture samples were negative at the time of discharge.
Acute renal failure - Patient with renal failure, likely originally due to dehydration and subsequent with acute tubular necrosis, possibly from medications received.
The patient's renal function improved both with time and with intravenous hydration.
All medications were renally dosed.
The patient's dysarthria was likely secondary to dry mouth post intubation and confusion possibly secondary to a recent infection and sedation.
His aspirin was held at the time of this admission given that he had evidence of a large ulceration in his duodenum and with guaiac positive stool.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Hydrochlorothiazide were held given his renal failure.
Blood pressure - Patient with hypertension, and his Hydrochlorothiazide and [**Last Name (un) **] had been held during this admission.
The patient was continued on the beta blocker and in addition to this was given Hydralazine for blood pressure control.
Hydralazine was keeping the blood pressure within good control, however, will consider switching as an outpatient for more convenient dosing as the patient's renal function improves.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient was kept on insulin drip on the Intensive Care Unit.
On transfer to the floor, he was given a regular insulin sliding scale.
As the patient began to take better p.o., his insulin NPH was restarted.
This was due to malnutrition, as the patient responded well to Vitamin K.  The patient was given Vitamin K during this admission and the INR returned to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
The patient's hematocrit although decreased during this admission likely due to hydration did not represent or suggest acute active blood loss.
The patient was given Protonix b.i.d.
The patient should continue on Protonix and follow up as an outpatient.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Patient with significant malnutrition at the time of admission and low albumin as well as evidence of Vitamin K deficiency as represented by his increased INR.
The patient will continue with Nutrition, maintaining a cardiac and diabetic diet at the time of discharge.
This was likely due to the sedation received during the procedure.
He was given nebulizers prn and encouraged to use an incentive spirometer.
The patient's tachycardia resolved as he was restarted on his medications and oxygenations but off of the ventilator there was no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Status post biliary stent placement.
Calcium acetate 2 tablets b.i.d.
Levofloxacin 250 q.o.d.
Multivitamin q. day.
Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers prn.
Flagyl 500 t.i.d.
