Admission Date:  [**2148-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and nausea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2148-8-12**] External ventricular drain [**2148-8-15**] Redo stereotactic third ventriculostomy   History of Present Illness: The patient woke the morning of admission and had one episode of vomiting with breakfast and then went back to sleep.
As the patient was recently discharge from [**University/College **] Hitchcock s/p abscess removal and hydrocephalus, the patient's uncle and aunt were concerned and brought him into a local ED at [**Hospital1 1562**].
Per the patient and the family he has only had some increased sleepiness, and has not had the headaches, hallucinations and unresponsiveness he had when he was initially diagnosed with his brain lesions.
The cultures returned C.albicans, and he was placed on a month of amphotericin and 5-flucytosine.
The patient EVD was removed and an endoscopic 3rd ventriculostomy was performed.
Past Medical History: chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (complications include mutiple skin infectious, tooth infections (pt has none of his own teeth) and eye infectiou leading to R eye blindness   Social History: Patient usually resides in [**State 3914**], but currently lives with aunt and uncle after d/c from the hospital.
There is extensive multifocal nodular ependymal and intraventricular enhancement, extending up to and through the right frontal prior  ventriculostomy catheter tract.
There is associated restricted diffusion and the findings likely relate to infectious ventriculitis, ependymitis and associated cerebritis with no discrete focus of liquefactive necrosis to suggest abscess.
Additional enhancement within the quadigeminal cistern and possibly involving the dorsal surface of the cervical spinal cord, at the C2 level.
Craniocervical alignment abnormality with crowding at the craniocervical junction and "kinking" of the cervicomedullary junction, likely on a congenital basis, as discussed above which should be correlated with the patient's prior imaging and clinical history.
MRI Flow Study [**8-13**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the right frontal catheter and interval placement of a left frontal catheter which terminates at the level of the foramen magnum.
There is a focus of enhancement within the inferior portion of the cerebral aqueduct.
Stable focus of enhancement within the inferior aspect of the cerebral aqueduct causing obstruction of outflow and therefore non-communicating hydrocephalus.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-8-16**] Again seen is bilateral frontal burr hole post- surgical change, with left lateral ventriculostomy with the catheter tip in unchanged position in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2148-8-19**] FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of a left frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter.
IMPRESSION: Status post removal of left frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter with no evidence for new hemorrhage.
MRI flow study done on [**8-14**] revealed that the prior 3rd ventriculostomy was not patent and would require re-do surgery.
He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-15**] for this procedure which was tolerated well.
The distal EVD catheter was left in place.
CSF cultures were finalized as negative for bacteria/fungus.. On [**2148-8-19**] the distal EVD catheter was removed as he exhibited no sign of hydrocephalus.
The IV medications for mucocutaneous candidiasis will be discontinued on [**8-21**].
Erythromycin 5 mg/g Ointment Sig: One (1)  Ophthalmic QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).
Prednisolone Acetate 1 % Drops, Suspension Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic Q4  ().
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.
Voriconazole 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours).
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
?Please return to the office in [**6-21**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
