Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15655**] was taken from the helipad emergently to the Operating Room where he underwent suture closure of stomach injuries and placement of pancreatic drains, washout of left wrist injury.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the Trauma SICU in guarded condition.

He was taken back to the Operating Room on [**2101-8-31**] and underwent a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy and primary closure of the abdomen.
Following this procedure he required a tunneled line for hemodialysis as he developed acute renal failure.
He underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest PT and incentive spirometry and remained free of any other pulmonary complications.
