Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, howver he was transferred to the MICU on HD 3 due to episode of ongoing SVT with HR to the 170's.
He received adenosine x 4, diltiazem and Lopressor.
EP evaluated and felt this was an atrial tachycardia and he was started on amiodarone drip.
Also, on [**1-10**], his tunnelled dialysis catheter was replaced as the current line was felt to be too far into the atrium, potentially causing atrial irritation.
Drain left in place following surgery with copius amounts of output.
Replacement provided with NS and 5% Albumin.
Blood cultures drawn on day of surgery yielded VRE.

At this time, patient was on Amiodarone 200 mg PO BID and low dose beta blocker IV.
Patient continued with serial exams, no intervention at this time.
Patient remained on pressors, with attempts to wean but keep SBP greater than 80.
Over the next week patient was on and off pressors PRN, eventually not requiring pressure support and on [**2-4**] the patient was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10.
CVVHD was discontinued and intermittent HD started on [**1-29**] which patient has tolerated.

Rate control was recommended with lopressor.
Amiodarone was to continue.
TPN was administered until [**2-12**].
Tube feedings were stopped briefly and resumed with diluted Nutren.
TPN was also resumed on [**2106-2-17**] for insufficient caloric intake while increasing tube feeding.
Albumin was given post paracentesis.
Repeat paracentesis was done on [**2106-2-16**] with removal of 6 liters.
He remained on lopressor and amiodarone for svt.
He will be d/c'd to rehab on TPN until tube feedings are at goal and tolerated.
He will require periodic paracentesis per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]).
