Vascular Surgery was consulted, and they advised that the patient be typed and crossed for 4 units of blood, and transfused 2 units.
He was volume resuscitated with 3 liters of IV fluid.
The bleeding stopped and pressure dressing was applied.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2178**].
Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in [**2178**].
Batteries in ICD device were placed in [**2182-10-11**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports allergies to Keflex resulting in rash, beta blockers resulting in aggravation of his asthma, Avandia resulting in rash and edema, aldactone resulting in hyperkalemia.
Verapamil SR 240 mg po q day.
Monopril 20 mg po bid.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
Lipitor 20 mg po q day.
Isordil 20 mg po bid.
Folate 3 mg po bid.

Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 115, bicarbonate 21, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 164.
Coronary artery disease:  Patient is status post myocardial infarction in [**2178**], status post PTCA of the left anterior descending artery in [**2178**].
He was continued on medical management with aspirin 325 po q day, Isordil 20 mg po bid, Lipitor.
His Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg po q day and was to be modified after a check of his lipid profile.
Originally, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held secondary to his falling hematocrit, the question of any blood pressure lability.
Patient was not started on a beta blocker secondary to his history of reactive airway disease.
However, it is felt that the patient should clarify with his PCP the role of beta blockade and could perhaps be started on a beta blocker in the future.
As the patient was status post ablation for ventricular tachycardia, he is monitored on telemetry for arrhythmias.
On hospital day #2, his verapamil 240 mg po q day and ACE inhibitor were reinstated.
Additionally, his verapamil 240 mg po q day was added for antiarrhythmic properties.
Right groin hematoma:  Patient underwent ultrasound which demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation.
Additionally, Vascular Surgery was following the patient and recommended serial hematocrit checks q4h with a goal to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 in light of his coronary artery disease history.
He was typed and crossed for four units of packed red blood cells and was said to be transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit.
Therefore, the decision was made to hold off on transfusion and simply monitor the patient with serial hematocrits.
In addition, he was volume resuscitated with a total of 3 liters of IV fluid.
On the evening of hospital day #2, the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

Hemoglobin A1C laboratory was sent, but was pending at the time of discharge.
