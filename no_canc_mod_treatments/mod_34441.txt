Admission Date:  [**2132-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-3-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-6-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Amoxicillin / vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital following breakthrough seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 47 y/o man with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder s/p TBI, behavioral changes (mostly aggression) following TBI, and ESRD of unknown etiology s/p recent renal transplant who was at [**Hospital1 **] Rehab facility following his transplant surgery ([**2132-2-3**]).
He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (neurology, [**Hospital1 18**]) for several years and he was well maintained on levetiracetam monotherapy.
As his renal function started to deteriorate, he was switched over to include dilantin as well.
Ultimately, prior to his transplantation, he was switched over to a regimen of zonegran and depakote as dilantin was thought to be a culprit interactor with several post transplant immunosuppressants.
He was started on depakote 500 mg qAM and 750 mg qPM with an ativan bridge and now at 1g [**Hospital1 **] (depakote).
He was given an extra 250mg dose of VPA and remained seizure free for 24 hours following which he was once again found unresponsive in his room, with mucus and blood emanating from his mouth.
Given the possibility of seizure, he was given IV lorazepam and transported to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for evaluation.
He was found yesterday not responsive with right eye deviation, tachycardic and diaphoretic.
Ativan was not given at that time.
He was also incontinent of urine and stool.
The thought was that he had an unwitnessed seizure and therefore was given 2mg IV ativan and taken to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital.
he states that he is not having HD currently and that he is urinating adequately.
He was initially treated with Keppra and remained stable for several years with few seizures.
Since Keppra was not the ideal medication given renal failure, he was admitted to the EMU for monitored medication changes.
He was tapered off Keppra and started on Dilantin and zonisamide.
He has remained on these 2 medications.
He had also been tried on gabapentin and Depakote in the past but the details of this are not clear.
Past Medical History: - ESRD of unclear etiology, on HD for several years, now s/p transplant - penetrating head trauma with metal blade [**2122**], s/p L frontal injury - Epilepsy secondary to TBI - HTN - hypothyroid   Social History: He has lived in a group home (Neuro Restorative [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78359**]for the past 2 years.

Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals;97.9 74 141/79 20 98% 2L Nasal Cannula Rectal temp 99.8 General: Lethargic, cooperative, NAD.
He is inattentive as he required frequent tactile stimuli to awaken.

Given his recent breakthrough seizures while on depakote and zonegran and his history of being well controlled on keppra, he received a 750mg IV keppra IV load (his renal function is poor, with a creatinine that is currently a 3.2/3.3) and was started on keppra 750mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was initially admitted to the Neurology floor, but later in the ED, he was noted to have another GTC lasting 3 minutes (description is not available) and was given ativan out of concern for ongoing subclinical seizures.
We also discussed the possibility of checking MRI C-spine, but OSH notes report that his C-spine had been cleared while he was awake and able to deny tenderness and display a normal ROM.
He will likely no longer require hemodialysis, but if he does he can take an extra 250 mg of Keppra after each round.
He will continue on his immunosuppressive medications at the doses specified below.
He was discharged on the new regimen of Keppra and Zonisamide.
PENDING STUDIES: None  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: [ ] Please f/u the patient's seizure control on Levetiracetam and Zonisamide as his renal function continues to improve.
He may require higher doses of these anticonvulsants as his renal function from his transplant improves.
[ ] Please check his PTH level as an outpatient and change his cinacalcet dose as needed.
We repleted his phosphorous with Neutra-Phos for a few doses.
[ ] Please make sure that his group home is able to obtain the immunosuppressive/transplant rejection and antiseizure medications (they get the medications filled in a blister pack from his pharmacy).

Through a series of physical examinations, neuroimaging studies and laboratory tests, we were able to determine that the likely reason for these seizures was the fact that one of your seizure medications (valproic acid or depakote) was recently reduced in dose.
We consulted the Renal Transplant service who helped make adjustments to your medications given the changing of your kidney function (which is improving and changing the way your body handles the medications).
It is important that you take this medication as prescribed.
You will take KEPPRA 750 MG TWICE DAILY.
The Renal specialists would like you to take SIROLIMUS at 9 MG DAILY.
The Renal specialists would like you to discontinue CALCIUM ACETATE at this time.
The Renal specialists would like you to take VALGANCYCLOVIR every other day (instead of your prior twice weekly dosing schedule).
The Renal specialists would like you to reduce the dose of LEVOTHYROXINE to 100 MCG each day.
Please take your other medications as previously prescribed and listed on this handout.
