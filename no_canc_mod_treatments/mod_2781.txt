He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2186-9-29**] with stent placement in the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.
No beta blocker was given in light of the patient's sinus bradycardia.
It was felt that this was secondary to difficult hemostasis status post sheath removal after his cardiac catheterization.
In light of this elevation of creatine kinase levels, the patient underwent an ultrasound of his right groin in order to rule out pseudoaneurysm formation.
CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient underwent bilateral carotid Doppler ultrasound on [**2186-9-29**].
A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the patient's head and neck was planned to further evaluate his carotid disease, but this was unable to be obtained secondary to the patient's recent coronary artery stent placement.
The patient was seen by the Vascular Surgery Service regarding his asymptomatic carotid stenosis and was felt not to be a surgical candidate in light of his need to continue Plavix for three months status post carotid artery stent placement.
Therefore, the patient underwent carotid stent placement via a subclavian angiography on [**2186-10-4**].
They performed serial examinations before and after his carotid artery stent placement.
Status post carotid artery stent placement, the patient was monitored in the Coronary Care Unit overnight; specifically, to maintain blood pressure values in the 120 to 150 range in case he needed pressor support.
Overall, the patient tolerated the right internal carotid artery stent placement well with no neurologic events.
His Losartan dose was decreased to 25 mg by mouth once per day in order to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 120 to 150 range.

As reported above, the patient underwent stenting to the mid left anterior descending artery and distal right coronary artery.
The patient also underwent stenting to the right internal coronary artery.
