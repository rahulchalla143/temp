The patient transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on the evening of [**2104-1-3**] with a plan to undergo coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, status post right above the knee amputation, status post repair of an incarcerated umbilical hernia.
MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.25 po q.d., Neurontin 300 mg q.d., Ziac 1.25 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg po q.d., nitroglycerin patch and the patient is also on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2104-1-4**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein to the obtuse marginal and a saphenous vein to the diagonal.
Postoperatively, the patient was on epinephrine, neo-synephrine, nitroglycerin and Propofol intravenous drip.
He was placed on intravenous Amiodarone at that time.
He ultimately was placed on an intravenous Dobutamine drip, remained on Propofol for sedation and was also on insulin and nitroprusside intravenous drips.
He was weaned from mechanical ventilator and ultimately extubated.
Initially he was treated with BiPAP mask, however, his respiratory status did not improve and he was intubated in the evening of postoperative day three and placed on mechanical ventilation.
The next couple of days in the Intensive Care Unit the patient remained intubated and was sedated on intravenous Propofol and was placed on low dose Dobutamine at 3 to 5 mics per kilo per minute.
He was given inhaled bronchodilators through the ventilator circuit.
For this reason it was felt appropriate to proceed with a tracheostomy as well as a PEG feeding tube.
The patient was placed on Levofloxacin for tracheobronchitis questionable pneumonia.
The sputum initially grew out gram negative rods, which turned out to be Moraxella, which was resistant to Ampicillin Penicillin.
The patient was kept on Dobutamine and full mechanical ventilation, intravenous Dilaudid and intravenous Propofol for sedation to tolerate the ventilation.
On [**2104-1-10**] the patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy as well as PEG placement by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Tube feedings were initiated via the PEG and the patient still required full ventilatory support due to marginal oxygenation status.
The patient was started on low dose Lopressor on [**1-12**].
The patient also had intermittent episodes of hypoxia requiring PEEP increased FIO2 on the ventilator.
He was being treated with Levofloxacin for the Moraxella pneumonia.
On the [**1-13**] the patient was restarted on intravenous Dobutamine due to his periods of hypotension and known left ventricular dysfunction.
Over the course of the next few days the patient began to have increased gastrostomy tube output necessitating CAT scan of his abdomen and chest for his distended abdominal examination, increased white count without clear explanation and in ability to tolerate his tube feeds.
General surgery consult was obtained on the [**1-13**] due to continued fever spikes, decreasing level of responsiveness and inability to tolerate tube feeds.
The patient was ultimately started on hyperalimentation since he continued to be intolerant of tube feeds into his stomach via the PEG and remained fully sedated on Fentanyl drip.
The patient had some problems with hyperventilation he was intermittently placed on pressure support, however, became hypoxic and placed back on assist control ventilation mode.
On the [**1-17**] he again required higher FIO2 and higher PEEP due to significant hypoxia with a PO2 in the 60s on full ventilator support.
The patient has been placed on Vancomycin due to staph not yet speciated at that time and was on Ciprofloxacin at that time as well for gram negative rods in his sputum.
He continued to spike fevers despite being on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
He was intermittently responsive, however, he required significant sedation to tolerate his full ventilator support without bucking the ventilator.
Over the course of the next few days to the next week or so the patient was placed on Dopamine drip due to hypotension.
The patient continued to not tolerate tube feeds and was maintained on hyperalimentation.
He remained fully sedated to tolerate complete ventilator support and was making very little progress weaning from the ventilator.
The patient received intermittent blood transfusion with the hope to get him off the pressors to help with blood pressure support.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers over the next two weeks or so and was maintained on hyperalimentation for nutritional support.
He continued to have trouble with abdominal distention, although not a specific reason for him not tolerating tube feeds, nor his abdominal distention.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2104-2-2**] due to worsening respiratory status and increasing need for ventilator support, which he had previously been weaned a little bit in his support.
He remained on Dilaudid and Ativan drips for sedation and Fentanyl patch for pain control.
He was continuing to be treated with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum as well as gram negative for the sputum, which was previously identified at Moraxella.
The patient essentially remained in unchanged status with need for full ventilator support as well as varying doses of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
On [**2104-2-6**] the patient was on Dobutamine at 7.5 mics per kilo per minute, he was on neo-synephrine, Dilaudid and Ativan drip throughout that time.
His Dobutamine was ultimately weaned off without significant change in his blood pressure.
The patient was intermittently given diuretics to maintain adequate urine output.
He was also intermittently transfused packed red blood cells to help with his blood pressure support.
On [**2104-2-7**] the patient went to the Radiology Department where he underwent a conversion of his PEG to a PEG jejunostomy feeding tube.
The family has indicated that it was their wish to have the patient moved to a facility closer to home, since he still remained dependent on vasopressors for blood pressure support, we were unable to have him transferred to a long term chronic ventilator facility or an acute rehabilitation facility with ventilator support and this required his remaining in the Intensive Care Unit.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has spoken with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37360**] [**Name (STitle) **] the patient's primary cardiologist at [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**Location (un) 37361**], [**State 792**]who has agreed to accept this patient in transfer to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center for definitive care and continued support in the Intensive Care Unit.
He is on decreased ventilator support from his previous settings.
Physical examination, the patient remained sedated, intubated and fully ventilated.
He also has a right brachial arteriole line, Foley catheter and a feeding tube.
The patient remains on intravenous Levophed drip at .05 mics per kilo per minute.
Other medications include intravenous Dilaudid drip at 2.5 mg per hour, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Imipenem 500 mg intravenous q 6 hours, Digoxin 0.25 mg per PEG q.d., Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
through the ventilator circuit, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers q 2 hours via ventilator circuit around the clock, Lasix 40 mg intravenous b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg through the G tube q.d., sliding scale regular insulin coverage for blood sugar of 130 to 160 equals 2 units, 161 to 200 equals 4 units, 201 to 250 equals 6 units, 251 to 300 equals 8 units, 301 to 350 equals 10 units and 351 to 400 equals 12 units, subcutaneously greater then 400 to resume on insulin drip.
The patient is on Nystatin powder to effected areas t.i.d.
He has been receiving varying doses of Coumadin to keep him on the low therapeutic side with an INR to 1.5 to 2.0.
His most recent Coumadin dose is 2.5 mg on [**2104-2-7**].
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition remains guarded on full ventilator support, vasopressor support in the Intensive Care Unit to be transferred to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center for continued care in the Intensive Care Unit under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
