Aspirin, Plavix, heparin, and Integrilin were started.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] where catheterization revealed a thrombotic LAD occlusion and the patient underwent CYPHER stent placement.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications on admission included, 1.
Right dominant system, LAD 95 percent proximal with thrombus 60 percent, origin of bifurcating D1 diffusely diseased beyond left circumflex, mid lumen irregularities throughout proximal left circumflex and large OM1, OM2 normal, distal left circumflex 70 percent before small OM3; RCA, mild lumen irregularities and ectasia throughout.
Interventional details include the following: LAD culprit lesion crossed with a 0.14 PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] wire and AngioJet performed x2 passes with good thrombus removal.
Then, proximal LAD was stented with 3.0 x 30 mm CYPHER drug- eluting stent and post dilated with proximal two-third of stent with 3.9 x 9 mm NC ranger at 16 atm.
Mild no flow treated with IC diltiazem and with good response.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Acute anterior MI was managed successfully with primary angioplasty and drug-eluting stent placement.
The patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin, and IV heparin was started after Integrilin finished.
The patient was maintained on beta-blocker and high-dose statin.
By the time of discharge, the patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, Coumadin for apical akinesis, Lopressor, and lisinopril.
For rheumatoid arthritis, the patient's medications were discontinued secondary to his MI.
The case was discussed with his primary rheumatologist and he advised that the patient should be kept off medication for approximately one month.
The patient was maintained on cardiac diet.
The patient was on heparin, Coumadin, and bowel regimen.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Myocardial infarction status post stent to LAD.
The patient is to remain on Coumadin due to akinesis of his heart apex and will need to do the INR checked regularly.
He will also need to remain on Coumadin for four to six months.
The patient is status post cardiac catheterization with PTCA and stent to proximal LAD.
Plavix 75 mg 1 p.o.
Atorvastatin 80 mg 1 p.o.
Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg 1 p.o.
Coumadin 5 mg 1 p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg 1 p.o.
Lisinopril 10 mg 1 p.o.
