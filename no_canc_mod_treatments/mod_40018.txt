Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with severe CAD s/p CABG in [**2097**] and stents to LCX and L-PDA in [**1-/2111**], presenting with NSTEMI s/p balloon angioplasty of LCX for in stent stenosis.
Also with RUQ pain and distended gall bladder on U/S consistent with acalculous cholecystitis s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.
Cardiac cath revealed in-stent stenosis of LCX treated with balloon angioplasty.
ASA, plavix, lisinopril, atorvastatin were provided.
Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] was added and lisinopril was titrated to 30 mg daily.
Patient will likely need follow up for repeat angiography / stenting given inability to place coronary stents during catherization on this admission.
#Systolic Dsyfunction Post cath echo w/ 30% (c/w 35-40% in [**1-/2111**]) also with 3+MR.
Initially was hypoxemic and hypervolemic, however resolved this CHF exacerbation, which was likey precipitated by ischaemia, w/ lasix and afterload reduction w/ hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.
Afterload reduction was converted to metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 20 daily.
Lasix was continued at 20mg PO daily for home dose.
# Abdominal pain Initial RUQ pain and dilated gallbladder on ultrasound were consistent with acute acalculous cholecystitis; given pt was poor operative candidate [**Hospital1 **] recommended IR guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.
Initial wbc, fever, and abdominal pain resolved w/ perc chole tube and Zosyn x 7 days.
chole tube is scheduled to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] in general surgery and will probably be removed approximately 6 wks from discharge.
# Hypoxia During initial 2 days of hospitalization patient was hypoxic and requiring oxygenation with 50% face mask.
Patient has no known history of lung disease, however exam was positive for wheezing which responded to albuterol and atrovent nebulization.
He had been prescribed 70/30 sliding scale [**Hospital1 **] at home.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for tighter DM management while inpatient and recommended 17 units of lantus QHS w/ humalog sliding scale.
For anemia, iron was found to be low at 13, and iron supplementation was initiated.
Given concern for possible myelophthistic process, patient has been scheduled for outpatient heme-onc appointment.
Lisinopril was initially held but restarted and increased to 30 mg daily.
Patient was started on the following medications: ferrous sulfate / iron supplementation, metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], insulin lantus 17 units qhs and sliding scale humalog.
Lisinopril was increased to 30 mg daily.

You had a cardiac catheterization and balloon angioplasty to open up the stent in your artery which was blocked.
A tube was inserted into your gallbladder to drain the bile fluid and relieve the pressure.
You were given an antibiotic for 7 days to treat this.
You will need to follow-up with surgery in [**5-1**] weeks at which time the drain may be pulled.
Please take all medications as directed.
We stopped the following medications: Diovan-HCTZ, nifedical, toprol xl and aldactone.
We changed your insulin from 70/30 to lantus 17 units which you should take at bedtime.
We increased your lisinopril from 20 mg daily to 30 mg daily.
We added metoprolol 50 mg twice daily.
