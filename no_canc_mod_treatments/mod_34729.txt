The patient was evaluated by the GI team, who recommended an outpatient capsule endoscopy study.
Pt received two units of blood in the MICU, and Hct increased from 22 --> 26.
Given multiple endoscopic interventions in the recent past w/out resolution of bleeding, no indication for therapeutic intervention at present.
Considering the work-up for GI bleed, teh patient's lisinopril, torsemide, nitroglycerine and beta blocker were all held initially, and slowly added back to her medication regimen, as we did not want this patient to go into CHF, and she was clinically stable.
# CAD: Patient is s/p CABG and PCI for stenosed grafts.
However, similar changes were seen in EKG from yesterday's office visit.
We kept the patient on ASA and statin, and replenished blood volume with 2 units of pRBCs in the MICU.
# CHF w/ 4+ MR: Patient has previously been scheduled twice for CABG w/ MVR but unable to undergo procedure.
We initially held antihypertensive and diuretic medications given GI bleed, and gradually reintroduced, without ill effect.
We continued home dig 0.125mg PO QOD.
Continued ursodiol and allopurinol.
continued home levothyroxine .
continued home sertraline .
continued home pravastatin  ======================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ======================== 1.
