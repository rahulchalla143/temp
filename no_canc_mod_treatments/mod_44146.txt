With fluid resuscitation, BP's gradually increased from 60's to 80 systolic, but then dropped to 68/42, prompting initiation of dopamine gtt.
HR remained in 70's until initiation of dopamine gtt, then increased to 90's.
Prior to transfer, he received ASA 162 mg, hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, and gentamycin 150 mg IV, and dopamine gtt titrated up to 8 mcg/kg/hour for target SBP >100.
On arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 97.8, HR 83, BP 75/38, RR 18, SpO2 100% on 3L NC O2.
He received cefepime 2 grams IV and morphine 4 mg IV for 6 out of 10 pain in his fingers.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old man with history of end stage renal disease secondary to amyloidosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes on insulin admitted to the MICU for hypotension and lethargy in the context of having the transformer set changed of his peritoneal dialysis catheter.
Family contact and decision made not to progressive with aggressive intervention for diagnosis (i.e.
no MRI, no intubation for imaging, no LP).
Etiology thought to be secondary to sepsis, ?meningitis for which he was covered empirically with cefepime/vancomycin and also with acyclovir.
Additional etiology ?recent hypoglycemia, pt on IVF with dextrose.
Despite continued broad spectrum antimicrobials and continued dialysis sessions and treatment of transient hypoglycemia, pt's mental status never improved and he was not reactive even to sternal rub.
On [**2135-7-6**], after meeting with pt's girlfriend, HCP, and after discussion with patient's family, decision was made to change the patient's status to CMO.
Pt was then placed on a morphine gtt and he passed away on [**2135-7-7**] at 6am.
# Hypotension: The initial differential included distributive shock due to infection vs. endocrine vs. cardiogenic.
Given his history of line infections and bacteremia and recent violation of sterile PD catheter field, infectious etiology was considered most likely.
He was started on vanc/cefepime as patient has h/o colonization with both MRSA, pseudomonas.
An attempt was made to obtain peritoneal fluid for cell count, cultures.
He was on a dopamine gtt titrated to MAP > 65, also received fluids at the OSH ([**Location (un) **]) and in the ED.
His dopamine was titrated off and he was transferred to the medical floor where his blood pressures were stable, however his mental status rapidly deteriorated.
# ESRD: The patient has been on dialysis secondary to amyloid, currently on HD with plan for transition to PD.
He is status post peritoneal dialysis catheter placement [**6-10**], needs 2-3 weeks to heal prior to use.
He was continued on his sevelamer at an increased dose secondary to hyperphospetemia, cinecalcet.
HD sessions were continued until [**2135-7-6**] and the renal team was very involved with the patient's care.
He generally receives oxycodone PRN pain  # Thrombosis: The patient has known extensive inferior vena cava clot burden to level of right atrium and likely involvement of superior vena cava.
There is a high degree of risk associated with anticoagulation in this patient related to history of hemodynamically signficant epistaxis, recurrent epistaxis, and hemoptysis related to fungal lesion in left upper lobed of the lung.
The risks/benefits of anticoagulation have been discussed at length during previous hospitalization, with decision not to anticoagulate.
His beta blocker was originally held in the setting of his hypotension.
# Sarcoidosis: The patient was on chronic prednisone.
# Pulmonary aspergillosis: The patient was continued on his chronic suppressive voriconazole.
