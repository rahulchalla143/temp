He has a history of peripheral neuropathy, kidney transplantation in [**2128**] secondary to diabetic nephropathy, as well as throat cancer in [**2129**] treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation.
Therefore, he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees; blood pressure 145/80; pulse 60; respiratory rate 10; 100% on a non-rebreather.
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask.
Interoperatively, he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate, although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively.
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement.
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume.
He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day.
He was transferred to Medicine the morning of [**2136-6-11**], for continued medical management post surgery.
His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued; those included Temocillin, Nortriptyline, Haldol, Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, and Gabapentin.
Hypo or hyperglycemia:  [**Last Name (un) **] had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control.
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on [**6-12**].
The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event.
Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n.
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd.
Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function, due to his renal transplant in [**2128**].
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4; he has a baseline renal insufficiency.
With this in mind, when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option.
While the patient was in restraints, gentle hydration was initiated since p.o.
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed [**2136-6-8**].
