Antimicrobial coverage for his leg wound was initially covered by vancomycin and was transitioned to cefazolin on [**1-31**].
Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated the patient.
He was given a multi-podus boot and later fitted for an AFO for LLE foot drop.
On [**2-10**] the pt returned to the OR for improved coverage of his leg wound with a medial gastrocnemius flap covered with a split thickness skin graft measuring 35 x 15 cm.
[**1-/2039**] Lovenox was started for anticoagulation.
