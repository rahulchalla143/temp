She was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further management and possible cardiac catheterization.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2105**] with left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus, obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary artery.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Glucophage 1000 mg po b.i.d.
Zestril 10 mg po q.d.
Lopresor 12.5 mg po q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg po q.h.s.
Synthroid 100 micrograms po q.d.
NPH insulin 26 units subQ q.p.m.
Zalatan 0.005% eye drops.
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports allergies to Naprosyn, sulfa, Biaxin and Clindamycin.
Blood pressure 135/98 with an oxygen saturation of 81% on room air and 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Cardiac catheterization showed a proximal 100% left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, left circumflex was 70% proximal 100% mid occlusions, right coronary artery with 100% proximal and patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal grafts, 70% left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to ramus and posterior descending coronary artery totally occluded.
Her right sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with a right atrial pressure of 97/20, right ventricular 98/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 and 45 mm peak to peak pressure.
Her aortic valve area was measured as .55 cm square.
She was subsequently given 120 cc of intravenous Lasix in the catheterization laboratory and received a total of 276 cc of contrast during this cardiac catheterization.
Given these catheterization results it was decided that the patient may benefit from an aortic valve replacement with an accompanying coronary artery bypass graft.
As such Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] of CT Surgery was consulted.
As part of her surgical evaluation a copy of her CT scan from the outside hospital was obtained, which showed 1 to 2 cm hilar and peritracheal adenopathy.
This scan was reviewed with the Pulmonary Service who performed lymph node biopsy and bronchoscopy.
This biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells and instead showed a hypocellular specimen with a few group of bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes, red blood cells and neutrophils.
The patient also has a known anemia, which may be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency and required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization.
At that time it is expected that after checking a repeat chem 7 and her renal function that a number of her medications that were held secondary to her renal failure will be able to be reinstituted.
These medications include her ace inhibitor, Digoxin and diuretic.

Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d.
Tums 500 mg po t.i.d.
