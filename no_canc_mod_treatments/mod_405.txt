CT abdomen/pelvis showed massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis.
Post hemodialysis, patient was transferred to the Medicine Service, where his lisinorpil, hydrochlorothiazide, [**Hospital1 **], and metformin were stopped, in lieu of kidney injury.
During his time on the Medicine Service, he was given antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection, provided electrolyte supplementation and fluids, provided a diabetic diet, and monitored for improvement of uremic symptoms, kidney function, and acid-base status.
Per urology recommendations, the patient was continued with a foley catheter throughout the stay, with the plan of removing the foley 5 days after discharge and following up with urology.
Foley catheter was placed to relieve the obstruction and patient's creatinine trended down from 27.4 on presentation to 1.2 on discharge.
Following relief of the obstruction, patient's fluid balance was matched with 1/2NS given post-obstructive diuresis which slowed prior to discharge.
Foley catheter was left in place to be removed as outpatient with PCP and urology followup.
Lisinopril and HCTZ were held until renal function improved.
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a lactic acidosis in the setting of renal failure and metformin use.
Metformin was held and renal abnormalities were corrected.
He underwent one episode of HD while his kidneys recovered.
Uremic Encephalopathy: Patient remained oriented to time and person throughout his hospital stay but lost orientation to place for 2 days following correction of uremia.
Thiamine and folate supplementation were given if there was an aspect of unknown alcoholism, but ultimately correction of patient's renal abnormalities and monitoring led to patient's recovery of orientation and less less confusion.
Simvastatin had been on hold since two days prior, and CK-MB and troponin were negative.
Ultimately the cause was supected to be mild rhabdomyolysis from hypophosphatemia, and CPK was downtrending on discharge with phosphate repletion and fluids.
Simvastatin decided to be re-started as an outpatient.
Diabetes: The patient's glipizide and metformin were held thoroughout the stay, and the patient was continued on Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
Lisinopril and HCTZ were held throughout the stay.
Transitions in Care: Patient is discharged with foley catheter in place and should have this removed with voiding trial by his PCP.
Patient should keep his f/u appointment with urologist for evaluation of his prostate, and opiates and anticholinergic meds should be avoided until prostate health is managed.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were retaining urine in the bladder and your kidneys were injured.
The obstruction seems to be a combination of enlarged prostate and use of pain medications with opiates.
This caused abnormalities in your blood chemistry which required urgent dialysis.
STOP taking tylenol with codeine 2.
STOP taking cyclobenzaprine 4.
START taking Lisinopril 20mg once daily by mouth.
Please take all other medications as previously prescribed to you.
