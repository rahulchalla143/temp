Patient has a prolonged history of VT starting in [**2161**] with monomorphic VT and s/p ICD placement then.
He has been previously treated for his afib with amiodarone however developed transaminitis and therefore was switched to dofetilide.
He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient who recommended a trial of VT ablation in the cath lab.
His course was complicated by poor LV function in the cath lab and required placement of an Impella.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: #CAD s/p AMI and IMI (remote) #Ischemic systolic heart failure with EF of 25% ([**1-/2168**]) #Moderate MR #Atrial Fibrillation- has been trialed on amiodarone however failed [**1-25**] transaminitis, currently on dofetilide #Ventricular tachycardia- diagnosed in [**2161**] with monomorphic VT with R axis at cycle length of 340msec.
[**2170-3-25**] ED visit for monomorphic VT at a rate of 188 beats per minute that failed to terminate with two ATP therapies and required an ICD shock #s/p Dual chamber ICD placed ([**Company 2267**]) in [**2161**] and generator replaced in [**2164**] #PTSD from ICD shocks #Diabetes Mellitus #HTN #HLP #Gout #GAVE- with GI bleed in [**3-/2170**] s/p cauterization  Social History: Spanish speaking.
Inserted a 6 French Sheath and using a "Preclose Technique" two Perclose AT devices were deployed without complication after an initial Perclose needles did not capture.
The catheter was then used to exchange for the 0.18" Abiomed Impella delivery wire with an appropriate curve to avoid trauma to the LV Apex.
The patient tolerated the procedures including Impella removal, without complication.

He transiently had an Impella device placed during the VT ablation of his inferior wall scar.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring.
He underwent ICD implantation in [**2161**] and he has been shocked multiple times over the years with post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result.
He underwent ablation of these tracts in the EP lab on [**2170-6-5**] with transient use of Impella device.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.
Dofetilide was restarted on transfer at home dose 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and patient was noted to be comfortable and appropriately atrially paced throughout his stay.
We continued valsartan 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], carvedilol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and atorvastatin 40mg daily.
He is not on antiplatelet therapy due to history of GIB.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Due to CAD as above, last LVEF 30% in [**2167**], and he is s/p ICD placement in [**2161**].
We continued his valsartan 80mg [**Hospital1 **], carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], lasix 40mg daily and spironolactone 25mg daily.
# Afib:  Continued patient's dofetilide and carvedilol.
Warfarin was held prior to ablation, and was restarted following procedure.
# HLD: Continued atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
# Diabetes: on metformin at home, A1c consistently in the 7s.
Metformin was held during stay and insulin sliding scale was used.
He was restarted on metformin on discharge.
