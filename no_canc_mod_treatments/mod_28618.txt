Pt received Valium via a CIWA scale protocol q 2hours in the unit and he did not seize.
Due to his PCN allergy he was started on Vancomycin and underwent PICC placement on HD #4.
The source of the patient's bacteremia was never identified as he had a negative torso CT, negative CXR, negative U/A and Cx, negative TTE as well as aspiration of anterior leg fluctuance which revealed no pus.
Pt apparently had a PICC line at OSH prior to coming here and that IV is a possible source of his bacteremia.
He was slated to continue his PICC line for either a 2 week or 6 week total course of Vancomycin.
remained adamant about leaving, and thus his PICC line was removed and he was allowed to leave.
He was strongly encouraged to return to the hospital as soon as possible to continue his antibiotic course.
