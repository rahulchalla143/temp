He was briefly on Propofol which was turned off at 11:45 am, and he was extubated at 12 pm.
EPILEPSY (as per Dr[**Name (NI) 7029**] most recent note in OMR): AED / other therapy trials (include VNS, surgery):  Dilantin and Tegretol caused rash; Depakote and Lamictal more recently did not improve seizure control.

Toes downgoing bilaterally  Gait and coordination could not be assessed, as he is too drowsy and uncooperative.
MRI is more sensitive for detection of intracranial masses.
The increase in frequency of his seizures could be multifactorial, such as alcohol dependence or metabolic/infectious exacerbation but most likely poor compliance with his medications given report per Mom and past hx.
Pt had been off medications and then started tapering up zonegran in the days prior to admission.
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] on [**4-3**] where he was initially intubated and loaded with IV Keppra (20mg/kg).
He was continued on Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **].
On [**2166-4-6**] Patient removed all EEG leads, and they were replaced in the next day.
Prior to removal on one occasion he was found to have a lot of increased seizure activity which was felt to cause or contribute to his agitation.
He was treated with standing ativan while tapering AEDs for seizure control, but he still required prn ativan for increased seizures or agitation on occasion.
Multiple code purples occured to the point of requiring IM haldol 5mg and 3mg ativan on one occasion.
He was started on rufinamide 400mg and tapered up to his current dose of 800mg over 3 days with plans to taper up further after discharge.
Pt expressed concern that the medication was making him more emotional but this was compounded by his strong desire to be discharged.
We also discussed the importance of not stopping his medications without supervision by his epileptologist and that this would put him at high risk of seizures and status epilepticus.
Although he was not considered to be at an ideal seizure control for discharge, it was decided to let him go home with rufinamide up taper and ativan wean at home, after long discussion with the patient and his mother.
