The patient had a recent admission to the same OSH from [**Date range (1) 23977**] for increasing dyspnea and was treated for a CHF and COPD exacerbation, as well as a RLL PNA.
Hemoptysis was thought to be secondary to pneumonia (possibly staph) and patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
diagnosed in [**2172**], T2N0, s/p MRM and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment.
Given the immune- suppressed status of the patient following chemotherapy, atypical organism should be considered including fungal organisms (Aspergillus and mucormycosis), although the appearance is not specific for a particular organism.
[**10-31**] CXR (AP port): (preliminary read) UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  The patient is status post removal of the right pleural drain and a right PICC.
[**10-8**] Pulmonary Artery Embolization: IMPRESSION: 1.
- G stain: no org, cx neg, no growth - Viral cx neg to date - Fungal cx neg [**10-16**] galactomannan pending [**10-18**] pleural fluid: - HSV PCR neg for 1 and 2 - G stain: no polys, no mircoorg, no growth - fungal cx pending - AFB: smear neg, cx pending - viral cx neg [**10-19**] galactomannan neg.
Note: No fungi or bacteria are identified in GMS and Brown-Brenn stained sections.
Immunohistochemical stains show cells lining fibrous septae to be positive for cytokeratin MNF116 and negative for calretinin and D2-40, consistent with type II pneumocytes.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was continued on antibiotics and bronchodilators.
Bronchial artery embolization was performed on [**10-8**] and was unsuccessful as no definite arteries to LLL could be identified.
He was transferred to MICU where he responded to treatment with Lasix diuresis, nebulizers, and IV antibiotics (changed vanc/ ceftriaxone to vanc/ zosyn on [**10-8**]) for ?PNA and superinfected bulla.
Admission sputum cultures were negative (OP flora), but the patient was continued on vancomycin and zosyn, as above.
On [**10-12**] BAL cultures returned as positive for aspergillus fumigatus (sparse growth) HSV-1 (by fluorescent antibody testing) and the patient was started on voriconazole and acyclovir.
Galactomannan, B-glucan, and histoplasma Ag were sent and returned negative.
Aspergillus fumigatus was thought to possibly be a contaminent as amount of growth was sparse in all cultures and the fact that presentation and imaging was not consistent with classic picture; however, the family adamantly refused VATS to obtain tissue diagnosis of masses.
On [**10-18**] the patient underwent a right-sided thoracentesis in which 1.3L were removed to attempt to obtain further tissue diagnosis/ culture data with negative results.
A catheter was left in the R pleural space for an anticipated cyst FNA, but the patient's family declined this.
The catheter was removed on [**10-31**] with no evidence of pneumothorax on CXR.
Throughout the admission, the patient complained of dyspnea with minimal exertion, which only improved after bilateral thoracenteses on [**10-25**].
Lung exam showed minimal improvement on antimicrobial therapy, with significantly decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally.
Leukocytosis resolved on antibiotic treatment alone.
In consultation with Infectious Disease, the patient was treated with an empiric course of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
He completed a course of 14 days of acyclovir treatment for HSV-1 (completed [**10-27**]), 30 days of voriconazole for aspergillus, and augmentin (switched from cefepime on [**10-21**], last day of treatment [**10-31**]).
However, the patient's creatinine began to increase after thoracentesis (1.3L removed) and restarting diuretics [**10-19**].
Diuretics were initially held in attempt to maintain intravascular volume status, but were later re-introduced as BP allowed.
The R pleural catheter was left in place from [**10-25**] - [**10-31**] with continued serous drainage.
# Pulmonary thrombosis: The patient was diagnosed with a nonobstructing thrombus in L descending pulmonary artery upon admission, which was not treated with anticoagulation given symptoms of hemoptysis.
The patient was continued on lopressor for CAD and rate control.
ASA was held given hemoptysis and can be re-started upon resolution of hemoptysis.
He had increasing peripheral edema on exam in response to holding diuretics to maintain adequate hydration for IV acyclovir.
He was given [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings during admission, and diuretics were restarted with mild decrease in dependent edema.
A foley catheter was placed during admission due to concern for obstruction, but was removed prior to admission.
# Access: A PICC line was placed in the RUE for access; however on [**10-28**] the arm was noted to be erythematous and swollen.
The PICC line was pulled without any anti-coagulation given presentation of hemoptysis and risk for further re-bleeding.
Workup has been negative and the patient continues to decline despite broad-spectrum treatment for possible infectious etiologies.
Medications on Admission: lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **] Protonix 40 promethazine w/ codeine 5ml q6h terazosin 2mg qhs mg-hydroxide qd albuterol fluticasone prednisone 20 daily on taper ceftriaxone 1g daily [**10-2**] vancomycin 1g daily [**10-2**] .
It appears that you have a pneumonia, and you have been given broad-spectrum antibiotics for this.
You must finish augmentin and voriconazole as prescribed.
Please take your medications as prescribed.
