Prev study on [**2156-2-11**] showed LVEF 20-25%)  While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was initially given lasix boluses, and was later started on a Lasix drip on [**2156-7-5**].
The patient diuresed 914ccs [**2155-7-6**] PM after stopping lasix gtt.
However, she still complained of SOB, so RHC with Swan Ganz was performed to assess volume status.
The patient tolerated the R heart cath well.
Given her elevated pressures despite Lasix and in the setting of a creatinine increase and low EF, the patient was transferred to the CCU for initiation of milrinone and IV Lasix.
Of note, while on [**Hospital1 1516**], the patient was also started on amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: CABG x4(LIMA->LAD, svg->OM1,svg-Y-graft->diag, svg->pda)  [**2156-1-19**] -Atrial Fibrillation 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: H pylori Back pain Osteopenia Pancreatic cyst AAA s/p endovascular repair [**2151-5-20**]   Social History: She exercises three times a week at her adult day center.
The cardiac index was notably depressed on 2L supplemental oxygen (with an assumed oxygen consumption) of 1.58  l/min/m2.
Right internal jugular swan [**Last Name (un) **] catheter was sutured to the neck for additional pressure measurements during hospitalization.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] is 75F with history of CAD s/p STEMI, CABG in [**12/2155**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG Y-graft-diag, SVG-PDA), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), most recent estimate at 10% who initially presented with dyspnea on exertion for the last one month and chest pain for 2-3 days prior to presentation.
She was transferred to the CCU for initiation of milrinone and Lasix drip.
Her milrinone was replaced with dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min, which was up-titrated to 7mcg/kg/min.
Her afterload was reduced was increasing doses of captopril, which allowed for reduction of her dobutamine dose to 5 mcg/kg/min.
Patient was discharged on the following mediations for her CHF: dobutamine drip, lisinopril 5mg, Dig .125 every other day, torsemide 40mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg daily, imdur 60 mg daily  # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: since CABG 1/[**2155**].
Her coumadin was initially held given the need for catherization and central line placement.
On [**7-10**], her coumadin was restarted with a heparin bridge.
Pt was also on amiodarone for Afib and will continue this medication upon discharge.
Because her INR was subtherapeutic we will discharge the patient on warfarin 7.5 mg daily with close follow up.
Began to develop after Cr normalized s/p easing of diuretic regimen.
#Code status: Patient was DNR/DNI at one point during hospitilization and then changed her mind to FULL CODE.
# DYSLIPIDEMIA: The patient's statin was continued while in hospital.
