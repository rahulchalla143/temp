#Asthma exacerbation: Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for monitoring and treatment of her asthma exacerbation.
She received continuous albuterol nebs, as well as additional magnesium, Atrovent, Advair, and IV Solumedrol.
Given her persistent hypoxia on ICU day 2, Azithromycin was added for atypical coverage and she completed a 5 day course while in the hospital.
An arterial line was placed for monitoring.
She clinically improved and oxygen was able to be weaned to room air (93%), but the patient was sypmtomatically more comfortable on a 35% humidified face tent.
She was transferred to the floor on [**2114-9-2**], and transitioned to oral prednisone.
She was continued on a 2 week prednisone taper as follows: 60 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29491**],completed), 50 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 22564**], completed), 40 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29492**]), 30 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 8967**]), 20 mg x3 days ([**Date range (1) 29493**]), then off.)
She was tapered off of standing albuterol nebs and discharged on q6H PRN with a machine at home (SW instrumental in helping her get this at no cost).
She received 10 days of IV ampicillin while in house.
She received Ibuprofen/Tylenol for soft tissue trauma/pain to her frontal head, R knee.
She was kept on fall precautions and was not given sleeping medication at night thereafter.
#Anxiety: She takes high doses of valium daily as outpatient, and was tolerating ativan here.
