Intra-aortic balloon pump placement 2.
Cardiac catheterization with left main coronary artery bare metal stent placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79-year-old male with history of prior CVA, hypertension, cirrhosis and prior NSTEMI which was treated medically in [**2136-10-24**] who presents now as a transfer from OSH with a new NSTEMI.
After admission, the patient was observed on telemetry in preparation for a cardiac catheterization.
He was given ongoing therapy with [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin, beta-blocker, and IV heparin.
Overnight, he triggered for hypotension and was given fluid bolus of 500cc x2.
He remained chest pain free initially but had recurrent chest pain in the early morning hours requiring IV morphine.
The RCA was totally occluded proximally with faint left-right collaterals.
Ultimately, the patient underwent stent placement on [**2136-11-2**] with stent placed across LAD to distal left main coronary artery.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension Cardiac History: NSTEMI Prior percutaneous coronary intervention: none Pacemaker/ICD:None  Social History: The patient lives in [**Location **] and is dependent in ADL's and IADL's and is cognitively very intact.
RRR, balloon pump on 1:1.
Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.0x15mm Vision stent in the distal LMCA and origin LAD were performed.
The stent was postdilated proximally using a 4.5x8mm Quantum Maverick balloon and distally using a 3.5x12mm Quantum Maverick balloon.
Left femoral arteriotomy closure was performed using an 8 French Angioseal VIP.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:PTCA and placement of a bare-metal stent in the distal LMCA to origin LAD.
non-transmural inferior wall perfusion defect on post-stress images.

The patient was treated as an NSTEMI protocol with heparin, [**Year (4 digits) **], [**Year (4 digits) 4532**] load and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Patient continued [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin and heparin therapy.
Patient's beta blocker held in the setting of severe cardiogenic shock on admission to CCU.
Admission TTE/ECHO [**2136-11-1**] showed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) and Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was stabilized with the assistance of a intra-aortic balloon pump to help augment BP.
The patient was initially placed on IABP 1:1 and gentle diuresis was given with lasix.
Diagnostic coronary angiography showed 2 vessel and left main coronary artery disease as patient was found to have 90% L-main occlusion.
He underwent PTCA and placement of a bare-metal stent in the distal LMCA to origin of LAD and recovered well with no notable complications post-procedure.
The patient had initial elevation in BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 79816**] given his acute NSTEMI and CHF with poor cardiac output.
He received post catheterization diuresis with Lasix and his CXRs showed improvement in his pulmonary edema throughout his hospital course.
RHYTHM : The patient was monitored throughout his stay and per telemetry he remained predominantly in normal sinus rhythm after his PCI procedure with very limited PVCs.
Thus, he was started on IV heparin and bridged while starting coumadin therapy to reduce his risk of thrombus and CVAs.
At time of discharge the patient's INR was slightly supratherapeutic at 3.5 and his evening warfarin dose was held prior to his discharge.
He was given mucomyst pre and post-procedure and IVFs were given sparingly due to the patient's CHF/cardiogenic shock.
He had no appreciable RUQ tenderness, jaundice, HSM on exam and he will plan to follow-up with his usual PCP after discharge regarding his GI management.
RECENT PNA : The patient was noted to have had a fever at OSH and he had recently completed treatment for PNA.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: On [**2136-11-5**] the patient had a routine UA which revealed bacteria and WBCs and labs were consistent with a UTI so he was started on Doxycycline for a 7 day regimen.
FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES: The patients magnesium and potassium were repleted on an as needed basis during his hospital stay and daily electrolytes were monitored.
He was started on a full cardiac diet once he stabilized and he did very well with his oral input and had a good appetite.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was on anticoagulation for NSTEMI and thrombus coverage in the setting of his hypokinetic heart and was therefore covered for DVT prophylaxis as well.
He was also given 40mg PO daily Protonix for GI prophylaxis.
Medications on Admission: Home Medications on arrival: Reglaid Flonase Sudafed Celexa Colchine [**Date Range **] Lopressor Allopurinol Aricept Recently completed levaquin for PNA  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 37**] House Rehab & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Urinary Tract Infection Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Stable Creat: 1.6 BUN: 47 K: 4.2 Hct: 27.9 Stage 1 sacral ulcer   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and required a bare metal stent to open one of your heart arteries.
Continue doxycycline for 3 remaining days of therapy for a urinary tract infection and continue daily Warfarin as prescribed to avoid blood clots and to decrease stroke risk.
