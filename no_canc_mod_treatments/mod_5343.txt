His chest pain resolved after the administration of tenecteplase with some improvement of ST segment elevations on EKG.
Intravenous nitroglycerin drip was increased and his chest pain again resolved.
His Lopressor dosage was increased to 25 mg p.o.
and an Integrilin drip was added to his regimen.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for failed lytic therapy after acute myocardial infarction as an indication for cardiac catheterization.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included allopurinol, Prilosec, albuterol, theophylline, aspirin, Atrovent, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Integrilin drip on transfer, Prevacid, IV nitroglycerin drip on transfer.
Chemistry on admission revealed sodium of 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 101, bicarbonate 30, BUN 14, creatinine 1.4.
The second set eight hours later CPK was 110, MB positive at 15.6 with troponin of 5.4.
EKG #2 post lysis administration of TNK revealed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with 0.5 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3 and aVF with T wave inversions in leads 2, 3 and aVF.
RCA was dominant with proximal 90% stenosis and mid-vessel 70% stenosis.
The proximal RCA was treated with successful direct stenting.
The mid-RCA lesion was also treated with direct stenting.
The LAD lesions were not intervened upon at this time due to the intervention that was performed on the RCA already.
The patient was discharged to the coronary care unit for monitoring overnight with the understanding that he would go back to the cath lab in one to two days after stabilization from his current IMI to receive further stenting of the LAD.
The patient was given Solu-Medrol intravenously and 50 mg of intravenous Benadryl.
The patient had altered mental status with drowsiness and lethargy after receiving intravenous Benadryl.
There was a concern for CNS bleeding as the patient was status post lytic therapy at the outside hospital with altered mental status status post cardiac catheterization.
The patient was maintained on Integrilin drip and was given oral                                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2053**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2052**], M.D.
