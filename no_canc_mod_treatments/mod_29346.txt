She was initially not started on antibiotics.
She was given a standing IVF order.
She was started on stress dose steroids and levo,flagyl, and vanco.
She was given 4L of fluid boluses and transfered to the MICU.
The above treatments were continued.
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course, antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone, and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation.
On recommendation from endocrine, her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 (higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms.).
She was started on stress dose steroids.
She had cultures drawn, was given tylenol (tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative, as was a urine tox), was started on levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia, GI sources, and a potential hip infection.
A line could not be placed for technical reasons, however after 4L NS on the floor and [**2-2**] more in the ICU via peripheral IV's she was stable.
She remained hemodynamically stable with good UOP in the setting of being started on abx and stress dose steroids.
The patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone/fludrocortisone dose.
calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate, calcitriol.
The pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge.
These were initially continued as above and later, when she became hypotensive and febrile, stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone.
On recommendation from endocrine, her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 (higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms.).
She was continued on her prior dose of steroids with sliding scale per patient using a 1:15 carb counting scheme with a 1:30 correction factor.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and the pt was reassured.
The pt uses a wheelchair often at baseline due to pain from arthritis.
Depression:  The pt was being treated at [**Hospital1 **] 4 for suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt on original admission with tylenol and oxycodone.
As a result, she was maintained on her ativan, mirtazapine, risperidone, duloxetine.
The patient did have heparin subcutaneously while on the medical floor and in the ICU.
