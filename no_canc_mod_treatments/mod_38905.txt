Brief Hospital Course: Chronologic course:  The patient is a 63 year-old woman with Goodpasture's disease (diagnosed [**3-/2119**]) s/p plasmapheresis on prednisone and cytoxan, who initially presented to OSH with nausea and vomiting, found to have bilateral DVTs, and subsequently developed progressive dyspnea and hypotension prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
She required pressors temporarily at the OSH, but pressors were stopped prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
She was started on Vancomycin and Meropenem (latter switched to Cefepime) and a Heparin drip for DVT treatment.
On [**2119-7-15**], she developed Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was given IV metoprolol without response, followed by Amiodarone bolus and drip with conversion to sinus rhythm.
She was started on oral Amiodarone on [**2119-7-18**].
She was seen by Hematology and was subsequently started on Filgastrim on [**2119-7-15**].
She was continued on vancomycin + cefepime for 8 days for her pneumonia until [**2119-7-21**].
At presentation, she was being treated with cytoxan and prednisone.
Cytoxan was discontinued given pancytopenia.
The patient was continued prednisone 60 mg daily, but downtitrated to 50 mg on [**2119-7-27**].
She was started on azothioprine 75 mg daily in hospital on [**7-27**].
Plan is to treat with azothioprine for 3 months (managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to prevent renal progression and to prevent pulmonary disease.
Prednisone will be tappered off over the next few months as discussed in emails between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Weekly labs should be collected to monitor LFTs and CBC.
HD catheter replacement was performed on [**2119-7-20**].
Given pressors briefly at OSH.
Treated with vancomycin and cefepime for 8 days with resolution of symptoms.
# Neutropenia: WBC nadir at 0.1 on [**2119-7-18**], likely secondary to Cytoxan and sepsis.
Now on azothiprine and will need weekly CBC to assess for bone marrow suppression.
Bactrim prophylaxis was held during admission and will need to be re-started once counts stable.
# DVT/PE: Started on heparin drip in hospital for DVT and PE (diagnosed by CTA) with goal PTT 60-100.
Once patient is greater than 2.0 for 2 days, Heparin can be stopped.
Coumadin therapy should be continued for at least 6 months with the first day being [**2119-7-18**].
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: On [**7-15**], in ICU pt had episode of A fib with RVR that responded poorly to beta-blockers/calcium channel blockers due to hypotension but later resolved with IV Amiodarone.
After another episode of A fib following discontinuation of Amiodarone, she was started on oral amiodarone therapy.
The plan defined by Cardiology is a tapered course of Amiodarone starting at 200 mg TID for 3 weeks, then 200 mg daily until Cardiology follow-up at 4 weeks.
One unit pRBC transfusion was given at HD prior to discharge.
Interventional Radiology believed that the HD catheter was in proper position and is unlikely to explain the patient's chest pain.
She improved with Afrin and manual compression.
Bleeding likely from a combination of dryness and thrombocytopenia.
# Positive C. diff result: On [**2119-7-27**] found to be positive for C. diff, however no treatment was initiated bacause the patient was asymptomatic.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  - Amiodarone taper as above and follow-up with Cardiology for further management of atrial fibrillation.
- Needs to continue IV Heparin bridge to Coumadin.
Once INR [**3-17**] for 2 days, can stop Heparin and continue coumadin for 6 months.
Outpatient coumadin management has NOT yet been arranged but will need to be done before patient leaves for home.
- Will be tapered off steroids over several months by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and continued on Azathioprine 75mg for 2-3 months.
- Pulmonology follow-up and repeat CT chest have been arranged for abnormal CT finding.
- Will need to determine need to re-start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, which was stopped in setting of bone marrow suppression.
