He was treated with vancomycin, dosed for level<15.
Pt continued to be in ARF, despite R ureteral stent placement and L percutaneous nephrostomy.
His meds were renally dosed during this time.
Pt was extubated on [**2123-6-19**], and tolerated extubation well.
Pt was restarted on metoprolol and norvasc, but his ACEI and Lasix continued to be held.
He was continued on ASA and Plavix during his MICU stay.
Pt was maintained nutritionally by tube feeds while intubated, but began to have thickened liquids after extubation.
He underwent left percutaneous nephrostomy and placement of right stent.
He was also found to have MRSA UTI and is being treated with vancomycin.
Despite nephrostomy tube placement and stent, pt continued to have renal failure.
Given his septic wrist, he needs to continue vancomycin for a total 4 week course(start date [**2123-6-14**]) with daily vanc troughs checked given his ARF.
Septic wrist- S/P surgical irrigation and debridement.
[**6-19**] Wound catheter tip negative.
Respiratory failure- pt intubated during surgery and could not be extubated until [**2123-6-19**].
