He was treated with an extended prednisone taper and increasing his home Lasix dose.
The patient reports that his last dose of prednisone was the day prior to this admission.
He had been started on high dose prednisone at the end of [**2185-5-15**].
He reports that this current flare of his dyspnea started at the end of [**Month (only) 547**] at which point he was started on prednisone and he has never really returned to his baseline since that time.
Otherwise, he does not have sick contacts and his weights have been stable.
He was initially placed on a non-rebreather which raised his oxygen saturation to the 90s.
He did well on non-rebreather, but was eventually found to be tachypneic and was placed on biPAP.
He was then graduated to a face mask and eventually back down to his home nasal cannula at 5L.
He was initially given nitroglycerin and aspirin to rule out if he had any component of ACS.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Brief Hospital Course: MR [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 76 year old male with PMH of stage II COPD with an FEV1 consistently in the low 60s on 3-5L of home O2, pulmonary HTN with estimated pulmonary pressures of 84 mm Hg on recent ECHO [**6-25**], secondary polycythemia, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, diastolic congestive heart failure, and HTN, recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for 4 days in mid-[**2185-6-14**] for dyspnea deemed to be related to a COPD/diastolic CHF exacerbation, now re-presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia initially requiring biPAP initiation in the emergency room.
Recent evaluation of chronic hypoxia revealed chest CT with possible TBM, small airways disease, and several pulmonary nodules, and ECHO with worsening pulmonary artery hypertension with estimated pressure of 84 mm Hg from 51 mm Hg in [**10-24**].
He was started on a trial of sildenafil at 20 mg TID and this was communicated to his pulmonary MD, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was continued on oxygen therapy at 6L nc.
He was continue on his previous COPD regimen including tiotropium, advair, and albuterol inhalers.
Held home furosemide initially, but this was restarted at home dose 20 mg qday prior to discharge.
Continued home CPAP at night.
Transitional Issues: - titration of sildenafil - pulmonary rehab  Medications on Admission: -Advair 250-50 mcg/dose 1 puff [**Hospital1 **].
-Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily.
-Albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
-Furosemide 20 mg once a day.
-Prednisone 20 mg daily.

We also performed a right heart catheterization, which showed pulmonary hypertension that might be responsive to a medication called sildenafil (Rx below).
We made the following changes to your medications: We STARTED Sildenafil 20 mg three times per day  Followup Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 6005**] office to make an appointment while you are in pulmonary rehabilitation.
