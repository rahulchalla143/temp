Mother presented on date of delivery with spontaneous rupture of membranes of twin A.  Twin B was breech presentation, which prompted Cesarean section delivery.
Blow-by oxygen and stimulation was provided and Apgars were assigned of 7 and 8.
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AT [**Hospital6 **]: Initial hospital course at [**Hospital **] Hospital was notable for: - Discordant twin size, with this twin growth restricted at less than 10th percentile and other twin appropriate size for gestational age; - Mild respiratory distress and oxygen requirement that resolved over first 12 hours of life, most consistent with TTN; - Initial hypoglycemia, treated with intravenous glucose with a maximum of D-15 concentration; - Polycythemia with variable hematocrit values, with initial hematocrit of 64% and reaching 73% by day of life 3, prompting partial exchange transfusion; - Mild thrombocytopenia with platelet counts 70-80s, diminishing to 50s following exchange transfusion; - Sepsis evaluation on two occasions, with initial treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin and subsequent reinitation of ampicillin and cefotaxime, with both blood cultures negative; - Mild hypocalcemia, which resolved; - Mild hyperbilirubinemia which treated with phototherapy (infant blood type B-, coombs -).
Anterior fontanel soft, flat, sutures not split.
On admission to [**Hospital1 69**], the infant was initially maintained NPO and on IVF.
Serum chemistries including calcium and magnesium were within normal limits.
Enteral feedings were started on [**8-6**] via gavage tube.
Advancement of feedings was limited by frequent vomiting.
As infant's overall status improved, oral feedings were introduced, with eventual transition to full oral feeds.
By the time of discharge, the infant has been feeding PO ad lib Neosure 26 calorie/oz formula for greater than three days, taking over 140 cc/kg/day.
The mass was followed clinically at first, but due to issues with vomiting with introduction of enteral feeds, further evaluation was performed with repeat ultrasound and upper GI study, performed on [**2126-8-14**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Plan at the time of discharge is for follow-up with surgery at [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient, with elective excision of the mass in the future.
She required treatement for hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy for several days after transfer.
Infectious disease:  In light of the seizure activity, acyclovir was added to the ampicillin and cefotaxime the infant had been on at the time of transfer.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-6**] and the Acyclovir was discontinued on [**8-8**].
Neurology:  As noted above, infant was loaded with phenobarbital following seizure activity at [**Hospital **] Hospital.
An additional clinical seizure was seen on [**8-3**], and EEG performed on [**8-4**] and 20 suggested ongoing subclinical seizure activity, prompting additional doses of phenobarbital with an eventual level of 36.
Occupational therapy has been following the infant throughout, and has noted increased tone diffusely.
Medications: Phenobarbital 12 mg (3 mL) PO daily.
Immunizations received: received Hepatitis B vaccine # 1 on [**2126-8-28**].
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
