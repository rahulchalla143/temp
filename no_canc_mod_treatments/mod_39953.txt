He was continuing to have "subtle seizure activity" despite these interventions, so he was intubated, started on propofol drip.

This raised our concern for HSV encephalitis so he was started empirically on acyclovir and an LP was done.
The LP showed only 2 WBCs and 3 RBCs, 5 bands, protein 43 and glucose 112.
He was initially started on Keppra and this was titrated up to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **].
Once the patient was off of propofol he had two electrographic seizures so Dilantin was added with a 1 gram load.
Overnight he became agitated and tore off his EEG leads.
On [**11-10**] the dilantin was discontinued due to a concern for poor bone healing (right acetabular fracture).
He was started on Trileptal 300 [**Hospital1 **] instead, but patient had another seizure on the floor so patient was loaded with fosphenytoin and dilantin was restarted and trileptal stopped.
Because of this agitation, keppra was weaned to off and lacosamide was started and titrated up.
ID: The patient was initially put on acyclovir as above but was stopped after a benign CSF was obtained.
He also had a chest xray that was concerning for pneumonia so he was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
This was stopped after 2 days because the patient's chest xray improved after diuresis and he had no further white count or fever.
RESP: Patient was intubated for status.
He was successfuly extubated on [**11-9**] after getting extra lasix and diuresing the day prior.
He was continued on his home dose of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone.
His blood pressure and electrolytes were stable and he did not require stress dose steroids.
