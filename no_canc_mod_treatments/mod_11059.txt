The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2197-4-25**] for a total abdominal gastrectomy, an S-pouch and a Roux-en-Y feeding jejunostomy placement.
The only complication noted was a small splenic injury that was coagulated and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
He had an epidural and gastrojejunal tube placed which was discontinued after his feeding tubes began to be tolerated.
His epidural was removed by postoperative day three and was begun on J tube feeds around this time period.
He was tolerating tube fees and by postoperative day six he was tolerating tube feeds nearly at goal and it was decided to start him on clear liquids.
The PCA was discontinued and the nasogastric tube was removed.
He was changed to overnight tube feeds at 2/3 strength impact with fiber at 120 cc an hour and he was eating regular diet.
He had a swallow study on [**5-5**] in the fluoroscopy that showed an obstructed area at the distal aspect of the S-pouch and a nasogastric tube was placed under direct visualization of the fluoroscopy.
He was encouraged to drink some meat tenderizer and Kayexalate which helped to decompress his obstruction.
After the placement of the gastric tube he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring overnight and by the morning he was stable and discharged back to the floor.
By postoperative day 15 once again he was restarted on clears and was able to tolerate these clears.
