HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have multivessel coronary artery disease which would not likely be amenable to interventional procedures.
A cardiothoracic surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2127-4-24**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with a left internal mammary artery to the LAD, a left radial graft to the OM, saphenous vein to the RCA and saphenous vein to the diag.
The patient was postoperatively transported from the Operating Room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine and nitroglycerin intravenous drips.
Later on the day of surgery, the patient was weaned from a mechanical ventilator and extubated.
The following day, the patient required some Neo-Synephrine for approximately 24 more hours due to some hypotension.
His Foley catheter and the central venous line were removed as were his epicardial pacing wires.
The patient continued to progress and remained hemodynamically stable, had some hypertension and was begun on beta blockers which had subsequently been increased.
His sternal incision is well and his leg and his left arm incisions are clean, dry and intact with Steri-Strips in place.
