He was started on a Z-pack.
Given tachypnea and hypoxemia as well as high work of breathing, patient was intubated with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
He was empricially provided with levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
After an 3 additional 3L NS SBP increased to 100's.

The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.
An nasogastric tube is seen in the esophagus but does not reach the GE junction or the stomach.
CXR [**2185-6-26**] Compared with [**2185-6-25**] at 5:46 a.m., an NG tube is again noted.
It overlies the lower chest, but appears to overlie the gastric fundus, which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation, as seen on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.
CXR [**2185-7-6**] FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], the orogastric tube has been removed.
Persistent opacification at the left base with progressive clearing of opacification at the right base.
Follow up upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies  CXR [**7-11**] PA/Lat: CONCLUSION: There is no significant pneumothorax.
