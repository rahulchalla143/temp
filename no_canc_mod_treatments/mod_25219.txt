He had a recent U/A at a PCP's office a week ago which apparently showed a Klebsiella UTI, for which he was treated with a week's worth of ABX (he is not sure which kind).
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] gave him Levoquin and Vancomyin.
He also recieved a dose of Zosyn.
Levophed was placed at bedside but not hung.

Past Medical History: Dyslipidemia Hypertension CKD (last Cr 2.9 on [**2-1**]) COPD Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, on Coumadin) Bladder CA s/p cystectomy/prostatectomy Hyperparathyroidism s/p parathyroid resection [**2135**] Lung nodule resection (PCP's office has record of adenocarcinoma of the lung but no info on tx) Gout CAD s/p stent placement to LAD and LCx [**2126**]   Social History: Patient lives [**Location (un) **] with his wife.
CXR [**2137-2-21**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular venous catheter.
Chain suture is noted in the left hemithorax with volume loss suggestive of prior resection.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old man with h/o dyslipidemia, hypertension, CKD, COPD, afib, bladder ca s/po cystectomy/prostectomy with urostomy, parathyroid resection, and lung nodule resection who presented to OSH with a one day of weakness transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of sepsis from suspected urinary source.
# Sepsis from Urinary Source: Patient had a UA with 86 WBCs and large bacteria in setting of unusual urologic anatomy with urostomy.
He was pan-cultured and treated with vanc and zosyn initially empirically for urosepsis.
He was volume resuscitated with 2L in the ED with CVPs at goal, but continued to by hypotensive and was started on both levophed and vasopressin in the MICU.
His antibiotics were changed to vanc/cefepime/flagyl after obtaining information from his PCP that he had recently been treated with doxycycline for a Klebsiella UTI (resistant to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin; sensitive to cephalsporins; non-ESBL).
He was called out to the floor on [**2-23**] for further management.
His antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone.
His fevers, leukocytosis (34K->7K), lactatemia, and other evidence of end organ ischemia resolved and he no longer required IV fluids to maintain his pressures.
A midline was placed for him to finish his 10-day total course of ceftriaxone (last day [**3-3**]).
Cr peaked in house to 4.6, up from prior baseline of 2.2 but trended back down to 2.2 with pressors and fluids rec'd in the unit and on the floor.
# CAD/Troponin Leak: Has known h/o CAD s/p stenting to the LAD and LCx in [**2126**].
Is not on anti-platelet agents (ASA/plavix) given h/o heavy bleeding.
Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] coumadin dose had recently been changed from 2 to 1 mg in the setting of his elevated INRs.
His beta blocker and coumadin were held in the setting of his acute illness and elevated INR.
He received 5 mg of vitamin K to help correct his INR of 12.7.
He was restarted on coumadin and his beta blocker on discharge.
# Thrombocytopenia: In setting of elevated INR, concern for DIC- fibrinogen and FDP were sent and negative.
He was started on a 3-day course of renally-dosed valacyclovir.
His home diuretic regimen was held during his acute illness but re-started at the time of discharge.
#Antibiotics: Patient is receiving a 10 day course of IV cephalosporins (first cefepime, now ceftriaxone) to end [**3-3**].
#CHF: Patient is not on an Ace inhibitor which is indicated for his systolic CHF.
