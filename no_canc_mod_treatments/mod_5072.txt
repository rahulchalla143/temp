The patient initially reported a sore throat, tightness, and chest pain which was not reported by the patient on presentation to the Emergency Department.
She was given intravenous fluids, and her usual dose of 80 mg p.o.
She has no complaints of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, sore throat or shortness of breath.
In the Emergency Department, she was given Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one, Solu-Medrol 120 mg times one, albuterol nebulizers, bicarbonate, D-50, and intravenous insulin.
There is a history of intubation in the past, and she requires home oxygen of 2 liters to 3 liters.
ALLERGIES:  DEMEROL and CASHEWS.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include Flovent 4 puffs b.i.d., Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d., albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d., Vioxx 25 mg p.o.
q.d., trazodone 100 mg p.o.
q.d., Prozac 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Plaquenil 200 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Detrol 2 mg p.o.
b.i.d., glucosamine 100 mg p.o.
q.d., Neurontin 300 mg p.o.
q.d., Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d., digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
q.d., and K-Dur 20 mg p.o.
Urine culture from [**2188-4-4**] showed Klebsiella sensitive only to imipenem with 10,000 colony-forming units.
Hospital course prior to being transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Service, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for further management of her respiratory distress.
She was placed on BiPAP and did not tolerate this well overnight.
However, she maintained her oxygenation and was switched to nasal cannula during the day on the following morning.
Thus, Solu-Medrol was discontinued at this time as well as Levaquin for pneumonia.
Since then she has been able to maintain herself off of BiPAP and only on 3 liters to 4 liters nasal cannula.
She was also tried on ibutilide drip without affect.
She was anticoagulated initially with heparin and then converted to Coumadin and started on amiodarone while in the unit.
Flovent 4 puffs inhaled b.i.d.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q.6h.
Imipenem 500 mg q.6h.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Heparin drip.
Combivent 2 puffs q.4-6h.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature of 96.3, pulse of 89 (in atrial flutter), blood pressure of 104/62, respiratory rate of 27, satting 88% to 97% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Nasal cannula was in place.
She had been attempted previously for chemical cardioversion with ibutilide drip without success.
She was started on amiodarone on [**2188-4-11**] and also anticoagulated with a heparin drip with Coumadin.
Digoxin was discontinued secondary to its effect on both amiodarone and Coumadin.
Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] INR did finally reach a therapeutic range but had to be reversed with vitamin K secondary to need for new line placement.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended holding off on Swan-Ganz catheter and suggested possible right heart catheterization at a later time.
RESPIRATORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] respiratory distress responded well to diuresis with Lasix up to 80 mg intravenously b.i.d.
Lasix at 40 mg p.o.
Strict ins-and-outs were requested, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is not a candidate for dialysis at this time secondary to her preload dependence and poor blood pressure.
However, they believed that she was a candidate for continuous venovenous hemofiltration to help remove approximately 120 pounds of fluid.
She will require placement of a hemodialysis catheter and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
In light of her renal failure, all medications are now renally dosed, and all nephrotoxins have been discontinued.
Albumin was checked and was found to be 3.4.
Intravenous fluids had been avoided at this time secondary to whole body anasarca.
She was treated with seven days of imipenem which was discontinued on [**2188-4-15**].
Foley was changed on [**2188-4-11**].
LINES:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a left subclavian line which was placed in the unit on admission on [**2188-4-8**].
She will be transferred at this time to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and continuous venovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis.
She is willing to take these risks including possibly requiring hemodialysis for the rest of her life.
