The patient arrived with pressor support of dopamine and norepinephrine.

He was on a heparin gtt when his INR then became subtherapeutic.
# Altered Mental Status: Once extubated and weaned off of sedation, the patient was noted to have some depressed mental status.
They also recommended continued anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in setting of low ejection fraction.
Does not require insulin at home but poorly controlled on oral agents.
The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale while in house.
