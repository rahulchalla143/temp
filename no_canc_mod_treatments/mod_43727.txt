Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-13**], the left ventricular systolic function is similar and the severities of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitaiton have worsened.
She initially had borderline low blood pressure in the setting of urosepsis, and was transferred to the CCU given her history of severe systolic and diastolic heart failure.
She was started on IV ceftriaxone in the CCU which has since been switched to oral ciprofloxacin.
Today is day #6 of antibiotic therapy.
She was maintained on IV Heparin for 48 hours.
We continued her on aggressive medical management with  Aspirin, Plavix, and statin.
Her metoprolol was held until her blood pressure improved.
Patient will be continued on her aspirin, statin and plavix.
She should also receive metoprolol as her blood pressure tolerates.
Patient was diuresed well and is currently back on her outpatient regimen of Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
She should also continue taking metoprolol.
A low dose of lisinopril was also added at time of discharge.
Both of these medications are important for optimizing her heart failure management.
Patient's creatinine resolved following treatment of her urosepsis and improvement of her heart failure.
We have restarted patient's standing dose of NPH 18 units Qam and 8 units qPM and Humalog per sliding scale.
7) Polymyalgia Rheumatica: Patient received a short course of stress dose steroids in the setting of hypotension/urosepsis.
9) Neuropathy: Gabapentin dose was decreased to 300 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] when creatinine was increased.
