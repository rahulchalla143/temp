Blood Cultures: Pending  Studies: The current study demonstrates the right chest tube in place with no apparent right pneumothorax, although small pneumothorax can be obscured by significant amount of subcutaneous air.
The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and might be advanced another 10 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo f with hx of dementia, now s/p cardiac arrests in setting of PE and PEA arrest, with pneumothorax s/p chest tube, now intubated and unresponsive having myoclonic jerks.
On admission patient was continued on Levophed and Dopamine, Neosynepherine was started.
However, due to PE and prolonged code and time since her code patient was not a good candidate for cooling protocol given concern for coagulopathy and overall poor outcome.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and started on a bicarb gtt given her profound acidosis.
The patient's extremly poor prognosis was shared with the family and it was determined that the patient would be made Comfort Measures Only.
She was started on heparin at the OSH.
Continued heparin gtt.
Whe initially had jerks on her left side but these generalized over the course of her admission.
Unclear if she had a hx of sz, since the pt was on depakote at her NH.
Sedation was held and metabolic abnormalities were corrected.
# Pneuomthorax: Secondary to subcalvian line placement attempt on right.
Chest tube is currently in place.
Left sided pneumothorax was small and did not reguire chest tube.
# Hypertension: Held home lasix, atenolol, nifedipine, and lisinopril  # Dementia: Unsure her baseline, currently unresponsive.
