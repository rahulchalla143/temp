Troponin 0.66.
He was taken to cardiac catheterization from the ED for persistent chest pain on a nitroglycerin drip.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a right-dominant ciculation, LMCA with severe diffuse disease, proximal LCx occlusion, RCA occluded proximally, SVG-RCA with an ostial 99% lesion and SVG-OM1 proximal 80% and distal 90%.
The patient had PTCA and 2 Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to SVG-OM graft and PTCA and stent to SVG-RCA.
The patient was noted to have elevated pressures (PCWP 16, RA 11, PA 43/26) and was transferred to CCU for hemodynamic support as he was briefly on a Dobutamine drip after the right heart catheterization.
In the CCU, he received Lasix for diuresis, was maintained on dobutamine overnight and received 2U FFP prior to sheath pull (INR 2.5).

Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in SVG-RCA.
Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in SVG-OM1.
Colonoscopy: Findings: Flat Lesions Multiple angioectasias due to previous radiation therapy were seen up to 10 cm into the rectum.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Recommendations: Patient will need repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy with argon-plasma coagulation to further treat radiation proctitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103271**] is a 78 male with CAD, CABG x 2, AVR/MVR,HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, who presents with episode of diaphresis and shortness of breath, with EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes.
Four drug-eluding stents were placed, including 1 to SVG-RCA, 2 to proximal SVG-OM1 and 1 to distal SVG-OM1.
Pt was maintained on an Ace inhibitor, with daily Lasix and Spironolactone.
However, pt had lower GI bleeding when placed on heparin and coumadin and therefore did not tolerate anti-coagulation at this time.
He may tolerate anti-coagulation upon further resolution of his radiation proctitis.
Will continue rate control with beta blocker and rhythm control with amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was held as discussed above.
A colonscopy revealed radiation proctitis, and coagulation was performed.
Pt will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] for a flex sig and repeat coagulation in one month.
Type II Diabetes: The patient is currently diet-controlled and covered with regular insulin for a few episodes of hyperglycemia.
?Anxiety/Depression: Pt was given olanzapine as needed for anxiety.
