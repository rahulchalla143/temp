He has been maintained on imuran and prednisone although there is some question whether the patient has been fully compliant with his regimen.
On [**2165-9-3**] he underwent diagnostic paracentesis and was found to have SBP [**1-30**] to alpha-hemolytic strep, treated with 2gm IV CTX (currently D4/5) with supplemental albumin on D1 and D3.
Given concern for possible cholangitis, he underwent ERCP w/ sphincterectomy on [**2165-9-5**] which showed stable, known constrictions without acute pathology.

Ceftriaxone was continued for SBP diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**] x5 days and albumin.
This was treated with octreotide and midodrine, as well as daily albumin, with resolution of Cr closer to baseline.
Two JP drains were placed.
He was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for recent SBP.
On [**2165-9-16**], he vomited coffee grounds, and NGT placement continued to drain similar fluid.
PRBC were transfused, and coagulopathy was corrected with FFP and cryoprecipitate.
The J-J anastomosis was not reached.
He was persistently orthostatic due to hypovolemia due to high JP ascites output which required IV fluid/albumin.
Broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics were started.
Vancomycin and meropenem were started empirically.
On [**9-18**], a Roux tube gravity cholangiogram was performed to assess the roux anastomosis.
The tube was noted in the bowel.
Roux tube was capped.
On [**2165-9-19**] TPN was started for nutrition, as the patient developed ileus requiring NGT.
Vancomycin was changed to linezolid for VRE growing from bile sampled from his Roux tube.
TPN had been continued daily since initiation, as the patient could not advance to a significant oral diet due to ileus.
IV fluid boluses were given and a unit of PRBC were administered on [**9-28**] for HCT of 25.2.
On [**9-30**], a post pyloric feeding tube was placed.
Tube feeds were started and rate was increased as tolerated.
Hyperkalemia was treated with IV meds and po Kayexalate.
The tube was left out per patient request as he felt that he could drink [**4-2**] supplements per day.
Levothyroxine was started on [**9-17**].
Given repeated orthostatic episodes, anasarca, flat affect and lack of appetite, a repeat TSH was checked on [**9-27**] and found to be 12.
Levothyroxine was increased to 100mcg per day.
Endocrinology was consulted and recommended increasing to 125mcg per day with repeat TSH/T3/T4 in 1 month.
Lasix was started for edema as well as for ascites that had accumulated after abdominal JPs were removed.
A 6 liter paracentesis was performed on [**10-4**].
Albumin was administered.
IV Ceftriaxone was started and continued for 5 days.
Repeat paracentesis was done on [**10-9**] for approximately 4 liters.
Albumin was given post para.
Ceftriaxone was switched to Ciprofloxacin on [**10-10**] for SBP prophylaxis indefinitely ([**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital1 1326**] MD to re-assess in outpatient f/u).
Two units of PRBC were administered on [**10-8**].
Prograf was held and dose decreased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
