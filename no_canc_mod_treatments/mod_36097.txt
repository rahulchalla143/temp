During the cardiac catheterization, the patient had occasional episodes of hypotension and was started on atropine and dopamine.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and given intravenous fluids.
(a)  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2174**].
(b)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery in [**2174**] with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery.
