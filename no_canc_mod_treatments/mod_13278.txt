The patient was placed on telemetry and followed with serial EKG.
Metoprolol was used to control episodes of tachycardia to the 120's.
On [**2101-8-8**], a dual pacemaker device with leads in the right atrium and ventricle was placed.
A-fib:  On admission, Digoxin was discontinued because this medication was thought to be contributing to asystolic pauses.
The patient was rate controlled with metoprolol 25mg PO TID.
On [**2101-8-9**], with resolution of the cardiac pauses with pacemaker placement, Digoxin 0.125mg every other day was restarted.
This will be attempted after a full month of anticoagulation on coumadin at therapeutic levels.
Then, chemical cardioversion should be attempted as an outpatient.
The patient was treated with IV lasix and over the lengths of hospital stay, he diuresed more than 9L.
The patient's heart rate was controlled with metoprolol in the hopes that a slower heart rate would allow more effective filling of the ventricles.
And ACE inhibitor was not started for afterload reduction because of the patient's low blood pressures, but can be considered in the future.
DVT/PE/Anticoagulation:  The patient was on home coumadin for treatment of his PE and a-fib.
The coumadin was held and sliding scale heparin was started in preparation for the pacemaker placement.
The patient was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma to correct his INR to below 1.8.
After the pacemaker was placed, the patient was put on Lovenox as a bridge until his coumadin became therapeutic.
On discharge, the patient was on coumadin 5mg a day with Lovenox 80mg SC with an INR of 1.6.
When the patient reaches a therapeutic INR of [**3-5**] for 48 hours, the patient should discontinue Lovenox and continue on coumadin mg PO daily.
Change in mental status-On [**2101-8-9**], the patient became somnolent and PO medications were not administered.
The patient was scheduled for a video swallow study that was performed on [**2101-8-11**] and showed mild dysphagia for thin fluids that could be corrected with compensatory maneuvers.
The patient should follow up with speech therapy for a re-evaluation.
The patient was started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID for a 14 day course.
