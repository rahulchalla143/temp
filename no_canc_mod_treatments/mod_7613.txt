He was found to have an exposed RUE AV fistula/graft in clinic on [**2166-12-25**], and was sent to Pre-Op for a planned repair where he became febrile to 103.0, with chills.
He is status post 3-vessel CABG on [**2165-2-20**] with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein to RCA, saphenous vein to OM.
ESRD x 5 years on HD (MWF), felt secondary to HTN 3.
Status post CVA in [**2149**] with residual left-sided hemiparesis 4.
Afib/Aflutterm, not on anticoagulation secondary to history of GI bleed.
Family History: Mother with hypertension No history of no strokes, seizures, or heart disease  Physical Exam: Per transplant surgery admission note on [**2166-12-25**]: VITALS: T 193, HR 99, BP 130/59, RR 18 GEN: In NAD.
LN: No cervical or axillary LAD RESP: Chest CTA bilaterally.
The vertebral arteries, basilar arteries, intracranial internal carotid arteries, and the middle and anterior cerebral arteries are patent.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p CABG, PAF on no anticoagulation [**1-21**] history of GU bleed, HTN, and ESRD on HD, admitted with an exposed and infected AV graft.
1) Exposed/infected AV graft and MSSA bacteremia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the transplant surgery service and taken to the OR on [**2166-12-25**] for the emergent removal of his exposed/infected RUE AV graft.
A temporary right groin HD catheter was placed.
He was initially started on empiric Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2166-12-25**] eventually all grew methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus, 6/6 bottles.
Flagyl was D/C'd, and Vancomycin was eventually switched to Linezolid PO, which unfortunately was ordered but never approved.
He received a short course of Oxacillin ([**2166-12-30**]), and ID was consulted on [**2166-12-31**], at which time antibiotics were switched to Cefazolin 2gm IV with hemodialysis ([**2166-12-31**]).
Hence, plan is to continue Cefazolin 2 gm IV with hemodialysis, counting from [**2166-12-27**] (first negative blood cultures).
2) CVA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a known history of PAF, and was not on anticoagulation on admission given a prior history of GI bleed.
Neurology was consulted, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on anticoagulation with Coumadin, as well as aspirin.
Of note, given his poor vascular access, Heparin could not be given.
Lovenox was also not an option in the setting of his ESRD.
Coumadin was temporarily held on [**2167-1-9**] for line placement.
He is to remain on anticoagulation with goal INR [**1-22**], as well as ASA.
He was continued on hemodialysis 3 times per week.
He was kept on a low potassium diet, with good results.
Temporary lines were placed in his right groin and right IJ.
A tunneled HD line was placed on [**2167-1-9**].
Permanent vascular access should be delayed until after completion of 6 weeks of IV antibiotics and documentation of sterile blood cultures 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics.
It is unclear why he is not on a beta-blocker as an out-patient.
He was transfused a single unit of PRBCs on [**2166-12-29**], and remained fairly stable afterwards.
