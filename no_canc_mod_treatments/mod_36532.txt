CXR on day following admission: Fluid levels within the cystic bronchiectasis foci of the right lung and new subtle left perihilar opacity.
The anterior wall, distal septum and apex are akinetic.
Patient then underwent bronchoscopy on the following day and was found to have Influenza A, and a course of oseltamivir was initiated.
As noted below, patient was treated broadly for gram-negative rod pneumonia (not pseudomonas) with meropenem x 14 days.
On pressure support trials, patient would become tachypneic and agitated or apenic and hypercarbic during spontaneous breathing trials.
Patient was initiated on quetiapine for maximal non-narcotic sedation and anti-agitation, however, patient continued to have agitation when efforts were made to wean towards extubation.
Pt is able to tolerate pressure support and short trials of trach mask.
Therefore, patient was initiated on a two week course of meropenem for broad-spectrum coverage of the unspeciated gram-negative rods and concern of recurrence of infection in the setting of severe bronchomalacia and bronchiectasis.
She was started on a 10-day course of Vancomycin which she will complete at rehab.
Also, she was found to have copious thick nasal secretions and she was started on a 7-day course of Ceftazidime for presumed sinusitis.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placed in mid-left anterior descending coronary (initially 70% stenosis).
Patient was treated with post-MI medications including ASA, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin as well as Plavix 75mg daily status post stent placement.
Her lisinopril and metoprolol should be titrated up as her blood pressure allows.
Pt has a hx of c diff colitis s/p treatment with Flagyl.
Her stool was tested for c diff and was negative x 5.
After treatment with po diflucan, miconazole powder and nystatin cream there was marked improvement.
Diabetes: Pt's blood glucose was controlled with an insulin sliding scale.
On day of discharge, her oral hypoglycemic medications were restarted.
She became increasingly agitated while intubated requiring boluses and Fentanyl and Versed and the initiation of propofol.
She was started on po Haldol and kept on Seroquel.
Her mental status improved as propofol, versed and fentanyl were weaned off and on day of discharge, she was alert and following commands.
Hypotension: Pt's BP was well controlled on metoprolol and lisinopril.
While on propofol, her systolic blood pressure dropped into the 70s-80 but responded well to fluid boluses.
Nutrition: Thoracic surgery opted not to place the PEG tube secondary to the patient's large ventral hernia.
Pt received tube feeds via NGT tube until PEG was placed by general surgery.
She had PEG tube placed on [**2144-2-19**].
