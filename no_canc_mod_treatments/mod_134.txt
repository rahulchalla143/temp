Considering that she was reported as poorly complaint at her ECF with medications, and refused several medications each day while in the MICU, she likely had an aspect of medical noncompliance either contributing or even causing her HHS.
Her non-compliance and/or inadequacy of home diabetes therapy is further bolstered by her A1C of 12.
She was started on insulin drip, received 7 L of IV fluids, and then was transitioned to a SQ insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations which included a QACHS insulin sliding scale with humolog and QHS lantus.
On transfer to the floor from the MICU the patient was stable and her blood sugar was being controlled with SQ insulin regimen.
# HLD: Simvastatin was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house.
# HTN: Atenolol was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house.
Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3 which responded to 0.9 with IVF.
Aspirin was started.
Reportedly poor medication compliance at ECF (patient sometimes hides pills).
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted and started on insulin per med list.
Thus her Metformin and glypizide were stopped.
Her lisinopril and furosemide were stopped in the setting of her acute illness.
