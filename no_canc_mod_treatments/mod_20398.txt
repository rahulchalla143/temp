The mother's medical history is remarkable for possible fetal alcohol syndrome, developmental delay and depression.
At that point in time she received Magnesium Sulfate and Betamethasone.
She had onset of labor on the day of delivery, and she was delivered by cesarean section.
The infant emerged apneic and was given positive-pressure ventilation.
Cardiovascular:  He received an initial normal saline bolus for hypotension, but has been subsequently cardiovascularly stable.
Respiratory:  The patient was intubated and given one dose of Surfactant and was weaned to CPAP of 6 on day of life #1.
He was weaned off of CPAP to room air on day of life #2 and has breathing comfortably in room air since.
He was initiated on Caffeine prior to extubation.
He was continued on Caffeine until day of life #30.
He has remained off of Caffeine since that time, and his last apnea/bradycardiac spell was on [**2193-4-16**], with a heart rate of 74 and oxygen saturations to 80%, which spontaneously resolved.
Fluids/electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was initially NPO on intravenous fluids.
He had a central PICC placed on day of life #1 and was treated with total parenteral nutrition.
His feeds were initiated on day of life #2, tolerated and advanced.
He was advanced to premature Enfamil 26 Kcal with ProMod; however, on day of life #21, he developed grossly bloody stools and was made NPO and started on TPN.
He was treated with a 14-day course of NPO, Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Clindamycin.
He was restarted on feedings on day of life #36 and reached full volume feedings at day of life #42, and these feedings were pregestemil.
On day of life #50, he was switched to Enfamil 24 and has been tolerating these feeds with heme negative stools.
He is currently taking more than half of his feedings by bottle, and he is receiving 150 ml/kg/day.
He was initiated on Fer-in-[**Male First Name (un) **] and Vitamin E once he reached full enteral feeds on day of life #44.
Vitamin E was discontinued one week later.
He was treated for 48 hours on Ampicillin and Gentamicin.
Blood cultures were no growth at 48 hours, and the antibiotics were discontinued.
Due to bloody stools on day of life #21 and KUB consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis, he was treated with a 14-day course of Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Clindamycin.
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Feeds at discharge:  Enfamil 24 at 150 ml/kg/day, taking approximately 75% p.o.
