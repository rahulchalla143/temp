Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Left upper mediastinal drain is partially imaged.
[**2154-12-9**]: BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT: IMPRESSION: Leak at the gastrojejunal anastomosis  [**2154-12-11**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION:Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction with potential regionality  [**2154-12-12**]: ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left ventricular systoilc dysfunction.
LINE PLACEMENT New left IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.
Right chest Preliminary Reporttube ending at mid thorax and right basal pigtail catheter present, unchanged Preliminary Reportin position.
I see only one right pleural drain, pigtail catheter unchanged in position at the base of the right hemithorax.
Nasogastric tube ends just inferior to the level of the left main bronchus in the upper esophagus  [**2154-12-22**]: CHEST PORT.
An additional tube which appears to terminate in the mid mediastinum apparently represents an enteric tube with tip near the left mainstem bronchus and sideport near the thoracic inlet.
The PICC line and enteric tube findings were discussed by radiology resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the IV nurse, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 7830**], at 9:30 a.m. on [**2154-12-23**].
Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room where he underwent a Takedown fundoplication from previous Mark IV thoracotomy, Paraesophageal hernia repair, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, open, Open cholecystectomy and [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy tube placement.
It should be noted that patient required an insulin drip intra-operatively to control persistently high blood glucose levels, which was continued in the PACU and eventually replaced on post-operative day 1 with an insulin sliding scale while on the floor at the direction of [**Last Name (un) **] who was consulted for diabetes management.
Cardiology was consulted and the patient received nitroglycerin, PR aspirin and metoprolol.
On POD 1, the patient's oxygen saturation levels dropped to below 85% after maintaing sats in the 90s on 3L NC, the patient triggered on the floor and required 5L of continuous oxygen via face mask to maintain >90% oxygen saturation.
With the lack of any clinical symptoms, volume overload was suspected as the most likely culprit for the dropping O2 sats.
On POD 2, He was given a dose of lasix and a CT scan was ordered.
Following the lasix dose, the patient was weaned from the facemask to 3L NC, however, the Chest CT revealed a right segmental pulmonary embolism.
Subsequently, a heparin gtt was initiated to maintain PTT 60-80 and eventually transitioned to therapeutic lovenox.
The patient continued to deny SOB or CP and was weaned from supplemental oxygen and maintained on room air.
Also, given bandemia empiric broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics were intiated.
A central line was also placed at this time.
Given the findings, the patient returned to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and irrigation of abdominal cavity, placement of drains x3 and placement of a right-sided chest tube.
Post-operatively, the patient remained intubated and was transferred back into the SICU.
Neuro: The patient was initially alert and oriented post-operatively; pain was initially managed with an epidural.
On POD 2, due to findings of a right-sided pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation via heparing gtt, the epidural was d/c'd and PCA was started for pain control.
On POD4, the pain regimen was transitioned to oral Roxicet.
Post-operatively he remained intubated and sedated with fentanyl and versed until POD 15/9.
Following extubation, pain was controlled with prn IV hydromorphone and transitioned to an oral regimen of liquid oxycodone.
Recommendations included gentle diuresis once clinically stable and daily electrolyte monitoring.
Intravenous lasix was resumed on POD [**10-26**] with goal of negative 1liter daily until shortly before leaving the ICU on POD 20/13.
He remained hemodynamically stable while on the floor and remained on telemetry for monitoring.
Pulmonary: On POD2, following an acute desaturation, a right segmental PE was identified on CTA as described above.
He remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint with a heparing gtt for anticoagulation until POD7.
On POD7, the patient returned to the operating room (as described above) and remained intubated post-operatively.
A chest tube was placed intra-operatively due to findings of a small pneumothorax following central line placement.
On POD [**10-26**], the patient underwent thoracentesis with pigtail catheter placement by Interventional Pulmonary with drainage of 100 cc purulent fluid.
An abdominal CT obtained the following day indicated several fluid loculations in the right hemithorax with complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
He was gradually weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD 16/9; he was maintained on CPAP overnight for known OSA for the remainder of the hospitalization.
The chest tube output gradually decreased and was removed on POD 14/7.
The pigtail catheter output also decreased gradually and was removed on POD 20/13.
A repeat Abd CT and UGI series were performed and indicative of a large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen most likely from an anastamotic leak at the GE anastamosis; as described above, the patient was subsequently taken back to the operating room for an abdominal washout and placement of 2 additional JP drains.
As the patient's diet was unable to be advanced, TPN was initiated on POD [**11-26**].
After UGI study and subsequent methylene blue test showed no evidence of leak he was started on trophic tube feeds at 10cc/hr on POD 19/12.
TPN was weaned as the TF rate increased and eventually disconitnued on POD 24/17.
Following a repeat methylene blue dye test (POD 22/15) in conjuction with minimal drain output, the NGT and JP #2 were removed on POD 23/16 followed by JP#1 on POD 24/17 as drain input did not increase.
On POD 29/22, following removal of JP #3 and a negative repeat methylene blue dye test, the diet was advanced to stage 3 and tube feedings were discontinued.
He had pleural fluid sampled on POD [**9-24**] that grew Veillonella species on placment of a right sided pigtail that returned 100cc of purulent drainage on insertion.
He underwent a bronch on POD [**10-26**] and was weaned to extubation on POD 13/6.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Unasyn on POD 17/10 and remained afebrile and without a leukocytosis afterwards.
Unasyn was discontinued on POD 29/22 following a negative UGI series.
He was started on nystatin swuch and spit for presumed thrush on POD 20/13.
After the NGT was removed he had no further issues with pain in his throat.
HEME: He required one unit transfusions on POD [**7-23**], POD [**11-26**], and POD 14/7.
ENDO: Immediately post-operatively, he maintained on an insulin gtt as described above.
Post-operatively, blood sugars were controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.
Once on a stage 3 diet, the patient did not require insulin coverage.
Prophylaxis: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin until he was found to have a pulmonary embolism as mentioned above, at which point he was transitioned to a heparin drip, with goal PTT of 60-80.
Hematology recommended 1 mg/kg therapeutic dosing with anticoagulation for 6 months.
