Admission Date:  [**2187-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-3-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**] Chief Complaint: Fall from standing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2187-12-28**]: Flexible bronchoscopy [**2187-12-1**]: Open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [**2187-12-17**]: Percutaneous tracheostomy placement   History of Present Illness: 69 year old woman with multiple medical problems now presenting on transfer from an OSH with a C-2 cervical fracture.
She was placed in a hard collar and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
Past Medical History: -diabetes -COPD -anxiety -high blood pressure -s/p knee replacement -s/p abdominal hernias and surgery -h/o pneumonia -h/o recent leg cellulitis  Social History: -lives by self -walks with walker -no tobacco or alcohol use  Physical Exam: Admission exam 97.5  66  153/98  28  96%ra General: no acute distress Neck:  in hard collar, trachea midline Lungs:  decreased breath sounds at the bases CV: regular rate and rhythm; no murmur/rub Abdomen:  mildly tender to palpation diffusely, multiple reducible incisional hernias no rebound.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The fracture extends into the left transverse foramen, raising the possibility of vertebral artery injury.
Assessment of likely tracheal stricture around tracheostomy tube would require extubation.
Compared with the focused TEE study of [**2187-12-2**] (images reviewed), the LV systolic function has improved, and there is now a pericardial effusion, as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted after initial evaluation in trauma ED for emergent ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was taken to the surgical intensive care unit still intubated and in critical, but stable condition.
Her course in the intensive care unit was remarkable for development of ischemic colitis following the operation that resolved with conservative management.
She remained ventilator dependent and the decision to perform a tracheostomy was made.
She underwent a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2187-12-17**].
Since that time she was weaned on the ventilator to the current status of alternating trach mask and CPAP+PS as tolerated.
Tube feedings were intitiated via NGT (PEG deferred secondary to abdominal operations).
She completed a course of zosyn and flagyl on [**12-17**] (on abx from day of surgery).
Later in her hospitalization urine cultures revealed yeast, proteus and klebsiella for which she was treated as well.
Retention sutures placed in the OR were removed on [**2187-12-31**] when her nutritional status had improved.
