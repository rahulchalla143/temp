Failed outpt management of CHF exacerbation with increase of PO Lasix 60 mg to 120mg.
CXR consistent with a very large heart, bilateral patchy opacities and L > R pleural effusion; also with BNP 5500 (no baseline) and Cr 2.3 up from 1.7 back in [**4-/2108**], and baseline appears to be mid 1's.
She was given 80 mg IV Lasix in the ED, and through admission to Cardiology was given 60 mg IV Lasix instead of the intended 120 mg IV due to concern for hypoTN.
Through her course, she was diuresed as above; ACEi, beta blocker, and Coumadin have been held; echo has just been done this am; CE's have been trended which are only minimally elevated Trop's (0.1-0.11) with negative MB's.
There was also of note a concern for LLL PNA vs atelectasis for which she was given IV Levaquin x1, but this was not continued on the floor (she denies cough, fever, and WBC's are low) .

Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation: Pt presented with cyanosis, cool extremities, volume overload, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, acute renal failure.
She was admitted to regular Cardiology floor then trasnferred to CCU for hypoTN where CVL was placed and she was started on lasix drip and required dopamine drip [**2-8**] hypotension.
After 9L diuresis, dopamine was weaned off she was transitioned to PO furosemide.
At time of discharge will be on torsemide 40 mg daily and will stay on metoprolol titrate 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Lisinopril was being held for [**Last Name (un) **] but can likely be restarted as outpatient.
She was also started on isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine for afterload reduction.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  On HD 5 patient was noted to have increased work of breathing and over sedation.
While ventilated patient developed an acute metabolic alkalosis presumably from diuresis and was started on acetazolamide.
Patient's intubation was complicated by abscence of a cuff leak which was assessed by ENT and Pulmonology.
Post-extuabtion patient continued to have hypoxia off of nasal cannula.
She was started on bactrim DS TID for three days and transitioned to Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] and will need a total of 21 days of treatment to end on .
She did not require any steroids, as she was not hypoxic post extubation.
After 21 day course pt will need to be started on PCP prophylaxis unless etiology of immunodeficiency is determined and reversable .
As patient was aggressively diuresed with lasix drip her creatinine initial rose to a max of 3.0 before trending down.
[**Name (NI) 6233**] Pt on warfarin as outpt.
INR was transiently increased to >5 at time of intubation despite withholding coumadin.
#AMS: with decreased RR and acidemia requiring intubation on [**9-8**].
likely secondary to taking trazodone 75mg in setting of renal failure.
Recommend repeat video swallow prior to considering upgrade of liquids given silent aspiration noted on today's exam.
Transitional: - needs f/u for HTLV and HIV viral load and immunodeficiency/anemia work up - INR needs to be checked in 3 days adjust coumadin as needed - bactrim ppx as above - holding lisinopril until [**Last Name (un) **] resolves, should restart as outpt and transition from metoprolol tartrate to metoprolol succinate as well  Medications on Admission: Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr daily  Furosemide 120 mg daily (newly increased from 60mg daily previously) Warfarin 2 mg PO daily Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet qhs prn Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 500 mg(1,250mg) - 400 unit PO BID Trazodone 75 mg qhs prn Lisinopril 5 mg daily nystatin powder  Discharge Medications:   1. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM.

You were on a breathing machine to help you breathe and had some bleeding when the tube was removed.
You had some bleeding during your hospital stay and was started on pantoprazole.
Change metoprolol to 12.5 mg twice daily 2.
Please hold lasix for now with rising creatinine.
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 4. discontinue zolpidem, trazadone and lisinopril.
Start hydralazine and isordil to replace the lisinopril until your kidney function improves 6.
Start colace, miralax and senna to prevent constipation 7.
