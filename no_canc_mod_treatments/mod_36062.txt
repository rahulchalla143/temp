HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the trauma service with a neurosurgical consultation.
The Department of Neurosurgery did not recommend any acute surgical intervention at this time.
Flexion and extension films, taken after the C-spine collar was removed, due to midline spinal tenderness, showed no evidence of abnormal movement and the collar was removed as the C-spine was cleared.
Of note, the patient's Foley was discontinued at midnight, the night prior to discharge.
He reports that he has had multiple problems with urinary retention and Foley re-insertion due to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
The Foley should be removed in one to two days time to allow for another trial of voiding.
