Admission Date:  [**2147-10-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-11-5**]   Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization and stenting, status post ventricular fibrillation at rest with anterior wall myocardial infarction ([**2147-9-19**]) and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% who presents from an outside hospital with cholecystitis status post cholecystotomy tube placement.
The patient is status post a recent prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital6 256**] from [**10-6**] to [**10-18**] for ventricular fibrillation at rest with anterior wall myocardial infarction requiring two cardiac catheterizations with evidence of multivessel disease.
The patient's hospitalization was completed by complete heartblock requiring transcutaneous pacer placement, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia requiring implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement and congestive heart failure with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
The patient was made nothing by mouth and was started on total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was started on empiric antibiotics and underwent an ultrasound-guided placement of a cholecystotomy tube on [**10-22**].
The patient was reportedly ruled out for a myocardial infarction, however, developed, per report, a supraventricular tachycardia requiring the initiation of an esmolol drip prior to transfer.
The patient was transferred for further management to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**10-25**].
Coronary artery disease, status post catheterization 15 years ago, status post cardiac catheterization in [**2147-9-19**] with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery; 4.
Ventricular fibrillation at rest, status post anterior wall myocardial infarction; 5.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement; 6.
Esophageal stricture status post dilatation; 8.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on transfer, 1.
Zofran 2 gm intravenously q.
Ativan 0.5 mg intravenously q.
Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
Zoloft 25 mg p.o.
Imdur 60 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Unasyn 3 gm intravenously q.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Cholecystotomy tube in place.
Chem-7 with sodium 137, potassium 3.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN 74, creatinine 1.7, glucose 103, calcium 7.3 with an albumin of 2.7, phosphate 4.1, magnesium 2.1, coagulation screen with PT of 13.1, INR 1.1, and PTT 25.8.
Bile cultures from the cholecystotomy tube without organisms on gram stain and cultures no growth to date.
The esmolol drip was subsequently discontinued and the patient was started on her outpatient dose of beta blocker with adequate rate control.
The patient was continued off of Coumadin, given the question of blood loss with the subcapsular hematoma.
The Surgical Service was consulted with the recommendation to continue the patient on total parenteral nutrition with nothing by mouth.
Gastrointestinal - The patient was transferred with a cholecystotomy tube for decompression of acute cholecystitis in the setting of an elevated white blood cell count, fever, gallbladder distention, gallstones, and pericholecystic fluid.
The decompression was used as a temporizing measure without surgical options given the patient's recent myocardial infarction.
The patient was continued on empiric antibiotics to complete a ten day course for acute cholecystitis.
The patient was maintained on total parenteral nutrition with nothing by mouth and pain management.
The patient's cholecystotomy tube inadvertently was removed by the patient on hospital day #3 with a follow up right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrating cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis and stable perihepatic hematoma.
The cholecystotomy tube was not replaced at this time.
Infectious disease - The patient was treated with a ten day course of empiric antibiotics for acute cholecystitis.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were without growth, however, given the patient's abdominal pain and a Xylocaine demonstrating persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities, the patient was started on empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient continues on antibiotics at the time of this dictation without recurrent fever and no obvious source.
The patient's creatinine progressively improved following transfer with diuresis and stabilized with a creatinine of 1.5.
The elevated BUN was complicated by uremia with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, somnolence and an anion gap metabolic acidosis.
The patient required transfusion at the outside hospital, however, since the time of transfer the patient's hematocrit has remained stable, greater than 30 without further transfusion requirement.
The patient's oxygen requirements decreased with diuresis, however, the patient continues with a persistent oxygen requirement of 2 liters by nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 88 to 90% on room air.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient has remained nothing by mouth on total parenteral nutrition and/or peripheral parenteral nutrition for the duration of the hospitalization.
