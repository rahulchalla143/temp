Pt has been on Coumadin and digoxin due to her cardiac hx and initially her INR was 3.5.
During the operation the pt experienced episodes of bradycardia with right neck manipulation and swan-ganz catheter placement c/w vagal etiology, however bradycardia and pauses continued for following the surgery.
Permanent v-lead pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**].
Difficulty with using bedside commode due to pain and reports no BM, but positive flatus.
MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-13**]: IMPRESSION: Status post decompression of a large dorsal epidural hematoma, there is soft tissue swelling which continues to impress the distal cord and proximal cauda equina.
Pacing leads in the expected position of the right ventricle.
PM Interrogation [**2133-6-24**]: PM functioning properly   Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo Cantonese F with history of Atrial fibrillation, Mitral valve replacement presented with epidural hematoma and lower extremity weakness.
Patient is s/p epidural hematoma evacuation on [**2133-6-12**] and s/p single wire pacer placement on [**2133-6-14**] sceondary to periop brady/pause.
Following diagnositic evaluation, the patient was taken to surgery for a T12-L2 laminectomy and subsequent evacuation of the hematoma.
At the time of admission the patient's INR was 3.5 as she was taking 3.5mg coumadin PO Qhs for prophylactic anticoagulation due to her h/o afib and MVR.
Her coumadin was held and her INR monitored following surgery.
She was placed on coumadin 3.0mg Qhs once her INR dropped below 2.0 and she was bridged with a heparin drip.
Coumadin was increased to 4.0mg on [**2133-6-17**] and as her INR rose to 2.8 on [**6-22**], decreased to 3.0mg.
Subsequent to her INR dropping from 2.5 to 2.1 on [**6-25**] and then to 1.9 on [**6-26**] the coumadin dose was increased to 4.0mg and 5.0mg repectively.
Coumadin continued to be titrated to a dose of 3.5mg (her dose PTA) giving an INR of 2.4 at discharge.
In the perioperative period the patient began having episodes of bradycardia and pauses for which a single wire pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**], with confirmation of proper lead placement by CXR.
Additionally in this time she developed mild anemia likely due to the spontaneous hematoma and surgical blood loss for which she received a total of 2 units of PRBCs and has since resolved.
During this time the patient was continued on Lanoxin for her atrial fibrillation and developed a NSVT/?
junctional tachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity.
Her digoxin was discontinued and per EP's recommendations was not restarted and will be held indefinitely.
In order to maintain K levels above 4.0 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia, spironolactone 25mg PO daily was started.
On this regimen the patient required 40mEq of KCl PO daily to maintain her K levels and this was reduced to 20mEq daily as the K level on the day prior to discharge was 4.5.
For heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to an eventual dose of 75mg PO BID the day prior to discharge, during which time the patient's BP was stable at SBP=110s to 130s.
On the day of discharge metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] was increased to Toprol XL 200mg to help control SBP that were in the upper 120s.
Following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developed right LE pain, which was attributed to a radiculpathy and was successfully treated with Neurontin 100mg TID.
P. mirabilis was found to be intermediately sensitive to ciprofloxacin and Tx was switched to a sensitive antibiotic, Ceftriaxone 500mg po Q12H for 10 days.
Ceftriaxone was stopped on [**2133-6-29**] and the patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic.
Lastly during her hospital course she developed some bladder irritation/spasms and hematuria likely due to foley catheter trauma.
The catheter was d/c'ed and she was treated with Detrol for a couple of days.
