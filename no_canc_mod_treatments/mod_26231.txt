# Femur fracture: Leg was immobilized and the patient was taken to OR for IM rod placement on [**12-4**].
She was not started on post hip fx anticoagulation due to concern of questionable hemorrhagic conversion of subacute strokes.
# Hypotension: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted with borderline hypotension and was started on a norepinephrine drip on admission to keep MAPs>60.
The cause for her hypotension was unclear; she was started on antibiotics empirically for sepsis; [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was equivocal so she was started on hydrocortisone.
Due to concern of total body fluid overload ([**Location (un) **]-sarca) with hypotension, low urine output, and very low albumin the patient was given several days of IV albumin which temporarily improved her blood pressure and allowed diuresis.
IV albumin helped reversed the hypotension and allow lasix diuresis.
Currently she is diuresing well to 20mg IV lasix boluses.
