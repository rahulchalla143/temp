#) Wound Infection/Sepsis: She had been started on Keflex [**8-6**] at the rehab facility and the drainage was cultured on [**8-6**], which grew heavy growth of MSSA and moderate alpha strep.
As a result, she was switched to Levaquin on [**8-8**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**8-11**].
She was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn on [**8-12**].
She was initially placed on vancomycin and cefepime and then transitioned to a combination of Unasyn 2 q 12 hours (given her renal function) and vancomycin 1 q 24 hours.
Her OR course was complicated by the fact that she was required requiring a fiberoptic intubation, and was noted to have significant tracheomalacia from midtrachea through carina.
She was successfully extubated in the PACU and required Levophed for blood pressure support in the ICU for two days post operatively.
She received a PICC line for the purpose of administering IV antibiotics at her rehab facility.
Opat Antibiotic regimen and projected duration Unasyn 2 q 12 hours x 8-10 weeks from time of operative debridement, [**Date range (1) 4981**].
Vancomycin 1 q 24 hours x 8-10 weeks from time of operative debridement, [**Date range (1) 4981**].
Cultura data (organism and susceptibilities) MSSA, GAS (OSH) CoNS ([**Hospital1 18**])  Essential diagnostic date for OPAT rx (TEE< bx, ect) baseline Pertinent co-morbidities or complications:  Laboratory monitoring required: Weekly CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, Alk phos, Tbili, vancomycin trough, ESR, CRP.
All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns.
#) AMS: She was noted to have fluctuating mental status with narcotic pain [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4982**], thus these were avoided to the extent possible with pain control primarily with Tylenol and subsequent improvement in her mentation to baseline per family.
#) Respiratory Failure: She was weaned off the ventilator post operatively and was subsequently weaned from a non-rebreather to 4L O2 on nasal canula in the ICU and finally to room air with excellent oxygen saturation on the general medicine floor.
#) Systolic CHF: She has a reported LVEF of 25% and requires 20 mg of Lasix daily at home.
Because of the intravenous fluids she as received while admitted this dose should be increased to 40 mg daily and titrated to her daily weight and creatinine.
#) Hypokalemia: Secondary to diuresis with Lasix required monitoring and potassium repletion to reflect Lasix dose as appropriate.
#) Iron Deficiency Anemia: She was started on ferrous sulfate 325mg daily while admitted.
#) Incontinence: She was incontinent at baseline and thus requires absorbent undergarment and miconazole powder QID.
#) DVT Prophylaxis was achieved with 5000 units of SC Heparin TID.
