Treated with IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] with resolution of symptoms, and began on heparin gtt (which was d/c in setting of g+ stools).
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent cardiac catheterization and had BMS placed to a 60% proximal RCA lesion with positive resting gradient by pressure wire.
She was started on a Nitroglycerin gtt at 180 mcg, then Nipride gtt, as well as given IV labetalol bolus (dose unspecified) to keep her sBP<180.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC HISTORY: prior Non-Q wave MI in [**4-13**] - CABG: None - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac cath in [**4-13**] with BMS placed to RCA (severe mid 90% lesion and diffuse 70% mid disease) - PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: as above, additionally -peripheral neuropathy -bilateral carotid stenosis (50-60%) -osteomyelitis/gangrene of right fourth toe s/p amputation in [**2182-5-4**] -s/p right SFA stenting in [**4-13**] -s/p L iliac angioplasty in [**2167**] -cataract surgery   Social History: - Retired nurse - Exercises daily - Tobacco history: currently uses [**2-6**] pack/week since age 16 - ETOH: denies - Illicit drugs: denies  Family History: - Father had CAD, MI in 60s, died from complications of cancer  Physical Exam: VS: 98.2, 69, 174/50, 23, 97% GENERAL: NAD.
The RCA had a 40% ostial lesion and a 60% proximal stenosis.
There was severe systemic arterial hypertension despite aggressive IV vasodilator therapy (SBP=184mmHg).
[**Hospital **] medical therapy and BP control.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo W with PMHx of CAD s/p POBA to LAD in 99, BMS to RCA in [**4-13**], PVD (s/p L iliac angio & R SFA stenting), HTN, HLD, IDDM presenting to OSH with elevated troponins and acute on chronic diastolic CHF, transferred for cath where she received BMS to prox RCA, and had significantly elevated blood pressures necessitating nitroglycerin and nipride gtts .
# Hypertensive Urgency: Patient had been receiving her home antihypertensive medication regimen at the OSH.
Per report, the day prior to transfer her pressures were elevated and supplemental labetalol was given.
During catheterization the patient was maxed on a nitroglycerin gtt, then started on a nitroprusside gtt to keep her SBPs <180.
Given her baseline poor renal function we discontinued the Nipride gtt and re-started the Nitroglycerin gtt, as well as re-started her outpatient antihypertensive regimen (except for Lisinopril during [**Last Name (un) **]).
She was easily weaned off the Nitroglycerine gtt and her blood pressure remained well controlled.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient presented to OSH with acute dyspnea, and had CXR findings of pulmonary edema and elevated troponin (peak 0.6, CKMB flat).
She was diuresed with IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] with subsequent improvement in her symptoms.
She was given IV Lasix boluses and diuresed over her hospital course.
She initially required supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations, but that improved with diuresis.
She was continued on Metoprolol, but Lisinopril was held given her acute on chronic kidney injury.
She was discharged on a decreased dose of Lasix 40 mg PO daily.
Her ace-inhibitor was held.
She was continued on ASA 325, Plavix 75, and Atorvastatin 80 daily.
She was also given a prescription for SL Nitro to take for chest pain in the future.
Given she had been on a heparin gtt, a head CT was obtained and negative for ICH.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended delirium work-up, frequent reorientation, transfer out of ICU, and Haldol if needed for agitation.
Haldol was not needed.
Has many microvascular and macrovascular complications including retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, CAD and PVD.
We monitored her FSBG levels, provided diabetic, consistent-carbohydrate diet, and continued her on her outpatient regimen of Glargine and Humalog SSI.
Takes Fe supplement as outpatient, which was held on admission, and re-started at discharge.
# HLD: Continued Atorvastatin 80 daily.
Her pain was controlled with tramadol and low dose oxycodone.
Upon discharge she was given a two day prescription for Percocet for pain relief, then told to re-start her Lyrica.
# GERD: We initially held her outpatient Omeprazole and started renally-dosed Famotidine given the patient's history of being on Plavix.
Famotidine was discontinued in the setting of acute kidney injury.
Upon discharge she was restarted on Omeprazole.
We provided her with a nicotine patch to reduce cravings.
