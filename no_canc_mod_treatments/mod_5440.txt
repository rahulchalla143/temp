He was initially empirically treated broadly with Ceftazadime and vancomycin which was transitioned to unasyn and vancomycin on admission to the ICU with the addition of steroids given septic clinical picture.
A central line was placed and he was given 3L NS prior to transfer to the ICU with improvement in BP not requiring pressors.
Steroids were not continued since [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was negative.
Antibiotics were weaned to Unasyn alone given only e. coli grew in the blood cultures and follow-up cultures have been negative with bandemia and fever resolved.
Pt had a mildly elevated Alk phos and GGT on admission so RUQ US was obtained to look for a source of the GNR bactermia but there were no signs of biliary obstruction or cholecystitis.
He was transiently on heparin gtt, but developed guaiac + stools and hematocrit drop requiring transfusions with prbc x2.
Heparin was discontinued, GI was consulted and an IVC filter was placed.
78 year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation recently in a nursing home because of a T12 compression fracture, presenting from his nursing home with lethargy and weakness, decreased appetite for several days with temperature to 101. .
A right internal jugular central line was placed.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and he patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidine.
The patient was initially given decadron as he had been recently on prednisone.
Felt to be no neurosurgical issue, transferred to MICU for further medical care.
Vancomycin and Ceftazidine were discontinued and the patient was transferred to the floor on Unasyn pending culture speciation.
End-stage renal disease on dialysis (MoWeFr) via left-sided AV fistula 2.
FINDINGS:  The evaluation of abdominal organs and major vessels are limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
The liver is diffusely hypodense measuring up to 78 [**Doctor Last Name **], probably due to iodine accumulation with amiodarone.
The patient is status post IVC placement just inferior to the renal veins.
New large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis, measuring up to 20 [**Doctor Last Name **], without evidence of concentration of high-density oral fluid-fluid levels.
Given the Hounsfield unit, this is probably a simple fluid, however, in the setting of anemia, hemorrhage component or abdominal bleed cannot be totally excluded especially given that ascites is new.
These findings are compatible with previous proctitis and involved the rectum from approximately 2 cm to 6 cm.
Obtain outside EGD and colonoscopy reports.
His cecal and proximal ascending angioectasias will not be amenable to endoscopic treatment since the process is so diffuse.
Definitive therapy would be a right hemi-colectomy   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with fever and gram-negative rod bacteremia.
A right internal jugular central line was placed.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and he patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidine.
The patient was initially given decadron as he had been recently on prednisone; this was discontinued as cortisol stimulation test showed an appropriate response.
Vancomycin and Ceftazidine were discontinued and the patient was transferred to the floor on Unasyn pending culture speciation.
Unasyn was discontinued and the patient was given a course of ciprofloxacin once speciation and sensitivities had returned E. coli, pan-sensitive.
IVC filter was placed [**12-10**] as patient could not tolerate heparin secondary to GI bleeding.
Patient underwent neurosurgical stablization of the affected area.
Neurosurgery removed staples on [**2112-1-4**].
After the colonoscopy, preventative surgery for the patient was discussed (hemicolectomy), with the family opting for a more conservative approach of following periodic hematocrits with transfusions as needed.
The patient was continued on hemodialysis per MWF schedule.
In addition, his renal medications were maintained.
The patient was seen by the endocrinology service during his stay and briefly required corticosteroids which were tapered before his discharge.
His synthroid dose was increased to 200mcg QD.
He had negative antibody screen for heparin induced thrombocytopenia and no clear medication precipitants.
His exposure to heparin with PIV and PICC flushes should be minimized and his platelet count should be checked serially (next check [**2113-1-5**]).
Patient is not on anticoagulation given history of GI bleed.
He was continued on amiodarone for rate control.
# Access: The patient has a right PICC which was placed on [**12-26**].
The PICC is being flushed with normal saline to minimize exposure to heparin given the patient's unexplained thrombocytopenia.
