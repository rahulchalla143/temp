She had Ancef and Flagyl perioperatively, and an NG tube and Foley were placed.
Overnight, on the floor, she became hypotensive, and a code was called at 0100 by the team, which gave Narcan 0.2, IV fluids and pressors, after which her SBP rose to the 120s and she became responsive.
On [**12-13**] she was weaned off pressors, received 2 units pRBC and received Bupivicaine and Fentanyl for pain.
She continued to improve clinically afterwards, and when was afebrile, with stable vital signs, and able to ambulate and tolerate PO intake, she was discharged, with VNA care at home.
