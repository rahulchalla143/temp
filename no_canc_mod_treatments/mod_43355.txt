His Coumadin was held and he was administered Vitamin K to reverse his INR in anticipation of interventional procedures.
He was kept on a sodium restricted diet.
His home medications were continued.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was next transferred to the CCU where a Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted under fluoroscopy through a femoral vein because of inability to pass it through the internal jugular vein.
Dobutamine therapy was started and continued in the CCU for two days.
The patient tolerated the Dobutamine well but did not symptomatically improve.
After two days of Dobutamine therapy, the patient was transferred back to C-Medicine where the Dobutamine drip was continued on the floor for several days, again with no clinical improvement.
The Dobutamine drip was subsequently discontinued.
It should be noted that the patient was maintained on heparin since he was off his Coumadin, in order to maintain anticoagulation for his known superior vena cava thrombus.
His heparin was discontinued prior to each procedure.
The epicardial leads were placed and the biventricular pacer upgrade was completed in two separate procedures over two days.
A chest tube was placed after the first procedure.
His chest tube was removed by the cardiothoracic surgery service with a residual small pneumothorax in the apex of the left lung.
Apex upon transfer back to C-Med, the patient's hematocrit was 24 and he was transfused with four units of packed red blood cells with the goal of bringing his hematocrit over 30.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4946**] systolic blood pressure ran an average between 80 and 100 throughout the hospitalization and his Carvedilol and Lisinopril were frequently held for this reason.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also had low urinary output near the end of his hospitalization which increased somewhat with the insertion of a Foley catheter.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was able to ambulate to his door at the end of his room and back with the help of physical therapy prior to discharge.
