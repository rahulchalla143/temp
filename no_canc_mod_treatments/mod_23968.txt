Notes describe approximately five seizure subtypes characterized by: 1) staring episodes lasting seconds; 2) the tonic extension of arms following deep inspiration; 3) head/upper extremity loss of tone following deep inspiration; 4) (secondarily) generalized tonic clonic seizures; 5) jerking of upper extremities.
Previously tried, and discontinued, anti-epileptic drugs include dilantin (frequent urination and dazed eyes), valproate (worsening seizures, malodorous bowel movements, excessive urination, glazed eyes), Tegretol (rash), and Ativan (excessive muscle weakness).
Rufinamide was started, and currently at 1200 mg [**Hospital1 **] and phenobarbital and clonazepam were continued at his prior doses.
He has received multiple doses of ativan and diazepam but has not yet received his scheduled evening medications.
While in the ED he continued to have frequent seizures despite benzodiazepines and was maintained on a non-rebreather.

Interictally, multifocal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was  usually of mixed frequencies and disorganized, suggestive of an encephalopathy, although abundant beta activity was seen at other times, which could be an effect of benzodiazepine medications.
Interictally, bifrontal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was slow and disorganized throughout much of the day's recording, suggestive of an encephalopathy, and rhythmic runs of frontal delta activity were seen intermittently lasting up to 10 seconds at a time.
The shorter bursts of interictal epileptiform activity were also more prominent on today's recording  EEG [**2150-6-30**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
However, frequent electrographic seizures were seen  characterized by bifrontal sharp waves recurring at a two per second frequency and many of these lasted longer than 30 seconds.
This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations for various behaviors including vocalization as well as grimacing that did not have an electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2150-7-5**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to brief electrographic seizures, as mentioned above.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2427**] was admitted to neurology ICU service for evaluation and treatment of increasing frequency of seizures.
He underwent continuous video EEG montioring throughout most of his hospital course.
Initially he was having near continuous seizure activity and was given loading doses of dilantin, keppra as well as phenobarbital for control of seizures.
the development of pneumonia coupled with tapered off doses of seizure medications during last admission , probabaly constituted for increased seizure frequency.
He was closely followed by epilepsy team and rufinamide was increased to 1600 [**Hospital1 **], keppra to [**2140**] [**Hospital1 **], and topiramate was increased to its dose prior to recent taper (250 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
He was started on standing diazepam 5 mg q6 h IV for seizure control.
Ativan prn 1-2m mg IV was on call for any prolonged or frequent seizures.
He had good seizure control with addition of dilantin, but after persistent fevers and rash presumed to be caused by this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (as described below), dilantin was tapered off, receiving his last dose 6/12.
He had occasional brief clusters of [**4-27**] events of head turning and stiffening, lasting seconds at a time, usually no more than [**1-24**] clusters per day, and occasionally received ativan 1 mg after clusters in addition to his standing medications.
The cultures were sent and he was started on broad spectrum cover for nosocomial bacteria with vancomycin, zosyn and cipro.
After sputum grew E Coli - sensitive to zosyn, the other 2 antibiotics were stopped.
A suspicion of drug-related fever and rash were raised and the patient's dilantin and zosyn were discontinued.
He has been saturating well on room air but it is recommended he use 2L O2 via nasal cannula at night for sleep apnea as started during his last admission.

Your keppra, rufinamide, and topamax were increased, and your clonopin was replaced by valium.
You completed a seven-day course of antibiotics for your infection.
After this, you continued to have fevers which were thought to be related to phenytoin, which have resolved after this medication was discontinued.
Changes in seizure medications; -Keppra increased to [**2140**] mg twice daily -Rufinamide increased to 1600 mg twice daily -Topiramate increased to 250 mg twice daily -Clonazepam was discontinued -Valium was started at 5 mg four times daily   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in [**1-24**] months.
