CAD: He has a history of severe 3vd, s/p CABG with recent catheterization showing patent grafts with totally occluded native vessels.
He is not a candidate for any further intervention at this time.
He was continued on his outpatient regimen of Coreg, Lisinopril, and Imdur (Imdur at decreased dose of 60 mg daily secondary to low systolic blood pressures).
CHF: He has a known ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
He was initially started on a lasix drip.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure given his pulmonary edema.
Diuresis was continued with IV lasix with good effect.
He also received 1 day of lasix with zaroxalyn to maximize diuresis.
Rhythm: He was tachycardic on admission after dopamine (SVT), and he then had episodes of ?ventricular tachycardia.
He was continued on his amiodarone and had no further events on telemetry.
He was extubated on Hospital day 2 and remained stable on nasal cannula O2.
He spiked a fever >101.5 during admission, but no source was ever identified and antibiotics were not started.
Serial CXR's were checked to rule out hemothorax given arterial stick when subclavian line was attempted.
He required 1 U PRBC while in-house for a hct of 26.9.
