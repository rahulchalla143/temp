REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems on admission was negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, sputum production, night sweats, cough, visual changes, dysuria, headache, neck stiffness, and new motor symptoms.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2114**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (The patient's medications on admission were as follows)  1.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Atenolol 150 mg p.o.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
NPH insulin 28 units q.a.m.

T-PA and papaverine were instilled into the superior mesenteric artery with some clearance of clot and vasodilation.
Based on these findings, surgery was offered to the patient and family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] of General Surgery.
After hearing Dr.[**Name (NI) 1745**] description of the extensive surgery and multiple ostomies that would likely be necessary to remove necrotic bowel, the patient and his family refused surgical intervention.
However, on hospital day four, the family decided that they would like medical treatment for his hypotension.
The patient was started on a Levophed drip.
On the morning on hospital day five, the patient's respiratory status declined precipitously with saturations in the middle 80s on 100% nonrebreather.
Given the futility of pressors for treatment of mesenteric ischemia without surgical intervention, and the patient's worsening arrhythmias, the Levophed was stopped on the morning on hospital day five.
The patient's pressure slowly declined, although he remained comfortable on a morphine drip and he eventually died on [**2117-4-16**] at 10:30 a.m.
