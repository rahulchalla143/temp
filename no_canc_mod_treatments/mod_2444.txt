[**9-10**]: failed PTCA attempt (RCFA 8F) [**9-11**]: PTCA of LAD (RCFA 6F) [**9-15**]: R fem-plantar thrombectomy   History of Present Illness: 85 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p 4VCABG in [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), T2DM, HTN, and PVD, with multiple recent admissions for cath with stenting, last from [**Date range (1) 14629**] at which time cath revealed known occluded LIMA-LAD with non-flow limiting lesions in other grafts, and a discrete 90% stenosis of D1 that was ballooned, presenting from [**Hospital 882**] hospital with concern for STEMI.
He was recently discharged on [**9-2**], with hospital course notable, in addition to POBA of D1, for persistent CK elevation with normal MBI, thought to be myositis secondary to statin use and his statin was discontinued.
He was given an [**Hospital1 **] and started on a heparin drip.
A UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin due to concern for urosepsis.
The heparin drip was discontinued as ischemia was felt to be less likely at that point.
He was restarted on a heparin drip and arrangments were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
Unfortunately the lesion was difficult to cross and the procedure was aborted after 78 minutes of fluoro time and 230 cc of contrast, with plans for possible re-catheterization the next day.
The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab, and another 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU, with almost 2 L urine output within 2 hours of CCU arrival.
He does complain of right leg pain.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD, s/p 4VCABG [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), with bare metal stent to LAD in [**6-13**], as well as POBA to D1 in [**8-13**].
2) HTN 3) Hyperlipidemia 4) SVT 5) PVD 6) T2DM 7) CHF, EF 40-45% 8) Prostate CA (treated w/ Lupron injections, seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], most recent PSA 12.6)  Social History: Per prior notes, former [**Company 2318**] engineer, works as [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital1 14630**].

CAD: Patient pmh included CAD status post CABG in [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), with 2 recent stents to LAD and D1, and he was transferred from OSH with concern for new ST elevations and increase in cardiac enzymes.
Due to length of procedure and concern for overexposure to fluoroscopy and dye-load, procedure was stopped and repeated on [**9-11**] with different fluoro angle.
On the repeat attempt, balloon was passed and stent was placed in the LAD.
Patient was continued on Plavix and [**Month/Day (4) **].
Statin had been discontinued following last hospital stay (discharged [**9-4**]) due to concern about increased LFTs.
Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were held during stay due to low blood pressure.
Subsequent culture with sensitivity demonstrated resistance to levoquin and patient switched to piperacillin-tazobactam.
After confirming with the OSH laboratory, there was felt to be no concern for ESBL and he was discharged on Augmentin given sensitivity to Unasyn.
He will be treated for a total of 7 days after being started on Zosyn so he will complete a 5 day course of Augmentin after discharge.
Patient was started on coumadin and bridged with heparin to prevent clot formation.
He was discharged on Lovenox until INR therapeutic and Coumadin will be continued for at least 6 months until repeat echo.
Amiodarone was briefly stopped during admission and patient had some runs of asymptomatic SVT.
Pt tolerated the procedure well.
Pt started on heparin drip and coumadin.
On DC pt on lovenox to coumadin bridge.
