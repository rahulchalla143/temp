He denied seizure-like activity, changes in vision, headache, language difficulties, or asymmetric weakness.
Of note, pt has been noncompliant with his tacrolimus for the past 3 doses as he ran out of his medications, and he may have taken double his usual dose of Tacrolimus the evening before presentation.
Pt denies any associated symptoms of cough, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or dysuria.
In the ED, he was found to be hypoxic in the 60s on room air, and was placed on a NRB with PO2 in the mid 80s.
The patient was initially started on Vancomycin 1gm, Cefepime 2gm, and Levofloxacin 750mg IV.
In the MICU, pt appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR, with BNP [**Numeric Identifier 28490**], so he was kept on lasix.
His gabapentin was discontinued.
Valsartan was held pending Cre normalization.
Warfarin was restarted that day at 1/2 dose.

ABDOMEN: Evaluation of abdominal viscera is limited by lack of intravenous contrast.
An NG tube is present within the stomach.
PELVIS: The bladder contains a Foley catheter and is otherwise normal appearing.
Deformity in the posterior left ribs might be the result of prior fractures.
Chest xray [**2188-8-24**]: 6 am FINDINGS: Single portable chest radiograph excluding left lung base from view demonstrates endotracheal tube with tip positioned 5 cm above the carina.
The nasogastric tube is seen coursing out of view with tip position not evaluated.
Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
Endotracheal tube well positioned.
Nasogastric tube passing out of view.

He was intubated for hypoxia in the ED.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage on admission ([**2188-8-24**]).
He was extubated on [**2188-8-25**], and started taking PO without difficulty.
Cefepime and vancomycin was stopped on [**2188-8-26**], and levofloxacin was stopped on [**2188-8-27**].
He was maintained on home dose Lasix with gentle goal negative diuresis.
He was continued on Metoprolol.
Valsartan was held given high Cre on admission (see below).
Renal consult recommended to continue holding valsartan since his SBPs were 100s-110s, and recommended PCP to restart valsartan once his SBPs have stabilized to baseline.
Renal also recommended pt to be discharged on home lasix regimen (20 mg PO BID), with instructions to double his morning lasix dose (to 40 mg) as needed for pedal edema.
There were no apparent sources of bleeding throughout hospital course, and pt endorsed only dry clots of blood in his sputum (no blood in stool or urine).
Pt remained asymptomatic, and it is possible his Hct changes were from hemodilution due to profound fluid shifts.
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt's platelet count on admission was 163 (baseline 150s-200s), and dropped to 119 on [**2188-8-25**] (107 on discharge), in parallel with Hct changes above.
s/p kidney transplant:  Transplant in [**2180**], on tacrolimus and prednisone but pt may have missed his last 3 tacrolimus doses prior to admission because he ran out of his medications.
His tacrolimus level was low at 3.1 on admission, and his dosing was adjusted per Renal Transplant recommendations, to 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1-2 days.
His last tacrolimus level prior to discharge was 10.8, so renal recommended decreasing his dose back down to his home regimen (0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
His home prednisone was continued, as well as home batrim three times weekly for prophylaxis.
Acute renal failure:  The patient initially presented with acute on chronic renail failure with Cre 2.7 on presentation.
This was likely due to poor perfusion from heart failure exacerbation, and Cre improved to baseline of 1.9-2.0 with gentle Lasix diuresis.
His history suggests this may be related to recent medication changes, such as skipped tacrolimus doses on admission, or recently restarted gabapentin doses (per pt, both these medication changes have been associated with myoclonic episodes in the past).
Gabapentin was held throughout hospital course, and he no longer had any evidence of myoclonus after transfer to Medicine.
Coumadin was re-started at 1.5 mg daily when his hct remained stable on [**2188-8-26**].
His INR rose to 2.2 but was 1.5 on discharge, so his warfarin was increased to 3 mg daily.
We recommend continued INR check-ups and follow-up on warfarin dosing.
Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient with history of NSTEMI in the past, s/p atherectomy of the LAD [**2176**], DES to mid-LAD, ISRS [**2180**] s/p DES to mid-LAD, ISRS s/p POBA [**2185**], s/p CABG.
Valsartan was held as above.
Simvastatin was initially held but re-started when initial mild transaminitis normalized.
Diabetes:  Continued insulin in-house with sliding scale.
Hypertension:  Continued home Metoprolol and lasix.
Valsartan was held per above.
Hyperlipidemia:  Held home statins initially given elevated LFTs but was restarted on Simvastatin when LFTs improved.
Held Gabapentin as above, managed with home Oxycodone, Fentanyl patch.
Please follow-up INR and modify pt's warfarin regimen accordingly.
***Please recheck blood pressure and consider re-starting valsartan for pt's heart failure.
***Please continue to monitor pt's electrolytes (in particular, potassium and Cre).
