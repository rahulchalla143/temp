Common causes of encephalopathy include medications, metabolic causes, infections, and anoxia.

Seizures with Post-Ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis: The patient is a 43 year old woman with a history of secondary progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54182**], bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and baseline bilateral lower extremity paresis who presented with 3 GTC seizures, and was then found to have new onset left sided weakness.
A code stroke was called in the ED for new onset left sided weakness after the last seizure (of note, she has at baseline bilateral inferior limb paresis and right hemibody paresis).
She continued to be tachycardic, so the neurology team was concerned for status epilepticus and gave her Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Dilantin load.
She was briefly on empiric Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Acyclovir.
She was discharged on Trileptal 450 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her Topamax and Amytriptyline were discontinued given her altered mental status.
While the patient was on the Neurology floor, she continued to have altered mental status including disorientation to place and date, and uncooperativity with the physical exam.
Urine culture did show Acinetobacter baumanni complex, so she was treated with Bactrim for a 10 day course.
Her Keppra, Topamax, and Amytriptyline were discontinued as these may have been contributing to her encephalopathy.
She has an indwelling catheter, and we elected to treat her with Bactrim [**Hospital1 **] x10 days.
