LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation CBC revealed a white count of 24.8, a hematocrit of 33.5, platelet count 417,000; CHEM7 revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 5.5, chloride 100, bicarb 25, BUN 45, creatinine 1.0, glucose 527; coag studies revealed PT 14.1, PTT 24, INR 1.3; urinalysis revealed large blood and nitrite positive, 22 red blood cells, 6 white blood cells, occasional bacteria; blood cultures were sent with 1 out of 2 bottles coming back positive for diphtheroids, this was presumed to be contaminant, although it would have been covered by subsequent antibiotic treatment; ABG revealed a pH of 7.53, pCO2 38, pO2 52.
Urine culture taken on admission later revealed growth of Proteus mirabilis.
The patient was intubated emergently and started on Dopamine after which her systolic blood pressure rose to the 90s and 100s.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit course is notable for the following events:  The patient was started on Vancomycin 750 mg IV q.24 hours, as well as Flagyl 500 mg per PEG tube q.8 hours on the evening [**8-7**] and the morning of [**8-8**].
[**8-8**] through [**8-9**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dipped again down into the 70s, and thus she was restarted on pressors.
A hematocrit drop over the previous several days from 33.5 to 27.8 to 25.9 prompted a transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood cells with an appropriately elevated hematocrit thereafter.
The patient was started on Ampicillin 2 g IV q.12 hours on [**8-11**].
On [**8-14**], the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% on shovel mask and was subsequently transferred to the Medicine floor.
Also, a PICC line was placed on the evening of [**2174-8-16**].
Otherwise, her course was stable, and she continued to do well on oxygenation by mask.
