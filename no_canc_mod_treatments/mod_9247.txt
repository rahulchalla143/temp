The patient was treated with immunosuppressants including CellCept 1 gm [**Hospital1 **], Neoral and prednisone.
Orthotopic liver transplant on [**2173-7-7**].
The patient was begun on broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics, as stated, including vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Zosyn.
As stated, he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
On the [**9-30**], the patient underwent CT-guided drainage of his biloma.
On [**10-10**], the patient received an offer for a cadaveric liver, and on [**10-10**] the patient underwent cadaveric renal transplantation.
This transplant was done in an orthotopic fashion.
The portal vein was end-to-end and the duct was duct-to-duct with a T-tube placed.
The patient received Simulect at the time of retransplantation and again on day 4.
The patient was given 500 mg of steroid of Solu-Medrol on day 0 and day 1, and started on a steroid taper.
The patient was also continued on mycophenolate and Prograf.
Postoperative course was significant for delayed graft function/primary cholestasis.
The patient had full investigations including tube cholangiograms which were normal, CT scanning with IV contrast which demonstrated a small wasting of the portal vein with good flow through the portal vein, and a small residual stenosis of IVC with good flow in the IVC.
This is status post previous angioplasty.
The patient had a mesenteric A gram that demonstrated the hepatic-splenic artery anastomosis to be intact with good flow and perfusion of the left and right hepatic arteries without evidence of stenosis.
With his increasing bilirubin, the patient required reintubation for decreased mental status and inability to clear his respiratory secretions.

All of the patient's cultures were negative, and all of his antibiotics were completed.
Although the patient was weak, he would ambulate with a walker and with assistance.
The patient's bilirubin, as stated, decreased and was meeting all of his goal nutrition with tube feeds and was tolerating a PO diet.
The patient's pigtail catheter was putting out approximately 100-120 cc a day of a small pancreatic fluid collection.
The patient was maintained on Insulin sliding scale, bactrim single-strength 1 qd, labetalol 100 po bid, clonidine 0.4 tid, hydralazine 75 qid, Epogen 10,000 U subcu q Monday, nystatin 5 cc qid, Actigall 300 mg po qid, Prevacid 30 mg po qd, colace 100 mg po bid, lithium 300 mg po qid, fluconazole 400 mg qd.

Prednisone 10 mg po qd.
Prograf 1 mg po bid.
Bactrim single-strength tablets 1 tablet po qd.
