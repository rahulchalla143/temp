Admission Date:  [**2192-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-3-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2125-6-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 38466**] is a 66 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, restricted lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea and ventricular tachycardia status post pacemaker defibrillator, who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2-6**], ten days before admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for severe leg pain and bilateral necrotic leg ulcers.
The patient, at the outside hospital, was started on intravenous steroids and transitioned to p.o.
Also at the outside hospital, his INR got elevated; this was felt secondary to antibiotics given to him for a possibility of cellulitis.
It corrected with Vitamin K.  At the outside hospital he had been followed by Rheumatology, Dermatology and Nephrology.
His white blood cell count was noted elevated on admission and continued to increase but this was felt to be too large for a steroid dose.
At the outside hospital, he was afebrile with negative blood cultures and skin cultures.
Skin biopsies were performed which did not support the diagnosis of vasculitis per report, although no specific details of the biopsy were available.
History of ventricular tachycardia status post pacer and defibrillator.
Gout on Celebrex and Prednisone for the past six months prior to admission.
The Prednisone dose was 10 mg a day.
Coumadin 2.5 and 5 mg alternating.
Levoxyl 100 micrograms q. day.
Betapace 120 mg twice a day.
Prednisone 5 to 10 alternating.
Zaroxolyn 2.5 q. day.
Spironolactone 25 q. day.
Nexium 40 q. day.
Prednisone 10 q. day.
Betapace 120 q. a.m., 80 q. p.m. 4.
Nystatin Powder to groin.
Bumex 2 mg q. day.
Glipizide 10 mg q. day.
Levaquin 500 mg q. day.
Vancomycin 1 gram q. day.
ALLERGIES:   Penicillin and Allopurinol, both of which gave him a rash.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Firm where he would thus begin what would be a long hospital course:  Initially admitted to the Medicine [**Hospital 38467**] transferred to Vascular for surgery and then transferred back to Medicine for medical management prior to discharge.
He then went back on [**3-14**], for a skin graft from his abdomen to his right leg.
He was evaluated by the Electrophysiology Service for this and his Betapace was stopped due to his renal failure, but he was started on Amiodarone.
Approximately ten days before discharge, it was deemed that because of his ophthalmologic problems (see details below), that Amiodarone was a possible cause since one of its side effects is optic neuritis.
The patient also reported that Amiodarone in the past had caused optic neuritis.
They recommended that he should be discharged to rehabilitation and then approximately a month or two later he could come back and seek Cardiology care and he could go for an EP procedure and have his pacemaker changed.
At the time of discharge, he had not had a dialysis for four days and his creatinine had remained in the mid-3 range.
At the time of this dictation, the Renal Team did not think he would need any further dialysis and plans were being put into place to remove his dialysis catheter.
He was given six units of blood and his repeat hematocrit was unchanged.
Iron studies were done and he was slightly iron deficient so he was given iron supplementation.
Hemolysis labs were unrevealing as well during this work-up.
The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
On [**2-19**], the patient had a catheter tip from one of his lines come back positive for Enterococcus, resistant to Vancomycin.
The Infectious Disease Team did not think treatment with Liosol was indicated.
The patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics which consisted of Flagyl, Vancomycin and Ceptaz.
His white count was elevated, but this was believed to be secondary to the large doses of steroids he was receiving for his ophthalmalgic issues.
He was stopped on steroids two days prior to discharge.
We found these resolved when the patient was taken off of his opioids.
Because of this, we have advised him on discharge to avoid being treated with massive doses of opioids.
