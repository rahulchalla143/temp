He was hemodynamically stable with nitroglycerin and fluid resuscitation.
He returned to the operating room for exploration of left subclavian artery and angioplasty by [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] surgery on postoperative day one.
Due to prolonged ischemia he underwent fasciotomy of left arm.
Over the first few days postoperative days he remained intubated requiring increased PEEP for hypoxia and supportive care.
On postoperative day three he had decreased urine output however myoglobin was decreasing from admission and CK decreasing from peak of  55,950 and receiving fluid.
He continued with oliguria and was treated with diuretics but no response.
Renal was consulted and he was started on ultrafiltrate for volume removal on [**2106-4-4**].
He remained intubated and sedated due to volume overload however hemodynamically stable on heparin for mechanical aortic valve with resolving rhabdomylosis.
He continued with ultrafiltrate for fluid removal, and intubated.
On [**4-6**] due to increased white blood cell count he was started on antibiotics to cover sputum that had gram negative and gram positive, and lines were changed.
He developed a rash on vancomycin and zosyn, the vancomycin was stopped and the zosyn was changed to meropenum.
The rash progressively resolved, and the meropenum was discontinued after course completed.
He continued on ultrafiltrate with aggressive fluid removal until [**2106-4-8**], and he was monitored for the next few days but restarted ultrafiltrate due to increased ventilatory requirements.
After volume was removed he was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on [**4-12**], however due respiratory difficulty and hypoxia he was reintubated.
On [**4-22**] he was transferred to rehabilitation at [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation Center.
