The patient has a documented history of an allergy to augmentin resulting inpresyncope, nausea and vomiting in the past, but was treated post-op with cefazolin x 3 doses.
On [**3-27**], she developed a macular rash on her back and shoulders which then spread to her palms and soles with some desquamation of the skin on her back and spread diffusely throughout her body, as well as swelling of her hands and feet.
She was evaluated by dermatology at [**Location (un) **] who felt her skin findings were may have been consistent with a drug reaction as the patient has sensitivity to Augmentin and was placed on cefazolin which has cross-reactivity with pencillins.
She underwent a second ortho procedure on [**2146-3-31**], the patient received one dose of vancomycin as a result.
Pertienet to her OSH course, the patient also reports that she received 3 units of blood during her ORIF.
She was treated for a presumed UTI with urine cultures and blood cultures pending.
On arrival, the patient was felt to be in mild respiratory distress and placed on a high flow mask 35% FiO2 and did not require intubation.
It was negative for PE but did reveal b/l pleural effusions with atelectasis and emphysema and questionable small area of devloping PNA, and an Echo with Ef>55%, normal RV size and motionShe as strted on levo/flagyl and continued on nebs with significant improvemnt in her O2 sats to 95 % on 6 L FM.
RA on chronic low dose prednisone, methotrexate and etanercept which was held recently secondary to bacterial sinusitis and ORIF *SLE with no known renal involvement, on chronic prednisone 2.
GERD with Schatzki ring requiring endoscopy 6.
Skin - Diffuse, desquamating, confluent, erythematous, blanching macular rash.

IMPRESSION: Status post fixation of comminuted fracture of the proximal femur with proximal lateral apex angulation with somewhat unusual alignment.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 yo F with COPD, RA, SLE s/p femur fracture and ORIF with significant residual displacement s/p redo [**4-15**], s/p several admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress with tachypnea now with respiratory distress again with tachypnea, hypoxia, unclear etiology and trigger.
She was treated for a COPD flare as chest x-ray was negative for CHF and pneumonia.
She was extubated the next day but remained tachypneic with O2 sats improved to 95% on 6L FM and was started empirically on Levo/Flagyl for ?PNA and completed course on [**4-15**] (8 day course).
The patient was sent to the floor again and the floor team optimized her respiratory status optimized prior to OR with diuresis with 10 IV lasix daily and frequent nebs although diuresis did not seem to improve sxs significantly.
Pt was maintained on Lovenox 30 mg SC BID for DVT ppx.
Pulmonary team was consulted regarding ongoing hypoxemia and diff dx still included persistent mild CHF, fat emboli, or mucus plugging and recommended continued diuresis and IS.
Pt had left femoral revision on [**4-15**], was intubated for surgery and extubated without event and actually seemed improved per floor team with pain meds.
PE was thought to be less likely given negative CTA on [**4-6**] and on DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox.
Her respiratory distress was thought to be more likely secondary to mucous plugging and anxiety as pt was able to breathe better after coughing up thick mucous sputum and placed on haldol for anxiety.
ENT was also consulted given her respiratory distress,intubation and hoarse voice and noted sluggish R vocal cord and recommended decadron, nasal saline spray for 2 weeks and avoiding nasal cannula at all costs.
