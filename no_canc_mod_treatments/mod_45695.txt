Name: [**Known lastname 7379**],[**Known firstname 7380**] L            Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 7381**]  Admission Date:  [**2104-12-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2105-1-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-12-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 7382**] is a 56 year old woman with coronary artery disease, Type 1 diabetes mellitus who was in her usual state of health until roughly one to two weeks prior to admission when she started to experience chest pressure, relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
She took one sublingual Nitroglycerin which relieved the pain, however, the pressure then returned 30 minutes later and was again relieved with one sublingual Nitroglycerin and then returned soon after as a sharp mid sternal chest pain not relieved by Nitroglycerin.
At the outside hospital she was treated with 15 mg of Lopressor intravenously and made painfree with 10 mg of Morphine.
She was also treated with Aspirin, Aggrastat and a nitroglycerin drip as well as heparin.
Coronary artery disease, angioplasty in [**2097**].
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.
Lopressor 75 mg b.i.d.
Insulin 20 NPH in the morning with 10 of regular, regular insulin sliding scale, 24 units of NPH at night.
Lasix 80 q.d.
Zoloft 50 q.d.
Lipitor 10 q.d.
Nitroglycerin prn; 7.
Vitamin C.  ALLERGIES:  Bactrim which causes nausea and Biaxin which causes nausea.
Data at our hospital four hours after the first set of enzymes at the outside hospital showed a creatinine kinase of 377, MB 44 and index of 11.7 and troponin had bumped to 37.8, hemoglobin A1c was pending.
Cardiovascular - The patient was started on Captopril 6.25 t.i.d.
She was given Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
as tolerated, intravenous fluid boluses for hypotension.
She was started on a GP2B3A inhibitor precatheterization and continued on Heparin, Lipitor and Aspirin.
All vessels were small in caliber and diffusely diseased, therefore making stenting impossible.
The patient was continued on Metoprolol.
Her ACE was held after cardiac catheterization for renal protective reasons.
She was given gentle intravenous fluids and continued on Plavix and aspirin, heparin was discontinued after catheterization.
As the right coronary artery lesion was complex and not stented due to the high risk of restenosis it was decided to perform a nuclear ETT to further quantitate the level of ischemia from this lesion and determine if the patient needed emergent/aggressive measures now versus waiting for the future drug-eluding stent.
With this amount of reversible defects it was decided that the patient should go to cardiac catheterization to have intervention on the occluded right coronary artery.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the proximal and mid right coronary artery was performed using a 2.5 by 28 mm pixel stent distally and a 3.0 by 33 mm zeta stent proximally.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
She was continued on beta blocker, her ACE was added back [**Company 7384**].i.d.
She was continued on Aspirin, Plavix and a statin.
The patient was discharged to home after observation status post stenting on [**2105-1-7**].
For the patient's known congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of roughly 30%, she was given gentle intravenous Lasix for diuresis.
As stated above, the patient was continued on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.
and the ACE inhibitor was titrated up to Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
The patient was discharged on [**2105-1-7**] on the following cardiac regimen, Lisinopril 5 q.d., Atenolol 25 q.d., Plavix 75 q.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Aspirin 325 q.d.
and Lasix 20 q.d.
She was continued on a Humalog sliding scale and she was continued on her NPH in the morning and in the evening.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked on [**2104-12-31**] which came back at 7.0 indicating relatively good control of her blood sugars.
The patient was started on Lantis during her hospital course.
Different insulin permeations were tried during her hospital course.
Based on the patient's hemoglobin A1c she had relatively good glucose control at home on her prior regimen, therefore she was discharged on her prior regimen of NPH 20 q.
AM, NPH 24 q. PM, regular insulin 10 units q.
She was initially treated with Ciprofloxacin for this urinary tract infection.
The urine culture grew out Klebsiella which was sensitive to Levofloxacin and therefore the patient was continued on Ciprofloxacin for a five day course.
AM, NPH 20 units q.
Regular insulin sliding scale with dinner 3.
Lisinopril 5 q.d.
Atenolol 25 q.d.
Plavix 75 q.d.
Lipitor 10 q.d.
Protonix 40 q.d.
Reglan 10 b.i.d.
Iron 325 q.d.
Aspirin 325 q.d.
Zoloft 50 q.d.
Lasix 20 q.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to have [**Hospital6 2050**] for medication review and diabetes management.
