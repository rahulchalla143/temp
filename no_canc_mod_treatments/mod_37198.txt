Was taken off of BiPAP overnight and maintain saturation on non-rebreather mask.
Following intubation patient initially saturating in mid to high 80s.
Patient was noted to be asynchronous with vent and her sedation was uptitrated followed by initiation of cisatracurium.
Initial difficulty with oxygenation improved after neuromuscular blockade.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy with specimens sent for micro and cytology.
While no microbiologic cause of respiratory failure was identified the patient was maintained on an empiric 7 day course of broad spectrum antibiotics.
Following extubation patient did not complain of dyspnea and was noted to be saturating well on supplemental O2 by nasal canula.
# ARDS Patient with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and low PaO2/FiO2 consistant with ARDS.
Was maintained on ARDS net ventilation protocol until successful extubation.
# [**Last Name (un) **] Experienced oliguria and progressive Cr increase after a hypotensive episode with intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation.
# Electrolytes Patient intermittently required free water repletion for hypernatremia and various electrolyte repletions during her critical illness.
Initially felt to be secondary to continued benzodiazapine activity as she spent multiple days on a Versed drip for sedation.
Her mental status worsened in spite of being off of Versed and an empiric course of lactulose was started for hepatic encephalopathy.
She was then successfully extubated and maintained on PO lactulose titrated to 3 bowel movements per day.
Started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but no microbiologic etiology was ever identified.
Was treated with Levofloxacin in spite of prolonged QTc as atypical causes of pneumonia could not be ruled out and patient's respiratory status represented a major life threat.
- please decrease Lasix dose as appropriate so that her goal I/O is even.
- please taper off steroids with Prendisone 20mg [**8-18**], then 10mg [**Date range (1) 15491**], then STOP.
