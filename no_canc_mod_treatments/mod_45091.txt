ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  HOSPITAL COURSE (continued):  Over the next few days in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's significant systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction continued to be managed with Hydralazine, nitrites and beta blocker.
Persistent efforts at medical management were maintained with continuation of beta blocker therapy, Hydralazine and nitrates for improved forward flow, however, the patient's blood pressure did not always tolerate the continuation of these medications.
The patient continued to be alternately treated with small fluid challenges for intermittent hypotension which had to be subsequently followed with efforts at diuresis, given the initiation of shortness of breath and decreasing oxygen saturations.
Given the patient's significant cardiac dysfunction which has persisted for a long time and which had resulted in the significant decrease in her baseline functional capacity, as well as her associated renal insufficiency and sacral decubitus wound complications, a family meeting was held with the patient as well as her husband to discuss goals of care.
Given that the patient was responding poorly to optimal medical management, no further interventions were requested at that time.
The patient and her husband agreed that she should be made "DO NOT RESUSCITATE", "DO NOT INTUBATE", and that the focus should be changed from optimal management to comfort measures.
She was provided with morphine and Ativan as needed for dyspnea as well as complaints of air hunger.
The patient required increasing doses of morphine therapy, both for pain in her sacral decubitus wound as well as for increasing dyspnea and severe air hunger.
