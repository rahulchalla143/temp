Brief Hospital Course: 85 year man with a history of CAD s/p recent CABG, AFib, s/p recent cholangitis and ERCP, post-ERCP pancreatitis, presented with a change in mental status and hypotension after receiving benzodiazepines and narcotics for aggitation.
#  Hypotension: The patient was initially started on levophed but weaned off in less than 24 hours.
Upon admission he received a total of 1L NS boluses to stablize his blood pressure.
A CT head on [**2162-4-8**] showed no acute pathology, and an MRI head was not performed due to concern of pacer wires (reportedly in place but not seen on CXR) and metal clips in his sinuses.
It is very important to avoid narcotics, benzodiazepines in this patient as he becomes hypotensive after administration of these medications.
Zyprexa can be used but at much lower doses: start at 1mg of zyprexa and increase as needed.
Haldol can also be used but should be started at very low doses.
A PEG tube lavage was heme negative, and on rectal exam the patient had an internal hemorroid.
His sputum grew out stenotrophomonas [**2162-4-12**], and the patient completed a course of bactrim which he had started pre-hospital.
MRI was not performed due to the pacer wires in his heart.
Pacing wires which were placed in [**State 108**] were reportedly clipped (but NOT pulled) during his last admission.
The wires were not visualized on CXR, but the concern that wires may be in place caused the patient not to get an MRI.
While in hospital the patient was rate controlled on amiodarone, and his coumadin was held for two day due to a slow lower GIB.
His coumadin was restarted in hospital and his hct remained stable between 28-30.
#  HTN: Antihypertensive medications were held in the setting of hypotension and recently started on hemodialysis.
Patient was given epogen q HD.
# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was continued on his ASA and his statin.
His beta-blocker was held for relative hypotension.
