The patient was given aspirin, nitroglycerin, and a heparin drip was started for emergent angioplasty and catheterization.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home were Depakote, enteric-coated aspirin, and triamterene.
Cardiolipin antibodies were pending, as were homocystine.
He also had CK/MB and troponin drawn.
His nitroglycerin was weaned off.
His heparin was discontinued.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted, and the patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who noted his history and that he had associated moderate aortic insufficiency with this vegetation on his aortic valve, left coronary leaflet.
Over the course of the next two weeks he was treated for his bacterial endocarditis by Infectious Disease and Cardiology with antibiotic therapy.
His antibiotics were held, and he had mild renal insufficiency upon the recommendations of Infectious Disease.
He remained febrile with no neurologic complaints and continued to ambulate while he awaited surgery for his aortic valve endocarditis.
He had a left lung infiltrate on [**1-1**], so levofloxacin was added into the antibiotic regimen along with the ceftriaxone.
Gentamicin was also added into his coverage for treatment of pneumonia.
He remained hemodynamically stable as he continued his antibiotic therapy.
On [**1-5**] he has his dental surgery to remove his infected teeth.
He continued to have both his systolic ejection murmur and his diastolic murmur, and was continued on antibiotics.
He continued with increased intravenous fluids therapy and hydration for the mild increase in his creatinine, and BUN decrease, and continued to remain febrile but was hemodynamically stable.
[**Last Name (STitle) 21663**] again on [**1-7**] by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of Cardiology Surgery who was following his progress and the timing of his surgery.
On [**1-10**] he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit, and he remained stable with no evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.
On[**1-12**] he underwent a homograft aortic root replacement with valve and a resection of his aortic root left ventricular abscess.
His left circumflex outflow track was repaired and reconstructed with a pericardial patch, and he had a repair of his mitral valve after debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
On postoperative day one, he remained sedated on a Nipride drip at 2 mcg/kg per minute and a propofol drip at 50.
He continued on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin per Infectious Disease.
He remained intubated and sedated on his double antibiotic therapy with a heart rate slightly tachycardic in the 100s.
He started a labetalol intravenous drip for better control of his blood pressure as well as some Lasix diuresis.
His Nipride was restarted for blood pressure control.
His amiodarone was switched to p.o.
His Lopressor was increased to 100 mg p.o.
His Lasix was discontinued.
He continued on antibiotic therapy, and central venous line was discontinued.
He continued on double antibiotic therapy.
On [**1-16**], the chief resident noted that he had an adequate beta blockade on 150 mg of Lopressor b.i.d., so he was put back on Nipride to bring down his blood pressure acutely to a goal of 130 systolic.
He was started on diltiazem 30 mg q.6h.
and hydralazine 10 mg to 25 mg intravenous q.6h.
A left chest tube was placed which drained 500 cc of straw-colored fluid.
A central venous line was placed.
On postoperative day five, he remained intubated and sedated.
Plans were made to discontinue his sedation and his paralysis so he could be extubated.
He continued on Lopressor, amiodarone, and propofol as well as his double antibiotic therapy.
He remained on an amiodarone drip and continued on double antibiotic therapy with a stable hematocrit, and creatinine that now dropped from 2.2 to 1.9.
He continued on heparin and remained in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day seven, he continued to be in and out of atrial fibrillation and remained on amiodarone as well as heparin drips with a good blood pressure.
Percocet for pain.
Amiodarone was switched over to p.o.
His central venous line was discontinued.
His chest tubes were discontinued.
He was switched over to Bactrim-DS 2 tablets p.o.
His Foley was discontinued.
His heparin drip was discontinued as he remained in sinus rhythm.
A PICC line was to be placed, and Infectious Disease was again consulted for his antibiotic course.
They recommended Bactrim in addition to his ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
The PICC line was placed on [**1-20**].
They recommended discontinuing his amiodarone and starting either quinidine or moricizine after he was off amiodarone, and recommended that his heparin could be switched over to Coumadin, and adjustments in his calcium channel blocker and beta blockers.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Electrophysiology who recommended a specific pharmacologic course of starting him on quinidine, discontinuing his amiodarone, and then starting him on moricizine as soon as his quinidine could be discontinued and moricizine was available.
He was continued on Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
He continued on his antibiotic therapy, and discharge planning was begun.
The patient spiked to a temperature of 100.2 and was given some Tylenol for that.
His abdomen and extremity examinations were benign, and he continued on his pharmacologic therapy.
He was given Reglan with some relief.
He also had good blood pressure control and remained in sinus rhythm.
Home antibiotics were being arranged.
He continued to be followed up by Psychiatry, which again recommended giving him Haldol 1 mg as a standing order.
He was switched over from Bactrim to doxycycline given his persistent nausea.
Doxycycline 100 mg p.o.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
