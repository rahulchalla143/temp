The patient reportedly went to his primary care physician's office on the day of admission and was given three doses of sublingual nitroglycerin which relieved his pain but dropped his blood pressure.
There, the patient was started on heparin, nitroglycerin, nitroglycerin paste, aspirin, and oxygen.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Albuterol 1 to 2 puffs q.8h.
Prilosec 30 mg p.o.
The patient was started on aspirin, Lopressor, Integrilin, morphine as needed, heparin, nitroglycerin, and Lipitor with relief in his pain symptoms.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted thereafter and saw the patient on the same day.
The decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft.
Surgery was delayed by a few days when the patient developed a left thrombophlebitis at the site of an intravenous line.
The site of the patient's cellulitis was incised and drained on [**2100-12-23**].
Following improvement in the patient's symptoms from the cellulitis, the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2100-12-27**] for coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient had a 2-vessel bypass with the internal mammary being grafted to the left anterior descending artery and the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
The patient also had an uneventful stay on the Cardiac Surgery floor.
Given the patient's need for intravenous antibiotics for two weeks following discharge, a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed on postoperative day four.
Arrangements were made for the patient to receive the required supplies and nursing visits in order to continue this therapy.
By the time of discharge, the patient's pain was well controlled on oral pain medication, and he was ambulating well on the floor.
Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Motrin 400 mg p.o.
Vancomycin 1 g intravenously q.12h.
