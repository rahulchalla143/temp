Empiric treatment for possible pneumonia now completed.
The mother's estimated date of delivery was [**2119-7-5**] for an estimated gestational age at the time of delivery at 37 and 4/7 weeks.
Betamethasone was administered on [**2119-5-15**] in case preterm delivery was necessary secondary to the maternal glomerulonephropathy.
No antepartum antibiotics were administered.
The infant proceeded to spontaneous vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia.
The infant received bulb suctioning and tactile stimulation and then was given blow by oxygen.
Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] did have several episodes of what appeared to be apnea with oxygen desaturation noted subsequent to extubation after being treated for surfactant deficiency.
His grunting, flaring, retracting increased such that he was started on nasal CPAP originally at 5 cm of water with an FIO2 starting at approximately 40% FIO2.
He remained on mobile CPAP until approximately midnight on the night of [**6-18**] where upon his respiratory distress increased and he was intubated and given surfactant in the early hours of the morning of [**2119-6-19**].
He was extubated approximately 3:00 p.m. on [**6-19**] and was placed on nasal cannula oxygen at approximately 400 cc per minute flow.
Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] remained on nasal cannula oxygen for an extended period of time meet needing supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula until approximately the evening of [**6-25**].
Initially baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] required continuing 400 cc at near 1.0 FIO2 until approximately [**6-23**] to [**6-24**] when his flow was weaned to low flow at approximately 13 to 50 cc per minute at 1.0 and eventually came off on [**2119-6-25**].
Subsequent to his being weaned off of his nasal cannula baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] has been in room air without any difficulties and has had no need for supplemental oxygen.
Subsequent to extubation baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] had several episodes of apnea or shallow breathing with oxygen desaturation, which was not accompanied by bradycardia.
He was not treated with any methylxanthine for stimulation of his respiratory center.
He was started on oral feedings subsequent to extubation and started feeding on [**6-19**] to [**2119-6-20**].
He did not feed well, however, po secondary to his degree of respiratory distress during feeds and thus was fed both po and pg during the first several days of his enteral feeds.
However, his feeding behavior improved such that by the weekend of [**2119-6-23**] he was on solely oral feeds without need for gastric tube feedings and was taking very good volumes of oral feeds.
For example on the day prior to discharge baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] took 160 cc per kilo per day of breast milk or Enfamil 20 with iron.
Hematologic and infections diseases:  Upon admission baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] was started on antibiotics secondary to his respiratory distress in the setting of a mother whose GBS status was unknown.
He was placed on Ampicillin and Gentamycin and a blood culture was collected as well as a CBC.
CBC was benign and the blood culture remained no growth to date after 48 hours and antibiotics were discontinued at that time.
Secondary to his continuing respiratory distress, however, and the inability to discern whether or not his original chest x-ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency or pneumonia baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] was restarted on antibiotics consisting of ampicillin and gentamicin for seven days.
As his oxygen requirement gradually reduced to 0 and he reached seven days of therapy for possible pneumonia, baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Known lastname 48347**] antibiotics were discontinued on [**2119-6-28**].
He was started on phototherapy times two and his total bilirubin reduced such that by the [**2119-6-26**] he was off of phototherapy and his post phototherapy total bilirubins were well within the normal range.
FEEDING AT DISCHARGE:  Mother's milk or Enfamil 20 with iron ad lib on demand.
MEDICATIONS:  Ferrous sulfate 0.2 cc po q day.
Immunizations received is hepatitis B vaccine.
