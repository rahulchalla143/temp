Mitral valve replacement with a 25/33 On-X Conform-X     mitral valve mechanical prosthesis.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting   History of Present Illness: 49 year-old female with type I diabetes complicated by ESRD s/p renal transplant x 2 with chronic rejection, s/p pancreatic transplant x 2, CAD s/p mulitple PCIs, severe MR complicated by severe heart failure admitted directly from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] clinic due to [**Name (NI) 9140**] heart failure.
Over the past two months she has had significant decline in her cardiac function.
She previously been asymptomatic, but has progressed to NYHA class III with symptoms of lower extremity edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion.
She was last hospitalized from [**3-27**] to [**4-4**] for a [**Month/Year (2) 1902**] exacerbation.
She will require precath hydration and renal consult due to the risk of further decline of her renal function from contrast and possible need for HD during this admission.
Depending on the catheterization results, she may also need to undergo surgical evaluation for mitral valve replacement.
