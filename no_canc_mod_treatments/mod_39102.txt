Admission Date:  [**2174-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-1-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-4-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: hematochezia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 93733**] is a 67 year old man with history of severe COPD (on 3.5L home O2 and chronic steroids x 4 years, previously intubated on several occasions), was who was hospitalized at NEBH from [**Date range (1) 93734**] for a pseudomonal and proteus pneumonia, and had been discharged on cefepime to pulmonary rehab at [**Hospital1 15454**] from [**Date range (1) 86904**], where on [**2174-1-10**] he was found to have a bright red bloody bowel movement.
He received one unit of pRBCs with Hct increase to 33.2 ([**1-11**] @8:38).
He received 1 dose of cefepime and flagyl and was admitted to the MICU.
In the MICU he received one unit of PRBCs and serial HCTs bumped appropriately and were stable.
However, blood cultures from [**1-11**] grew [**5-12**] bottle of pan-sensitive (ampicillin) enterococcus.
He was briefly treated empirically with vanc and then linezolid until sensitivities were available, and then switched to ampicillin [**1-14**].
These were largely felt to be due to anxiety and he responded well to low dose haldol and ativan.
On [**1-17**], he reveived a PICC line in anticipation of d/c.
Due to his worsening CO2 narcosis/somnolence, he was voluntarily intubated and transferred back to the MICU for further management.
Past Medical History: CHF atrial flutter s/p ablation hypertension multiple pneumonias glaucoma osteoporosis compression fx spine rib fracture gastroesophageal reflux disease cor pulmonale obstructive sleep apnea diabetes mellitus  Social History: 50yrs x 1.5 ppd smoking hx.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 67 year old man with history of COPD, OSA, aflutter s/p ablation with recent subacute altered mental status transferred from OSH for w/u hematochezia found to have [**5-12**] blood cx +enterococcus.
Urine or PICC line were thought to be most likely sources.
Pt initially treated with linezolid; when sensitivities returned, he was transitioned to IV ampicillin with a two week course planned.
He received a R PICC line on [**1-17**].
He was started  on IV ampicillin and remained afebrile until his transfer back to the ICU on [**1-17**] for hypoxia and hypercarbia.
He was noted to have worsening leukopenia and thromocytopenia while on ampicillin and although it has probable better coverage than vancomycin, the ampicillin was replace by vancomycin for total 14-day course.
# Respiratory: Pt began treatment at OSH for pseudomonas and proteus PNA with ceftazidime on [**12-30**]; this was d/c'd after a 14 days.
The patient's solumedrol was transitioned to PO prednisone daily, with a taper planned.
He was started on Bactrim DS 3x/week for PCP prophylaxis while on high-dose steroids.
However, on [**1-17**], he demonstrated increasing somnolence and an ABG showed a CO2 of 99, so the patient was intubated for ventilation and transferred back to the ICU.
He does best on nasal cannula with O2 sat goal 90%.
Anxiety control is therefore paramount to his respiratory status with emphasis on minimizing meds that will cause somnolence and respiratory depression.
[**Hospital1 **] PO PPI therapy was initiated.
Sedating medications were limited, although it was found that the patient has a good therepeutic response to low-dose Haldol administered in the evenings.
Haldol 0.5-1mg can be given on PRN basis but pt also responds well to reasoning.
Ativan 1mg PRN can be second-line treatment.
# HTN: The pt's home dose of diltiazem had been lowered given bleed; this was slowly titrated back up with good effect.
# DM: The patient's home metformin was held and he was managed on an insulin sliding scale with standing glargine.
