History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old female with a PMH significant for chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and CAD s/p CABG sent to the ED for symptomatic anemia now admitted tot he MICU for GIB.
She denies any change to her bowel movements, including melena or hematochezia.
Of note, the patient has a long history of anemia requiring transfusions with multiple GI evaluations including upper and lower endoscopy, and capsule study without a clear localizing GI source.
Since [**2107**], she has received a total of 7 units PRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**].
She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] of Gastroenterology, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] of Hematology has also evaluated the patient for non-GI sources of anemia, with an unremarkable bone marrow biospy in [**2101**] and SPEP in [**2109**].
She was started on a ppi gtt, transfused 2 units PRBC, and was admitted to the MICU for further management.
Atrial fibrillation - coumadin discontinued in the setting of GI bleed 2.
Bilateral renal artery stenosis status post right stent [**8-/2103**] 10. s/p left hip replacement 11. s/p appendectomy 12. s/p tonsillectomy 13. s/p cataract surgery [**14**].

There are mild central vascular congestion and a suggestion of Kerley B lines in the left base, raising question of evolving early edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation (off Coumadin), chronic anemia followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] (history of bone marrow biopsy), renovascular resistant hypertension with renal artery stent (complicated with occlusion), and coronary and peripheral artery disease who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2111-4-14**] with symptomatic anemia related to her third episode of major gastrointestinal bleeding.
She was taken off Coumadin after her second major bleeding and now she has a recurrent significant anemia while taking aspirin only.
On MICU presentation, she had mild elevation of troponin (0.04) with mild nonspecific lateral ECG changes.
She received 5 units of RBC transfusion for an initial Hgb of 5.5 and hematocrit of 17.6.
During her hospitalization, she was noted to have worsening kidney function along with Labetalol and Digoxin chronic toxicity with classic saggy ST depression, atrial fibrillation with very slow ventricular response rate as low as 30 (range 30-40), and mildly elevated digoxin level of 2.3 (does not correlate with toxicity).
Her Labetalol and Digoxin were discontinued and her severe hypertension was treated with Imdur (new medication), Hydralazine, and Norvasc.
We did NOT restart Digoxin because of risk of toxicity in elderly with CKD.
We also added Minoxidil (new medication) for better control as her SBP was 170-200.
She was not candidate for ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] because of risk of hyperkalemia and worsening CKD because of RAS and treatment with Aldactone.
These diuretics were held in the setting of acute worsening of her kidney function.
We restarted Aldactone and Torsemide but not the HCTZ because of decreased GFR (decreased efficacy) and risk of electrolyte abnormalities.
Several medication changes were made to address her uncontrolled hypertension, worsening kidney function and bradycardia (see below).
We also discussed findings with her daughter who is her HCP and explained all her medications in details.
We asked her to follow up with her PCP for frequent [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/H monitoring.
