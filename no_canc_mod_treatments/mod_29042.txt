There an MRI/MRA revealed a left vertebral artery dissection with left PICA infarct, and she was transferred to [**Hospital3 **].
She took robitussin DM until 3 days ago, but has taken no decongestants.
Her only current medication is an OCP.
She was treated with IV fluids, Zofran, and Meclizine.

If the clinical suspicion for a paradoxical embolism is high, a TEE with saline contrast at rest and with maneuvers is suggested.
In particular, the fourth ventricle appears normal in size and configuration at this time.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 31 year old female with sudden severe headache accompanied by nausea/vomiting/vertigo, nystagmus worst with left gaze on exam, and imaging revealing left vertebral artery dissection with left PICA infarct.
Potential etiologies of dissection include trauma, connective tissue disease, congenital abnormality of the vessel.
Will continue work-up for possible cause, while preventing clot propagation with IV heparin.
- Heparin IV 800 units/hr, goal PTT 40-60.
- EKG, r/o MI - Send ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], CRP, urine and serum tox, HgbA1C, lipids - T/C further hypercoag workup as indicated - RISS, Pantoprazole, pneumoboots  * * *  Brief Hospital Course:  * Neuro:     Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] was maintained on heparin through most of her admisson.
An external ventricular drain was placed on [**2-21**].
Her hydrocephalus gradually improved, and on [**3-1**] the drain was removed.
Heparin was discontinued prior to drain removal and due to the small hemorrhage, it was not restarted.
She started coumadin on the night of [**3-1**] and by the time of discharge on [**3-4**] her INR was 1.5.
She was discharged home on coumadin 5 mg qHS and aspirin 81 mg.  She should continue the aspirin until her INR is therapeutic, then discontinue the medication.
She will need to stay on coumadin for 3-6 months.
She was discharged with a plan for outpatient physical therapy, but her need for this is minimal.
* Heme - Maintained on heparin, then transitioned to coumadin and aspirin as described above.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime).
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: TAKE UNTIL YOUR INR IS THERAPEUTIC, THEN STOP.
Outpatient Physical Therapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left vertebral artery dissection, left PICA infarct Hydrocephalus, resolved   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please attend all follow-up appointments and take all medications as directed.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**] at 1:10 p.m. to have your INR checked, and to have your staples taken out.
