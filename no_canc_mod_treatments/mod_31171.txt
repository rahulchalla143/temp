Flagyl re-started.
Started on Amio bolus/gtt, rate controlled in PM however with episode of asystole for 3-4 seconds, continues on pressors (started after intubation) [**6-7**]: Unstable Afib with RVR, hypotensive, recieved 200J shock X 2, then shock x 3 (100J-->50 J-->50J) CE cycled, cards [**Name (NI) 653**], esmolol gtt improved rate, x 1 ffp.
Drop in Plts, sent off HIT antibodies and changed out catheter to non-heparinized line, Knee tap by ortho showing WBC=2278, gram stain pending.
On Lasix gtt for CHF on CXR.
[**6-11**]: Heparin gtt started.
Bronch negative, U/S of lungs showed no pleural effusions, extubated without problem [**6-12**]: d/c NGT  CV: Given that she is not likely to be taking PO medications in the near future and was previously rhythm-controlled on sotalol, would favor short term use of amiodarone to control heart rate and rhythm.
- can give 150mg IV x 1 followed by 1mg/min IV infusion x 6 hours followed by 0.5mg/hour x 18 hours - please maintain INR between [**3-7**] if no evidence of bleeding; with heparin bridge if coumadin must be held or reversed for surgery - plan to discontinue amiodarone and resume sotalol once surgically stable and able to take POs.
Patient was restarted on Sotalol and Atenolol.
Coumadin was started on [**6-14**], patient INR on [**6-19**] was 3.5, we hold her Coumadin.
Volume overload was treated with Lasix IV.
Continue to use 1 L O2 via nasal cannula.
GI: Patient was NPO with TPN for nutrition.
Vaginal cul-de-sacs visualized and no fecal material visualized.
Hematology: Admission labs were further significant for a macrocytic anemia (received 1 unit PRBCs on [**6-4**]) and an elevated INR which continued to rise despite her Coumadin being on hold.
She received FFP on [**6-7**] b/c INR 9.0.
It seems that on [**6-6**] she had been receiving s.c. Heparin as well as Heparin flushes for her line.
After her TKR she had been on therapeutic Lovenox for at least 4 days.
(1) coagulopathy: Her elevated INR is likely secondary to previous use of Coumadin and current Vitamin K deficiency(intubated, NPO).
Given her significant thrombocytopenia we recommend to give Vitamin K 5 mg i.v.
slowly and to provide Vitamin K through her TPN.
(2) thrombocytopenia: no schistocytes seen on the peripheral blood smear, she does not have splenomegaly, HIT was ruled out by negative [**Doctor First Name **].
Continue to monitor her platelet count and avoid medications that could cause thrombocytopenia.
