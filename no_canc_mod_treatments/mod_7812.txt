He had a catheterization and stent placement in [**2149**].
When the pain persisted through early this a.m., he presented to [**Hospital1 **], received aspirin, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin for inferior ST elevations and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
At catheterization, the patient had a transient decrease in heart rate and was treated with transcutaneous pacing, dopamine, and atropine.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit off of these medications.
Amiodarone 0.5 mg per minute.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Prilosec 40 mg p.o.
Zocor 40 mg p.o.
After percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient's cardiac enzymes trended downward.
He was also treated with metoprolol and captopril; which were titrated up to blood pressure and pulse tolerance.
He is considered a possible candidate for recatheterization and stenting of his left circumflex lesion; given his current active lifestyle.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation occurring on the day of catheterization and up until the day prior to discharge.
He was loaded on amiodarone with 4 g total distributed over four days.
He was subsequently placed on amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Prior to discharge, it was arranged for the patient to participate in an electrophysiology study involving risk stratification of post myocardial infarction patients for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
He responded to small doses of Haldol and Zyprexa.
Status post right coronary artery stent placement.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications were) 1.
Metoprolol-XL 25 mg p.o.
