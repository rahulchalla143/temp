She was started on treatment for a COPD exacerbation.
In the ED she was placed on Bipap which was soon weaned off on arrival to the MICU.
She was given methylprednisolone 60 mg q8hrs, albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6 hrs, and albuterol q2 hrs as needed.
Tiotropium was held while on ipratropium nebs.
She was also provided with a nicotine patch during her hospitalization.
Her status improved from admission, but her improvement plateaued and she remained hypoxemic, requiring continuous supplemental oxygenation.
She accepted the consult, and with the addition of palliative care and the hospice team focusing on end-stage issues, we felt it was appropriate to discharge home with hospice given her clearly and consistently stated wishes, her end-stage COPD, and the comprehensive planning that has taken place around her discharge for out-patient symptom management.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was informed of these discussions and events prior to her discharge.
#) Depression/schizophrenia: Continued home citalopram and trazodone.
Patient unsure if she was taking abilify and this was held during her hospitalization.
#) Hypertension: continued Diltiazem 120mg and Aspirin 325mg  #) GERD: continued famotidine  ICU Course: Day 1: Weaned off BiPAP, IV methylpred, scheduled nebs, intermittently hypoxic to the mid 80's so she was and on and off face tent  Day 2: By rounds patient was improved from presentation, on nasal cannula, transitioned to PO steroids, desaturated to 80s prior to transfer to floor, so transfer was cancelled and she remained in the ICU  Day 3: Patient adamant she will go home, threatening to sign-out AMA, but ultimately amenable to a palliative care consult for post-d/c management.
She continues to have poor respiratory function, palliative care was consulted who involved hospice - patient enrolled in hospice, plans made for hospice follow-up, hospice triage number given; patient written for baseline control meds as well as morphine syrup and ativan for sympomatic control of her shortness of breath.
