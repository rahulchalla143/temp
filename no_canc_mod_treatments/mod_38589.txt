Complete bile duct clearance was not achieved and she required a stent placement.
She remained intubated after the procedure and was admitted to the ICU.
Her hospital course was complicated by hypotension and and required admission to the SICU.
At that time, she underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and a double pig-tail stent placement.

-Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
-Biliary Tree: Many stones that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the biliary tree.Sphincterotomy was extended with a balloon sphincteroplasty using a 10 and 12mm balloon.Multiple stones were removed with a balloon catheter.As duct clearance could not be achieved with the balloon a basket was used to retrive rest of the stones.
The stones could not be completely removed as the basket was impacted at the ampulla.Basket was successfully removed with a rat-toothed forceps.Due to prolonged procedure further attempts to clear duct were not made and a 10FRx5cm double pigtail plastic stent was inserted successfully.
Impression: Normal major papilla with stent in-situ.Stent removed with snare.
-Previous sphincterotomy noted.
-Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
-Sphincterotomy was extended with a balloon sphincteroplasty using a 10 and 12mm balloon.
CXR [**2134-4-14**]: An endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm above the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 28893**] is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history significant for schizophrenia, depression, fibromyalgia, and a recent admission for gallstone pancreatitis complicated by cholangitis.
She remained intubated after the procedure and was admitted to the ICU.
She was transferred out to the floor for further management including observation, advancement of diet, and a 5-day course of post-procedure ciprofloxacin as recommended by the ERCP team.
She will need a repeat ERCP in 2 months for stent removal and further stone extraction considering not all stones were able to be removed during procedure during this admission.
If not, the issue of capacity to decline should be re-addressed as her long term risk of life threatening complication is extremely high.
