Admission Date:  [**2154-12-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-2-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-2-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Milk / Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD PEG placement Intubation   History of Present Illness: 58 yo f w/ h/o DM1, htn, hyperlipidemia, who was found down at home by her son at approximately 3am.
Also states that he believes that she has been stretching her insulin doses since she lost her Mass Health.
In the ED, the patient was found to be in sustained convulsion w/ R eye deviation, broke w/ ativan 2mg x2.
Given labetolol x1.
Started on an insulin drip with improvement in AG.
Atraumatic, normocephalic, EEG leads in place.
[**12-20**] CXR: Endotracheal tube terminating in the right main bronchus 2 cm below the carina.
There is probably some medial occipital involvement as well suggesting PCA territory involvement.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: ED and MICU course: In the ED LP was performed and showed CSF - Protein  84, Glucose 327, TUBE 4: 10 WBC 7 RBC, TUBE 1: 14 WBC 256 RBC poly 87 lymph 8.
She was admitted to the MICU and started on Propofol gtt for seizures and Acyclovir 500 mg IV Q12H, Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV Q12H, Vancomycin HCl 1000 mg IV Q48H, and Ampicillin 2 gm IV Q6H to cover for meningitis.
CSF gram stain and cultures returned negative and HSV PCR was negative, so antibiotics were d/ced.
was loaded on Dilantin IV initially, but had 15 seconds of asystole and hypotension with this, and so was loaded instead on Depakote.
She was monitored on bedside EEG x 2 days (see results above) which showed a suppressed rhythm with no assymetries or epileptiform discharges.
In terms of her DKA she was initially covered with an Insulin drip, which was transitioned to sliding scale insulin and NPH (8U [**Hospital1 **] -> titrated up to 12 U [**Hospital1 **]).
Given that the mechanism of her stroke was felt to most likely be cardioembolic from new apical hypokinesis it was felt that she would benefit from Coumadin in the short term.
She will likely need Coumadin for 2-3 months, while the risk for apical thrombus is highest, and then her Neurologist should consider stopping it given her co-morbidites with longterm Coumadin.
This was initially held given concerns for anemia, for procedures (PEG placement), and later Guaiac + stools (see below), but as hct stabilized and procedures were performed she was started on Coumadin.
However, during her course she developed an increased inr largely related to profound vitamin K deficiency, she was discharged on daily lovenox as described below.
She remained on asa and a statin for the stroke, and trileptal for the seizures.
In collaboration with the hematology and neurology services, she will receive full-dose aspirin (325mg) for secondary stroke prophylaxis with regard to the LV apical akinesis.
After the procedure her hct dropped and she was noted to have Guiac + stools.
She should be continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **] while on anticoagulation.
Endocrine (DKA/DM/Hypoglycemia):  As above, the patient's DKA was treated and once resolved she was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] on the floor, and transitioned to Lantus and Humalog sliding scale.
This was normal, and the patient's hypoglycemia improved and her insulin was adjusted accordingly by [**Last Name (un) **].
An receiving glargine insulin and every 6 hour fingersticks and humulin insulin sliding scale.
She was started on Levaquin on [**2154-12-31**] and changed to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl on [**1-3**] given concern for prolonged Qt on EKG on Levaquin.
She continued to spike fevers and CTX was changed to Flagyl.
All antibiotics were discontinued on [**1-16**].
ID felt with a normal cxr and no hypoxia, treatment should be deferred.
As ultimately no source for an infection was found (including negative C. dif toxins A and B), all antibiotics were stopped and the patient remained afebrile until time of discharge.
They recommended optimal medical management with aspirin, bb, ace, and statin.
Her respiratory status improved with diuresis, and when she was euvolemic her diuresis was stopped.
The patient has a baseline hct of ~ 27, and after her G-tube was placed her hct dropped.
An egd showed gastritis, and with a PPI and 2 units of blood her hematocrit remained stable.
Given her stroke, as above she had been receiving coumadin, and during her course developed elevated pt/ptt/inr.
DIC was ruled out and coumadin and sc heparin was held.
They felt her coagulapathy was due to vitamin k deficiency.
After consulting neurology, it was decided to anticoagulate with 325mg aspirin daily for secondary stroke prevention.
She will likely need continued tranfusion support while her hematuria persists.
Her urine lytes revealed a pre-renal etiology and she was given fluids aggressively (while closely watching her exam and oxygen sats given her chf).
Upon discharge, her Cr had normalized and she was stabilized on her ACEi regimen to decrease progression of her proteinuria.
