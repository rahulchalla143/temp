He presented over 10 years ago with nutcracker esophagus and underwent a [**Known lastname **] esophageal myotomy with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13989**] fundoplication.
This was complicated by severe erosive esophagitis and eventually an undilatable stricture requiring transhiatal esophagectomy.
This was subsequently complicated by severe and unrelenting bile reflux and was treated with biliary diversion and a Roux- en-Y gastrojejunostomy.
Approximately 10 months ago, he underwent a procedure to revise the gastrojejunostomy which was stenotic.
This was planned as a joint procedure between myself, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**].
