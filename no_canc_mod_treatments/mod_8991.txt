CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2187-1-1**] 10:56 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: r/o pe Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 69 year old man s/p cabgg/avr now ^dyspnea/hypoxia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o pe CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Helical acquisition of CT images performed through the thorax during dynamic infusion of approximately 80 cc of intravenous nonionic contrast following departmental CTA protocol.
FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there is has been interval median sternotomy and three-vessel CABG, as well as aortic valve replacement.
There is a persistent anterior mediastinal hematoma, and a moderate sized pericardial effusion, with density measurements consistent with serosanguineous fluid.
Greatest thickness of fluid is approximately 1.5 cm.
Tiny residual anterior right-sided pneumothorax, with chest tube in place, its tip located at the apex.
Brief Hospital Course: He was taken to the operating room on [**12-28**] where he underwent a CABG x 3 and AVR (pericardial).
He was seen by ID and started on vanco and ceftriaxone empirically for pneumonia.
A right chest tube was placed for pneumothorax.
CTA showed bilateral PEs and he was started on heparin and coumadin.
His antibiotics were dc'd.
He was started on vencomycin for lower extremity cellulitis.
His cellulitis improved and his INR was therapeutic and he was ready for discharge home on POD #13 with oral antiobitics.
