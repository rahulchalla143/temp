After careful consideration and given that she had a recent non-Q wave myocardial infarction, along with the catheterization findings the patient, after informed consent was obtained, decided to pursue an operative repair of these problems.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2159-11-28**], where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times one and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] aortic valve, Size No.
The patient then was given volume and her blood pressure was maintained using alpha agents.
She had drainage of ascites and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
She was also given fresh frozen plasma and a unit of packed cells.
She was also followed using an oxy-Swan.
Her ventilator was slowly weaned thereafter and on postoperative day three, the patient had her abdominal wound now closed in the midline, stapled, and she tolerated that.
She was followed by General Surgery during this hospitalization.
She intermittently required Dopamine for heart rate control as she tended to be bradycardic and Neo-Synephrine was used to maintain her blood pressure.
She was loaded with amiodarone with the orders to change to p.o.
As her blood pressure increased and Neo-Synephrine was weaned off, she was started on Lasix.
She required some endotracheal suctioning.
On [**12-6**], postoperative day eight from the exploratory laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, postoperative day six from abdominal wall closure, she had several self-limiting runs of ventricular tachycardia, approximately six to eight beats long, with minimum decrease in her blood pressure and shortly thereafter was seen on the evening rounds after having labs sent off and was noted to have a decrease in her blood pressure significantly, dropped approximately 20 pounds, and continued in a ventricular tachycardia.
Her chest was then opened, wires were cut, and after having several episodes of attempts at electro-cardioversion, externally, she had the internal lead paddles placed and was attempted internal cardioversion.
She continued to have intermittent periods of hypotension and she then had a #30 French intra-aortic balloon pump placed.
She had her sternum irrigated with two liters of Bacitracin solution and warm saline and her chest was closed with an Isotac cover after pacing wires were placed and a chest tube was placed.
