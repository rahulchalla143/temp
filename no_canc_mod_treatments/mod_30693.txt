CXR on admission showed possible RUL/RML PNA, but was concerning for endobronchial lesion.
F/U Chest CT showed bilateral PE's, and patient was started on anticoagulation with coumadin and lovenox.
Pt was on Prednisone taper on admission and got stress-dose solumedrol in ED.
Pt was initially stable on the floor, but on hospital day [**1-13**], he had an acute desaturation, was working hard to breathe/using accessory muscle, and was transferred to the MICU at this time where he was stabilized using non-invasive measures (O2 mask, frequent nebs).

Pt was initially put on Lovenox 70 [**Hospital1 **] with coumadin when PE's discovered on chest CT.  Pt was stable for 2 days and then had an acute episode of desaturation, O2 sats 83-84% on 4L, minimal improvement with nebs and 50% facemask.
He was transferred to the MICU at this time where he was managed and stabilized without intubation (frequent nebs, O2).
TTE showed possible left mobile PA mass/clot; suggestion was patient was throwing new clots even though on Lovenox.
Pt started on Heparin drip, became more stable from a respiratory standpoint, and he was transferred back to the floor where he has remained stable on 2 L NC O2, nebs, hep gtt, antibiotics, and steroid taper.
Heparin was discontinued after 48 hour overlap (therapeutic on both coumadin and heparin), and patient discharged on coumadin for lifelong anticoagulation.
IVC filter should be considered if this anticoagulation is inadequate.
COPD: Pt continued on a prednisone taper (2wks) for possible COPD flare, likely one of the reasons for his respiratory distress.
Pt also with frequent nebs and O2 as needed (pt has baseline 2 L O2 requirement).
?PNA-normal cxr, afebrile, but did have bandemia on admission and now with pseudomonas in sputum, resistent to quinolones.
