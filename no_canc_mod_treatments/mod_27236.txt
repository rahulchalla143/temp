Admission Date:  [**2118-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zosyn / Vancomycin / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1642**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NG tube placement   History of Present Illness: 78M with h/o Parkinson's Disease, CAD s/p CABG, h/o TIA, s/p recent hospitalization for pna ([**Date range (1) 65931**]) now with worsening weakness.
Pt was given Tylenol 650mg po, aspirin 325mg po, vancomycin 1g IV, Zosyn 4.5g IV, ticlid 250mg, carbidopa 25/Levodopa 100, Comtan 200mg.
Was also given metoprolol 75mg po and subsequently BP dropped to systolics in the 80's.
He was then given boluses of 1L NS x 3 and BP improved to 120's and he was transferred to the MICU.
CAD s/p CABG and NSTEMIs ([**2-/2117**]: LIMA-LAD, SVG->Diag, OM1, OM2, SVG->PDA); s/p PCI of proximal SVG-D1-OM 1-OM2 with DES in [**6-29**] and PCI of SVG-OM/D with DES in [**8-29**].
Osteoporosis 9. s/p right hip fracture, ORIF in [**3-1**]   Social History: Former prof [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65926**] at [**Location 2785**].
NG tube in proximal stomach.
Micu course involved, the patient had hypotension and was given IVF and zosyn/vanc (concern for pna/sepsis).
Given his hypotension his lasix was held as were other bp meds.
During the majority of the patient's course he was npo so IVF were continued and he was treated for his pneumonia.
His blood pressure was normal on the floor and his blood pressure medications were reintroduced as tolerated.
In the MICU he was on zosyn and vancomycin but had angioedema and due to this allergic reaction, he was switched to levofloxacin and flagyl.
He continued to fail speech and swallow evaluations given his increased secretions.
He was put on daptomycin, flagyl and aztreonam and he improved, initially though he continued to aspirate and his continued aspiration made his pneumonia worse to the point where his prognosis was poor.
He was aggressively suctioned and a scopalamine patch was placed, but given this and his poor prognosis the family decided to make the patient CMO.
Antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was given morphine and scopalamine for comfort.
# Parkinson's: The family fears the patient's parkinson's is worsening, though the patient's recent decline in functioning and mentation could also be related to his infection.
The patient's outpatient neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65932**], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he recommended keeping his medications at the same dose and having an inpatient neurologist see him.
The inpatient team did not have any medication changes to add, though they recommended Movement Disorders consult as his dysphagia may have been related to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
During the patient's course he lost his NG tube and he had difficulty with oral intake to the point where he could not receive his parkinson's medications.
The pharmacy did not carry the oral disintegrating sinemet, and neurology said they could not recommend alternative IV medications to treat his parkinson's.
Unfortunately without his medications the patient became more bradykinetic and as his pulmonary status worsened a G tube was declined and the patient was without medications.
# Nutrition: The patient failed his speech and swallow in the MICU and had an NG tube placed.
He was kept on IV fluids and NPO, while awaiting a second speech and swallow evaluation.
Once he failed this tube feeds were started.
Initially he received tube feeds, and when another speech and swallow was failed it was decided that since the patient was at risk with tube feeds and eating, he would try eating.
He pulled out his NG tube, and at that point the family decided the patient would continue a modified diet, but would likely continue to have pneumonia based on his high risk of continued aspiration.
The patient was found to have elevated INR, and the GI team felt his risk of bleeding was very high and despite reversal of his INR GI decided he was a poor candidate for a Gtube given his worsening clinical status.
# Transaminitis: The patient developed a transaminitis that may have been related to his medications as with medication adjustment, his lft's improved.
He improved with SC vitamin k, though GI felt given this, his LFT's and his pulmonary status the G tube should not be placed.
# Melena: The patient was noted to have melena, and also blood in his NGT, given his repeated failed attempts at NG tube placement this was attributed to trauma, and his hematcrit was followed closely and remained stable.
The patient never required blood products.
HIT antibodies were sent and all heparin products were held.
His HIT antibody was positive and with the holding of heparin products the patient's thrombocytopenia improved.
Towards the end of his course as his aspiration worsened and he was not able to get his parkinson's medications the patient became somnolent and lethargic.
Given his initial hypotension and then diarrhea, his lasix was held and his ins/outs and daily weights were followed.
Once his diarrhea resolved, he became more overloaded and fluids were stopped and he was diuresed.
Diuresis and fluids were stopped though once the patient was made cmo.
# Diarrhea: The patient had profuse diarrhea and this was concerning for c. difficile given antibiotic use.
His cdifficile was negative and he was supported with IV fluids.
Palliative care was very involved and per their recommendations the patient was made comfortable with scopalamine and morphine.
