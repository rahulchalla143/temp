He was evaluated at an outside hospital and he was found to have bilateral wrist fractures, a right superior and inferior pubic ramus fracture, a L1 compression fracture.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Split thickness skin graft to his right arm.
MEDICATIONS:  He reportedly takes no medications at home.
Apparently, he has Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Vital signs initially:  Heart rate of 103, blood pressure 122/74, respiratory rate of 16, breathing 98% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed fatty liver with diverticula were noted.
Patient was aggressively hydrated, and his hematocrits and arterial blood gages were then ordered and followed.
The patient's left distal radius fracture was reduced under conscious sedation and films were obtained.
He was placed on logroll precautions because of these fractures.
Patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2135-8-1**] for an open reduction internal fixation of his right distal radius fracture.
Patient's left distal radius fracture after splinting and reduction films showed good alignment, however, the right distal radius fracture was taken to the operating room for open reduction internal fixation.
The patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells perioperatively for some anemia that was occurring.
The patient underwent also a right hemicolectomy for a perforated right colon.
The patient was started on regimen of empiric antibiotics also at this time including ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
He was aggressively resuscitated with intravenous fluids approximately 5 liters and had good urine output.
He was given Pepcid for DVT prophylaxis as well as Venodyne leg stockings for DVT prophylaxis.
The patient continued to have good urine output and a patient's history of alcoholism suggested DT's etiology, and the patient was treated with Ativan for his agitation and tachycardia.
He was also treated for his pain.
He did spike a fever during this time, and had blood cultures drawn and had his antibiotic regimen continued.
He was reintubated in the PACU for airway protection and agitation.
The patient was started on Hirudin drip to continue his anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism per Hematology.
The patient also underwent a screen for rehabilitation at this time, as well as visits from Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.
The patient was started on TPN, and was kept NPO while his belly remained distended postoperatively.
The patient was started on Coumadin while he remained in the Trauma Intensive Care Unit.
He remained on Hirudin as well per Hematology to continue his anticoagulation for his pulmonary embolism.
A nasogastric tube was placed several times because the patient pulled it out several times.
He was kept on nasogastric tube suction which drained quite a bit of bilious fluid from his stomach.
He was kept NPO during this time and TPN was continued.
Also his antibiotic regimen continued during this time.
Again, the patient was kept on maintenance fluids during his NPO time, and TPN continued while his ileus and distended bowel began to resolve.
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy continued to work with the patient, and his Coumadin was reaching therapeutic levels.
The patient's Coumadin finally reached therapeutic levels.
Orthopedic Surgery requested repeat films of his bilateral upper extremities at this time, this was approximately [**8-25**].
The Orthopedic Surgery team then determined that patient would require surgery on approximately [**9-1**], and that would be an open reduction internal fixation of his left wrist because the left wrist films showed a loss of length and increased dorsal angulation, which would require surgery.
At this time, the patient's Coumadin was stopped, and his Hirudin was continued to keep him anticoagulated for treatment of his pulmonary embolism.
It was then requested by pharmacy that the Hirudin be discontinued due to the risk of possible anaphylactic reaction to the ongoing use of Hirudin, and the patient was then started on Argatroban for continuation of his anticoagulation needs.
