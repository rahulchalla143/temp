History of Present Illness: This [**Age over 90 **] year old lady was found at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to have an episode of vomiting of undigested food followed by 5 episodes coffee ground emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR on Warfarin for PE and plavix for CAD.
She was given Compazine PR, and Coumadin has been held since [**1-3**].
She was recently on Cipro for a UTI.
The patient was found to be in rapid Afib (rate 130s) with a non-tender abdomen and guaiac negative; unsuccessful NG lavage.
She was given NS and 1 unit FFP and Vitamin K 10mg IV x1 for elevated INR.
Femoral line and peripheral placed, T&S obtained, started on Protonix Bolus/Gtt.
Given an elevated WBC count, cough, CXR appearance and infected appearing U/A, the patient was started on Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the ICU.
Her daughter confirms that the patient did not receive a stent at [**Hospital3 **], her diagnosis of PE was uncertain.
ROS: Denies chest pain, abdominal pain, active nausea, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia.

Hematemesis: The patient was admitted after 4-5 episodes of coffee grounds emesis without hemodynamic instability, on Aspirin, Plavix and Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ?
Her INR was elevating to [**2-19**], likely due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction without a concomittant dosage change.
ASA restarted, Plavix and Warfarin held at time of transfer out of the ICU.
Based on risk/benefit ratio (CHADS = 1), are holding plavix and coumadin, but continuing aspirin on discharge.
Patient without stent or hardware, so also has presumed history of pulmonary embolism, no clear indication for plavix even in setting s/p NSTEMI.
Opted to continue aspirin however.
Her beta blocker was held while admitted to the MICU.
Rate was controlled with IV metoprolol which was later converted to PO metoprolol, which was later uptitrated for better rate control.
Given CHADS 1 and recent GI bleed (as well as h/o recurrent falls), the decision was made not to anticoagulate, coumadin is discontinued.
She was diuresed gently with 10 mg IV lasix boluses and was approximately 2 L net negative over the next 24 hours with improvement in dyspnea and oxygenation.
If she becomes SOB again, we strongly recommend considering fluid overload with potential treatment with low-dose lasix (as well as consideration of aspiration).
She received Vanc/Zosyn in the ED presumably for a PNA but was converted to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro then Vanc/Cefepime.
To continue to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (including pseudomonas), she was continued on cefepime only - planning for 8 day course, so 2 days more of once daily antibiotics (cefepime) at rehab.
CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient was on ASA, Plavix and metoprolol after recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware present.
Decided to discontinue plavix in setting of GI bleed and risk > benefit.
Placed on dysphagia diet.
[**Name (NI) 227**] uncertainty (and CHADS = 1) and her current high bleeding risk, we discontinued coumadin and let her INR drift down.
# Had femoral line originally in setting of GI bleed, then removed.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hematemesis Atrial fibrillation with [**Hospital 5509**] Hospital-acquired pneumonia Dysphagia Pulmonary edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with vomiting blood.
This resolved on its own, without any procedure other than medical management.
You had an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) that became rapid (rapid ventricular response) on 2 occasions, and responded to fluid resuscitation as well as diuresis.
You had some fluid on your lungs, and diuresis with low-dose lasix improved your respiratory status.
If you have more shortness of breath, consideration to give another one-time low lasix would be important.
You were on medications for a presumed pulmonary embolism (plavix and aspirin) but we feel that given you had a bleed, your risk of bleed outweighs the benefits, and so we are discharging you solely on aspirin, and not on plavix anymore.
You were on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and for a presumed pulmonary embolism, but given your history of falls and your gastrointestinal bleed on this admission, it is felt that the risk of bleed outweighs the benefit of stroke prevention, and so we have discontinued your coumadin.
You had evidence of a pneumonia, so you are being empirically treated, and you have 2 more days of IV antibiotics to finish your course.
