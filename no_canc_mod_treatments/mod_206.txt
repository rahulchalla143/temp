Since the fall, the patient had been basically confined to her bedroom, did not drink or eat, and lived on some water, coffee, cigarettes and occasional beer.
On admission, the patient denied any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, chest pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, history of vitamin B12 deficiency.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Tiazac 240 per day, Premarin 0.625 mg per day, Provera 2.5 mg per day, clonazepam 1 mg three times a day, Atrovent two puffs four times a day, albuterol four puffs four times a day, Ventolin as needed.
She was given intravenous fluids, antibiotics, levofloxacin intravenously, nebulizer therapy, inhalers and oxygen.
She was put on ethanol and nicotine withdrawal precautions, given deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and was seen by Orthopaedic Surgery consult.
She was discontinued from her Premarin because this increases the risk of deep venous thrombosis.
She would need to walk with a walker for four to six more weeks, for which she would need a rehabilitation hospital or home care with services.
Changed to 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, saturating 95%.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further airway management.
She did not tolerate BiPAP secondary to depressed mental status and secretions, and therefore was intubated for pulmonary toilet and more adequate respiration to protect mental status.
She has refused interventional therapy or medication.
It was decided at that point that she would be made Do Not Resuscitate, but would continue on the ventilator.
The patient continued to be treated with Levaquin and Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia, and was continued on the respirator, but had a difficult time being weaned from the ventilator.
By [**11-19**], her pressure support on the ventilator was decreased to 10, although she failed a spontaneous breathing trial.
She was evaluated by Nutrition, and started on tube feeds, Impact with fiber at 40 cc/hour.
On [**11-20**], she had to be placed back on pressure support of 12 and 5 because of failure to tolerate the lower pressures.
Plans were made on that day for percutaneous tracheostomy if she continued to fail her wean.
She was treated for eight out of 21 days with levofloxacin and eight of 14 days with Flagyl.
Atrovent was added on [**11-22**], and she was continued on her antibiotics.
On [**11-21**], it was discussed with the family and it was decided that it would be attempted to avoid tracheostomy and attempt ventilatory wean because the wishes of the patient and the family were to not have long-term intubation on a tracheostomy, and that she would not want to be reintubated.
However, a short trial of pressure support [**3-28**] with increased respiration, decreased tidal volume, subsequent arterial blood gas of 7.31/84/54, and the patient had to be put back on pressure support of 15 with 5 of PEEP.
She spiked to 101 and was cultured, grew 4+ gram-positive cocci, and the patient was started on vancomycin over concern for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
On [**11-24**], she tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial for two hours, but the required increased ventilation assist control overnight.
She was continued on antibiotics, continued on tube feeds, prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.
Later that day, a PICC line and an arterial line were placed, and on [**11-25**], day number 11 of intubation, a tracheostomy was placed at the bedside.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, but with some chest pain at the tracheostomy site.
During this time, she was also treated with prednisone for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, as well as antibiotics.
On [**11-28**], the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed.
The procedure was tolerated well, and the patient was continued on a weaning protocol from the ventilator, with slowly decreasing pressure support.
On that day, all antibiotics were discontinued because she had completed her course, and she was tapered from her steroids.
The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospital course, was continued on tube feeds with intravenous fluids as necessary, was seen by Physical Therapy services, was found to be requiring daily mobility and exercise for two to three weeks to regain her strength.
This was fitted on her trach mask as tolerated.
The patient was able to tolerate five hours off of the ventilator without events.
Her prognosis for removal of her tracheostomy was thought to be good.
