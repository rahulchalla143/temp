Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo F with PMH schizoaffective disorder, CAD, HTN, DM, restrictive lung disease, discoid lupus, and h/o CVA, who p/w 3d h/o audio and visual hallucinations, leg pain, and SOB with altered mental status.
Initial work-up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium were unrevealing.
Psychiatry saw pt and recommended increasing antipsychotic dosage from short acting seroquel 250mg po qhs, to long-acting seroquel 300mg po qHS and adding on haldol 1mg po BID.
At this time, she was found to have a urinary tract infection (see below), seroquel and haldol were discontinued and the urinary tract infection was treated and her mental status improved the following day, returning to a level similar to at the time of admission.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management.
She was treated with 2mg cogentin and ativan with mild improvement in her mental status.
She was transferred back to the general medicine floor, where her mental status continued to wax and wane but never returned to her initial level of interactiveness on admission.
Given the extensive negative work up for delirium, this was considered to be her new baseline and placement was found for skilled nursing facility for discharge with permission from her health care proxy.
Throughout hospitalization the patient was convinced that her hallucinations and delusions were real.
She was treated with ceftriaxone.
# Supraventricular Tachycardia: Patient has a remote hx SVT, on metoprolol for rate control.
The patient has been stable on Metoprolol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen without improvement in mental status.
Patient has a 20 pack year history and likely has baseline hypoxia with sufficient compensation to maintain peripheral O2 saturation >92%.
# Ankle pain: Initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for CK in the 800s and an elevated ESR and CRP.
Amyloidosis was also considered however SPEP and UPEP, total protein and globulin levels were unremarkable.
Statin-induced myopathy was considered, and statin was held however CK had already begun to trend down when the statin was stopped, making statin induced myopathy unlikely.
Patient had received PRN doses of haldol, home seroquel 250 mg.
The patient was started on Ativan 1mg q6 hrs PRN agitation.
Upon transfer back to the general medicine floor, her rigidity had improved and she continued to be treated with prn ativan for agitation, though this made pt quite somnolent.
On [**2165-8-25**] she was restarted on seroquel 50mg po BID prn agitation in an effort to avoid sedation associated with benzos.
All other PRN doses of seroquel and Ativan were held.
She was still measuring in SBP 170s on several occasions despite being on max dose of numerous BP meds, including metoprolol, losartan, furosemide, and clonidine patch.
While in house, hydralazine 10mg po TID was added to pt's regimen, and metoprolol was further increased to 200mg po BID for management of SVT.
She should have her CK rechecked as outpatient and consider restarting simvastatin as outpatient.
Clopidogrel was continued on admission but simvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondary to elevated CK levels.
# DM - held glyburide, gave SSI while in house  # h/o candidal rash: miconazole powder  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # schizoaffective disorder: The patient was admitted on Seroquel 250 qhs and because of the possibility of NMS, the patient is being discharged on Seroquel 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
