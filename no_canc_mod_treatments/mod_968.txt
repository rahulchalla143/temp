The patient had two episodes of rigors at the outside hospital with fevers to 105.
The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain - but does state some dysuria, hesitancy, and urgency, and the feeling of being dehydrated.
The patient denies a cough, headache, neck pain, photophobia, recent trauma, blood in the urine, blood from any other orifice, cold symptoms, myalgias, arthralgias, or any recent symptoms of this kind.
The patient states about one year ago he was diagnosed with urate stone at the outside hospital, but nothing was done for it, and he does feel he has passed the stone either.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in [**2182**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post angioplasty in [**2172**].
On pulmonary examination, he had prolonged expirations and mild rales in the left middle lobe, and left lower lobe, and the right lower lobe.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a 3-day history of fever of unknown origin with rigors, chills, tachypnea, and episodes of tachycardia with delirium who was admitted from an outside hospital.
The patient was initially worked up because of the rales found on his physical examination as well as some signs suggestive of either congestive heart failure or pneumonia found on chest x- ray.
He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia and was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient continued to have these rigor episodes while on Levaquin and Flagyl, and other etiologies were  also pursued.
As the only imaging not done at the outside hospital - including his abdomen and with a history of uric acid stones and questionable picture of urosepsis, the patient received a computer tomography of the abdomen which showed a left portal vein septic thrombus.
Blood cultures were again drawn, and the patient was changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Discussion,  per the surgeons with the Interventional radiologists - all agreed that the thrombus was stable at present (as confirmed by a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging) that no surgical intervention was necessary for removal of this clot.
The patient was started on Zosyn and then gentamicin was later added.
It was later decreased that anticoagulation would most likely be necessary at a weight- based protocol dose for a clot and was started on the day prior to discharge.
On the day of discharge, the patient is on Zosyn and gentamicin - which are per Infectious Disease recommendations is being changed to Levaquin and Flagyl for four weeks.
Because a left portal vein thrombus is not very common occurrence, and because the literature is very sparse in terms of the most efficacious treatment, the patient is going to be on Levaquin and Flagyl for coverage for anaerobes and gastrointestinal flora and will be given Lovenox and Coumadin for anticoagulation to dissolve the clot.
The patient stated he had recently had a colonoscopy which showed a diverticulosis and was unaware of what the correct diet for a patient with diverticulosis should be.
The patient was seen by the Nutrition Service and was started on a low-residue diet for three weeks, to be slowly advanced as tolerated.
Because of being started on Lovenox and Coumadin, the patient was to have his INR checked in three days at his [**Hospital 6642**] Hospital.
The patient was given Lovenox teaching prior to discharge and understood that he had to continue both Lovenox and Coumadin until his INR is therapeutic.
The patient also understood to take his Levaquin and Flagyl for at least four weeks until he sees the Infectious Disease physicians - whom it will be up to regarding make a decision regarding discontinuance of the antibiotics in four weeks.
The patient also understood to see the hematologist regarding when to discontinue his Coumadin and when to not be anticoagulated any longer as well as for a workup of hypercoagulability.
The patient was also given a prescription for hypercoagulability laboratories which are to be drawn at the [**Location (un) 448**] of the [**Hospital 469**] Clinic Laboratory before he presents to the hematologist.
Status post diverticulitis; continuous diverticulosis.
Levaquin 500 mg once per day (times 30 days).
Flagyl 500 mg three times per day (times 30 days).
Lisinopril 5-mg tablets take one-half tablet by mouth once    per day.
Zantac 150-mg tablets one tablet by mouth twice per day.
The patient to be on both Lovenox and Coumadin.
The patient may stop Lovenox injections upon advice of his primary care physician when his INR is normalized.
The patient was given very explicit instructions to continue the Lovenox and Coumadin until told to stop by his primary care physician.
All questions about his diagnosis, his condition, followup, and medications were answered satisfactorily for the patient.
