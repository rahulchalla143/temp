Admission Date:  [**2106-5-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-12-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Benzodiazepines / Furosemide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Evaluation for liver transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Post-pyloric feeding tube x 3 3.
PICC line placement x 2  History of Present Illness: 45F with ESLD secondary to EtOH, AIHA due to lasix recently on prednisone who was initially presented to OSH with hepatic encephalopathy transferred from OSH on [**5-27**] for liver transplant evaluation whose course has been complicated by coagulopathy with recurrent epistaxis, VRE bacteremia, new onset Afib with RVR and now with worsening leukocytosis and diffuse bilat pulmonary infiltrates.
To summarize her recent course, the patient was admitted to OSH from [**Date range (1) 74368**] for hemolytic anemia thought to be [**1-15**] lasix and was started on prednisone 50mg.
On [**5-22**], she represented with hepatic encephalopathy and T [**Age over 90 **]F where she underwent paracentesis with negative cultures.
CXR showed b/l infiltrates and she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for liver transplant eval.
Due to worsening confusion the patient underwent repeat paracentesis with 135 WBC.
Eventually blood cultures from [**6-11**] returned [**12-17**] bottles +ve for VRE and was started on daptomycin.
Also on [**6-11**], the patient was started on CTX for positive U/A which was then continued per ID to empirically cover possible SBP.
Also treated for hepatorenal syndrome (cre 1.5 which improved to 0.4) with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide x 4 days, which was d/c'd on [**6-16**] given improvement in renal function.
She was started on bactrim for possible PCP given her recent prolonged predinsone course that had been discontinued on [**6-15**].
Due to increased volume of diarrhea and climbing WBC count she was started on empiric flagyl on [**2106-6-17**].
Reported PTSD s/p attack by father as a child/teenager.

Questionable biliary dilatation anterior to TIPS stent .
NG tube tip is below the diaphragm out of view.
Right PICC line tip is in the mid SVC.
Left PIC catheter ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.
Esophageal tube and right PIC line have been removed.
A left-sided PICC is seen extending into the superior vena cava.
OTHER STUDIES: ============== EGD [**2106-6-2**] - Grade 1 esophageal varices A trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube (8 fr) was placed to 120 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo female with ESLD [**1-15**] EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS who presented from OSH for liver transplant evaluation, recent severe bleeding, who developed sepsis, DIC, and multiorgan failure.
#Sepsis/DIC: The patient required multiple vasopressors to maintain SvO2 >70 and MAP>60s.
She was treated broadly with antibiotics and aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin for intravascular volume support and to correct her underlying coagulopathy.
HCO3 was utilized prn given worsening acidosis.
The patient was made CMO after an extensive family discussion regarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired after removal of vasopressors and respiratory support.
Differential included DAH given coagulopathy, infection (e.g.
The patient was treated with steroids and bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 74369**] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to cover mycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
Given worsening infiltrates and P/F ratio suggestive of ARDS, she was ventilated on ARDSnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowed permissive hypercapnea.
Differential included HRS, ATN [**1-15**] renal hypoperfusion, prerenal [**1-15**] hypoalbuminemia and 3rd spacing.
She was unable to take po octreotide, midodrine due to increased GI secretions and poor absorption.
Attempted to increased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products.
Lasix held given auto-immune hemolytic anemia.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic encephalopathy.
During hospitalization, she was evaluated for liver transplant, and was transiently placed on the transplant list but was removed after becoming septic.
HRS improved after midodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia near baseline of 127-129.
She was fluid restricted, but continued to have worsening peripheral edema; diuretics were held given her recently diagnosed AIHA [**1-15**] lasix.
She was converted with lopressor and diltiazam, but then reverted to Afib/flutter rate-controlled on diltiazem.
# Leukocytosis: Initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outside hospital treated with a course of IV antibiotics.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood, urine and stool cultures.
Although pulmonary nodules were seen on chest CT, this was not felt to represent an acute infectious process given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection, therefore no further antibiotics were given.
Felt that PICC line was possible source; however, wound tip culture showed no growth.
She was started on daptomycin and ceftriaxone per ID.
On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off steroids for AIHA only days earlier.
She was started emperically on treatment doses of bactrim however she continued to worsen.
Flagyl also emperically started for C. diff.
Pt has had multiple red blood cell transfusions, FFP, cryo, and platelets during admission.
Also received ddAVP for uremic platelets.
She had an episode of profuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from Doboff feeding tube that could only be controlled with packing, Afrin and pressure by ENT.
She also bled from her paracentesis site, requiring transfusion and sutures.
Re-consulted hematology here who agreed with this diagnosis.
Lasix was held during admission and repeat coombs antibody negative.
However, hemolysis indices improved on prednisone, and slow prednisone taper initiated as indices stabilized.
