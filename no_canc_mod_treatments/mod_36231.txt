ET tube in optimal position.
[**2163-4-24**] Portable Chest X-Ray: FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube tip terminates about 4 cm above the carina.
Pt was admitted to the MICU and initially started on broad spectrum abx, but this was tailored to CTX/Azithromycin for CAP.
Pt was continued on standing albuterol & atrovent MDI's while intubated.
She was started on Seroquel for agitation in addition to home Zoloft.
MICU course was also complicated by acute renal failure of pre-renal etiology likely [**1-19**] to aggressive diuresis.
PE thought to be high probability,  since pt unable to get any imaging procedures given her obesity, empiric heparin was started.
Pt was initially started on broad spectrum abx; however, given that last hospitalization 2 months prior, tailored to CTX/Azithromycin for CAP.
She was placed on solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, which was switched to prednisone 60mg po daily and tapered prior to discharge.
Continued on Albuterol and Ipratropium MDIs while intubated.
Thought that diastolic heart failure could be contributing, and she was placed on lasix gtt for diuresis.
She was started on a lasix gtt with metolazone; however, she developed acute renal failure and her creatinine increased to 1.9.
Diuresis was stopped and patient received IV fluids to treat renal failure, which improved (see below).
Following treatment of pneumonia and diuresis, patient could not be weaned off ETT.
Patient received 7 day course of linezolid for VRE UTI.
Patient was started on heparin gtt to treat empirically.
Coumadin was started.
Please plan on 3 month course of treatment for coumadin.
Continue heparin gtt until INR in therapeutic range (2 - 3).
Continue coumadin for three month course.
# Acute renal failure: Patient received lasix gtt and lasix boluses in addition to metolazone.
Bicarb increased with diuresis and patient received diamox.
With aggressive diuresis patient was -16 L net fluid balance, however, her creatinine increased from 0.6 on admission to a peak of 1.9.
Diuresis was held.
Patient received IVF boluses and her creatinine improved to 0.7 at discharge.
Foley catheter was changed and repeat culture grew VRE.
# DM 2: Placed on home regimen of Lantus and ISS with qid fingersticks.
During admisssion patient had very elevated fingersticks into 400s despite aggressive home lantus dose and sliding scale.
Patient was started on an insulin drip and required as much as 47 units of regular insulin per hour.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted and recommended starting patient on U500 with humalog sliding scale.
Patient stared U500 0.3 mL (150 units) three times a day prior to tube feeding.
Patient also on humalog insulin sliding scale.
# Psych: Pt with baseline psych/agitation issues.
She was treated with Zyprexa in the MICU for agitation.
She continued to have agitation and required propofol for sedation as she was agitated with Fentanyl/Versed.
Seroquel was used for sedation, and Zyprexa was discontinued.
Psychiatry ultimately consulted and recommended stopping psychiatric medications while taking linezolid because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
Patient was weaned off all sedation and all psychiatric medications, including seroquel, were stopped except haldol PRN for agitation.
Please use haldol PRN for agitation.
Psych consulted and family will pursue legal guardianship for mother to be legal guardianship.
Please continue guardianship process as her mother wants to pursue this.
