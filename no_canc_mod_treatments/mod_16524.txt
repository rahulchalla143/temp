The pain was described as moderate, located at midsternal region, dull in quality, and responded partially to nitroglycerine X3.
Patient came to work and went to a conference, and his chest pain exacerbated, despite nitroglycerin use.
Of note, on [**6-26**] patient was admitted for chest pain, and was taken to cardiac catheterization with DES to RCA ostium given in-stent restenosis (70-80%).
Six days later ([**7-2**]) patient had similar chest pain, underwent another catheterization with stent placement in LCx, and resulted in normal flow, with no dissection or residual stenosis.

A Pilot 50 wire was positioned in a large ramus intermedius branch.
At this point patient started complaining of chest pain ([**7-1**]) which was unresponsive to IV and IC nitroglycerin at high doses.
In view of severe chest pain, the ostium of the left  circumflex coronary artery was treated by multiple balloon inflations to a maximum of 10 atm with a 2.0 x 12 mm Apex OTW, followed by a 2.5 x 12 OTW balloon.
In view of uncertainty about a definitive culprit lesion, patient was admitted to CCU for further observation and management.
The arterial sheath in the left groin was pulled and manual pressure held with excellent hemostasis.

ETT ([**2136-7-6**]): This 75 year old man with h/o multiple PCIs most recent PCI to RCA on [**2136-6-26**] and PTCA to Cx on [**2136-7-4**] was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
Three cardiac catheterizations were performed in the past week, resulting in the placement of drug eluting stents in the potential flow restricting loci, including the LCX and the ostium of a prior stent in RCA.
Of note, patient has remote history of NSTEMI 36 years ago that was attributed to vasospasm, and responded to calcium channel blocker treatment.
Patient was started on nifedipine 30 mg po daily and losartan lowered to 50mg to allow therapy with CCB.
