ADDENDUM:  On [**2122-4-24**], the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for hematemesis with hypotension.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-3**] for hematemesis with Grade II-III varices requiring [**Last Name (un) 9081**] placement after failed injection.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**4-16**] for hematemesis with Grade II varices, bands times three placed.
Two large bore intravenous lines were placed.
She received packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, A-line, femoral Cordis line and was intubated for airway protection.
Initially she required dopamine and vasopressor to help maintain her pressures.
She received erythromycin 250 mg times one.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit was temperature of 97.0 F.; blood pressure 70/30 to 60/palpable; heart rate 60 to 80s; respiratory rate 12; saturation of 94% on two liters nasal cannula.
UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Initially the patient was stabilized with transfusion, pressors, Octreotide and erythromycin; however, given the severity and frequency of her upper gastrointestinal bleeds, the patient had a TIPS procedure done by Interventional Radiology on [**2122-4-28**].
She tolerated the procedure well and remained hemodynamically stable with no further hematemesis.
END STAGE LIVER FAILURE:  The patient was continued on her Lactulose, Ursodiol for symptomatic relief and with Flagyl added to help relieve encephalopathy.
To help maintain her blood pressure with paracenteses, she required peri-procedural albumin.
SBP:  The patient was started on ceftriaxone SBP diagnosed on [**2122-4-15**].
She actually completed a 20 day course of antibiotic given her high risk for infection with numerous procedures and repeat episodes of hematemesis.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with volume repletion.
Her urine sodium was less than 10.0, which was consistent with possible early hepatorenal function and all of her medications were renal dosed and her urine output was monitored closely.
She was started on renally dosed acyclovir at the recommendation of Infectious Disease and will complete prolonged course.
She received Atarax and Sarna lotion for symptomatic relief.
RESPIRATORY:  On admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was intubated for airway protection, given active hematemesis and need for repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopies.
She required only minimal ventilatory support and was extubated successfully without complication.
Her O2 saturation improved with Physical Therapy and out of bed to chair.
At the time of transfer, her saturations were 98 to 100% on two liter nasal cannula, with a markedly improved lung examination.
She was started on Vancomycin dosed by level for presumed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
Her right internal jugular line was discontinued and pending isolation of culture, her PICC line will need to be removed and an echocardiogram should be checked.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  The patient with Foley catheter throughout most of her hospital stay.
She was started on Levaquin on [**5-6**] and is to complete a seven day course.
She had a Dobbhoff tube placed by fluoroscopy and tolerated tube feeds well.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient with pneumoboots and proton pump inhibitor twice a day.
