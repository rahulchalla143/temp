of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic systolic HF and  chronic venous insufficiency presenting with sudden onset of left sided chest/epigastric pain and found to have antreior STEMI and treated with cardiac catherization and 3 bare metal stents to the LAD.
# Chest Pain - Given her EKG ST elevations in V1-V4 the patient experienced a anterior STEMI which was treated with emergent cardiac catherization and LAD stent placements.
Continued plavix 75mg daily and aspirin 325 mg daily.
Started on Metoprolol Succinate and Atorvastatin.
She was started on warfarin on [**8-19**].
Lower on the differential was PE given her initial tachycardia, however her O2 sats are responding to supplemental oxygen and remains less likely.
We gently diuresed her with 40mg-80mg IV Lasix boluses and observed I's and O's- she exhibited adequate responses daily with good urine output between 0.5-1.5L negative daily.
We started on Metoprolol Succinate and Losartan 25mg.
Started 5mg Coumadin daily which will  provide thrombus prophylaxis given her apical hypokinesis and apical aneurysm.Followup echocardiogram showed left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
The estimated PA systolic pressure may be slightly higher.Continued plavix and aspirin 325 mg daily.
Started on Metoprolol Succinate, standing oral Lasix was increased, Spironolactone, Losartan and Atorvastatin.
#Acute renal failure- Most probably mutlifactorial given her recent cardiac catherization and dye load.
Also could be due to hypoperfusion given her diminished cardiac output according to echo which is most probably chronic , however could have worsened given her recent ischemic event.
Placed patient on insulin SC and standing home regimen of 25 units glargine after breakfeast.
She should remain on sliding scale at rehab and be transferred to an oral regime using metformin with caution given her renal function.
Continued home dose of Gabapentin 300mg at nighttime for neuropathic pain.
#Atrial Fibrilliation - Chronic which has been rate controlled with lopressor but no warfarin given patient's past hx.
[**Country **] score is 4 points.Patient was given informational pamphlet on anticoagulation.
Started on 5mg Coumadin daily, after patient agreement, which will  provide thrombus prophylaxis given her apical hypokinesis and apical aneurysm.
Started on Metoprolol Succinate for rate control.
?TSH [**2107-8-17**] was normal.Continued home levothyroxine dose, 125 mcg daily.
# Hypertension.Started on Metoprolol Succinate today 150mg daily  and started on Losartan 25mg daily today, standing oral lasix.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Anterior ST-elevation MI - Received 3 stents to the LAD Congenstive heart failure Atrial fibrillation (chronic) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted following sudden onset of left chest pain preceding worsening back pain.
You were given aspirin in the ambulance by the emergency services and on arrival, your cardiac tracing (ECG) showed evidence of a heart attack.
Your chest pain eased and you were given medication to dilate your arteries to increase blood supply to the heart and medication to lower your heart rate (to reduce strain on the heart) and lower your blood pressure.
This was treated with three stents to reverse the blockage.
Following the procedure, your kidney function deteriorated mildly due to the combination of the dye you received during your procedure and the results of diuretic medications to reduce the accumulation of water in the lungs.
You were stable following your procedure and we increased the amount of diuretic we gave you to improve your oxygen levels and shortness of breath.
You were started on warfarin for your atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and in addition to other risk factors including your diabetes and recent heart attack that would otherwise greatly increase your yearly risk of stroke.
We changed you from intravenous to oral diuretics (water tablets) and added another medication to help reduce lung water.
We held your home oral diabetic medications and changed you to a regime only involving insulin injections in addition to your normal home lantus dose.
You were seen by physical therapy who felt that you would benefit from a period of rehabilitation following your heart attack.
Your Foley catheter was removed on [**8-20**] and you were discharged to rehab on [**2107-8-20**].
Changes to medications:  1) We stopped your amlodipine 2) We dcreased your home irbesartan dose to 150mg daily 3) We started high dose atorvastatin (for high cholesterol) 80mg at night 4) We held your glipizide and metformin and these can be cautiously reintroduced in rehab.
We continued your night-time insulin and increased the dose to 25 units.
We will continue the insulin sliding scale (in place of tablets) while you are in rehab 5) We increased your metoprolol succinate to 150mg daily.
6) We increased your aspirin dose to 325mg daily and added another medication called clopidogrel (another blood thinner which acts on platelets, components of the blood) at 75mg daily 7) We increased your fuurosemide to 80mg daily (water tablet) 8) We started you on warfarin to thin the blood and reduce your risk of stroke 9) We will continue the heparin injections until you are walking and your warfarin level is in the correct range  Discharge instructions: 1) You should have your INR level checked daily at rehab until it is in te right range and regularly at home following discharge 2) Should you have further chest pain or feel unwell you should immediately seek medical attention and proceed to teh ED 3) You will need to be careful when walking given your several blood thinners and you will be far more prone to bruising.
If you fall and hit your head whilst on these medications you should seek urgent medical attention.
4) You will need to have your kidney function tests checked to make sure they are heading in tehright direction 5) With your new blood pressure medications, you will need to have your blood pressure checked regularly 6) your Foley catheter was removed on [**8-20**], you may have difficulty passing urine after this and this may have to be replaced if you are unable to pass urine  You should weigh yourself daily and see your PCP if your weight changes by >3lb.
