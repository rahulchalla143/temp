She has had multiple hospital admissions for these complications, most recently in [**2131-11-22**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and sludge extraction on [**12-20**].
The ERCP report notes that the minor papilla was unable to be visualized and thus no pancreatic intervention was done.

Therefore no pancreatic intervention was performed.
In this patient status post distal pancreatectomy with fiducial seeds placed in the pancreatic bed and jejunojejunostomy in the left upper quadrant, there is a new large simple fluid collection in the lesser sac measuring 9.2 x 7.4 x 8.7 cm.
This collection is amenable to image guided drainage 2.
Pancreas, distal pancreatectomy (B-T): A.  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia with micropapillary features and high grade dysplasia (PanIn-3).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with history of chronic pancreatitis and chronic PO intolerance was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment after attempted ERCP.
The patient was made NPO with IVF, she was continued on TPN and her pain was controlled with large amount of IV Dilaudid.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] evaluated the patient and patient was scheduled for elective Puestow procedure.
The decision was made to keep patient in hospital prior surgery secondary of pain (required large amount of IV Dilaudid) and atrial fibrillation (can't take home meds PO s/t NPO status).
On [**2132-1-21**], the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and J-tube placement (Operative Note is unable on discharge).
The patient was started on Diltiazem gtt and Hydralazine IV.
The patient's cardiac status improved, Diltiazem gtt was stopped and she was transferred on the floor in stable condition.
The patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and TPN, with a foley catheter, IV Dilaudid and Fentanyl patch for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received IV Dilaudid and Fentanyl patch for pain control, she required significant amount of IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications with continued IV for breakthrough pain.
Patient's Fentanyl patch was increased and her IV Dilaudid was weaned off.
The plan for the patient is continue to wean off her Fentanyl patch and PO Oxycodone as tolerated.
CV: The patient has a history of Afib and she is on PO Coumadin, Diltiazem and Digoxin at home.
When NPO, patient was given IV Digoxin, IV Metoprolol and Lovenox SC, her Coumadin was held for perioperative period.
According to Cardiology recommendations, IV Digoxin was discontinued with anticoagulation therapy, her IV Metoprolol was continued.
Post operatively, patient was started on her home regiment with PO Digoxin and Diltiazem.
Coumadin was restarted on POD # 7, her INR prior discharge was 1.2, bridging therapy was not indicated.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was TPN dependent since [**Month (only) 216**], she was continued on TPN prior surgery.
The patient was started on TF on POD # 5, and her TF rate was advanced to goal on POD # 7 and started cycling overnight.
The foley catheter was discontinued at midnight of POD# 2.
Urine cultures were positive for Enterococcus and patient was started on IV Vancomycin x 5 days.
On POD # 10, patient underwent percutaneous drainage of this fluid collection.
No antibiotic treatment was indicated prior discharge.
Patient's HCT was stable after transfussion and no further interventions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
