Hypotension/sepsis - Pt was hemodynamically stable after fluid resuscitation.
He was started on vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl and then changed to just vancomycin once patient was stable and it was felt that his infection was from his HD line.
He needs to continue vancomycin empirically for 2 weeks, to be dosed at HD.
As the patient has a history of extremely poor and difficult access, his HD line CANNOT be removed.
The patient remains on daily low-dose prednisone given his history of adrenal insuffieciency in the past.
The patient's MS was also lethargic initially, which has improved to his baseline after starting appropriate treatment with antibiotics.
ESRD - On HD Tues/Thurs/Sat.
Hx adrenal insufficiency - was on stress dose steroids briefly, changed over to  low-dose po prednisone as pt is hemodynamically stable .
DM - continue insulin SS as directed .
Pain - continue lidocaine patches and oxycodone prn .
Afib - Hold metoprolol as patient was initially hypotensive and now normotensive.
On coumadin 1 mg qod, which was increased to 2 mg qod upon discharge as his INR was 1.5.
He should have repeat PT/PTT/INR in [**4-4**] days as dose adjustment may be necessary.
Psych - On welbutrin and remeron.
IVF prn hypotension.
