Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 90030**] is a 59yoM with a history of diabetes, Parkinsons disease, septic shoulder and septic knee who presents with T8 compression fracture and cord compression s/p OR x 2 with subsequent vetebrectomy and laminectomy and fusion of the thoracic spine and culture data showing likely osteomyelitis with MSSA.
He was intubated [**1-22**] in the TSICU, and on [**1-23**], he underwent vertebrectomy of T8-9, and fusion of T7-T10 with placement of anterior spacers.
He was transferred to the TSICU and left intubated overnight.
A spinal epidural catheter was placed for post operative pain control.
His drains and epidural catheter were removed from back on [**1-25**].
He received a new PICC [**1-26**] and was transferred to the medicine service for further management of osteomyelitis/discitis.
Pain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid then PO oxycodone with good effect.
Increased drainage was noted from his back surgical wounds on [**1-28**], with wound vacs subsequently placed.
They were removed on [**2-1**] after drainage was noted to be minimal, and there was no further signficant drainage.
OSTEOMYELITIS/DISCITIS:  He was empirically started on vancomycin [**2112-1-23**] due to MRI evidence of discitis/osteomyelitis accounting for his compression fracture, and due to his history of both MSSA and MRSA infections.
He received cefazolin perioperatively.
Bone and disc samples taken during his [**1-23**] procedure eventually grew out MSSA.
He was febrile on [**2112-1-23**] to 101.9 following his operation.
His PICC line was removed and cultured, and blood was cultured- both negative.
He was switched to IV nafcillin 2gQ4hr on [**2112-1-27**] which was well tolerated.
He was discharged to complete 6 weeks of intravenous nafcillin ending on [**2112-3-9**].
He received an additional unit of blood aside from his OR requirements.
The swelling slowly dissipated but was persistent on discharge- it was felt to be due to his recent shoulder surgery and removal of indwelling drain.
DIABETES MELLITUS: Metformin was discontinued on admission in favor of an insulin sliding scale with generally very good control, requiring very little correction insulin.
HCTZ and lisinopril were restarted prior to discharge.
HYPOKALEMIA:  He is on spironolactone presumably for hypokalemia as an outpatient, which was discontinued in favor of daily potassium supplementation.
He was started on ciprofloxacin eye drops [**1-30**] to be used through [**2-5**].
He may also use saline eye drops as needed for symptomatic relief.
PARKINSONS DISEASE:  He was continued on stalevo and ropinirole with good control.
His PPI was discontinued due to increased risk of fracture, which is pertinent to his presenting complaint.
