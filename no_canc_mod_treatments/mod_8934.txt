She was treated with levofloxacin and improved.
She rec'd a small bolus of IV fluids in the ER and her BP improved, she had also rec'd solumedrol 125mg IV.
It is possible she had secondary adrenal insufficiency in the setting of acute illness and chronic steroid use as the cause of her low blood pressure, so she was treated with prednisone 20mg po daily and this should be tapered back to her home dose of 10mg po daily over the next 5 days.
She was treated with pain controlling medications.
Given delerium her pain medication regimen was switched from oxycodone to tylenol standing and tramadol standing with low dose of oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
Given possibility of worsening dementia precluding discharge to home she was seen by geriatrics to help with long term disposition as well as acute delerium issues- geriatric recommendations were as follows to modify the pain medicatoins and timing and dose of seroquel admission.
She still experiences occasional hallucination and confusion in the evenings, however, on the day of discharge she was alert, oriented times 4, and was able to perform days of week backwards without difficulty or error.
She was started on an aspirin while her cardiac enzymes were trended and after trending downward she was discharged on a full strength aspirin daily.
