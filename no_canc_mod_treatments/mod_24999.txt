Patient tolerating food/liquids, and PO meds per speech and swallow.
Abd- flat non-distended, soft, midline incision closed with steri-strips without signs of infection, no redness/drainage or other sign of infection.
The low rectal anastomosis appears intact, without surrounding fluid collection to suggest leak.
Evaluation of the patient after diuresis is highly recommended.
Unconventional position of an NG tube should be correlated to functioning.
CXR [**2028-1-26**] IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in right basal opacity after diuresis though the residual remains concerning for pneumonia.
There is penetration with thin barium; however, no frank aspiration was observed.
A left PIC line ends in the mid left brachiocephalic vein.
[**Numeric Identifier 4684**] FLUORO GUID PLCT/REPLCT/REMOVE CENTRAL LINE Study Date of [**2117-2-2**] 1:07 PM IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated exchange of left-sided venous catheter for a 5 French 38 cm PICC with its tip at the mid SVC, under fluoroscopic guidance.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the colorectal surgery service on [**2117-1-15**] for a small bowel obstruction and had an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions on HD 8 after medical management failed.
There were no complications from the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
Neuro: During her stay and post-operatively, the patient received IV morphine as needed along with IV Tylenol, all with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tolerating oral intake and clears by speech and swallow to take pills orally, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient was more or less stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; She was intermittently tachycardic on the floor prior to surgery and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after which was successfully managed with IV Lopressor (please refer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course below).
Occasional hypertension was successfully treated with hydralazine.
The patient was transitioned to home dose of Metoprolol and the patient's blood pressure was adequately controlled.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened on POD 3 to include vancomycin and Zosyn due to a worsening CXR.
She never needed to be intubated and eventually was satting well on RA.
She was transferred back to the floor on POD4 with markedly improved stridor and dyspnea.
Thereafter, her saturations and vitals remained stable despite occasional subjective dyspnea while supine.
Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments were given every 6 hours.
The ENT team was comfortable with diet per speech and swallow and primary teams.
GI/GU: Due to no improvement and in fact worsening obstructive picture, the pt ended up having an ex-lap on HD 8.
Prior to that, she was only having minimal flatus and bowel movements with aggressive suppository treatments.
Post-operatively, the patient was also kept NPO for a while aggressive awaiting return of bowel function.
NGT tube was removed on POD 2 due to very low output.
A PICC line was placed on POD 3 and TPN was initiated shortly thereafter.
The next day, a video swallow study was ordered which she passed and was allowed to start a diet with many aspiration precautions in place.
Her distention and obstipation continued to worsen and a KUB was obtained which showed colonic ileus.
The patient was given bisacodyl suppositories in the mornings.
Because of prolonged NPO status the patient was started on TPN and was followed closely by inpatient nutrition.
The patient was to be discharged on TPN cycled overnight with intention of tapering TPN as her PO intake increased.
The patient will need continued speech therapy during her rehabilitation hospital stay.
It was removed on HD 8.
It was again replaced on HD 9/POD1 for close urine output monitoring given respiratory status and desire to keep from fluid overload.
ID: refer to the antibiotic regimen mentioned above in the pulmonary section.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
The heparin was then administered in the TPN.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: #Stridor: patient was scoped by ENT who noted sluggish vocal cords and recommended steroids.
She received 3 doses of dexamethasone, racemic epinephrine nebs and ipratropium nebs with some improvement in symptoms.
She was kept on face mask in the ICU and her O2 sat was stable.
#Healthcare acquired pneumonia: After patient's stridor improved, she was noted to have continued O2 requirement and repeat CXR showed a new RLL consolidation and she was started on treatment for HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime on [**2117-1-25**].
Given her NPO status, her home metoprolol was converted to IV and patient's tachycardia responded well to metoprolol.
Her pain was controlled with IV morphine prn and her anxiety was controlled with Ativan prn.
# Nutrition: As patient was NPO due to stridor and post-operative from abdominal surgery, a PICC line was placed and TPN was initiated.

This obstruction was managed conservatively with nasogastric tube decompression and intravenous hydration.
However, you developed acute abdominal pain which required Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to preform an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesionss, and repair serosal defects.
Prior to this procedure you were noted to have a possible aspiration pneumonia on chest Xray for which you were treated with a full course of Levofloxacin intravenously.
You have damage to your vocal cords which will be followed by ENT as an outpatient and may require an injection.
Because you are not going to be able to meet your caloric needs right away from food alone, you will be discharged to rehab with an order for TPN and this will be gradually decreased overtime and eventually stopped.
Some loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are expected however, if you notice that you are passing bright red blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will have some constipation.
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or constipation.
You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain.
Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily.
