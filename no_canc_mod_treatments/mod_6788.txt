She was given 81 mg of aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin times three, and 4 mg of morphine by Emergency Medical Service in the field.
She was given 3000 units of heparin, a nitroglycerin drip, Lasix 40 mg, and started on Integrilin.
She was premedicated with Solu-Medrol and Benadryl due to a suspected allergy to contrast and sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
She has used a walker for a number of years and currently gets short of breath with minimal exertion.
Of note, during the cardiac catheterization the femoral artery was unable to be cannulated, and a right radial approach was necessary.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and was started on aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin drip, and Lipitor.
The Integrilin drip was stopped prematurely, approximately eight hours after staring, status post catheterization due to concern over bleeding from central venous site as well as a femoral sheath.
Lipids were checked on hospital day four, and the patient was found to have an low-density lipoprotein of 95; and therefore Lipitor was stopped.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was on six antihypertensive medications at home.
Status post catheterization, her medications were started and titrated up slowly, and she was discharged on an antihypertensive regimen of metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., enalapril 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
