Ca    Phos   Mg 8.1*  2.1*   1.8    Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old W with a recent healthcare-associated pneumonia ([**2141-7-13**]), presented to the ED with dyspnea and palpitations, was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis in setting of a new large R-sided pneumonia.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, extubated without difficulty, and transferred to the Medicine floor for further management.
The patient received eight days of intravenous vancomycin, aztreonem, and ciprofloxacin to treat her large right-sided pneumonia.
These antibiotics were chosen in light of her many antibiotic allergies.
She also received schedueled nebulizer treatments, chest physical therapy, beside respiratory suctioning, and an acapella valve.
Repeat chest imaging suggested an increasing component of fluid overload, for which she was treated with diuretics.
Her oxygen requirement was slowly weaned from 2 liters via nasal canula to 1 liter at the time of discharge.
She did not have a home oxygen requirement prior to admission.
She was diuresed with IV lasix then transitioned to her oral home regimen.
She will need continued monitoring of her daily weight, Ins and Outs (weigh diapers/pads), and physical exam to determine her current volume status and need for additional diuresis.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Once her blood pressures were stable, the patient was continued on her home regimen of Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily for rate control, and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
This improved with initiation of diuresis and topical triamcinolone applied twice daily.
A more aggressive bowel regimen was started and the patient improved to baseline.
Fe studies revealed a low Fe (19), low-normal ferritin (74), and decreased TIBC.
The benefit of starting iron supplementation, or pursuing a further evaluation should be addressed in the future by her outpatient provider.
# GERD: The patient's home PPI regimen of Omeprazole was continued.
# Hx of Breast CA: The patient was on Exemestane prior to admission.
This was not continued during her hospital admission, but re-started upon discharge.
# Speech and Swallow: The patient was evaluated a number of times by Speech who advanced her diet to soft solids and thin liquids, meds whole with puree, and recommended swallow follow up in rehab to ensure diet tolerance and consider further upgrades.
