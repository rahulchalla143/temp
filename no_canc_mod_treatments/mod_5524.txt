Pregnancy complicated by pre-term labor and delivery occurred via cesarean section due to transverse position.
Respiratory:  The infant exhibited mild to moderate hyaline membrane disease and was intubated and received one dose of surfactant.
The patient was quickly extubated to CPAP within the first day of life, and then transitioned to nasal cannula.
Nasal cannula flow was maintained for several weeks secondary to apnea of prematurity.
Caffeine therapy was initiated as well.
Apnea of prematurity gradually improved, and nasal cannula was removed on [**3-22**].
Caffeine was discontinued on [**3-28**].
At the time of discharge, the patient has been stable without apneic episodes for five days off of caffeine therapy.

By the time of discharge, the patient has been feeding on an ad lib basis 24 calorie breast milk or Enfamil formula, with good volumes and good weight gain for approximately five days.
Hepatitis B vaccine was given on [**4-2**].
The patient has been tolerating ad lib feeds of 24 calorie formula or breast milk for approximately one week, with good growth.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for this infant, as he was born under 32 weeks and has a sibling in the house.
