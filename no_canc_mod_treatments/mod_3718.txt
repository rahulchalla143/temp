HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with a history of numerous admissions for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations as well as a recent non-Q-wave myocardial infarction who has recently completed a course of ciprofloxacin for dysuria as well as Zithromax for a recent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
At that time, the patient was noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**] to under utilize his medications and oxygen.
The patient was given intravenous benzodiazepines and Solu-Medrol intravenously and was intubated and sedated with propofol for impending respiratory failure.
The patient's heart rate on admission was 135, and he was given 10 mg intravenously of diltiazem for rate control.
The patient was given one dose of intravenous Levaquin and a Medical Intensive Care Unit evaluation was requested at that time.

During his hospital course, the patient was treated with azithromycin, as well as oral steroids, as well as meter-dosed inhalers and nebulizers for his reactive airway disease.
The patient was given intravenous Solu-Medrol and was reintubated for respectively airway protection.
The patient was continued on a Versed drip and a Fentanyl drip throughout his stay.
The patient's beta blocker was held given the acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and statin and aspirin were continued.
After two more days, it was thought that extubation could be once again attempted since the patient's laryngospasm should have been reduced with intravenous steroids.
The patient was extubated and did quite well for the first hour, but subsequently began to have extreme tachypnea causing air trapping and causing the patient to work harder at high lung volumes.
After these two failed attempts at extubation, given the patient's severe pulmonary disease, it was thought that placing a tracheostomy would be the most appropriate decision in the hopes that the patient would be able to come off the tracheostomy in the next one to two months.
After extensive discussions with the family, as well as with the house staff, it was decided that the patient would have a tracheostomy placed.
Of note, the patient also developed a minor urinary tract infection toward the end of his hospitalization and was placed on ciprofloxacin and had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed as well as tracheostomy for feeding.
