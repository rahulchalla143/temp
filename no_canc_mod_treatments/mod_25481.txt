Lungs demonstrate increased interstitial opacities and Kerley B lines.
Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC.
However, if there is clinical concern for lymphadenopathy followup imaging recommended following treatment of fluid status.
Fluid and echogenic debris within the endometrial cavity without vascularity may represent blood, but devascularized retained products of conception cannot be excluded.
Evaluate liver and gallbladder for pathology and perform Doppler to rule out clot.
The bilateral kidneys demonstrate increased echogenicity, which is a nonspecific finding; however, in the setting of apparent sepsis, pyelonephritis is not excluded.
Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed and essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
Gallbladder sludge not seen on ultrasound, but may be related to fasting state.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "bone sacroiliac bone left, ?
The ET tube tip is just above the level of the clavicular heads approximately 5 cm above the carina.
ARDS would be another possibility and should be correlated with clinical findings.
Status post drainage of septic left hip, now with spiking fevers.
Intravenous contrast was not administered.
The tip of the endotracheal tube is in good position, 3.8 cm above the carina.
Oral and intravenous contrasts were not administered.
This may represent the sequelae of prior adrenal hemorrhage.
Oral and intravenous contrasts were not administered.
This is consistent with recent debridement and placement of antibiotic capsules.
A Foley catheter is noted in the dependent portion of the bladder.
Low-attenuation lesion measuring approximately 2 cm in the upper pole of the right kidney which is poorly defined.
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach.
Right jugular line tip projects over the low SVC.
There are multiple rounded radiopaque bodies projected over the left iliac bone, which probably represents antibiotic impregnated beads.
CONCLUSION: Status post antibiotic bead placement.
Embolization coils and skin staples again noted.
FINDINGS: There is a surgical defect in the left iliac bone with round high density pellets which is consistent with the previously described I&D, and subsequent antibiotic pellet placement.
High-density material projecting in the distribution of the left superior gluteal artery is consistent with catheter embolization material.
Skin staple line is also seen projecting over this area.

Brief Hospital Course: On presentation she was hypotensive with bandemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (creatinine > 3) with fluid refractory shock requiring three pressors.
She was electively intubated prior to emergent pelvic exploration.
The procedure was complicated by significant bleeding which required arteriogram and gelfoam to the left superior glutal artery.
She returned to the operating room on [**2199-10-4**] for repeat washout and exchange of antibiotics beads, and dilation and curettage.
Initial antibiotic coverage included vancomycin, Zosyn, ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
Clindamycin was added on [**2199-1-4**].
Postoperative course was complicated by ARDS and persistent oxygen requirement despite attempts at diuresis with lasix drip.
Her appetite improved and NGT was removed, and she was converted to oral antibiotics and her PICC line was removed.
Her affect improved over the course of her stay on the medical floor, with improvements in eye contact, voice intonation, facial expression and personability, although impairments in all areas remained noticeable.
Per orthopedic team, she should continue daily injections of Lovenox until her follow-up appointment in orthopedics clinic in early [**Month (only) **].
From an infectious standpoint, she should continue ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to complete a six-week course from [**10-11**].
She has worked with physical therapy who has recommended discarge to rehab facility.
Medications at time of discharge include Flagyl, ciprofloxacin, Lovenox, Percocet as needed, and stool softeners as needed.

SPECIMEN:  Endometrial curettings sent to pathology.
ANTIBIOTICS:  The patient continued on clindamycin, Unasyn and vancomycin that she was previously on before the operating room.
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 19-year-old female in G1, P1, status post a spontaneous vaginal delivery on [**2199-9-20**], who presented with left hip pain that was making her have difficulty sitting and standing but denied any fever, chills, abdominal pain.
The patient had a precipitous delivery and only received a local anesthesia at the perineum at the time of delivery.
The patient presented with hypotension and required pressors for blood pressure support.
She was started on vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl.
Given these concerning findings and the patient's concerning state, she was taken to the operating room where she underwent an incision and drainage of the left iliac bone and after coming out of the operating room, her hematocrit fell precipitously and she was taken to the interventional radiology for an embolization of the superior gluteal vessel which was found to be bleeding.
The patient was taken back to the operating room today for repeat incision and drainage of the clot from the bleeding as well as any infection as well as antibiotic bead placement by orthopedics.
The extra suture material which looked like 0-Vicryl was trimmed and hemostasis was noted.
The orthopedics team completed their portion of the surgery in the supine position, and when they had completed their portion of the operation, the patient was then placed in the dorsal- lithotomy position with the [**Doctor Last Name **] stirrups in order to support the patient's left thigh given resection of her bone.
The patient was continued on her clindamycin, Zosyn and vancomycin.
The posterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a ring forceps and the uterus was sounded with an endometrial sampling Pipelle to 14 cm.
A very gentle sharp curettage was performed after dilating the cervix easily to a #25 [**Location (un) 1662**] dilator.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was placed again in dorsal supine position.
