Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dementia, symptomatic bradycardia presenting with syncopal event, colitis, hypotension.
During her course, she received a total of 3L of NS for repletion which brought her HR back down to the 100s-110s.
Her abdominal pain was treated first with narcotics in the ED which made her confused, and as such she was instead started on standing tylenol which worked well for her pain.
Notably, the patient's goals of care seem to indicate no pressors, so as such, the patient has been supported with IVF throughout her stay (3L).
She also received some narcotic medication while in the ED which may have contributed to her hypotension.
Finally, a CXR read states a possible PNA, however given clinical picture, no treatment for PNA was started.
As above, no rate control agents were used given h/o symptomatic bradycardia, and rather IVF brought her rate down.
Tylenol was used for pain, and we continued her aspirin.
As per family wishes, no tele was used for monitoring while here.
Infectious causes are possible exacerbating causes of syncope, and as such we will continue abx therapy as above.
We deferred further extensive w/u given goals of care, and as above, gave fluids for the hypotension, and continued treatment for infx.
