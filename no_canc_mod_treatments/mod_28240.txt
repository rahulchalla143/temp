She was transferred at [**Hospital3 1810**] for management of necrotizing enterocolitis on day of life 34, and returned to [**Hospital1 346**] on day of life 98 ([**2124-10-9**]) at 3 months postmenstrual age.
A history of her hospital course from [**7-3**] to [**2124-10-9**] is as follows: [**Known lastname 6885**] was born at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2124-7-3**] to a 23-year-old gravida 6, para 2 now 3 mother whose pregnancy was complicated by severe preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction prompting delivery by cesarean section.
Her initial course at [**Hospital3 **] was notable for the following:  Respiratory: Mild respiratory distress syndrome.
Cardiovascular: She had a patent ductus arteriosus treated with indomethacin with documented closure of the PDA by echocardiogram.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition/GI: Initiation of enteral feeds started on day of life 8 with advancement to full feeds of Premature Enfamil 30 calorie per ounce with ProMod by day of life 19.
ID: Received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin on admission for rule out sepsis.
She started treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis on [**2124-8-3**] with vancomycin, gentamicin, and clindamycin.
Heme: Persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia with the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis, required multiple pack red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions.
In the operating room, necrosis and isolated perforations of the distal ileum were seen and these were resected with a total resection of approximately 12 cm of ileum, and an end ileostomy and a distal mucus fistula were brought to the surface.
In addition, a right saphenous femoral Broviac catheter was placed.
Her initial postoperative course was marked by moderate respiratory and hemodynamic instability requiring brief high- frequency oscillatory ventilation and intermittent dopamine, ongoing hematologic instability requiring pack red blood cells, platelets.
Subsequently, she showed slow steady progress, eventually extubating and weaning to room air starting on enteral feeds.
Her course at [**Hospital3 1810**] was notable as follows: Respiratory: She was extubated to nasal cannula on [**2124-8-25**].
Cardiovascular: She required dopamine postoperatively, and she weaned off this on [**8-17**].
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition/GI: She was maintained on parenteral nutrition.
Her feeds were started on [**2124-8-26**] and she gradually advanced.
She reached full volume feeds in mid [**Month (only) 359**], but had to be briefly reduced due to increased ileostomy output.
She required intravenous replacement of stoma output from [**9-27**] to [**10-3**] due to decreased urine output.
Her stoma output seemed to improve with return to continuous feeds and then she transitioned to [**11-28**] volume orally with 1/2 volume by continuous gavage feeds with the ostomy output stable at approximately 2 mL per kilogram per hour.
The infant was started on vitamin D supplementation.
Infectious disease: She was treated with approximately 2 weeks of vancomycin, gentamicin, and clindamycin after initial diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis with an additional 7 days of meropenem after drainage of the abscess, an additional 7 days of vancomycin for Staph.
aureus line sepsis.
Hematology: She received pack red blood cell and platelet transfusions with her last platelet transfusion on [**2124-8-18**].
Neurology: She required fentanyl drips postoperatively and weaned off this on [**2124-8-24**].
She had 2 lumbar punctures and meningitis was ruled out.
She had normal state screens sent during her hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **].
Liver 1 cm below right costal margin, no masses, active bowel sounds.
She was receiving feeds of Premature Enfamil     30 calorie per ounce by using Premature Enfamil 24     calories per ounce with 4 calories per ounce of MCT oil     and 2 calories per ounce of Polycose.
Her feeds were 160     mL per kilogram per day.
She was receiving continuous     feeds at 40 per kilogram per day and oral feeds at 120     per kilogram per day.
She was also receiving vitamin D     and Prilosec.
The Polycose was discontinued and Enfamil powder was added to the PE24 to equal 26 calories per ounce, plus 4 calories per ounce of MCT oil the day following admission.
Her oral feeds were increased up to 140 per kilogram per day and continuous were at 20 per kilogram per day on [**2124-10-17**], and she transitioned to all p.o.
Her feedings were restricted secondary to her ostomy output.
Her vitamin D was increased from 800 units a day to 1,200 units per day on [**2124-11-4**].
She has not received any blood products this admission.
She will need followup after discharge.
Psychosocial: [**Hospital1 69**] social work been involved with the family.
Feeds: Premature Enfamil concentrated to 24 calories per     ounce with 4 calories per ounce of corn oil and 2     calories per ounce of Polycose powder restricted to 190     mL per kilogram per day monitoring ostomy output.
Medications: Ergocalciferol (vitamin D) 1,200 units     orally daily, omeprazole 3 mg orally daily, Imodium 0.2     mg orally twice a day, and ferrous sulfate (25 mg per mL)     0.2 mL orally daily.
Immunizations received: Received Pediarix on [**2124-9-4**] and [**2124-11-4**].
Received pneumococcal 7 valiant vaccine on [**2124-9-4**] and [**2124-11-4**].
