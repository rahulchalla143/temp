Administered intracoronary vasodilators.
Perfomed intravascular ultrasound using the Atlantis catheter and this revealed mild diffuse atherosclerosis throughout the LAD and residual subocclusive thrombus in the proximal LAD.
It was decided that we would administer 18 hours of integrilin and IV heparin for at least 48 hours rather than cause distal embolization with stent, balloon or rheolytic thrombectomy.

EKG consistent with anterolateral ST-elevations with cardiac catheterization showing abrupt cut-off at the mid-LAD with visible vessel thrombus of the mid-LAD and distal reconstitution with some distal-LAD disease; underwent aspiration and balloon dottering of LAD via RFA access but given the need to avoid distal embolization, anti-platelet therapy was planned for 48-hours with a re-look planned.
Received Aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 300 mg load, heparin IV 4000 unit bolus prior to cath [**Year (4 digits) **] transfer.
Integrillin and heparin gtt continued following cardiac cath.

Visible thrombus in the apical LAD with "train track" appearance with some flow in the apex was also noted.
Heparin gtt was continued until Lovenox was utilized and then the patient was bridged to Coumadin.

Has been on insulin since and has blood glucose levels in the 150-200 mg/dL range at home, per patient.
The patient required aggressive uptitration of insulin given persistent hyperglycemia in the 400 mg/dL range.
