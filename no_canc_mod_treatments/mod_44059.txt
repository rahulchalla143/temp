Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o with hypotension and AMS in the setting of recent C diff infection, who was found to have worsening sepsis with Enterobacter UTI and new-onset seizures.
During the course of the hospitalization, the patient transitioned to comfort care.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Seizures: Pt developed seizures on HD 4.
She was initially treated with Ativan 1mg SL TID for seizure control, with Ativan 1-2mg IV or IM for active seizures.
However, her mental status improved and she was able to take PO so she was converted to Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **], still with Ativan PRN for active seizing.
The patient and her family understand that she may require SL Ativan in the future for seizure control if she becomes less alert and they accept that this may make her more sedated.
Her treatment course included IV Flagyl which was started on [**12-10**].
However, after discussing with the patient and her family, she has decided to focus on comfort care.
Her Flagyl was discontinued in light of her new goals of care and development of seizures (given that Flagyl can lower seizure threshold).
After Flagyl was stopped, pt had recurrence of her diarrhea so she was started on PO vancomycin as elimination of her diarrhea is consistent with her goal to focus on comfort.
She was given ceftriaxone (PCN allergy but tolerated ceftriaxone in [**2130**]) abx coverage, but then broadened to cefepime coverage given hypotension and concern for sepsis.
# ARF: Her Cr was elevated to 1.8 on admission from 1.1 baseline, likely partially prerenal from volume depletion, but given FE Na 2.07% this also suggests partially intrinsic etiology.
The patient was very clear about her wishes to focus on comfort measures only.
She is eating per her own preferences, and taking medications as she desires.
She is aware of her option for hospice care but currently does not want to go with hospice.
