This was due to an infection of your epiglottis called epiglottitis.
For this reason you had a breathing tube put in.
You were given antibiotics to treat the infection and another medication (prednisone) to treat the swelling.
You will need to finish a full course of antibiotics to be sure that your infection resolves, and complete a taper of prednisone.
