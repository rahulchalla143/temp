Additionally, dialysis should be considered.
Please note that the patient has had three MRIs with intravenous gadolinium in the span of three days (at 2 different institutions), and the presence of intra- articular gadolinium on the current study (and in the urinary bladder on the pre-contrast images from the previous study) suggests renal impairment and decreased clearance of gadolinium.

Initially held plavix given potential for operative management of discitis; it was restarted and will need to be taken into consideration if he is ever a candidate for surgery.
He will need a CBC drawn biweekly and will need transfusions for symptoms or HCT < 23.
Liver was consulted and recommended further outpatient workup with possible biopsy and RFA.
alpha-1 antitrypsin normal, SMA negative, hereditary hemachromatosis test pending.
Diuresed well with IV and PO lasix.
He is being discharged on PO lasix, which should be titrated according to his fluid status, renal function, and blood pressure.
