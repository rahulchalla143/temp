She was discharged home on [**2117-12-1**] with plans for rehabilitation and recovery at home and then possible mitral valve repair in the future for her known mitral regurgitation.
She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and treatment as well as workup for possible aortic valve replacement/mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
ALLERGIES:  She has multiple drug allergies including SULFA, ASPIRIN, CODEINE, ALLOPURINOL, COLCHICINE, and DIGOXIN.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  When she was seen by Cardiac Surgery on [**2118-1-27**] included Coreg 3.125 mg p.o.
twice daily, amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
once daily, Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
once daily, Lasix 60 mg p.o.
twice daily, Protonix 40 mg p.o.
once daily, Advair 100/50 twice daily, and Caltrate 500 mg p.o.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In preparation for impending valve surgery the patient underwent a number of studies and also was seen daily by the Medicine Service and the Cardiology Service for resolution of her congestive heart failure.
Sh[**Last Name (STitle) **]in the hospital approximately 10 days prior to her surgery with plans to obtain either repeat pulmonary function tests from an outside hospital or new pulmonary function tests at [**Hospital1 69**].
Cardiothoracic Surgery also recommended a possible Neurology consultation as the patient reported presyncope and syncopal symptoms over the past two months.
The patient did have a Foley catheter in place.
The Foley was removed on [**2118-2-6**].
She also received two doses of Macrodantin for a urinary tract infection.
Heparin was stopped overnight on midnight on the night prior to surgery.
Her last PT on the heparin drip was 150.
On [**2118-2-7**] the patient underwent aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, replacement of ascending aorta, closure of ASD/ISD, and a partial maze radiofrequency ablation.
The patient received a 23-mm CE pericardial aortic valve, a 27-mm mitral ThermaFix pericardial valve, a 32-mm partial tricuspid ring, a 26-mm gel weave tube graft in the ascending aortic position.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on a milrinone drip at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, a nitroglycerin drip at 0.7 mcg/kg/min, and an epinephrine drip at 0.02 mcg/kg/min.
Over the course of the next several days, the patient exhibited both bradycardia and a rapid atrial fibrillation.
She remained on an epinephrine drip and a Neo-Synephrine drip for several days for pressor support.
Electrophysiology consulted on the patient and determined that she had tachy- brady syndrome and would require a pacemaker.
She was weaned off her drips and was transferred out to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two.
On [**2-18**], she received a pacemaker by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
She was started on Toprol and amiodarone.
Again, she refused to restart Coumadin given her increased bleeding risk and prior gastrointestinal bleeds.
Also on [**2-18**], a chest x-ray showed small bilateral effusions, but the patient made excellent progress on the floor after her pacemaker and was discharged from the hospital.
Her epicardial pacing wires had been removed.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Protonix enteric coated 40 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Fluticasone/salmeterol 100/50 mcg dosing disk one disk    with device inhalation twice daily.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o.
Albuterol sulfate 0.083 percent solution 1 inhalation    q.6h.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
once daily for three days; then    amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
The patient was instructed to continue amiodarone until    she saw either Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57402**] or Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve    replacement, tricuspid valve repair, radiofrequency maze    procedure, repair of atrial septal defect with closure and    replacement of ascending aorta.
Status post pacemaker implantation.
