Status post T9-L4 posterior rod and screw fusion with  bone graft with satisfactory hardware position and preserved vertebral body alignment in this patient with T11 and L2 fractures.
Incompletely assessed pelvic fractures including a right sacral body and [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture extending into at least one of the right neural foramina.
In the ED no intra-abd, intracranial, or intrathoracic injuries were identified; he was seen and evaluated by the ortho trauma and neuro-spine services.
Injuries: T11, L2 fracture R sacral alar fracture Right superior/inferior pubic rami fracture R 9th rib fx  [**8-30**]: Admitted to TSICU for Q2hr neuro checks, on log roll precautions without any neurologic deficits.
Pain controlled with IV dilaudid.
[**8-31**]: His C-spine was cleared and the collar removed.
He was found to be stable for transfer to the surgical floor, and was kept NPO after midnight in preparation for operative intervention [**9-1**] with spine.
[**9-1**]:  Went to the OR with spine surgery for posterior fusion of T9 through L4.
Tolerated teh procedure well.
[**9-2**]: OR with ortho trauma for attempted SI fixation, but the procedure was aborted secondary to overlying bowel gas.
[**9-4**]:  The patient went back to the OR with Ortho-Trauma for a successful SI fixation.
He tolerated the procedure well, was extubated post-procedure and recovered in PACU.
He was then transferred back to the surgical floor for further management.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric tube was inserted for gastric decompression.
He was kept NPO and IV fluids were administered.
His pain was initially managed with a dilaudid PCA and then transitioned to oral narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics once taking a full diet.
Both physical and occupational therapy evaluated Mr. [**Known lastname **] and felt that he would benefit from intense rehabilitation at an appropriate facility.
As his ambulation and mobilization increased over the subsequent days, pain management had been an issue.
He is being discharged with standing acetaminophen and ultram with PRN dilaudid.

Also, please take any new medications as prescribed.
You are being discharged on narcotic pain medications (dilaudid and ultram).
It is also beneficial to take narcotics along with standing Tylenol during this acute period.
