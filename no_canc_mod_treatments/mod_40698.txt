[**2190-8-26**] 06:03PM STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN B ASSAY- detected  Brief Hospital Course: This 84 year old woman with atrial fib, CHF, HTN in non-convulsive status epilepticus also with recent digoxin toxicity and UTI presented to this hospital for management of her status epilepticus.
She was started on propofol and continued on dilantin for presumed status epilepticus.
The patient had been empirically started on meningitic antibiotics.
The regimen was modified on transfer and included vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
She was also started empirically on acyclovir for possible HSV infection.
MRI/MRA brain was not remarkable for stroke or bleed.
The patient was continued on propofol and dilantin.
Dilantin doses were adjusted and keppra was added on.
Propofol was transitioned to ativan drip as the patients blood pressure was somewhat labile on propofol.
After several days of an EEG without seizure activity, the Ativan drip was weaned and eventually discontinued.
She was kept on ventilation until it was decided after several family meetings to move towards comfort measures only.
A morphine drip was started and the breathing tube was discontinued.
Her atrial fibrillation was managed with diltiazem or BB if her blood pressured allowed.
Her warfarin was discontinued since the patient had a decreased hematocrit.
She improved soon after having started her on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
Her diastolic CHF was managed with antihypertensive and diuretic medications as needed.
