History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] is a 53 year old M with PMH of chronic vent/trach recent admission for VAP, severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, seizure disorder, depression and schizophrenia who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive overnight.
He was taken off of the ventilator and bagged with improvement in mental status.
He was treated with cefepime, tobramycin, and high dose Bactrim all of which he was still taking at time of presentation.
Respiratory was called and he was placed on the ventilator.
He initially refused a line and IVF was given through PICC.
CXR showed alight proximal migration of right-sided PICC line with tip now terminating within the mid subclavian vein, persistent right middle and lower lobe collapse, increased patchy airspace opacities at the left lung base which could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
Given persistent hypotension, patient acquiesced to central access and a femoral line was placed.
He was also given a dose of Vancomycin and Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 in the ED.
He is being admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and hypotension.
Of note, patient has been on a ventilator since [**Month (only) 359**] for respiratory failure secondary to severe COPD.

1)Unresponsiveness - Unclear etiology, initially suspicous for infection and he was treated with vancomycin after his PICC was removed and tip culture was positive for coag negative staph.
His blood cultures remained negative after 48 hours so his vancomycin was discontinued.
Possible contributing factors include volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency and autonomic insufficiency.
His blood pressure responded to IVF boluses.
For his adrenal insufficiency he was continued on hydrocortisone but was tapered from 100mg IV q8 to 50mg IV Q8 to chronic dose of 20mg qam and 5mg qpm.
4)COPD/chronic vent/trach - he had no acute issues during his admission and he was weaned on his ventillator settings.
He was discharged on a trach collar at 8 l/min.
He should follow up with pulmonology as an outpatient for further weaning of his ventillator settings.
5)Right leg pain: His leg pain pain was similar to the chronic pain he has had for years, for which he is on chronic narcotics.
He was continued on acetaminophen and oxycodone PRN for pain.
He was continued on his outpatient psychiatric regimen including risperidone and effexor.
He would likely benefit from further psychiatric care and medication adjustment given his continued depressed mood.
7)Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: He was continued on glargine and humalog sliding scale.
8)Seizure disorder: Continued on levetiracetam and depakote.
9)Constipation: he was continued on bowel regimen of lactulose PRN, colase and senna.
10) Schizophrenia: Continue outpatient dose of risperidone  11)F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG with Probalance Full strength; Goal rate: 70 ml/hr Flush w/ 250 ml water q6h.
His free water flushes were increased as he appeared to become dehydrated and hypotensive on tube feeds alone.
12) PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC  heparin for DVT prophylaxis  13) Access:He had a right femoral line during his admission to complete his antibiotic course.
This was discontinued on discharge following completion of his antibiotic course.
