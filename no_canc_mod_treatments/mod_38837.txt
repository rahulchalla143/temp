Her tylenol level on presentation was 10, her ALT was 1117, AST 821.
The patient had previously been started on a NAC drip at [**Hospital1 **], where she already had persistently elevated transaminases.
The patient was continued on a NAC drip throughout her time at [**Hospital1 **] and after transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her NAC drip was continued until her acetaminophen level was undetectable, her INR decreased to 0.9, and her transaminases continued to trend downward, suggesting that she was unlikely to suffer further liver injury.
She was seen by social work to help establish care and follow-up.
She will follow up with her dentist for further pain control and evaluation of the tooth pain as needed.
Given that she was asymptomatic, she was not started on antibiotic.
