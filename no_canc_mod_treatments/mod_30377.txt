Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm tube graft.
Splenectomy for bleeding.
Due to his anatomy, it was felt that he would not be a good stent graft candidate.
PSH: multiple skin grafts on left ankle after burn ([**2159**]), multiple knee surgeries on L. and arthroscopic on R. ([**2159**]), R. rotator cuff repair ([**2168**])   Social History: Current smoker.
[**2200-1-7**] CT Torso with NGT and IV contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Satisfactory postoperative appearance of open abdominal aortic aneurysm  repair.
Stomach:  Mucosa: A few areas of erythema and erosions were noted in the antrum consistent with NG tube induced injury.
Other findings: After the OTSC placement, an NG tube was placed under endoscopic vision successfully into gastric antrum.
Impression: A few areas of erythema and erosions were noted in the antrum consistent with NG tube trauma.
Another NG tube was then placed in the antrum.
Residual about 9 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm low to intermediate density fluid in the subphrenics space with drain in place.
Two perigastric surgical drains as described above.
Post-surgical appearance following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: 58M with 5.7cm infra-renal/juxta-renal AAA who presented for open AAA resection-suprarenal cross clamp, with intraoperative course complicated splenic laceration requiring splenectomy, and post-operative course complicated by small gastric fundal perforation requiring endoclipping.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the OR on [**2199-12-30**] for open repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm tube graft.
Intraoperative bleeding with splenic laceration was noted, for which the ACS service was consulted, and ultimately performed a splenectomy during the same procedure (attending surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was appropriately diuresed with a lasix drip, and transfused as necessary.
Tube feeds were begun on POD 4, and HIT panel returned negative.
On POD5 erythema surrounding his midline vertical abdominal incision was noted and he was begun on cefazolin given concern for a superficial skin infection.
Following initiation of clears on POD7, however, JP output markedly increased to over a liter per day from each drain.
Day 1 of TPN was initiated thereafter on [**2200-1-9**] (POD 10), and the patient underwent 7 days total of TPN.
He received post-splenectomy vaccinations on [**2200-1-10**] (POD 11).
The collection was thought not ammenable to additional drainage at that time given potential injury to pancreas/lung.
One flank JP was removed on [**2200-1-17**], and the second and final JP on [**2200-1-19**].
On discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, with pain well controlled on oral medications.
Vertical midline staples were removed prior to discharge.
He was discharged home on HD22 with instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery and the ACS service.
