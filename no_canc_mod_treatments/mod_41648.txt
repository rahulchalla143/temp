The patient also notes that he has an Achilles tendon which has ruptured for which he is scheduled to have a surgical repair sometime this summer.
For this reason we now list levofloxacin as an allergy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 101.7 Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 86, his blood pressure was 99/50, and his respiratory rate was 22 and he was saturating 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was resuscitated in the ER with 2 liters of normal saline after which time he had a hypotensive episode into the 80s systolic and 40s diastolic.
At this time it was noted that he already had 2 liters of IV fluid and he was not responsive to this.
For this reason he was put on a sepsis protocol and a central line was started.
The patient was started on a Levophed drip.
He was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit at which time he was observed over the course of the evening to continue his resuscitation and we were able to wean him off the Levophed on hospital day 2.
The patient had been started on broad spectrum antibiotic treatment on admission.
This antibiotic treatment continued to be refined as he continued to spike fevers, and awaiting for blood and urine culture results.
When the sensitivities of the E.coli came back, those being poly-drug resistant, the patient's medications were changed over to ceftazidime to which the organism was noted to be sensitive.
The patient was maintained on ceftazidime starting on the evening of hospital day 2 and continuing through hospital day 4 at which time the patient was changed to Bactrim double strength 1 PO b.i.d.
The patient was observed on this medical regimen for 24 hours after which time he was noted to have remained afebrile and asymptomatic.
Pyridium 100 mg 1 PO q.8 p.r.n.
