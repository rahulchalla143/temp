His acute decline during [**Location (un) **] appears to correspond roughly to a rapid ventricular rate and lidocaine administration.
He was unresponsive and intubated on arrival to the MICU but improved over the first hospital day.
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but seizure was thought to be most likely cause given improvement over a day and seizure-lowering properties of lidocaine and alkalosis.
However, he became intermittently quite agitated requiring anti-psychotics and eventually resumption of sedation.
He was difficult to wean from the ventilator, becoming uncomfortable after a few hours on pressure support, and it was clear that he had substantial respiratory muscle weakness.
Given that this was unlikely after such a dramatic course, they chose to change his code status to DNR/DNI and eventually was transitioned to comfort measures.
