Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded but should be correlated with clinical findings.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with higher-than-normal gradients.
# Pneumonia/respiratory failure:  She was admitted with altered mental status and met SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, with infiltrates later seen on chest CT.  She was treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Cultures eventually grew stenotrophomonas sensitive to bactrim but this was thought to repesent colonization rather than infection.
She is to complete a seven day course of antibiotics with last doses on [**6-21**], and a PICC was placed to facilitate this.
Her lasix dose will need continued adjustment to optimize her volume status.
Her altered mental status was thought to be secondary to infection and improved with treatment of pneumonia.
# Atrial fibrillation:  She was previously on metoprolol but was started on digoxin during [**Month (only) 547**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
However, because her ventricular rate was high in the 120s at times, she was started on metoprolol.
Her warfarin was initially held in the setting of antibiotics and an INR>3 but restarted.
# Mitral valve replacement: Mechanical valve per report and history of rheumatic heart disease.
She was continued on warfarin as described above.
