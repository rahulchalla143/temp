Interval colectomy and colostomy takedown with a large amount of intraperitoneal free air and fecalized material throughout the abdomen, especially within the left paracolic gutter and pelvis, most consistent with anastomostic dehiscence.
Gas dissecting into the soft tissues of the pelvic side walls and extending into the left groin and anterior abdominal wall which may be related to extension of intraperitoneal gas; however, necrotizing fasciitis cannot be excluded.
CT-guided procedure [**2182-11-12**]: Patient status post CT-guided catheter placement into right and left-sided fluid collections, the right suggestive of hematoma and the left compatible with abscess , without immediate complication.
There is no definite evidence of a leak although the rectal contrast does not flow proximal to the anastomosis inspite of rectal distention with contrast and repeat/delayed scanning.
Enlarged uterus which may represent uterine fibroids and can be assessed further with a pelvic ultrasound as per clinical need.
Dilated fluid-filled esophagus and stomach with patulous GE junction, and retrograde flow of contrast to the lung apices, placing the patient at risk for aspiration.
Removal of gastric contents would be advised.
