1) NSTEMI: Ruled in at OSH with elevated CK-MB, troponin I. Cath was attempted after pt diuresed, however cath was aborted d/t pt discomfort and desaturation on table.
She was subsequently re-cathed and two bare metal stents were placed to her SVG-OM.
Of note, pt gets ARF on ACE inhibitors.
2) Refractory HTN: Pt's outpt hydralazine was doubled with better control of her blood pressure, around 130-150 systolically.
Pt will continue spironolactone and Demadex, which was increased in dose.
4) LLL pneumonia: Treated with CTX and Azithromycin.
5) COPD: Pt not on standing inhalers at home.
Started on Advair 100/50 1 inhalation [**Hospital1 **].
She received Atrovent and Albuterol nebs for bronchodilator therapy during her hospitalization, and was d/c'd on MDI's.
Would not give pt ACE inhibitors in the future given her propensity to go into ARF on them.
However, she has risk factors for it, and prior records document DM type 2.
7) Anemia, maybe d/t hypothyroidism: Pt was guiaic negative with normal iron, vitamin B12, and folate.
9) Left forearm thrombophlebitis: Due to an IV, with no evidence of infection.
