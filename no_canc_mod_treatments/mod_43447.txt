Doubt overt CHF or pneumonia  RIGHT PICC LINE PLACEMENT [**2185-5-4**] IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 55 cm 5- French double- lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with tip in the superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 39 yo male with Prader Willi, diabetes, and CRI, who recently developed C. diff after antibiotic treatment for cellulitis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] was also noted to have MRSA bacteremia and was treated with Vancomycin.
The pt was also empirically treated with oral Flagyl for the C.diff colitis, however 3 sets of stool were negative for C. difficile toxin.
The left sided PICC was removed and a new right sided PICC was placed.
The pt was treated with Vancomycin (to complete a total 14 day course on [**2185-5-16**]) for the MRSA bacteremia (trough goal 15-20, current adjusted dose is 1 gram q48h).
Once treatment with Vancomycin is completed, the pt will need to have surveillance cultures to ensure clearance of bacteremia.
The pt was also noted to have diarrhea in the setting of antibiotic use.
Rectal tube fell out on the day prior to discharge, but the pt remained continent.
The pt was maintained on CPAP (18 cm QHS) at night for his obstructive sleep apnea.
FEN: Diarrhea resolved with treatment during the hospitalization.
The pt was continued on Erythropoietin and iron.
Diabetes Mellitus: The pt was noted to have elevated blood glucose level (in 200 range) for which his standing morning 70/30 dose of insulin was increased.
It is likely that the pt will need uptitration of his insulin if the blood glucose levels continue to remain elevated.
Prophylaxis: The pt was maintained on subcutaneous Heparin and pantoprazole for prophylaxis.
The patient was very particular in choosing the specific rehabilitation institution for discharge, noting that he has had numerous negative experiences with various rehab sites in the past.
