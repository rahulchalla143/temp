The previously placed pulmonary artery catheter in the right internal jugular vein was used to measure right sided pressures (only PCW and PA).
CARDIAC CATH w AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY [**2164-4-10**]: Initial hemodynamics revealed a peak aortic gradient of 19mmHg, with a valve area of 0.62cm2 and cardiac index of 1.7l/min/m2.
After several inflations with a 20mm balloon, the gradient decreased to 13mmHg and the valve area increased to 0.8cm2.
# Hypotension: initially cardiogenic, but also likley in septic shock by the end - used neosyn, dobutamine, and vasopressin .
- cont vanco/zosyn, added flagyl - lasix gtt; goal to improve respiratory status - Supplemental O2 - nebs prn .
- cath revealed coronaries unchanged from prior cath - ASA - currently on pressers, so no BB - statin .
Now with decompensated heart failure and episodes of flash pulm edema - [**Month/Day (2) **] with severe AS, mod-sev MR, and EF 15-20% - cont lasix gtt as tol; titrate to improvement in respiratory status - cont pressers as above .
# FEN: NPO (resp distress) .
