She was initially externally placed and subsequently had a temporary pacing wire inserted.
When she was in route to the [**Hospital6 2018**] she was found to have pulseless VT for which she was shocked in the ambulance and started on Amiodarone.
When she arrived, she was on dopamine and Levophed.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted and left in place for the duration of her procedure.
She subsequently underwent PTCA and stenting of the left circumflex followed by reperfusion, ventricular tachycardia.
She was shocked to a sinus rhythm and then underwent successful stenting of the LAD lesion.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
ALLERGIES:  She has a sensitivity to hydrochlorothiazide but there are no known drug allergies.
Her vent settings on admission to the Coronary Care Unit were assist control with tidal volume 500 and respiratory rate of 12.
EKG preprocedure at 8:02 a.m. revealed sinus rhythm with AV dissociation consistent with complete heart block, ventricular rate of 41, right bundle branch block, and [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 to V4.
Chest x-ray:  ET tube 1.8 cm from the carina with an OG tube in the distal esophagus but no cardiopulmonary process.
She underwent successful emergent revascularization of both the LAD and circumflex lesions.
The patient transferred to the CCU intubated on a balloon pump requiring dopamine for hemodynamic support.
Over the next several days, she demonstrated a remarkable improvement in her hemodynamic status and was able to wean off the dopamine quickly followed by intra-aortic balloon pump wean and removal.
Her post revascularization course was also notable for an Enterococcus urinary tract infection for which she was treated with vancomycin.
She was also found to develop a pneumonia for which she was started on Levaquin.
She was called out to the floor for titration of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor which she tolerated well.
She did have some persistent symptoms of congestive heart failure for which she was started on a standing dose of diuretic and required titration up of this.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will be transferred to [**Hospital3 1761**] for continued IV antibiotics and cardiac rehabilitation.
