HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old male with infarction times two, status post four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2135-3-6**], hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who reports he has had increased swelling of his abdomen and legs with swelling of the scrotum which has progressed over two to three weeks' time.
He received Zaroxolyn and Bumex, but his BUN and creatinine elevated.
An abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly and a renal consult thought patient was pre-renal and therefore, the patient's diuresis was withheld except for Spironolactone.
ACE inhibitor was held as well.
A paracentesis was done on [**1-11**], of two liters.
The studies showed 400 white blood cells, 520 red blood cells, no polys, 41 lymphocytes, 59 monocytes, glucose 126, total protein 3.9, LDH 110 and Enterococci grew out which was treated with Ampicillin one gram q. eight hours.
For a hematocrit of 25 he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Ascites with Enterococci sensitive to Ampicillin and sensitive to Vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55 year old male with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, significant coronary artery disease, but good ejection fraction on a recent MUGA scan, obesity, hypertension, and lower extremity edema with shortness of breath times two to three weeks.
Thickened aortic and mitral leaflets, and a right ventriculogram could be done if further quantification was to be done.
The patient had paracentesis of five liters of fluid in-house which was clear and yellow.
The patient was maintained on a cardiac low-salt diet of less than 2 grams per day and diuretics were initially held secondary to the question of prerenal azotemia.
The Renal Service was consulted regarding this patient and acute renal failure was thought to be secondary to ACE inhibitors plus diuretics plus/minus infection, with the intention to restart Bumex 2 twice a day once the patient's creatinine reached its baseline.
He was aggressively diuresed with Lasix overnight while in the Cardiac Care Unit.
He was continued on a regimen of Lasix 40 twice a day and Aldactone 100 q. day, aiming for minus 1.5 liters off per day.
It was decided that creatinine could be tolerated as high as 2.5.
Ampicillin was also given in-house while the patient had an Enterococcus in his prior peritoneal fluid.
