You were transferred here from an outside hospital for a procedure called an ERCP to evaluate your stomach pain, liver function test abnormalities, and a suspicion of IPMN seen on imaging.
A sphincterotomy was performed to treat that narrowing, and your liver tests improved thereafter.
You were started on antibiotics for this infection.
Medication changes: - Started Doxycycline an antibiotic for your left leg cellulitis, which you should take for 10 days - Restart your Coumadin at your regular dose of 5mg daily on [**9-3**].
This medication was not given to you in the hospital because we were afraid you might bleed after the spincterotomy.
Please take all of your other medications as prescribed and follow up with the appointments below.
You should discuss the following with your primary care doctor: 1) Resume coumadin for your atrial fibrillation on [**2196-9-3**] 2) Have your primary care doctor look at your left leg to ensure the infection we are treating you for is improving, and that you do not need additional antibiotics.
3) Discuss whether you need to be taking antibiotics to prevent pneumonia given that you have been on steroids as an outpatient (bactrim would be the most likely antibiotic).
