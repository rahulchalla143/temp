Normally-functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-1-12**], stenotic aortic valve has been replaced with a mechanical prosthesis.
Continued radiographic followup recommended to document resolution following treatment of the acute process.
Cardiomegaly with marked coronary calcifications, status post aortic valve repair.
He was admitted to the MICU where his BP stablized with fluid resucitation.
Initial differential including pneumonia, bacteremia related to LLE graft / ulcers / osteo and cardiac decompensation in the setting of heart failure.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were started with Vancomycin and Zosyn and blood / urine cultures were drawn.
Pressures remained stable during the initial part of hospitalization and the patient was restarted on carvediolol for improved rate control in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
On [**9-10**], antibiotics were discontinued as patient had been afebrile since admission with normalizing white counts and clinical picture clear for exacerbation of CHF.
Patient was subsequently started on lasix with  substantial diuresis and substantial subjective improvement in symptoms throughout his hospitalization.
Digoxin was continued for improved ionotropy in setting of systolic heart failure and lasix and carvedilol re-started for diruesis and afterload reduction.
# AFib/Mechanical AV: Patient's carvedilol was stopped on admission because on initial presentation he was thought to be septic.
Once sepsis was ruled out and antibiotics stopped he was re-started on to improve rate control.
His carvedilol was increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] from his home dose of 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **], with this intervention his heart rate was maintained below 100.
Patient's coumadin was stopped on admission given his presentation.
Upon transfer to the medical floor his INR became subtherapeutic and his coumadin was increased.
Upon further questioning the patient and his wife stated that he was receiving a higher dose of coumadin at home than what he was receiving presently.
His coumadin was then increased to his normal home dose and his INR began to increase.
He was discharged with a prescription for lovenox as a bridge to therapeutic INR.
A thoracentesis was done to drain the fluid and send if for analysis.
He was given a prescription to repeat CT chest in 5 weeks to evaluate for continued resolution or re accumulation of the pleural effusion.
# DM II: He was continued on his outpatient regimen of lantus and humalog.
# PMR: Patient was initially started on hydrocortisone.
Later it was found that he did not take hydrocortisone at home, but prednisone.
Hydrocort was stopped and prednisone started at his home dose.
