Due to fact that R carotid stent was placed near the carotid body, there was concern that pt might have labile BP post-op and he was admitted to CCU for close monitoring and possible nitro or dobutamine drips.
He was continued on ASA/plavix as well as other home medications.
Pt also on oral iron and with no Hx of GI bleed, no bright red blood, and no past EGD so black stool most likely [**2-8**] to iron supplements.
