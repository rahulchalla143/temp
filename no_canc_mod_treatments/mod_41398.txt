[**2194-5-14**] LENI: Color and grayscale son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, left-sided superficial femoral, popliteal and calf veins were performed.
[**2194-5-6**] CXR: The previously noted right upper extremity approach PICC line has been removed in the interval.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old female with history of EtOH abuse, depression, anxiety, and prior Reux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery admitted with encephalopathy and jaundice found to have alcoholic hepatitis, whose course has been c/b UTI, encephalopathy, and EtOH withdrawal.

Then, prednisone was started on [**2194-5-8**].
All hepatically cleared medications were held during this time.
She was given pantoprazole, vitamin D, and calcium given high dose steroids.
Her sugars were monitorred on high dose steroids but she did not require any insulin administration, likely a result of impaired gluconeogenesis.
Prednisone was stopped on [**2194-5-15**] given new leukocytosis and fevers.
Pantoprazole and calcium were subsequently stopped.
Vitamin D therapy was continued given documented history of vitamin D deficiency.
She was given oxycodone for her pain.
# Urinary tract infection: Initially a source of infection was unclear, so the patient was started on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone, broadened to vanc/cefepime upon admission to the ICU.
Antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone when urine culture data/sensitivies became available.
She was continued ceftriaxone for a total 7 day course.
The patient was treated with antibiotics as above.
She was also given lactulose 30mL QID, titrated to to [**3-19**] bowel movements daily.
At the time of discharge, her mental status was back to her baseline with attention intact.
# Elevated lactate: Patient with initial lactate 9 --> 2.8 with aggressive volume resuscitation.
She was maintained Ativan 1-2mg IV q2 hours with CIWA >10.
She was given a banana bag overnight, then continued on IV thiamine and given PO folate/MVI.
The patient began to withdraw on [**5-8**] and was treated with IV lorazepam intially every one hour per CIWA >10.
Her CIWA scale was discontinued four days prior to discharge.
She was continued on oral thiamine, MVI, and folate.
# Fever and leukocytosis: The patient developed fever and leukocytosis after alcoholic hepatitis was improving.
Fever has resolved and leukocytosis is trending down now that steroids have been stopped.
She received 2 unit of PRBCs and bumped hct appropriately.
This also was used as colloid resuscitation which improved her BP.
# Depression/Anxiety: Stable, med rec was performed with pharmacy and the patient is not on antidepressants at home.
All sedating medications were held given hepatotoxicity or hepatic clearance including trazodone, zolpidem, and gabapentin.
