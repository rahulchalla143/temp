Attempts were made over 48 hours to increase her to a regular low fat diet however her symptoms recurred prompting insertion of a PICC line and beginning TPN.
She started anticoagulation with heparin for the thrombosis and plans were made for a distal pancreatectomy during this admission.
Ct confirmed bleeding into the pseudocyst therefore the heparin was discontinued.
Subsequently a left pigtail catheter was placed for drainage of the effusion and she had immediate relief of her symptoms.
Upon return to the Surgical floor she was placed on a liquid diet and seemed to tolerate it very well.
Nutritionally, she continued her TPN which was eventually cycled simply for her convenience during the daytime and she remained on a full liquid diet without any significant abdominal pain.
Her diet was increased to low fat on the day of discharge but she will continue her TPN and should she have any problems with this diet she should be scaled back to clear liquids.
She was taking Ultram on a routine basis for pain which was tolerated well.
