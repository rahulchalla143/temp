He was rate controlled and started on anticoagulation therapy.
He underwent a successful cardioversion in [**2171-7-5**] but reverted to atrial fibrillation within four days.
He found when he was in regular rhythm he had more energy, an increased exercise tolerance and a reduction in his dyspnea.
He was started on Propafenone and underwent another cardioversion but sinus rhythm was not successfully restored.
His afib ablation was successful until the end of the procedure when he went into vtach arrest.
Reportedly, he received an asynchronous emergency shock which put him into vfib which was refractory to 3 360J external shocks and required an internal defibrillation for restoration of sinus rhythm.
He was put on a neo and epi drip for BP support.
His neo, epi and dopamine was stopped and he was maintained in sinus rhythm with amio and lidocaine drip.
