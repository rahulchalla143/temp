Status post mediastinal debridement with omental flap to open sternal wound and primary closure for chronic sternal infection.
Status post percutaneous tracheostomy.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right carotid endarterectomy.
Sternal debridement and omental flap as described above.
REASON FOR ADMISSION/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2128-8-1**]).
This was complicated by a postoperative sternal infection requiring debridement and pectoralis muscle advancements.
He was discharged home following this surgery and did well until [**2129-5-2**] when he fell at home and had an opening of the sternal wound.
He was taken back to the operating room in [**2129-11-1**] where an incision and drainage and removal of the sternal wires was performed along with closure of the wound.
This ultimately reopened and required another debridement in [**2130-2-1**].
The patient now presents with two persistent sinus drainage tracks in the lower sternum.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with multiple risk factors for sternal breakdown, status post median sternotomy.
The patient had a chronic sternal infection that required radical debridement and omental flap for reconstruction.
The patient was brought into the hospital on [**2130-12-20**] and was taken to the operating room for a combined procedure between Thoracic Surgery and Plastic Surgery and underwent opening of his sternal wound and debridement of some of the remaining sternal bone with removal of all infectious tissue.
Thereafter, Plastic Surgery performed a omental flap closure of the defect.
The patient tolerated the procedure well after a fairly long and complicated procedure and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit postoperatively.
Prior discussions with the patient and his family confirmed the conclusion that if the patient did not tolerate a rapid extubation status post surgery that we would proceed to early tracheostomy as the patient had been on a ventilator for prolonged periods of time after previous surgeries.
It was felt that should the patient not tolerate early extubation he would likely also require a prolonged intubation, the decision was made to proceed to early tracheostomy to facilitate ventilator weaning and pulmonary toilet.
On postoperative day one, the patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and tolerated this well.
Despite this, the patient was able to be weaned off a mild amount of ventilator support and is currently on a pressure support of 10, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8, and an FIO2 of 60%.
He has required aggressive pulmonary toilet via suctioning through his tracheostomy.
Additionally, at one point the patient's failure in weaning was felt to due malpositioning of the tracheostomy tube which had come to rest against the posterior membranous wall of the trachea.
Therefore, he was taken to the Interventional Pulmonology Service where a new tracheostomy tube was placed which was then in a more appropriate position.
He is currently on vancomycin for this and will be completing another 1-week course of vancomycin post discharge.
At times he was in a rapid ventricular response which was controlled with both beta blockers, and at one point an amiodarone bolus plus drip, which seemed to control the rapid ventricular response.
The patient was also placed on a diltiazem drip which also controlled his rate.
Once the patient tolerated enteric feeding, the patient was converted to by mouth diltiazem and he is now at 120 mg by mouth four times per day.
He has required some intermittent diuresis with intravenous Lasix.
He has been tolerating enteric feedings at a goal calorie rate.
Today, he had a video swallow and the patient was cleared for puree solids, thin liquids, and to swallow pills and puree.
TUBES/LINES/DRAIN ISSUES:  The patient will be sent for a peripherally inserted central catheter placement for his remaining one week of vancomycin.
