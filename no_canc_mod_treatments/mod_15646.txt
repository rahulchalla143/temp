Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 916**] was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 32-year-old gravida 4, para 0 now 2 woman.
This pregnancy was complicated by in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization resulting in monochorionic/diamniotic twins and a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.
Pregnancy was also complicated with preterm labor with contractions despite magnesium sulfate, rupture of membrane the morning prior to delivery, and progressive labor.
He was given positive pressure ventilation and intubated.
The infant's NICU stay by systems:  Respiratory status: Throughout his NICU stay, multiple ventilation and oxygen strategies were employed using the conventional ventilation and high frequency ventilation with increasing requirements needed and ultimately requiring 100% oxygen for several hours prior to his death.
Cardiovascular status:  The infant required increasing pressor support after four boluses of normal saline.
He required a maximum of 25 mcg/kg/min of dopamine and 25 mcg/kg/min of dobutamine.
A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the left mid sternal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] indomethacin was begun to treat a presumed PDA.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition status:  He was maintained with an umbilical arterial and umbilical venous line with dextrose initially requiring several boluses of dextrose for hypoglycemia which was then resolved.
He did receive 10 cc/kg of packed red blood cells to assist with blood pressure support.
Infectious disease status:  Infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
He was treated with Fentanyl for pain and sedation.
He experienced a progressive and then acute decompensation in his cardiac and respiratory activity with immediate cardiac arrest despite ongoing maximal support.
