She received 6 mg of Ativan and Versed as well loaded on Dilantin intravenously.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Synthroid 0.1, Catapres transdermal patch 2 every week, Novolin NPH 24 units, Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Neurologically, intubated and sedated, positive tongue abrasion.
No obvious facial asymmetry which was difficult to tell with a tube in place.
Acute coronary artery syndrome was r/o with serial EKGs, creatine kinases and troponin.
MRA at the same time was read as motion artifact, severely aluminated the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], visualized internal carotid arteries were likely vertebrobasilar system patent; however, the patient after extubation had new left arm weakness which was not at her baseline.
When the stroke team reviewed her MRA they felt that she could possibly have basilar artery stenosis; and, therefore, she was started on a heparin drip.
No protein was sent.
She did require an insulin drip at one point until she started eating again.
She was transferred out from the NICU to the Neurologyfloor on [**2135-12-22**] and remained stable on a heparin drip.
She was bolused with Dilantin with subsequent repeat being 10.9, and her chronic dose was increased.
Because of her diabetes and risk factors for coronary artery disease, she was transfused 2 units with a repeat hematocrit of 34 on [**2135-12-25**].
She was started on Levaquin for a possible aspiration pneumonia and then found to have urinary tract infection, and thus the Levaquin was continued.
She was started on vancomycin and continued on the levofloxacin.
The sensitivities studies showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed for a prolonged course of vancomycin.
Vancomycin peak and trough was checked on [**2135-12-29**] which showed a peak of 22 and a trough of 10.9, which seemed adequate and continued on the vancomycin dose 500 mg q.24h.
Her heparin was discontinued after the second hematocrit drop, and Gastrointestinal was consulted.
The patient was then started on Plavix for stroke prophylaxis since she had an aspirin allergy.
