CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2200-3-6**] 2:23 PM  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: source of GI bleeding.Please administer PO and IV contrast.C Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with congenital heart dz, s/p VSD repair, GI bleeding.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: source of GI bleeding.Please administer PO and IV contrast.Concer for small bowel source, CT enterography please.
There are technical limitations to this study since it appears that the patient was not administered the VoLumen and this limits the accuracy of this study.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST AND WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: Again there is evidence of median sternotomy and four-chamber cardiac dilatation consistent with a history of conigential cardiac disease.
Within the limitations of the study there is no evidence of a gross mass within the bowel or for extravasation of intravenous contrast into the bowel lumen.
A ventral defect previously seen has resolved with residual soft tissue being demonstrated.
G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  [**2200-3-8**] 1:07 PM  G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  Reason: eval for correct placement of J-tube  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with J-tube that fell out today, was replaced at the bedside.
please eval for proper replacement, and that the tube is in correct position to resume tube feeds.
thanks REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for correct placement of J-tube EXAMINATION: Injection of J-tube.
Injection of a J-tube was performed without a radiologist present and shows contrast in several loops of non-distended small bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o M with PMH congenital heart disease s/p VSD repair, PVR and MVR, CHF, DM, afib on coumadin and mult.
# Anemia/black stools: Has had extensive workup this month without discovering active bleeding source, including EGD, small bowel enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy.
However, he had some respiratory distress requiring placement on the ventilator and the GI team at [**Hospital1 2177**] recommended deferring the procedure at this time.
failure: Trached during admission in [**Month (only) 404**] for heart surgery due to difficulty weaning.
Inhalers and nebulizers were continued.
He was transferred to the MICU twice for respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.
His first transfer was in the the setting of volume overload and mucous plugging which improved with treatment of the MRSA/stenotrophomonas in his sputum.
The second incident of respiratory failure was in the setting of getting high doses of IV ativan leading to likely respiratory depression.
He completed a 5 day course of Bactrim for Stenotrophomonas and completed a 7 day course of vanco.
# Acute renal failure: He was diuresed given volume overload affecting respiratory status.
Diuresis has been held and can be restarted when needed for volume overload and creatinine allows.
Good urine output currently, and as his creatinine remained at approximately 2, his lasix was restarted at 20mg po bid.
Given his large atrial size (>8 cm), anticoagulation with coumadin was restarted (INR will need to be monitored at rehab and coumadin adjusted prn).
Rate control was acheived with a beta blocker.
# Congenital heart disease: s/p recent surgery.
Continued on outpatient regimen of lipitor, metoprolol, ASA.
Held benzos given resp depression as above.
