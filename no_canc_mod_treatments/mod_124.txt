Patient appeared 'sleepy' afterwards but then seemed to return to his normal self between seizures.
Also found to be hypokalemic with K 2.6, started on IVF @10cc/hrKcl 40 mEq [**Hospital1 **] x 6 doses.
O2 sat 100% on non rebreather, weaned easily.
Given Ceftriaxone 2gm, Vanc 1gm, Ampicillin 2gm, Acyclovir 700mg.
200mg IV Diflucan for thrush.
Morphine for pain, received total of 12mg.
After arrival to the ICU, it was discovered that he had a urine culture positive for acinetobacter at rehab and was started on imipenem.
Previous hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 1100**]) for change in MS after being found down and minimally responsive; he was intubated for airway protection; course complicated by R neck hematoma [**1-8**] to line placement, alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypercacemia, improved ARF, elevated lactate, transaminitis.
Concern for toxic metabolic encephalopathy, improved somewhat with fluids but did not return to baseline.
When discharged he needed 6 more days to finish 14 day course of vancomycin, 10 more days to complete 15 day course of meropenem and needed to continue on flagyl for 14 days after all other ABX completed.
HIV/AIDS - last CD4 105, VL > 100,000 on [**11-13**], off HAART because of suicidality and depression, on dapsone ppx for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1095**] noncompliant.

NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Surgical clips projecting over the left supraclavicular area are again noted.
Right-sided PICC line is incompletely included on the present study.
The most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1071**] is thought to have HIV encephalopathy and this condition combined with imipenem may have lowered his seizure threshold.
Patient's amitriptyline was also considered as possible cause of patient's seizures.
Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT; however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or bacterial central nervous system infection.
Of note, patient has had no seizures since admission and stopping of imipenem and amitriptyline.
Per the neurology service, the patient should be on Keppra indefinitely.
Patient's mental status changes date back to [**11-13**] admission when patient left hospital AMA, never having gone back to baseline mental status s/p presumed fall.
Patient's CMV viral loads were low (2160) and treatment was deferred since there was no sign end-organ disease.
He was started on a three day course of IV gentamicin on [**1-26**].
Neck CT without contrast obtained (could not use contrast as could not obtain peripheral IV access necessary) but study was inconclusive due to patient positioning and lack of contrast.
According to OMR, the patient has not had relief of his neuropathy with gabapentin in the past.
However, after patient left ICU for floor, opiates were held because of worries of sedation affecting mental status.
His pain was treated with gabapentin and acetaminophen.
We did not restart his opiates during this hospitalization nor his Remeron.
As feeding via NG tube began, lytes were monitored [**Hospital1 **] in order to assess refeeding syndrome.
Please continue to monitor his electrolytes while he is on TPN at least daily replete his electrolytes as needed and change TPN based on electrolytes.
ID did not recommend HAART as HAART carries increased risk of toxicity in setting of poor nutrition, and patient is vulnerable to immune reconstitution syndrome with low CD4 count at start of HAART and patient has known Hepatitis C.  ID's recommendation was that HAART not be initiated until Mr. [**Known lastname 1101**] nutritional status improves and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] (outpatient ID doctor for patient) should make decisions about implementing HAART.
Patient received NG tube on [**2146-1-21**] after neck was imaged with CT.  NG tube feeds began at midnight on night of [**2146-1-21**] at 10 ml/hr.
However, tube came out and patient refused replacement.
Patient did ask for tube to be replaced on [**1-25**] but after primary medical team could not place tube, patient refused IR placement of NG tube.
Patient was begun on TPN on [**2146-1-27**].
The patient is having improved PO intake and TPN can be discontinued when patient is taking adequate oral intake.

While you were in the hospital we treated you with IV antibiotics for a question of an infection in your spinal column.
Because you were having trouble swallowing, we put a tube from your nose into your stomach and gave you nutrition through this tube.
This tube came out and you did not want it replaced.
