His symptoms improved initially on the first day, and he became more alert and was weaned of supplemental oxygen.
Due to concern for aspiration and his hypoxia 85% RA, he was transferred to the ICU where he received broad spectrum antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia (Meropenem, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin).
His somnolence was thought to be due to hoarding his medication with intentional overdose.
His antibiotics were discontinued.
It is recommended that he be observed taking his medications when in the hospital to prevent hoarding of medications.

We recommended him continue using his old ones.
