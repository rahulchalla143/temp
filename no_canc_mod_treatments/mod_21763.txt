Admission Date:  [**2183-5-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-6-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: NSTEMI, Hypercarbic respiratory distress, Hemoptysis, 3VD  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic cardiac catheterization and PEA arrest Intra aortic balloon pump Central venous catheter placement Arterial line placement Peripheral intravenous central catheter placement Endotracheal intubation and ventilation Operative tracheostomy Percutaneous gastrostomy Bronchoscopy and lavage Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Push enteroscopy Colonoscopy Nuclear medicine bleeding scan Angiographic embolization of colonic arteriovenous malformation   History of Present Illness: 74M with history of HTN, sarcoid and emphysema who presented to OSH with chest pain and "indigestion."
Onset of CP started on Saturday [**5-10**].
Reports two months of "indigestion" which responded to TUMS.
For intubation, received etomidate, sucs, and started on propofol for sedation.
Improvement of pressures with levophed, fluids, and off propofol.
CPR and epinephrine initiated and pressures returned with support of dopamine and norepinephrine.
Had bronchoscopy performed which showed no endobronchial lesions, bronchomalasia, and some bilateral hemoptysis L>R.
Baseline FEV1 590 cc at best.
The RCA was severely calcified throughout (though the presence of previously placed stents could not be excluded) with a 60% stenosis proximally, 50% stenosis in the mid vessel, and diffuse disease in the PDA and RPL up to 80%.
At one point, his pressure was noted to drop into the 80s systolic and he was removed from mechanical ventilation transiently with a large gush of expelled air and a prompt improvement in his blood pressure (suggestive of significant auto-PEEP).
A stat echocardiogram was performed and revealed depressed myocardial function, a thickened aortic valve, and a mean aortic valve gradient of 20 mm Hg.
Cardiac surgery was consulted emergently.
2 units of PRBCs were transfused.
Delayed blood pool images for 90 minutes obtained immediately after injection of tracer show no areas of abnormal tracer accumulation.

Cardiac surgery was consulted in the cath lab and at that point as pt was intubated, had just had PEA arrest and was hemoptysizing, they deferred.
Reconsulted cardiac surgery given stabilization a few days later but given high comorbidities it was decided that risk outweighed the benefit.
Pt was initially on heparin and Integrilin that was d/d/cd secondary to hemoptysis.
Plavix was d/cd on HD #11 as pt was GIB (see below) and trach was planned.
Additionally, pt was started on ACEi and BB a few days in to hospitalization, but these were d/cd when he was hypotensive again and GIB (See below).
Ultimately, as patient's blood pressure improved following resolution of multiple infections, patient was able begin medical managment of coronary artery disease with lisinopril and metoprolol as well as continuing atorvastatin and aspirin.
Clopidogrel (Plavix) was discontinued given GI bleed and no stent placed during catherization.
He was on Levophed and dopamine after catheterization and these were able to be weaned off successfully.
He was also on an IABP to help CO/CI which was successfully removed without complications a few days in to hospitalization.
On HD #11, pt had hypotension requiring re-starting Levophed to maintain MAPs, which were d/cd later that day.
Pt had a swan placed on admission to the CCU which was pulled after one week.
Indeed, patient was found to be adrenally insufficient, likely secondary to long-standing corticosteroid treatment for sarcoidosis and COPD, and required a brief high dose hydrocortisone pulse which immediately improved hypotension.
Following clinical stabilization, echocardiography was repeated, which, although a poor study given ventricular bigeminy, revealed an EF of 35% and mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation.
Further consideration of intracardiac defibrillator was to be decided following discharge and stabilization.
Following hemodynamic stabilization with resolution of infections, patient was uptitrated on metoprolol given unrevascularized CAD without issues.
Question of if pt met criteria for ARDS though could not exclude a cardiac cause of b/l pulmonary infiltrates completes and ARDSNET protocol ventilation was administered.
At the end of the first week of hospitalization, sedation was weaned successfully, and patient was initiated on daily pressure support trials.
On hospital day 18, tracheostomy was operatively placed by thoracic surgery (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) - however, required replacement next day when trach cuff was perforated following placement.
Following tracheostomy placment, patient was quickly weaned to minimal pressure support and initiated on daily trach collar trials and successfully fitted for Passey-Muir valve.
Of note, patient continued to require intermittent pressure support and/or assist control ventilation secondary to fatigue at the time of discharge.
He was double covered for gram (-) w/Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin but tapered to Levaquin  alone when sputum grew out H. flu.
Course was further complicated by development of MRSA ventilator associated pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin for a full two week course.
However, at the end of that course, patient again was febrile with a transient hypotensive episode, and patient was started on linezolid 600BID for an additional seven day course.
e. Hemoptysis- On admission following cardiac catheterization, patient had episode of hemoptysis while on integrillin and heparin.
Therefore, anticoagulation was discontinued given risk of bleeding, at which point hemoptysis resolved.
Initial upper endoscopy and tagged RBC study were negative on HD #11.
As patient continued to have frank melena intermittently, three additional nuclear medicine bleeding studies were performed, and patient underwent colonoscopy as well as push enteroscopy; the last bleeding study revealed a source in the hepatic flexure of the colon.
Nutrition: Following intubation, patient was intermittently given tube feeds and/or TPN for nutrition.
PEG was placed at bedside on the day prior to discharge, as patient failed speech and swallow evaluation two days prior discharge.
Psych- Continued on outpatient dose of paxil - no issues.
However, as this resolved following hemodynamic stabilization, ARF was felt to be due to ATN.
