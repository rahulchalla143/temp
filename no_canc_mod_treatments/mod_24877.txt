Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service:  Neurosurgery was consulted for his traumatic brain injuries; a [**Last Name (un) **] Bolt was placed to monitor his ICP which was high.
The decision was mad to take him to the operating room for right hemicraniectomy and evacuation of subdural hematoma.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained sedated and intubated.
He was fitted with a helmet for protection of his skull; this needs to be worn at all times when out of bed.
It was several days before his sedation was weaned and he was noted to follow some commands.
Seizure prophylaxis was initiated early on and would later be changed to Depakote which will need to continue until follow up as an outpatient.
The plan after discharge is for him to follow up with a repeat head CT scan and possible surgery to replace the portion of skull that is being preserved at [**Hospital1 18**].
He is currently awake, alert and oriented to self; ambulates independently with supervision for safety.
Epidural catheter placement He did require some packed red blood cells several days postoperatively.
The epidural catheter was removed after a couple of days and his pain is currently being managed with prn Percocet.
He was also evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is being recommended for brain injury rehab after his acute hospital stay.
