She was continued on her aspirin and Lipitor.
In the past, she has been unable to tolerate a beta blocker and an attempt was not made to start this medication.
She was intravascularly depleted but total body volume over loaded.
Our approach to this condition was to initially try to replete intravascular volume with normal saline but then try to remove some of the total fluid overload by giving intravenous Bumex.
Towards the end of this course, we decided to start the patient on a small dose of ace inhibitor, given the proven benefit of this medication in congestive heart failure.
The patient was continued on her Coumadin for the iliac stent.
The patient is believed to be in acute renal failure, as a result of aggressive diuresis and contracture alkalosis.
This was corrected by gentle hydration, followed by diuresis, in which we were able to replete intravascular volume while removing some of the total body fluid over load.
Once we had an improvement in her creatinine, from starting at 2.6 to about 1.9, we decided that she should be restarted on her Captopril as this medication is particularly beneficial for her congestive heart failure.
Pain is well controlled with Percocet and Neurontin.
