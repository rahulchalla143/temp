Enlarged prostate and sigmoid diverticulosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 yoM with h/o CAD presenting with hematemesis and syncope, found to have a bleeding esophageal ulcer which required cauterization.
1) Upper GI Bleed: Patient was admitted on aspirin and plavix, and per EGD found to have an ulcer that had a vessel which was cauterized.
His hematocrit was followed, and he was transfused red cells to maintain his a hematocrit above 28.
Per GI, he should have his ASA and plavix held for life, but with his history of CAD restarting ASA 81mg can be considered at 1 week post discharge, and restarting plavix not only for status post CABG but for carotid stenosis, can be decided by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Hematocrit should be rechecked soon after discharge.
He had no symptoms during his course and was continued on atorvastatin, and labetolol.
As above, because of his risk for bleed, his aspirin and Plavix, were held.
Risk/benefit needs to be considered with restarting anti-platelet therapy.
4) Hypertension: As the patient presented with a GI bleed, his anti-hypertensives were initially held.
Once he was hemodynamically stable, his labetolol was titrated up to pre-admission doses.
His felodipine and lasix were held, as he was normotensive, and restarting these should be done as an outpatient.
