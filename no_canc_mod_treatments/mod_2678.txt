Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rectro-vag fistula who presented to the ER with likely GI bleeding of diverticular source admitted to the MICU for GI bleed, hypotension and respiratory failure.
Gyn, GI and Surgery were consulted in the ER and followed while in the MICU.
GI did not pursue colonoscopy at this time given patient's tenuous status.
Patient had no further bleeding after first night of admission and hematocrit was stable, but was critically ill throughout her stay so no surgical intervention or workup of the fistula was pursued.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: In the ER she received 1.7L of fluid for hypotension and shortly thereafter the patient developed acute pulmonary edema and tachypnea.
Thoughts for her hypoxic respiratory failure included infection, hypervolemia, CHF exacerbation.
Less likely TRALI or ARDS following blood transfusion since per ED report pt had received fluids prior to intubation.
She remained intubated and sedated until she was terminally extubated at the decision of her family given her critical illness and lack of improvement.
The patient was started on Micafungin.
Transplant surgery did not think the graft looked infected either.
The patient was given Vanc/Cefepime/flagyl for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, then started on micafungin when [**Female First Name (un) **] grew in the bloodstream.
OB/GYN and ID felt candidemia [**Known firstname **] be secondary to source from fistula, and blood cultures cleared after she was started on micafungin.
However, patient remained on double pressors and CVVH during MICU stay.
Stress dose steroids were also tried one day prior to death.
# CRF: Given hypotension, Pt did not undergo her usual Tues/Thurs/Sat HD and instead underwent CVVH for K,H+ clearance.
Her medications were renally dosed.
