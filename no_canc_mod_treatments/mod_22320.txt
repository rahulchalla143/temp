Endotracheal tube is within standard position.
Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach; however, the side port is just above the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced.
Sideport of the orogastric tube is within in the distal esophagus, and the tube should be advance for optimal placement.
Throughout this record essentially no electrical activity of cerebral origin was identified.
Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, and nasogastric tube has been advanced more distally in the stomach compared to the prior study.
Worsening diffuse airspace opacities throughout the right lung, particularly in the right middle and right lower lobes with near-complete obscuration of right heart border and right hemidiaphragm.
Diffuse extensive abnormal signal involving the bilateral sulci, basal ganglia and thalami with thickening of the sulci and crowding of the posterior fossa, likely representing diffuse brain swelling and suggestive of brain death.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Patient is a 66 yo male with past medical history of HIV on HAART,  CD4 584, VL 93 (2 weeks ago), PML, hx PCP pneumonia, syphilis (treated), crystal meth and tobaccoabuse, and B12 deficiency and also recent stroke, who presents found on floor at home soaked in urine and found to have multifocal PNA and positive amphetamine screen.
He was admitted to MICU having been intubated for airway protection and necessary medical studies given he was extremely agitated in the ED.
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime.
CSF infection was considered and he was covered with ampicillin in addition to the above-mentioned antibiotics.
Patient also had positive amphetamines on Utox with a history of methamphetamine abuse, and his altered mental status could be related to recent drug use, supported by the marked agitation seen in the ED.
Patient was intubated and sedated in the ED for airway protection and necessary imaging studies mentioned above and transferred to the MICU.
He was started on pressors with recovery of blood pressure within 10 minutes.
Based on these findings and monitoring showing no improvement, he was diagnosed with brain death.
Patient's pressors were stopped and the ETT was removed, after which he progressed to PEA arrest and then asystole.
Pneumonia - Patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection and facilitation of necessary medical studies in the setting of severe agitation in the ED.
He was started on vanc/levo for PNA and bactrim IV and dexamethasone in ED for concern of PCP given history in the past.
CXR was not consistent with PCP so steroids and bactrim were stopped.
S. Pneumo was cultured from the blood and he was continued on antibiotics.
Cr down-trending at time of death.
5.HTN - Held home metoprolol for hypotension.
