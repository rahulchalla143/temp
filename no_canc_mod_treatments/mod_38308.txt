Ground-glass opacities are demonstrated within the lung apices, which may simply represent atelectasis.
Ground-glass opacities at the lung apices may be secondary to hypoinflation; however, further evaluation with chest radiography is recommended.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # HYPOXEMIA: This developed in the ED in the setting of oversedation from medications administered for combative behavior and alcohol intoxication.
He arrived to the ICU heavily sedated following treatment with total dose of 10 mg Haldol and 4 mg Ativan in the ED.
There was initial concern for possible aspiration as a cause of the hypoxemia (O2 sats as low as mid-80s noted in ED).
# ETHANOL INTOXICATION/SEDATION: With the exception of blood alcohol level of 352 two hours after arrival to ED, remainder of urine and serum tox screens were negative.
He had no clinical evidence of C-spine injury and given the negative findings on CT (albeit in the setting of study limited by motion artifact), cervical collar was removed prior to discharge.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  # DEPRESSION: The patient reported taking citalopram for depression at home; however, his dose was unknown.
He was instructed to continue taking this medication as prescribed at discharge.
He did not feel that this episode of intoxication was related to his mood or worsening depression.
