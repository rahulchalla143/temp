Admission Date:  [**2124-11-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-12-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-10-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of aortic valve replacement for infected endocarditis on [**2124-2-4**], thought to be secondary to lower extremity osteomyelitis, likely Streptococcus organism.
The patient also has diabetes whose course is complicated by end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and has been followed by the Renal Service here at [**Hospital6 256**] since [**2124-11-22**], getting dialysis Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Renal notes have noted a I/VI systolic murmur and clear lungs over the hospital course, however, bibasilar crackles have developed and a systolic murmur was noted to have increase on [**11-28**] and a S3 was heard as well on that date.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for aortic valve replacement mentioned [**2124-2-2**], diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications on transfer from the Podiatry Service to the GCU Service included Metoclopramide, Synthroid 25 mcg q.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Nephrocaps, sliding scale insulin, Levaquin 250 q.o.d., Flagyl 50 q.d.
and Protonix and Aspirin.
Chem-7 on [**12-1**], sodium 134, potassium 5.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 24, BUN 58, creatinine .5, glucose 91, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 4.5, calcium 8 all predialysis, but will repeat.
The patient is a 60 year old male with osteomyelitis, status post debridement and left transmetatarsal amputation who has a history of endocarditis, chronic aortic valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve on [**2124-2-2**], also he has diabetes complicated by hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, now has a perivalvular leak, presence of abscess on a transesophageal echocardiogram, left with the assumption that this is endocarditis likely coming from the foot wound in terms of possible source that has lead to the vascular infection.
Adding ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction as blood pressure tolerates.
Check Vancomycin level and dose the patient's Vancomycin bilevel for a level of 15 and give the patient a dose of Gentamicin 80 intravenously times one.
Check daily electrocardiograms, following Prolene suture.
Continue Aspirin and Lipitor.
Cardiothoracic Surgery is following our patient and is going to follow him closely regarding the timing of surgery.
Ideally we are trying to have the patient transfer back to [**Hospital1 2177**] for evaluation and treatment by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] who performed the initial aortic valve replacement.
We are ultimately going to continue Levo and Flagyl for broad coverage, however, at the current time it is obvious that that is the source, most concerning is for Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
At this point, the patient is hemodynamically stable, not requiring any pressure support.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin 1 gm dosed intravenously for a level less than 15, Gentamicin 80 mg intravenously, getting first dose on [**2124-12-1**], to be dosed after hemodialysis for three to five days depending on blood cultures.
Continue on Levaquin and Metronidazole for broad coverage until positive.
