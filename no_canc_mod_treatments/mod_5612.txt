Echocardiogram in [**2128-11-14**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinetic anterior wall and kinetic anteroseptal wall, hypokinetic anterior apex, akinetic septal apex, and lateral apex and akinetic apex, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital for a GI bleed, where aspirin and Plavix were discontinued upon the outside hospital.
The patient took nitroglycerin x3 with no relief and called EMS.
Morphine, Heparin drip, and nitroglycerin drip were started.
Coronary artery disease in [**2129-11-14**], received brachytherapy through a restented left anterior descending artery, instent restenosis in [**2128-4-14**], stented left anterior descending artery.

Prevacid 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
On coronary artery catheterization, she had a 60% right coronary artery proximal lesion, 60% right coronary artery distal lesion, right posterolateral 100% stenosis, left anterior descending artery 100% occlusion proximal to previous stent, LCX without significant lesion.
She received successful cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending artery.
In the post myocardial infarction period, she did have a period of tachycardia to 160s, which was found to be VT.  For this she was bolused with lidocaine and put on a lidocaine drip.
The patient was talked to extensively and declined EP study, and pacemaker, and AICD placement at this time.
To lower the risk of recurrent VT, she was placed on amiodarone 400 mg po q day, and additionally, she was sent home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor for which strips will be examined over the next two weeks by EP.
She has an outpatient with this EP in approximately four weeks from discharge for followup and further discussion of risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiac arrhythmias.
The lidocaine drip was weaned off for 72+ hours prior to discharge, she was off lidocaine and had no further arrhythmic events.
She was kept on proton-pump inhibitor, and stool softeners.
Heme:  The patient did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a decreased hematocrit, which was most likely secondary to the prior gastrointestinal bleed.
