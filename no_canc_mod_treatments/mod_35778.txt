In the MICU the patient was given 3L of fluid with improvement in his blood pressures.
Thereafter, the patient had stable blood pressures, however he has required fluid bolusing to maintain urine output due to periods of decreased PO intake and overdiuresis.
The patient continued to require oxygen through out his stay, and had at times a recurrent L pleural effusion (see below).
His rate was difficult to control during his hypotension and volume depletion--digitalization was attempted but unsuccessful.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] was continued on coumadin and his INR was therapeutic at the time of discharge, but should be followed closely while he is on levofloxacin.
As the patient's urosepsis resolved and his blood pressure improved, gentle diuresis was initiated.
Brisk diuresis was avoided due to fear of volume contraction resulting in metabolic alkalosis, as earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course he became somnolent with an elevated pCO2 in response to brisk diuresis.
Consideration was given to thoracentesis as this effusion was not noted on previous CXR, however the attending felt that this was most likely due to CHF.
After the patient was transferred to the ICU service, an attempt to access the fluid with ultrasound guided thoracentesis was undertaken.
The pulmonary service saw this patient and felt that the etiology of the effusion was most likely post-operative, and that given his lack of temp or of elevated WBC count, he did not require definative drainage of the loculations via VATS.
This resolved with hydration and resolution of volume contraction.
The hope is that Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] can be transferred to a facility that will allow him to use nasal pillow CPAP as he has not been able to tolerate the  nasal mask or the face mask.
7)Urinary tract infection: Pt urine culture grew two strains of pan-sensitive klebsiella.
He was treated with Levofloxacin and finished a 14d course on [**5-10**].
According to the patient, his urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] told him that "a proceedure" would be necessary to ensure that he could urinate on his own when the foley was removed.
This resolved after irrigation and placement of a 20Fr 3way foley.
9)Anemia:Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] was found to be both iron deficient and B12 deficient.
He was thus started on iron and B12 replacement.
His stool was guaiac negative and his hematocrit was stable, thus colonoscopy was deferred to the outpatient setting.
This resolved with aggressive fluid to counteract his metabolic alkalosis.
In the setting of his C.diff diarrhea, he again began to have problems with lethargy and fatigue, diamox was stopped due this issue.
10)C.Diff:Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] developed diarrhea on levofloxacin which was positive for C.Diff.
He was started on a 7d course of Flagyl on [**5-11**].
