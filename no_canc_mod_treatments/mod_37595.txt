He checked her oxygen saturation and found her to be 92-93% on 2L NC, but over the next few hours continued to be somnolent and with progressively worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on 2L NC and still less than 90% on 4L NC, so she was brought in to the ED.
She was placed on NRB with improvement to 100%.
Right IJ CVL was placed due to difficulty gaining access, and blood Cx were sent.

Hypotension: The patient was admitted with relative hypotension compared to home blood pressures.
A right IJ CVL was placed in the ED and the patient's pressures did not respond sufficiently to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
On admission to the MICU unit, a Levophed drip was started, more NS was administered and her MAP and CVP responded.
This occurred after delivering 20 mg of Lasix the day prior for severe shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema.
was stabilized with fluid boluses and O2 nonrebreather.
At this time, her medication list was re-evaluated as it contained multiple centrally acting sedating medications (medication addendum listed below).
Fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, and increased sputum production supportive as well of a pneumonia.
Broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and zosyn, were initiated to treat hospital acquired pneumona.
On [**2148-7-28**], after persistent hypotension despite treatment, ciprofloxacin was briefly initiated to provide double coverage for pseudomonas.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued on the same day after infectious disease consult advised low probablity of success with cipro after zosyn resistance identified.
On [**2148-7-29**], Zosyn was discontinued as cultures were vancomycin sensitive.
Chest physical therapy was performed throughout her stay and the patient required oxygen supplementation (4 liter nasal canula)at the time of transfer from the MICU.
The patient was given 10mg IV lasix on [**7-30**] and [**2148-7-31**] to diurese the patient after CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.
had crackles on exam, and she was given 20 mg of Lasix to relieve her pulmonary edema.
After her medication adjustments, the pt's O2 demands slowly improved until discharge where she was doing well breathing room air.
Altered mental status:  Patient initially presented with altered mental status thought to be likely toxic-metabolic given infection, hypoxia and hypotension.
Adjustments were made to her medication list, and the pt's mental status improved to a consistently interactive state.
