Admission Date:  [**2155-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-2-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceclor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: Pleural effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 34521**] is a 85 yo F with history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, CAD and PAF with recent PPM placement s/p lead revision who presents with fevers, SOB, and pleuritic chest pain.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 427**] for pericardial effusions and was found to have small RV perforation during initial PPM placement.
Patient was initially off of warfarin given concern for hemorrhagic conversion of pericardial effusion but was restarted on warfarin prior to discharge.
At discharge, patient continued to complain of SOB and pleuritic chest pain but these were felt to be related to being in Afib given the presence of her debilitation and pleural effusions/atelectasis.
Of note, she has also been having CP on inspiration but this has been going on since her procedure.
She received 1L of NS and was given vancomycin and zosyn.

We found her to be fluid over loaded on arrival to the floor, and noted that [**2155-8-1**] ECHO showed EF in 30% felt to be due to pacer-induced mechanical dysynchrony of pacing, and began diuresis with IV lasix.
Her fluid overload symptoms resolved prior to hospital discharge, and she was started on a low dose ACE-inhibitor as indicated per her EF.
Initially a Diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis was deferred because of her elevated INR =3.7 on admission, and she was treated for possible pneumonia.
Coumadin therapy was held and her INR dropped down to a safe level for thoracentesis.
The procedure was performed and 1250ml of fluid was drained.
This would be inconsistent with parapneumonic effusion, but could be consistent with her prior ventricular disruption from prior pacer wire procedure.
The pig-tail catheter was removed and oxygen was quickly weaned.
A MRSA as well as a legionella screen were also negative as well.
On arrival to the floor she was on Vancomycin and Zosyn for antibiotic coverage and her symptoms of cough and fever subsided.
Antibiotic coverage was continued until a thoracentesis was performed and then discontinued after >1L of fluid was drained.
Since that time her breathing has improved, was weaned off supplement O2, and the antibiotic coverage was discontinued.
Coumadin was held and amiodarone was continued.
Metoprolol was restarted at 25mg TID which kept her rate controlled.
After completion of thoracentesis Coumadin was restarted at 3mg.
