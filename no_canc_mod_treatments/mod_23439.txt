Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid, nectar thickened liquid, puree and a half cookie coated with barium were administered.
There were several episodes of silent aspiration before and after the swallow with thin liquids.
For greater detail and for treatment recommendations, please see the dedicated speech and language pathology division report of the same date.
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right internal jugular central venous catheter remain in standard positions.
intubated due to hypoxia tacypnea.
Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung is probably combination of aspiration and hemorrhage due to contusion or laceration.
There is an unusually shaped lucency projecting over the right superolateral iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and obscuring a portion of the cortex.
Patient is intubated, and nasogastric tube is seen within the esophagus limiting assessment of the prevertebral soft tissues.
Lung windows demonstrate a right-sided chest tube with multiple bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left, likely pulmonary contusions.
The patient is intubated, and an NG tube is in place.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed following administration of 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach fundus.
A chest tube has been inserted from the right lateral mid thorax and terminates in the right lung apex.
A second smaller chest tube inserts laterally in the right apex.
A 7-mm hypodensity within the splenic body is of uncertain clinical significance.
A small amount of fluid (approx 20-25 [**Doctor Last Name **] density), of uncertain origin, is seen tracking along the right pericolic gutter and anterior to the right psoas muscle.
CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A catheter is present within the bladder.
Additionally, there are multiple nondisplaced fractures involving right thoracic vertebral transverse processes, including T2, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Small amount of right pericolic fluid (20-25 [**Doctor Last Name **]) of uncertain origin.
At OSH, on HD#2 pt intubated was intubated for hypoxia due to blood clot and secretions in R mainstem bronchus w/ collapse of R lung.
A R chest tube was left in place until [**2126-6-22**].
He remained intubated until [**6-27**] due to failure to wean, ventilator associated pneumonia, and associated high PEEPs.
On [**2126-6-27**], a percutaneous trach was attempted, but dilators could not be passed; the tracheostomy was converted to open procedure and continued uneventfully.
On the floor, patient was evaluated and treated by Physical Therapy and his gait and coordination improved rapidly.
Speech therapy also evaluated the patient on  multiple occasions and his ability to tolerate POs progressed well.
PO meds may be given whole, but only with purees.
Basic aspiration precautions, including:  a.
Speech therapy concurred that this consult should not be a barrier to discharge but that followup would be helpful regarding vocal cords movement reduction noted on video swallow.
With regard to the patient's orthopedic injuries, pt went to OR [**2126-6-14**] (HD#2) for wash out and debridement of right open iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture, as well as closed treatment right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture and closed treatment right clavicle fracture.
Pt was discharged on [**2126-7-4**] speaking well, tolerating POs, trach in place with PMV or capped, ambulating on his own, and with pain well-controlled.
He will followup with trauma surgery, orthopedic surgery, and ENT surgery clinics.
