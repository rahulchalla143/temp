Her hospital course had been complicated by atrial fibrillation in RVR with rates to the 130s that has responded well to PO metoprolol 100mg q6hr.
Of note, she has a history of apical-form hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has outflow physiology at elevated rates- she had HF symptoms with this recent RVR that responded to beta blockade.
She tolerated extubation initially but then became agitated with ABG demonstrating 7.2/77/87 on room air.
She was placed on BiPAP with improvement of her gas to 7.37/54/122.
Her pain did not respond to fentanyl, but was controlled with dilaudid PO 6mg.

Her hypercarbia may be narcotic-induced hypoventilation from the preceding surgery, however this should not cause significant AA gradient unless the hypoventilation was profound.
From a respiratory standpoint she continued to require oxygen alternating between nasal cannula and oxygen face mask.
[**3-25**] she was noted to have a new infiltrate on CXR likely to due aspiration and subsequently had increasing 02 requirement, antibiotics started.
# LEFT FEMORAL FRACTURE S/P OPERATIVE FIXATION: Surgery went without incident, but patient required BIPAP post extubation and was transfered to the intensive care unit.
Pain controlled with IV hydromorphone.
Attempts at pain control, anxiety control and rate control including esmolol gtt were mostly unsuccessful, though she did seem to improve slightly with IV metoprolol Q4H.
Has received both haldol and seroquel.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: S/P LAD PCI in past.
Unable to continue home cardiac meds due to NPO status.
Likely 2/2 blood loss due to fracture and correction of hemoconcentration.
