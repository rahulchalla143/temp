Admission Date:  [**2170-8-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-10-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-6-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  SURGERY BLUE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 67 year old female who presented to an outside hospital with abdominal pain, distention, nausea, for approximately three days.
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital and ultimately underwent an exploratory laparotomy and repair of hernia and was being taken care of at the outside hospital.
Therefore, it was decided at the outside hospital that she would be transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
Exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions times two for small bowel obstruction.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Iodine.
She also had a PICC line which was placed at the outside hospital and was having wet to dry dressing changes to her abdominal wound.
A G-J tube had been placed during her operation at the outside hospital and those were kept on intermittent suction.
She also had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain which was also to bulb suction.
She was saturating 98% on two liters nasal cannula.
Her abdomen was obese, nontender, and she had an open enterocutaneous fistula times three and open surgical wound on her belly with retention sutures in place and Foley catheter was also in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue Surgery service and was continued on TPN for preoperative nutritional enhancement and it was planned the patient would ultimately undergo exploratory laparotomy and repair of the enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient did well from the operation, however, postoperatively she developed single enterocutaneous fistula which caused wound breakdown and again she was started on tube feeding as well as TPN for nutritional enhancement.
Therefore, it was decided that the patient would have to return to the operating room on [**2170-9-13**], for a reexploration and component separation and flap closure, split thickness skin graft closure for this enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2170-9-13**], where closure of her enterocutaneous fistula was done and split thickness skin graft was also performed as well as a revision of her G-J tube.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure support and prolonged ventilatory support.
The patient was slowly weaned from the ventilator postoperatively, however, after extubation, she had significant respiratory distress and required significant fluid management.
Again, she required prolonged pressor support for her blood pressure and fluid management.
She was started on TPN and she was successfully able to be weaned from the ventilator postoperatively.
Therefore, she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
She was continued on multiple antibiotics and ultimately completed a twenty-two day course of Zosyn for the positive blood cultures and for her line sepsis.
Her tube feeds were slowly advanced through this time frame which she was able to tolerate.
She responded to Epinephrine and returned to sinus rhythm with her blood pressure returning to greater than 200.
Her gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity due to the distention and nasogastric tube which had been placed was removed.
She slowly improved from her ventilatory standpoint and she was continued on TPN for support for this.
A vac was placed over her wound site for her erythema and she was diuresed for her pulmonary status as well as for her fluid overload.
The vac was managed by the plastic surgery service and was changed multiple times with assessment of her skin graft on every change.
Just prior to discharge to rehabilitation, her vac dressing was removed and two small areas of questionable success and viability of the graft were noted.
It was decided that Xeroform gauze dressing changes would be used over the skin graft site for continued wound care.
She was restarted no her tube feeds on [**2170-9-26**], after being held and which she tolerated.
Her tube feeds were slowly increased over the next couple days.
The patient continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Zaroxolyn, Fluconazole and as stated before Zosyn.
She was able to be weaned over a very long period down to a pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 5 and it is planned that the patient would be extubated after being successfully diuresed.
After significant diuresis, the patient was able to tolerate extubation as well as able to tolerate low pressure support and minimal vent settings.
The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on [**2170-10-5**], which she tolerated.
Physical therapy as well as occupational therapy were consulted for ambulation as well as strength training as well as to manage all her deconditioning.
Her white blood cell count rose after being off antibiotics and it was felt the patient had a line infection and therefore, she was started on Zosyn.
The patient also underwent calorie counts which she did well with.
On [**2170-10-10**], plastic surgery took her back to the operating room for a repeat split thickness skin graft which she successfully underwent.
Her tube feeds were began to be cycled at that time and the patient was transferred out to the floor.
She continued to do well and continued to do well from a dietary standpoint on regular diet and her tube feeds which were cycled were able to be stopped completely prior to discharge.
She also completed as stated before a twenty-two day course of Zosyn for infected line as well as for bacteremia.
It was planned also that the patient would keep her Foley catheter for the time being and when the patient was more ambulatory and more functional, it could be removed in the rehabilitation facility.
The patient was also planned to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in three weeks time for evaluation as well as wound care check.
She is also to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the plastic surgery service for her skin graft and also for her abdominal closure.
Enterocutaneous fistula, status post repair times two including a component separation and split thickness skin grafting by plastic surgery service.
Small bowel obstruction, status post exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions times two.
Gastric bypass in the past.
Status post respiratory failure requiring emergent reintubation.
