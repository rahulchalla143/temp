He was also started on zoloft for depression.
He was started on a bicarbonate infusion [**3-15**] secondary to persistently low HC03 levels and given PO bicarb tabs.

A temporary R IJ dialysis catheter was inserted and he was started on hemodialysis with slow improvement in his BUN/Cr.
He was restarted on Impact Tube feeds 3/4 strength to goal of 80cc/hr and his nephramine was stopped.
He was continued on dialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri per nephrology.
He was continued on pressure support with slow wean of pressure support attempted with continued failure due to hypercarbia.

He tolerated the procedure well and post procedure chest xray was improved.
He was continued on hemodialysis and the vent was slowly weaned.
His nephramine was stopped on [**4-9**] secondary to increasing left effusion and concern for high fluid intake involvement in its reaccumulation.
He tolerated the procedure well.
At the time of discharge, his vent settings were PS 5 peep 5, he will continue on meropenem (last day [**4-15**]), continue on tube feed impact with fiber [**2-16**] strenght at 80ml/hr and hemodialysis per nephrology.
This should be followed with films while in rehab.
