The patient recently had pain medications increased and responded well to narcan, which made opioid overdose most likely.
Initially, patient's long-acting oxycontin was held as well as oyxcodone and dilaudid.
He was given a lidocaine patch and standing tylenol for pain.
Palliative care consult was obtained for assistance in pain control and dispo planning.
It appears that the patient has been followed at the VA for wound care and prior surgical evaluation previously.
Wound care recommended treatment as detailed in the page 1 wound care recommendations.
Pt should continue to follow up with his care at the VA after discharge for wound care and consideration of surgical intervention if any indicated or pt is a candidate.
Neurology recommended dilantin load of 1gm on [**4-29**] and another on [**4-30**], then increased dosing to dilantin 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pt was initally placed on linezolid and ceftriaxone pending culture.
Foley was changed and antibiotics were stopped.
No known renal dysfunction for explanation of troponin elevation.
Patient was continued on home doses of metoprolol, lisinopril and aspirin.
Troponin trended down and pt never had cardiac symptoms.
Sacral decubitus ulcer with associated pain -Initially home regimen was discontinued due to somnolence.
Pt was placed on standing tylenol, lidocaine patch.
Discussed risk/benefits of opioid pain medication with patient and his daugther.
Pt and HCP reported that pain control and wound care were of prime importance.
Oxycodone was restarted initially at 5mg Q6prn, then uptitrated to 5-10mg q6hprn dressing changes.
IV dilaudid 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was given prn dressing changes.
Therefore, final regimen at this time is 5mg oxycodone q4-6hrs prn pain with 5mg [**Hospital1 **] prn 1hr prior to dressing changes.
In addition, pt should continue tylenol and lidocaine patch, and ibuprofen 200mg maximum daily for pain.
Consider compound morphine into an intra-site gel for application to his ulcers.
It can be used as a mixture of 10 mg of morphine sulfate injection (10 mg/ml) in 8 gm of Intrasite gel.
Pt should discuss need for sleep study with his PCP/neurologist.
24hr EEG did not show seizure activity.
Did discuss, with pt and HCP/dtr delicate balance of using opioid therapy given the above as well as achieving good pain control.
However, would have to discuss goals of care further if pain control still becomes an issue, to discuss initiation of hospice care as increasing further doses, may lead to apnea and further somnolence.
His bb dose was decreased to 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] .
#hypoglycemia-  patient's metformin dose was held, and patient was provided NPH per his home dose, as well as Humalog insulin sliding scale coverage.
He can resume metformin upon discharge.
NPH was held at discharge, and can be restarted depending on clinical course and blood sugars.
She would be okay with him being intubated if medically necessary.
Palliative care and hospice was discussed for symptom management and she was initially interested in having her father at home with hospice services in place upon discharge.
Key current issues: Wound care as above Dilantin level in 10 days.
Palliative care and pain control management.
