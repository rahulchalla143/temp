Of note, he was recently admitted for an inferior wall STEMI with peak CK-MB of 41 and troponin of 1.03.
He underwent urgent cardiac cath for revascularization with occluded SVG-RCA.
Repeat angiography of SVG-LAD revealed 95 % stenosis of its ostium and underwent PTCA and one drug-eluting stent.
He was subsequently discharged with plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril.
He was placed on low-dose beta blockade but experienced bradycardia.
He had ASA 325 X1, 4mg Morphine IV x1 which helped.
He also received Amiodarone bolus of 150 mg over 15 mins x2.
Then Amiodarone gtt started at 1mg/hr.

-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: s/p DES to SVG-RCA and SVG-LAD ([**2148**]).
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - CAD s/p MI, CABG, PCI as above.
- AAA s/p repair - Chronic systolic CHF (EF 25-30%) - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.6-2.2) - s/p L carotid endarterectomy [**2143**] - s/p cholecystectomy - GERD - hearing loss - Nephrolithiasis - Mesenteric ischemia (celiac artery stenosis, occluded [**Female First Name (un) 899**]) - Dizziness - Chronic pleural effusion s/p talc pleuridesis  Social History: Lives alone, but sons lives within [**Street Address(2) 46372**] and involved in care.
PERTINENT STUDIES # Portable CXR [**8-17**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG.
# Portable CXR [**8-21**] INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with tachybrady syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker implant using the axillary vein.
A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle appropriately.
Compared with radiograph on [**8-21**] and after accounting for difference in positioning and technique, there is mild worsening of the right lower lobe opacity with obscuring of the right hemidiaphragm.
Sternotomy wires are intact.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD s/p CABG and multiple stents, CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation p/w substernal chest pain, A-fib w/ RVR, but later developed sinus bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement.
# A-fib with RVR Patient presented with A-fib with RVR in the setting of recent STEMI s/p restenting of SVG-LAD.
A decision of chemical conversion was made after first seen in the ED, given his intolerance to b-blocker and good response to amioderone for SVT during prior admission.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - Increased amiodarone to 200 mg daily - Started metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily .
# CAD: Patient had recent STEMI s/p stent placement in SVG-LAD.
Heparin drip was provided initially given the unclear ACS picture on presentation, but stopped shortly afterwards.
His home medications were continued, including aspirin, plavix, pravastatin and isosorbid mononitrate.
We temporarily discontinued lisinopril because of patient's low blood pressure.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - Changed to pravastatin from atorvastatin for insurance purposes.
Patient was discharged on only his morning dose of furosemide considering the lack of need for diuresis during this admission.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - Changed to furosemide 80 mg qAM only (from 80 mg qAM and 40 mg qPM).
Please optimize diuresis as needed.
This unfortunate incident could have potentially happened in the setting of anti-platelet treatment for his cardiac problems.
We temporarily discontinued his lisinopril, isosorbid mononitrate and furosemide, and restarted him on isosorbid mononitrate, decreased dose of furosemide, but no lisinopril.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - please consider restarting lisinopril given patient's history of CAD and CHF.
We continued his home medicine Ranitidine 150 mg daily.
