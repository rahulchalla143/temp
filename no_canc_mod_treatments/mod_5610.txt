Basal and apical pleural tube are unchanged in their respective positions.
Tip of the new Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries.
ET tube in standard placement, transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in standard placements as well.
Prominent fluid-containing structure with internal debris in the left upper quadrant may represent gastric contents versus pleural effusion with heterogeneous internal debris, incompletely evaluated.
New loculated hydropneumothoraces are likely related to pleural catheter placement.
Septal thickening, probably reflecting hydrostatic edema, but attention to this area on followup CT may be helpful to exclude lymphangitic carcinomatosis   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 34440**] was a very pleasant 54 year-old female who unfortunately was readmitted for recurrent right pleural effusion following a right VATS decortication, mechanical/doxycycline pleurodesis .
Her coumadin was held on admission.
On [**6-20**]/009 she underwent placement of a pigtail catheter and talc pleurodesis by IR.
It quickly became evident that the pigtail placed was too small in diameter for adequate drainage of this multiloculated effusion and that she would need a repeat R VATS decortication with placement of a pleurx catheter.
However, on closer inspection of her rhythm strip and in consultation with cardiology, it was determined that she actually had afib RVR with aberrancy.
She was immediately transferred to the unit and given IV lopressor.
She remained in the unit until [**2115-6-24**] when she underwent a repeat R VATS decortication with placement of a pleurx catheter.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the SICU extubated.
She was given an amiodarone loading dose and then drip.
She was also given 2 500 NS boluses for soft pressures.
Repeat K 2 hours following treatment was 4.9.
She did not have abdominal pain or surgical abdomen and her chest tubes were adequately draining sersang fluid.
Cardiology recommended stating a dilt drip and another amio load followed by drip for her continued intermittent afib with AVR.
On the evening of [**6-25**] patient was emergently intubated for worsening ABGs.
A swanz catheter was inserted.
She was given CPR with approximately 6 rounds of epi/atropine.
Multiple rds of CaCl and bicarb were given.
