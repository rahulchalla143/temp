MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications on admission included Diovan, atenolol, Glucophage, Glucotrol, aspirin, Lasix, Flonase, iron sulfate and Claritin.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to Tylenol #3.
PLAN:  The plan was to perform coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement, which was scheduled tentatively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for [**2147-10-30**].
Given what appeared to be angina, she was started on heparin drip.
The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] on [**2147-10-30**], where coronary artery bypass grafting times two was performed as follows:  left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and radial artery to obtuse marginal artery as well as mitral valve replacement with a #29 Carbomedics.
The patient was maintained on nitroglycerin postoperatively in the cardiac surgery recovery unit, given her radial artery bypass graft.
Lasix, Lopressor, aspirin and Imdur were begun.
Her chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the floor.
The patient was doing well on the floor until postoperative day #2, when she developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 160s, requiring intravenous Lopressor for rate control.
At this time, her amiodarone was decreased and her Lopressor was stopped.
She was started on a heparin drip, given her persistent atrial flutter/fibrillation.
Coumadin had also been started.
The cardiology consultant recommended that the patient would benefit from pacemaker placement; however, the patient requested if there were any alternative treatments and was informed that cardioversion would be an appropriate second choice to try to disrupt the atrial fibrillation and see if the patient had persistent pauses post cardioversion.
Hence, the patient was scheduled for pacemaker placement.
Her Coumadin was held.
Once her INR dropped to below 1.8, the patient underwent dual chamber pacemaker placement with a Medtronics bipolar pacing, bipolar sensing pacemaker.
She tolerated the procedure well and was restarted immediately on her Coumadin as well as on a heparin drip.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.

Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, status post pacemaker insertion.
