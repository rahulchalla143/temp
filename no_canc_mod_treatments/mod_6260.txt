She has been on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement.
Reportedly, her primary care physician has been following her INR via her visiting nurse.
In the Emergency Room, the patient received one liter of normal saline with 20 mEq of potassium.
She received four units of fresh frozen plasma and a head CT scan was performed, which was read as negative for an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
She received ceftriaxone and Flagyl times one at the time of CT scan.
She was admitted to the medicine service for further evaluation and management of her lower gastrointestinal bleed.
St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement in [**2136**].
Status post left oophorectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d., glyburide 10 mg p.o.b.i.d., Glucophage 500 mg p.o.b.i.d., Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o.b.i.d., Serevent two puffs b.i.d., Flovent two puffs b.i.d., Combivent two puffs q.i.d., Captopril 25 mg p.o.t.i.d., digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.b.i.d.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin (rash).
Admission CT of abdomen and pelvis revealed significant bowel wall thickening, stranding and pericolic fluid at the level of the left distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon, diverticula and vascular calcifications present; differential diagnosis diverticulitis versus ischemic bowel and/or hemorrhage into the bowel wall; there were also large gallstones present without evidence of cholecystitis.
The patient was kept on nothing by mouth and treated with intravenous fluids.
She was started on intravenous ciprofloxacin and Flagyl as well as intravenous vancomycin for Enterococcus coverage, given her penicillin allergy.
She received two units of packed red blood cells as well as two additional units of fresh frozen plasma for an elevated INR.
She had already received four units of fresh frozen plasma in the Emergency Room.
On the day of admission, she received vitamin K 3 mg subcutaneously times one.
The following day, while in the Intensive Care Unit, she received 5 mg of intravenous vitamin K times one.
Her diet was advanced to clears and she was changed over to oral antibiotics of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day and Flagyl 500 mg three times a day to complete a total of five days of oral antibiotics for presumptive diverticulitis.
Her hematocrit remained stable and she required no additional blood transfusions.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement, for which she was on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
She received fresh frozen plasma, blood transfusions and vitamin K, as above.
The cardiology service was consulted in regard to whether she should be continued on anticoagulation given the high risk of stroke and with her mechanical valve.
Their recommendation was to continue intravenous heparin with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 60.
Heparin was therefore restarted and her partial thromboplastin time was monitored closely.
After her INR fell to 2, her Coumadin was restarted without a loading dose at 2.5 mg orally at bedtime.
She will be continued on heparin until her INR is therapeutic, which is 2.5 to 3.5.
On admission, her cardiac medications were held in the setting of her acute bleed.
Her Lopressor was titrated up for better rate control and digoxin was restarted.
She was continued on her Serevent, Flovent and Combivent.
She received additional Lasix while in the Intensive Care Unit for some mild pulmonary edema after receiving multiple units of fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells.
Endocrine:  The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held on admission and she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
On discharge, she will be started back on glyburide and Glucophage.
They recommended in-hospital physical therapy to maximize her independent function and mobility prior to returning to home.
Her medications were being optimized and she continued on heparin and Coumadin while awaiting her INR to be therapeutic for her mechanical aortic valve.
An addendum to this dictation will be dictated upon the patient's discharge, which will address her discharge medications and status.
