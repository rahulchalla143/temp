HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, on hospital day number two, was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four with grafts in the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 and saphenous vein graft to diagonal 1.
