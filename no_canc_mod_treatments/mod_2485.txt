He had been seen in the Emergency Department where a CT angiogram of his chest had been performed and revealed a pneumonia and he was treated over the next week with Augmentin for this.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim which leads to an aseptic meningitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service for workup of pneumonia and diarrhea and was treated for a number of complications throughout his hospitalization.
Pulmonary - The patient had been treated as an outpatient for approximately ten days with Augmentin for presumed right middle lobe pneumonia which had not been improving.
His medical regimen at the time of admission included Augmentin, Ciprofloxacin and Azithromycin.
Placement of an inferior vena caval filter was entertained given his tenuous respiratory status, known bilateral deep vein thrombosis and concern that subsequent deep vein thrombosis could be fatal.
Instead, the patient was placed on Lovenox therapy given presumed failure to Coumadin therapy although it was noted that he may have required higher doses of Coumadin, i.e., levels greater than 3.5 in order to truly be anticoagulated with Coumadin.
He will, however, be discharged on Lovenox therapy.
It was decided to continue Epogen therapy with goal hematocrit to be maintained less than 40.0.
Throughout his hospital stay, the patient continued to require intermittent oxygen with saturation documented well below 88.
For this reason, arrangements were made for him to continue to receive oxygen therapy at home upon his discharge.
He was also treated for presumed pneumonia with Azithromycin and Ciprofloxacin to finish out fourteen day courses.
He was placed on Aspirin and Plavix and slowly introduced to an ace inhibitor as his blood pressure tolerated.
He was otherwise continued on his extensive outpatient antiretroviral regimen given his highly resistant viral strain.
He was also continued on Azithromycin, Mepron and Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.
During his hospital stay, he was noted to have question of a line infection in the CCU and was treated with a fourteen day course of intravenous Vancomycin to cover for any true infection, although his blood cultures remained negative.
He also underwent a colonoscopy with biopsies which was unremarkable.
He continued to have episodes of diarrhea and was ultimately placed on Kaopectate for symptomatic relief given no infectious source.
His etiology is presumably related to medications which cannot be altered at this time.
During his hospital stay, he was also found to have bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis as well as a left jugular vein deep vein thrombosis associated with a line.
Given presumed failure to Coumadin although his doses had been only dosed in the 2.5 to 3.5 range, the patient was switched to Lovenox therapy which he will continue as an outpatient.
CODE STATUS:  The patient had previously indicated his wishes not to undergo emergency treatment should he decompensate acutely, however, in the setting of his chest pain and presumed myocardial infarction, the patient had decided to pursue aggressive measures and so his Code Status was reversed to full code for his hospitalization.
Medications will be delineated in a further dictation to follow on the day of discharge.
