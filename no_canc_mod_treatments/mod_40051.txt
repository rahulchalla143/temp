The patient is currently an unreliable historian -- confused and inattentive and tangential, prone to rambling about unrelated topics, interspersed with appropriate information.
From what I can gather from the above sources, she has long-standing MG s/p thymectomy in [**2124**], and last immunosuppresion Tx was [**2143**]-[**2145**] with CellCept.
She has never needed immunomodulatory treatment besides then.
That course was started after an ICU/intubation crisis that occurred after she had her gallbladder removed at an OSH.
She has not required intubation except for a series of intubation/extubation episodes related to that [**2143**] hospitalization.
Six months ago, she developed LE weakness and SOB with extended walks and R>L eyelid drooping as before, so her Neurologist restarted her Mestinon at 60mg q4h.
She insisted on sleeping at a neighbor's house recently due to these ?hallucinations/delusions.
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **], as above; s/p thymectomy [**2124**]; antibody status unknown; Neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10653**]; intubated in ICU [**2143**]; last on immunosuppression [**2143**]-[**2145**] (CellCept); back on Mestinon past 6mos, decreased [**1-24**] nausea, then recent up-titration [**1-24**] increased fatigue.
5. s/p cholecystectomy [**2143**] 6.
Heel-knee-shin testing with no dysmetria.

She had been treated for a presumptive UTI with Bactrim at this point.
She initially did well on BiPAP with normalising CO2 on [**10-14**] and spent most of the day off NIV.
Patient passed swallow assessment and was started on a soft diet and CXR showed a left base opacity concerning for possible pneumonia although given clinical stability and that she had no stigmata of infection, was afebrile, additional antibiotics were held.
During the day, pCO2 rose to 50s but patient remained stable, however, she unfortunately vomited in the evening of [**10-14**] and refused 2x doses of pyrodostigmine and at this point was treated with nasal BiPAP out of concern for aspiration pCO2 worsened during the night and due to worsening pCO2 to 71 on the morning of [**10-15**], she was electively intubated and pyridostigmine was stopped.
Immediately post intubation CXR showed R>L base opacities and in the setting of a fever to 101.1 she was started on IV meropenem and vancomycin for HAP.
Neuromuscular were consulted post intubation and recommended plasmapheresis.
She had a reaction to IVIg on [**10-15**] with tachycardia and hypotension and this settled after brief treatment with pressors.
She proceeded with her first plasmapheresis session on [**10-16**].
The patient remained clinically stable, did not appear septic and had no further fevers and given that all cultures were negative, antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-17**].
She had very poor tidal volumes on the ventilator and restarted pyridostigmine 30mg Q4H on [**10-17**] however this was stopped due to greatly increased oral secretions on [**10-21**].
She was started on steroids at prednisone 60mg qd on [**10-21**] due to continued poor tidal volumes and she had no untoward sequelae from this.
UA was positive but UCx was negative and no treatment was instituted.
Patient had transient hypotensive episodes with her plasmapheresis which improved with IV fluid boluses and latterly the decision was made to hold her metoprolol before plasmapheresis days which improved this.
Endocrine were consulted and followed her calcium level and this was felt to be secondary to mild hyperparathyroidism in the setting of a calcium challenge following calcium gluconate infusion with plasmapheresis and this was stopped on further sessions and her calcium improved but did not normalise.
She was restarted on vit D as she was vit D deficient and will follow-up with endocrine as an o/p.
She slowly improved with better tidal volumes and pyridostimine was restarted at a lower dose [**10-23**] to augment respiratory function in preparation for extubation.
She remained stable without any complications from intubation and had an uneventful last plasmapheresis session on [**10-25**].
She did well on face tent following extubation and latterly was saturating well without oxygen although she still had oral secretions which were manageable by the patient.
After discussion with neuromuscular team she was restarted on mycophenolate 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-29**] for 1 week, and then the mycophenolate should be increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] thereafter.
She conditionally passed speech and swallow and was started on thin liquids with pureed solids, but she did still have some coughing up of residuals so the NGT was left in with Speech Therapy continuing to reassess every day or every other day.
[ ] Speech Therapy - please have Speech evaluate her frequently in anticipation of discontinuing the NG tube.
[ ] Please follow her fingerstick glucose and start an insulin sliding scale if needed.

You required intubation and care provided in an intensive care unit.
For treatment of your myasthenic crisis, you required both plasmapheresis and IVIG to remove the culprit antibodies that likely were causing the exacerbation.
You were restarted on a medication called CellCept (Mycophenolate Mofetil) which will help reduce your risk of developing further myasthenic crises.
You will take PREDNISONE 60 MG by mouth DAILY for your myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
You will take PYRIDOSTIGMINE 15 MG by mouth EVERY 6 HOURS for treatment of your symptoms of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
You will take VITAMIN D 1000 MG by mouth TWICE DAILY until changed by the [**Hospital1 18**] Endocrinology physicians.
