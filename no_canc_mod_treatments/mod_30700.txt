Patient initially responded well to diuresis, but then further lasix held [**10-11**] to [**10-13**] due to metabolic alkalosis.
Lasix was restarted on [**10-13**] for increasing shortness of breath, worsening failure by clinical exam.
Patient was continued on her Diamox.
She was given atropine 1 mg x 3 with increase in HR to 60s but no improvement in blood pressure.
Respiratory Failure: Felt to be multifactorial secondary to CHF, OSA, pulmonary hypertension, possible pneumonia, and possible right diaphragmatic weakness.
The patient could not be weaned from the ventilator and a tracheotomy was placed on [**2110-10-18**].
In the ICU, the patient was weaned to pressure support ventilation with setting of 15 pressure support and 5 PEEP.
She was diuresed several liters and improved, but then developed contraction alkalosis.
Therefore, diuresis was held.
She was started on lisinopril for afterload reduction.
b. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Pt non-tolerant of home CPAP mask.
She will need to be weaned from vent and then evaluated for tracheal CPAP while she sleeps.
She will likely need to resume this once she is weaned from the ventilator d. Right upper lobe pneumonia: Pt treated with vancomycin and zosyn for 7 day course.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and was noted to have bradycardia which was not associated with hypotension.
Patient will need physical therapy to clear patient for home safety evaluation.
Pt was seen by pulmonary who recommended no intervention at this time but follow up CT scan in 6 months when heart failure compensated.
Pt developed contraction alkalosis from over-diuresis for CHF.
She was kept on an insulin sliding scale with good control of her blood sugars.
FEN: patient tolerating tube feeds well on discharge.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow who felt we should permit patient to have pureed solids and thin liquids for comfort when the Passy-Muir valve is connected.

Acces: Patient had PICC placed under fluoroscopy guidance.
