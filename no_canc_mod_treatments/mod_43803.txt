Admission Date:  [**2137-2-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-3-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: anterior wall STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary Catheterization X2 Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: 83yo with a history DM, HTN, and MI with RCA stenting in [**2127**] arrived to ED by ambulance after 1 hr of substernal chest pain that came on while shoveling snow at approximately 11am this morning.
After angioplasty flow was recovered in the LAD and a stent was placed.
During the procedure the patient had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and underwent electrocardioversion several times and started on amiodarone.
He became hypotensive and was started on dopamine 15mcg/kg.
Post procedure PCWP was 40 mm/Hg with V waves to 80.
During the procedure he received over 600cc of contrast and was given 40mg of lasix.
Past Medical History: # Myocardial Infarction with two stents placed in the RCA in [**2127**].
Gen: WDWN middle aged male sedated on mechanical ventilation.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments and apex.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a overlapping 2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post dilated with a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon.
The LAD stents were patent with a distal filling defect and probable stent underexpansion with stent thrombosis.
Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD stents with a 2.75 balloon with no residual stenosis, defect or dissection.
There is a deep venous thrombosis in the right superficial femoral vein extending all the way down to the popliteal vein with intraluminal clot expanding the vein and absence of flow consistent with complete occlusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.
The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare metal stent was placed.
During the procedure the patient became hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple cardioversions.
After emesis he was intubated for airway protection.
He was treated with nitroglycerin, O2, and morphine which resulted in alleviation of his symptoms.
At cardiac catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved flow through the LAD stent.
He remains on Toprol XL 25mg daily, [**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Plavix daily.
He was initially started on dopamine.
In the first 24 hours post cath he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that required atropine boluses on one occasion.
Metoprolol was started on [**2-24**].
On [**3-1**] he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis.
On the day of discharge the lasix dose was increased to 80mg daily.
ACE-I/ARBs was held due to concerns for renal function; if renal function recovers to baseline, we would strongly recommended ACE inhibitor therapy for decreased EF.
# Rhythm: During cardiac catherization patient had ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiple cardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm.
At that time he was then started on amiodarone drip.
On [**2-23**] and then again on [**2-24**] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator weens.
Both episodes were treated with amiodarone and metoprolol and he returned to NSR.
Since [**2-24**] he has been in NSR on daily metropolol and amiodarone.
Coumadin dose was held on [**3-25**] for supratherapeutic INR.
Plan is to restart coumadin on [**3-6**], INR on [**3-5**] at the time of discharge was 3.1, was receiving a dose of 5mg, patient was being loaded on amiodarone.
The dose of amiodarone will be decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg and check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic and adjust as necessary.
# Respiratory: During cardiac arrest the patient vomitted and was intubated for airway protection.
He was removed from mechanical ventilation on [**2-25**].
He has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated JVP and lower extremity edema, and signs of CHF on CXR;  Diuresis with lasix was begun on [**3-1**].
The dose was uptitrated from 40mg PO lasix to 80mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on CXR.
His Cr peaked on [**2-23**] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to 2.4 on [**3-4**] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [**3-1**].
# DVT: Despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed a right sided femoral to popliteal DVT discovered on ultrasound on [**2-28**].
He was maintained on heparin and then transitioned to coumadin.
Because of DVT despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy peri-MI as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet therapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable.
# R arm cellulitis: In addition he developed an infiltrated right forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic and tender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern of a possible cellulitis.
# BPH: Restarted on Flomax on day of discharge.
