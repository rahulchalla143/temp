FINDINGS:  Views of the lumbar spine from the operating room demonstrates interval placement of a disc prosthesis at likely L3-L4.
Lumbar Spine ([**2197-4-28**]) FINDINGS: There has been interval L3-L4 posterior fusion including placement of an interbody fusion spacer, although depiction is limited.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4887**] is a 70F with multiple medical problems including DM2, depression, h/o CVA, CRI, OSA and COPD admitted on [**2197-4-27**] for L3-L4 posterior spinal fusion in two stages.
ACTIVE ISSUES: ================ #) S/P Lumbar Spinal Fusion: [**4-27**]: L3-L4 lateral interbody fusion with interbody device and allograft.
[**4-28**]: revision posterior decompression with far lateral decompression and instrumented fusion L3-L4 with autograft and allograft.
She is being discharged on dilaudid prn for pain and an as needed bowel regimen.
#) Pyuria: Patient developed delirium post-operatively which resolved after treatment with 3 days of IV ceftriaxone.
Possibly was stress response from surgery although higher than one would expect from just that.
Sedating medications were held and patient received antibiotics with complete resolution of symptoms and return to her baseline mental status by day of discharge, as confirmed by family member.
She had been constipated and received aggressive bowel regimen prior to onset of diarrhea.
Stool was sent for C.diff toxin and returned negative.
This could also have been antibiotic-associated diarrhea after receiving ceftriaxone for 3 days.
CHRONIC ISSUES: ================== #) Type 2 Diabetes: Patient is on Levemir, Metformin and Sitagliptin at home.
She has not been on an aspirin or an ACE-I, which may be beneficial given her diabetic history.
We resumed home regimen on discharge.
#) OSA:  Not on CPAP at home.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ====================== - Consider starting Aspirin and ACE-I as outpatient given diabetes.
