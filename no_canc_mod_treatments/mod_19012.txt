HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 year old female with past medical history significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, who is well known to the general surgery blue service, as she underwent an antrectomy/vagotomy with Bilroth II reconstruction as well as splenectomy and partial pancreatectomy for a large bleeding duodenal ulcer on [**2152-11-25**].
She recovered well from this previous surgery and she was discharged to acute care rehabilitation on [**2152-12-8**] with both a duodenostomy tube in the afferent limb of her gastrojejunostomy and a feeding jejunostomy tube placed.
She was sent to the Emergency Department on [**2152-12-21**] with report of fevers, abdominal pain and general malaise, as well as a report of some purulent drainage from her former right upper quadrant [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site.
Lasix 40 mg q. a.m. and 20 q. p.m. 2.
NPH 10 units q. a.m. 4.
Ambien 5 mg q h.s.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Zinc 20 mg p.o.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Protonic 40 mg p.o.
Reglan 10 mg p.o.
Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
There is a 5 by 5 cm area that is tender, indurated and erythematous surrounding the former right [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site with purulent drainage from the site.
There is a duodenostomy tube with some serous drainage from around the skin site and a feeding jejunostomy in good position.
In addition, the radiologist noted the expected changes following a Bilroth II reconstruction as well as a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.
She had follow-up contrast studies, during which gastrografin was injected into both the jejunostomy and duodenostomy tubes.
The J tube contrast study showed that the J tube was in good position and there was no evident leak.
It was determined that Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an angry abdominal wall abscess which required emergent surgery.
Intraoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had several episodes of hypotension which required the administration of pressure support.
In addition, the abdominal wound was packed with Betadine soaked Kerlix and the Penrose drains assisted with the drainage.
Once this was completed, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, intubated and in good condition.
Wound cultures taken during this procedure eventually grew out Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, the anaerobe Prevotella, for which Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on intravenous antibiotics.
She underwent hemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter.
TPN and tube feeds were started on postoperative day number three and Mrs. [**Known lastname **] actually began taking p.o.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also received several red blood cell transfusions.
This episode was attributed to a reaction to the intravenous Dilaudid that Ms. [**Known lastname **] was receiving for her dressing changes.
Neurologic:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on very small doses of Demerol to assist with her dressing changes.
Cardiovascular:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was on her home dose of Lopressor, 25 mg twice a day for the rest of her hospital stay.
Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] did have some wheezing difficulties, for which she continued on her Flovent.
She also received nebulizer treatments q. six and was oxygen saturation requiring because of oxygen saturations down into the mid 80's; however, her oxygen saturation would quickly climb back up with administration of oxygen via a shovel mask.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] TPN was changed over.
The protein was changed over to HepatAmine, in the hopes that this would assist with closing of her colocutaneous fistula.
She was able to increase the amount of protein in her TPN.
In addition, Ms. [**Known lastname **] also received tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube.
She received 1/2 strength Impact tube feeds plus fiber at 70%.
In an attempt to increase her protein intake, when she was noted to be subcatabolic, these tube feeds were supplemented with 30 grams of ProMod every day.
She [**Known lastname 8337**] this increase in protein very well and her subsequent nitrogen balance was noted to be +2.
Infectious disease:  After being treated for several days with intravenous antimicrobials, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have some low grade fevers on [**12-27**].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on Voriconazole for this but she subsequently had a dramatic increase in her creatinine.
She was switched back to Diflucan for several days; however, by [**1-16**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] did not clear the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] from her urine and she was treated with Amphotericin B bladder irrigation.
Gradually, of note, no blood cultures have come back positive and she has been discontinued from all her intravenous and oral antibiotics as of [**1-25**].
She [**Known lastname 53183**] well to hydration and discontinuance of the Voriconazole.
Throughout the month of [**Month (only) 404**], she was actively diuresed with Lasix, anywhere from 5 to 20 mg of intravenous Lasix a day.
Finally with renal, her Foley was discontinued on [**1-25**].
A wrist splint was placed and Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 53183**] well to Celebrex.
An ostomy nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and the patient received Duoderm intermittently to help prevent development of a worse decubitus ulcer.
This is packed with wet to dry Kerlix, covered over with four by fours and abdominal pads and held together with [**Location (un) **] straps with rubber bands holding them together.
Her duodenostomy tubes were also covered with ABD's.
Her drainage has significantly decreased from the beginning of her hospital stay.
Above this cavity, Ms. [**Known lastname **] also has her jejunostomy and duodenostomy tubes in place.
Discharge medications and discharge instructions will be added at the end of Ms. [**Known lastname **] hospital stay.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Protonic 40 mg p.o.
Glycerin suppositories prn.
Flovent 2 puffs twice a day.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Tylenol q. day.
Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
Imodium 2 mg p.o.
Celebrex 200 mg p.o.
Lasix 10 mg intravenous twice a day.
