One of the ulcers was actively bleeding during the procedure (although not initially) and therefore 3 hemoclips were placed with resolution of bleeding.
[**5-30**] EGD: Two non-bleeding ulcers in the stomach body, with two previously-placed clips on one of them Two ulcers at the gastroesophageal junction, with stigmata of recent bleeding A single small ulcer in the pre-pyloric region No active bleeding or old blood No duodenual ulcers Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right leg ischemia, started on a heparin drip, and scheduled for vein mapping/noninvasives/angiography in preparation for possible intervention.
He was started on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for his ulcer.
On [**5-19**] patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram, which demonstrated flow-limiting R CFA calcifications, flush occlusion of R SFA, no visible AK popliteal w/ BK popliteal recon, complete occlusion of R AT with distal recon, complete occlusion of R peroneal, and complete occlusion of R PT with recon at midcalf.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the floor in stable condition.
A bypass procedure was recommended.
Preoperative cardiac workup consisting of stress testing and echocardiography was negative.
On [**5-25**] patient underwent right common femoral, profunda femoral, and external iliac endarterectomy, and patch angioplasty using the donor SFA graft, right common femoral to PT bypass using nonreversed greater saphenous vein, and angioscopy.
Patient was transferred stable and extubated to the PACU, where he was maintained on a phenylephrine drip, which was weaned.
Heparin drip was discontinued after surgery and patient was continued on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.
On [**5-27**] patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to IV metoprolol.
He was transferred to the SICU and started on a Protonix drip, where he underwent endoscopy, during which a bleeding ulcer was clipped.
On [**5-29**] patient required transfusion of an additional 4 units of pRBCs.
On [**5-31**], patient tolerated a clear liquid diet and was transitioned to oral PPI and sucralfate.
On [**6-1**] vanco/cipro/flagyl were discontinued and Bactrim DS was started.
He will continue high-dose PPI treatment for 8 weeks and follow-up with GI in 2 weeks.
