She was treated for a COPD exacerbation as well as volume overload and was extubated after two days.
Her heart failure regimen was also optimized in consultation with cardiology.
In particular, metoprolol was increased from Toprol XL 100 mg qday to metoprolol tartrate 150 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Lisinopril 2.5 mg was started.
Her previous dose of torsemide 100 mg daily was resumed on discharge.
After arrival at home, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] was living with her husband who noted her to be mostly immobile, unwilling to eat, and taking her medications unreliably.
She was given vancomycin 1 g, piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g, and 4 L NS.
IJ was placed and levophed started (initially at .03, titrated up to .12 prior to transfer).
CAD s/p CABG [**2112**] 3.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 5.
DM - insulin dependent, c/b DM retinopathy 6.
However, the following morning her WBC was elevated so vancomycin and zosyn were started.
Norepinephrine was weaned to low doses and continued to maintain MAP >60.
Patient was transferred to the floor off pressors and was normotensive for the remainder of her stay.
Her home hypertension medications were held except for hydrochlorothiazide which was restarted prior to discharge.
She was initially maintained on torsemide 20 mg daily with IV lasix 40 mg prn volume overload.
After necessitating IV lasix due to tachypnea, torsemide was increased to 30 mg daily.
Oxygen and IV morphine prn were continued as needed for comfort although patient did not require IV morphine.
She remained stable on 1-3L NC with no respiratory distress during her hospital stay.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline creatinine per records obtained at last hospitalization ~1.5, which was what it was on discharge a week ago.
Recently, .08 in the setting of not quite so bad renal function.
Improved after IVF resuscitation.
She will be discharged on lower doses of these medications as she has been stable during hospital stay.
Was subtherapeutic INR after having warfarin held at rehab for several days (for INR 5 on [**12-15**]).
Warfarin was restarted at a lower dose and she was started on a heparin drip while warfarin subtherapeutic.
INR was then found to be supratherapeutic and warfarin was held.
Risks and benefits of anticoagulation were discussed with patient and she decided that she did not want to continue anticoagulation.
Warfarin was thus stopped and will not be continued at discharge.
Will continue metoprolol for rate control as described above.

Glargine was decreased to 5 units daily on the floor.
