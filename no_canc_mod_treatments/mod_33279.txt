As noted above, she has a history of worsening dyspnea over the past few months that has been treated with antibiotics and steroids.
She presented to OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a fever to 103F, and was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 83455**]) for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
She developed an increasing oxygen requirement, however, and initially required nasal canula (94% on 1 L O2) but later required face mask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).
It is unclear why she received double coverage for gram negatives.
She was also given methylprednisolone ([**6-6**] dose 20 mg iv q8; then 80->60 mg iv q8 afterward).
On [**6-7**], she was admitted to the ICU and intubated electively for hypoxia and SOB.
Phenylephrine was started because of hypotension to SBPs in the 80s after being intubated and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 83456**]), which had to be uptitrated for sedation.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-9**] based on her family's wishes.
On arrival, her ventilator settings were Vt 500cc, FiO2 100%, PEEP 16.
She was on phenylephrine at 0.6 and rapidly weaned off.

At the time of transfer, her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 were thought to be consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury, and mechanical ventilation settings targeted low tidal volumes and high respiratory rate.
Culture data from the OSH eventually demonstrated MRSA in her sputum culture and she was initially managed with vancomycin/zosyn and then zosyn was discontinued, and she was given a course of solumedrol because of her history of question COPD.
The ID service was consulted and recommended switching from vancomycin to linezolid and empirically completing a course of oseltamavir Of note, she also underwent a repeat chest CTA that was negative for PE and a TTE with a bubble study that was limited in quality but negative for intracardiac shunt.
Diuresis was tried several times with minimal change in PEEP.
Linezolid was switched back to vancomycin given concern for lactic acidosis.
A PICC line was placed on [**2111-6-25**] for long term antibiotics.
Oseltamivir was discontinued on [**6-25**].
Gradually able to wean down PEEP with improvement in bronchospastic episodes on increased sedation, and a trach was placed by IP on [**2111-6-30**].
Sedatives eventually weaned off on [**7-2**] and transitioned to fentanyl gtt and valium, which too were weaned off to a 25 mcg patch q72 hours - This should be weaned further at her facility under the direction of the accepting MD.
Patient was transitioned to lasix IV boluses until Cr and BUN bumped, then PRN to keep her I/Os even.
Pt finished her 15 day course of meropenem on [**2111-7-7**].
- Single lumen PICC was placed [**2111-7-6**] after a 3 day line holiday.
She was started on hep gtt and amio-loaded.
Heparin was discontinued at time of trach placement; long-term anticoagulation was not started as she is considered low-risk s/p conversion.
She was continued on amiodarone and ASA.
Lasix gtt was started to have a smoother diuresis as bolus doses (of 40mg IV lasix) made her transiently hypotensive.
She was restarted on lasix gtt in setting of pressors, which were eventually weaned off.
She was then transitioned to IV lasix boluses at 160mg IV tid until Cr and BUN bumped, then transitioned to PRN Lasix boluses to keep I/Os even.
Of note, she was on acetazolamide for a few days due to metabolic alkosis but this was discontinued as bicarb normalizing.
- Please give IV lasix 80-160mg PRN to keep fluid balance even.
She was started on oral fluconazole on [**2111-7-2**] due to persistent yeast-positive urine cultures despite changing out Foley catheters.
As blood cx grew C. paraipsilosis, changed to fluconazole IV to complete 14-day course of antifungal (last dose [**2111-7-16**]).
Concern was for emoblic event given AF as well as fungemia.
# Hypertriglyceridemia: TG elevated to 303 in setting of propofol gtt.
Pt initially switched to fentanyl and midazolam with improvement in TG.
# Atyical BAL pathology: Tissue from bronch done on [**5-31**] showed atypical plasmacytoid immunoblasts with abnormal CD138+/CD56+ cell population on flow cytometry.
# Diabetes: Required insulin drip temporarily for elevated blood glucose but transitioned back to ISS with glargine with good control.
