Successful emergent PCI of mid LAD with a MINI VISION 2.5x28mm bare-metal stent (BMS)  3.
L femoral artery intra-aortic balloon pump advanced to appropriate position via fluoroscopy for added hemodynamic support post revascularization.
History of Present Illness: This 65-year-old gentleman had a femoral above- knee popliteal bypass with a prosthetic graft at another institution in [**2111-12-4**].
The procedure was complicated by an MRSA wound infection.
This was encompassing virtually all of the graft with a large fluid collection of at least 10 cm in diameter in the above-knee popliteal space.
He has had leg swelling and discomfort from the large fluid collection although he has not manifested septic symptoms and because of the persistent nature of severe leg pain and difficulty walking, he was advised to have the graft removed and replaced with vein graft.
Note is made of bilateral lens replacements.

Cath revealed 80% LAD stenosis, and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD with restoration of flow.
A IABP was placed for hemodynamic support.
He was tranferred back to the CVICU on epi, levo, and milrinone and well as the IABP at 1:1.
Transfused 2 U PRBC for Hct 25 (-> 28).
Patient gradually weaned off milrinone and pressors and was extubated on [**2112-7-10**].
