IMPRESSION: Right PICC line terminates in superior vena cava.
Hospital course was complicated by post-operative hypotension requiring pressors and admission to the MICU.
She was stabilized and moved to the general medical floor for further treatment of cultures growing Strep Milleri.
She was treated initially with levofloxacin and metronidazole and underwent VATS-decortication and chest tube placement.
Given post-operative hypotension, antibiotic coverage was broadened to Clindamycin/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin.
Strep Milleri did not successfully grow in culture and sensitivity data was not able to be obtained.
PICC line was placed for planned 14 day course of vancomycin.
She has 7 days remaining of vancomycin therapy at time of discharge.
Though this is likely reactive in the setting of parapneumonic effusion, an interval chest CT should be obtained 1 month following discharge.
Pt responded well to IV fluids in PACU w/transient period off NEO once arrived to MICU.
Pt was weaned from pressors without incident.
We maximized therapy with singulair, pulmicort neb, ipratropium nebulizer, albuterol nebulizer.
We measured her finger sticks QID, and maintained humalong sliding scale as needed.
At time of discharge she did not have an insulin requirement.
