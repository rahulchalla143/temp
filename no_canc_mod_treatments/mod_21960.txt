In addition to her abnormal CBC, she demonstrated elements of hemolysis including decreased fibrinogen and haptoglobin as well a peripheral smear showing abundant schistocytes, occasional teardrop forms, many hypochromic and microcytic RBC's, occasional target forms, and rare acanthocytic/burr cell forms.
She was treated conservatively with humidified steam and steroid inhaler with improvement of her symptoms.
On [**2157-7-29**] the right IJ plasmapheresis port was removed without complication.
Initiation of a slow (6-week) prednisone taper as an outpatient was also planned.
Detailed hospital course by system/day is as follows: Briefly, this is a 24 yo female, G1P1, s/p induced vaginal delivery after suspected pre-eclampsisa, who postpartumly developed progressive anemia, leukocytosis, and mild to have HELLP given hemolysis, elevated LFTs and mild thrombocytopenia.
Although plt transfusion can result in thrombotic complications, since her chief issue at that time was vaginal hemorrhage, she received plt transfusion with a goal of plt>60, she continued to receive aggressive FFP replacement.
This was thought to be transfusion induced lung injury vs pulmonary edema vs pulmonary hemorrhage given her coagulopathy vs ARDS, was treated with lasix and NTG gtt to reduce preload.
Continue aggressive diuresis.
#3 pharesis  HD#7 ([**7-11**]): remained sedated/intubated.
platelets continue to climb slowly, coags normalized, slight drop in fibrinogen and hematocrit since yesterday.
Haptoglobin dipped to <20, other hemolysis labs normal.
Switched to predinisone at 60mg PO QD.Also started on Iron supplementation.
[**7-22**]: pheresis #14 [**7-23**]: pheresis #15 [**7-24**]: pheresis #16 [**Date range (1) 27112**]: pheresis held, labs stable [**7-29**]: pheresis held, labs stable, right IJ removed  2.
likely related to TTP/HUS, cre peaked at 2.0, trending downwards now stable at 0.4-0.5 with continued diuresis--she was net 16 L positive on [**7-9**].
Developed metabolic alkolosis probably from lasix diuresis, volume contraction, and citrate in the blood product.
Patient still requires occasional lasix due to fluid retention.
On [**7-15**] BP up to 176/56, started on 25mg QD atenolol and [**7-16**] IV lasix 20mg for pressure control.
She contines standing atenolol and prn lasix.
Pulm: She developed hypoxic respiratory failure on [**7-8**] probably secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage vs fluid overload s/p multiple transfusion vs ARDS vs transfusion injury.
She remained intubated for 5 days in the ICU.
Received Decadron 10 mg q8, racemic epinepherine inhaler prn, with resolution of her [**Last Name (un) 15883**] and respiratory distress.
Appropriate outpatient followups are arranged to assess the need for surgical intervention.
GU: s/p vaginal delivery with labial tear, vaginal oozing post-partum.
Pitocin was continued through [**7-8**].
She was put on empiric coverage for bowel flora with amp/levo/flagyl x 1 wk total, then developed diarrhea, stool c diff negative, ABX (amp/levo/flagyl) d/c'd on [**7-12**].
Initially on Cefzolin for S. aureus prophylaxis, discontinued on [**7-18**] b/c no signs of infection, vagi pack took out on [**7-16**].
Started on Keflex on [**7-20**].
Blood culture from peripheral line and Quinton pending, urine culture pending  7.
Endo: on RISS initially while on tube feeds,discontinued once PO.
