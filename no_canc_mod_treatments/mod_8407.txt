The patient received six liters of normal saline as well as one gram of Vancomycin, 100 mg of intravenous Gentamicin and was put on an insulin drip for her diabetic ketoacidosis.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis was treated and resolved with intravenous fluids and insulin drip.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin for question of bacterial endocarditis given her history of intravenous drug abuse.
On transfer to the floor, the patient's antibiotics were changed to Clindamycin given her complaints of tooth pain and her poor dentition.
She was transferred to the Medicine floor for further monitoring prior to discharge.
The patient has been using Heroin for the last fourteen years.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 26 units of regular and 24 units of NPH twice a day.
She admit to intravenous drug abuse of Heroin for the last twelve years and has tried numerous detoxification programs in the past including Methadone maintenance.
These have all failed since the patient states that she has hyperactivity disorder and self medicates with Heroin to treat this.
There are suspicions that the patient's husband may be using intravenous drugs as well.
Chem7 showed sodium 142, potassium 6.1, chloride 89, bicarbonate 6, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.5, glucose 989 with an anion gap of 47.
Urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates, but negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, Cocaine, amphetamines and Methadone.
Diabetic ketoacidosis - As mentioned above, the patient was placed on insulin drip in the unit and her blood sugar improved subsequently.
The patient was increased to a regimen of NPH of 28 units in the morning and 12 units at night.
The patient will obtain further nutrition and diet education at the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
The patient also complained of significant sore throat and it is possible that she may have had Streptococcus pharyngitis although Streptococcus culture is still pending.
Thus, she was appropriately treated with Clindamycin for a total five day course and was discharged with two days remaining.
Intravenous drug abuse - Although the patient was initially resistant to speaking with social work regarding detoxification programs and Methadone maintenance, after transfer to the floor, she had briefly mentioned that she would be receptive to some sort of treatment.
After follow-up with the addiction consultation, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**], the patient ultimately decided to hold off on detoxification treatment since she would like to further discuss recovery with her husband.
The patient was given a fax sheet with addiction resources as well as the number of the addiction consultation nurse in case she had any questions.
As far as the patient's Methadone taper, the patient has been loaded up with significant doses of Methadone in the Intensive Care Unit secondary to a severe agitation episode.
Thus, the patient had abruptly transitioned from a total dose of 120 mg of Methadone to 40 mg.
The patient's symptoms ultimately resolved and she was given a brief trial of Clonidine for symptomatic relief at 0.1 mg twice a day.
On the day of discharge, the patient received 30 mg of Methadone but, since she wished to be discharged to home, the patient could not receive any further Methadone taper.
Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine was high on admission at 1.5, but improved after intravenous hydration and was back to baseline at 0.5 upon discharge.
The nausea was most likely related to the patient's withdrawal from Heroin and she was treated symptomatically with antiemetics as well as Clonidine.
Access - The patient had a right subclavian line placed at the time in the Intensive Care Unit, which was subsequently discontinued prior to transfer to the floor.
The patient also required a primary care physician which was arranged for her.
Clindamycin 300 mg p.o.
Clonidine 0.1 mg p.o.
Compazine 10 mg p.o.
NPH 28 units q.a.m.
with regular insulin sliding scale for additional coverage.
The patient is to follow-up with [**Hospital **] Clinic for diabetes mellitus management on [**2174-4-28**], at 10:00 a.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the [**Location (un) 1773**] of the [**Last Name (un) **] Building, as well as at 11:00 a.m. with the nurse educator to discuss nutrition.
