Orthopedics saw and advised conservative management and she was given dilaudid for pain as well as a muscle relaxant (unknown type).
She was given 1 dose of Narcan with little change.
Put on 100% NRB and trasfered to CCU where she was given Ceftazidime and Vancomycin.
Continued to be hypotensive despite fluids (unsure how much) and was started on phenylephrine gtt.
Insulin pump (home med) was discontinued and ISS started.
[**Last Name (un) **] and bactrim were held.
Immediately prior to transfer patient was intubated due to concerns Re transfer saftey with pt still on NRB and concerns by [**Hospital3 **] that she was developing ARDS.
Pressures dropped significantly after intubation with Rocuronium and Propofol and had to go up on Phenylephrine.
Patient was stable on ride over and EMTs were able to go down on her pressor requirement.
She did well on the vent with relatively minimal sedation and remained responsive to voice on ride over.

ET tube tip is low, 1.5 cm above the carina, can be withdraw couple of centimeters for more standard position.
NG tube tip is in the stomach, but the side hole is at the EG junction and should be advanced for more standard position.
Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
Left perihilar and lower lobe opacities are worrisome for aspiration given the clinical concern.
[**2113-7-6**] Humerus XRay: IMPRESSION: Proximal left humerus comminuted fracture involving surgical neck with mild subluxation posteriorly of distal fracture fragment approximately two cortical widths with fracture line extension also extending towards greater tuberosity.
Between the bursts, there was evidence of a severe encephalopathy with suppression of electrical activity.

Patient had complicated MICU course where she was treated for altered mental status, pneumonia, and c. diff.
Mental status improved slowly over 10 days of ICU stay suggesting toxic-metabolic delerium as the reason for the alteration.
# Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated after respiratory distress at an OSH which may have been triggered by aspiration event.
She was covered with broad spectrum coverage for HCAP.
She was discharged on lasix 60mg daily and she was on room air.
Rectal tube placed and patient started on PO Vancomycin 500mg Q6hrs.
Couple days later also started on IV metronidazole for both this and pneumonia.
Last day of Cdiff treatment antibiotics should be [**2113-7-26**].
She was also started on cholestyramine to help reduce the amount of diarrhea she was having and this can be discontinued at the patient's discretion in a few days.
# Acute on CKD: s/p LURT in [**2106**], c/b humoral rejection followed by multiple plasmapheresis, recent Cr baseline (1.4-1.7) on Sirolimus and prednisone.
Cr improved initially with fluids and patient continued on home prednisone 4mg daily with reduction of Sirolimus to 0.5mg daily.
Continued on Bactrim prophylaxis.
# DM1: Has history of brittle diabetes on home insulin pump (although somewhat unclear how much [**Name (NI) 39150**] she takes).
Was placed on an insulin gtt while in the ICU and [**Last Name (un) **] consulted to help with management.
Day before ICU callout was transitioned to lantus with humalog sliding scale.
She was discharged on lantus [**Hospital1 **] with sliding scale insulin and should not resume her insulin pump until following up with her outpatient DM provider.
Ortho saw here and recommended conservative management with a sling.
Due to mental status tried to limit narcotics (and some history that she is very sensative to narcotics), so given tylenol, lidocaine patch.
# Depression/Anxiety:  High dose citalopram at home as well as busprione and clonazepam at home.
Citalopram was decreased to 20mg in setting of multiple other meds and buspirone and clonazepam were initially held given AMS.
The buspirone and clonazepam were restarted at home dose, and citalopram was reduced to 40mg at discharge.
Cards saw here and said no need for heparin gtt.
Once infectious issues stabilized, restarted lasix with PRN doses in the ICU, and discharged on lasix 60mg PO daily.
# HYPERTENSION: Initially BP meds held in setting of infection.
# HLD: continued home atorvastatin  # Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine  # FEN: Was NPO initially, then received tube feeds for a few days, ultimately advanced to diabetic diet # Code: Full # Disposition: She is very deconditioned and needs significant rehab.
She needs to call her Diabetes provider and schedule an appointment to discuss restarting her insulin pump once she is on a stable diet 3.
Rapamycin dose changed during this hospitalization, will have weekly level checked and follow up with renal regarding dose titration.
Can discontinue cholestyramine in a few days once diarrhea improves 5.

Your lung infection resolved with antibiotic treatment.
There was some concern that you were having seizures so you were briefly started on seizure medications but the neurologists feel you do not actually require this medication so this was discontinued.
You also developed a diarrheal infection in your colon called clostridium difficile for which you will continue to require antibiotics once you leave.
