Admission Date:  [**2110-10-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-12-12**]   Service:  VASC [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was an 84 year old gentleman with multiple past medical problems including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, history of sinus node dysfunction status post dual chamber pacemaker placement in [**2108-8-22**], history of long term hypertension, well known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm which was documented that had grown from 5.5 centimeters in [**2109-8-22**] to 7.2 mg on [**2110-9-17**].
The patient at that time had previously declined elective surgery and when he was noticed to have this increasing size in his abdominal aortic aneurysm, he continued to decline elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
The patient is status post left hip arthroplasty, history of left ventricular hypertrophy, history of mild aortic regurgitation with moderate mitral regurgitation and finally a history of hemorrhoidectomy in the distant past.
Upon obtaining good intravenous access and resuscitating him with intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells, a CT scan was obtained and demonstrated a primary aortic enteric fistula.
He was intubated for airway protection and the seriousness and acuity of his condition was discussed with the distant relatives present at that time Prior to his intubation, Mr. [**Known lastname 98538**] discussed going to surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
At that point, he wanted surgical intervention.
On [**2110-10-10**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a resection of the 7.2 centimeter infrarenal aortic aneurysm that required a temporary supra-celiac cross clamp of about 30 minutes and a 40 minute infrarenal aortic cross clamp as well as a replacement of the aorta with a 20 millimeter Dacron tube graft.
Subsequently the sac of the aneurysm was debrided and an omental pedicle coverage of the graft was performed.
An intraoperative consultation was obtained with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] from the Blue Surgical Team who performed a duodenal fistula resection, duodenotomy closure with an omental flap placement.
Due to the aggressive resuscitation and the patient's instability, the abdomen was left open but covered with a sterile drape with drains as well as a pack.
He was started on broad empiric antibiotic coverage.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He was started on Levofloxacin, AmBisome, Zosyn as well as Vancomycin with the guidance and input of Infectious Disease.
All along this time, he was supported with intravenous fluids and vasopressors and he was started on total parenteral nutrition.
He was found to have a moderate diffuse dilation of the common bile duct with some sludge, measuring about 12 millimeters and this is why he had a stent placed successfully in the common bile duct.
Subsequently this stent was removed but in spite of this his bilirubin never returned to [**Location 213**] values and remained elevated.
His Intensive Care Unit course was subsequently complicated by prolonged intubation, ultimately requiring a tracheostomy that was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from Interventional Pulmonology on [**2110-11-12**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well and this tracheostomy allowed the surgical Intensive Care Unit staff to perform much better pulmonary toilet.
He was intermittently on and off pressors to treat this hypotension during this time .
He was started on enteral tube feeding as well as kept on total parenteral nutrition, closing monitoring transferrin levels as well as liver function tests.
During the entire month of [**Month (only) **], the patient appeared to wax and wane but ultimately became progressively sicker and deteriorated.
Despite this, the patient's family wished to continue full support and keep him in the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
He continued to decline and progressively became sicker and more pressor dependent to keep adequate hemodynamics.
Upon meeting with the Surgical Intensive Care Unit staff and in agreement with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the vascular attending on record, it was decided that cardiopulmonary resuscitation would not be indicated on this patient, but he will be kept on the pressor support as well as ventilatory support as the patient's family wished.
By the evening of [**2110-12-11**], he was more acidotic and minimally responsive with low blood pressure requiring a full ventilatory support to barely keep his saturations above the 90s.
The Primary Team was called to evaluate the patient and upon confirming the absence of corneal reflexes, tracheal reflex as well as a lack of spontaneous breathing or heart rate, nor any response to painful stimuli he was pronounced dead at 03:35 pm on [**2110-12-12**].
