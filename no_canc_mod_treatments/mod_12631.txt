The patient received external pacing in the field and was brought to [**Hospital3 17310**].
At [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient received calcium gluconate 1 amp, and 10 units of insulin, and 1 unit of D-50, 1 amp bicarbonate, and 2 g of Kayexalate.
She was subsequently wrapped in warm blankets for hypothermia and intubated for comfort.
The patient required temporary dopamine.
She was then found to revert back to normal sinus rhythm in the 50s, and the dopamine drip was discontinued.
The patient was still intubated on arrival.
She was maintained on CPAP 10/5 with 50% FIO2.
The patient received 10 mg of subcutaneous vitamin K.  The patient was given aggressive intravenous fluids for acute renal failure thought secondary to prerenal azotemia.
A temporary pacing wire was placed on arrival which was set at 40 beats per minute.
Given question of sepsis and active sputum, the patient was started on Levaquin for a question of pneumonia.
The following day, with improvement in the patient's blood pressure, she was restarted on her atenolol.
Nasogastric tube was in placed.
Sodium of 131, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine 1.2 (down from an admission creatinine of 2.4), glucose of 184.
Prerenal state may have resulted in acidosis hyperkalemia with possible poor clearance of her atrioventricular nodal blockers which included verapamil and atenolol at the time of presentation.
She was put back on her atenolol and verapamil; although, verapamil was ultimately discontinued and beta blocker was titrate upward.
Instead, the patient's cardiac regimen was aggressively titrated up until the time of discharge.
PULMONARY:  The patient was maintained on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and completed a 10-day course with a normalization of her white blood cell count and no fevers.
She initially underwent some gentle diuresis for congestive heart failure but did not require further diuresis for the duration of her hospital stay.
However, she was maintained on aggressive ACE inhibitor for afterload and preload reduction.
She should likely be evaluated for an outpatient colonoscopy given her iron deficiency anemia.
Her INR was elevated on admission, and this improved with vitamin K times one.
She was put back on her Glucophage and glipizide with the addition of an insulin sliding-scale for better glycemic control.
