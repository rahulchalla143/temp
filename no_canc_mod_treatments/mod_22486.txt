The patient was initially admitted to Vascular surgery service.
The patient was continued on PPI during this admission.
She was then continued on a 7-day course of Levaquin per ID because of better coverage of Strep bovis with Levaquin and also because of CXR finding concerning of pneumonia.
IV Lopressor was given without success and she was loaded with IV amiodarone with subsequent return to NSR.
Cardiology consultants advised to continue amiodarone po loading followed by 400 mg po bid dose x 7 days then 200 mg po daily.
Vascular surgery were reconsulted with question of anticoagulation in the setting of AAA and advised that AAA is not a contraindication to anticoagulation.
The patient was started on anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin while in the hospital in anticipation of colonoscopy.
After EGD/colonoscopy, she was then started on lower dose Coumadin, 3 mg daily,  (as she was also on Levaquin and Amiodarone).
Given history of a prior stroke which puts her at a high risk for thromboembolic events, it was felt that the patient needs to be bridged with Heparin to overlap with therapeutic INR x 2days.
Cardiology consultants recommended that the patient will absolutely need continuous loop recorder after her discharge.
She had severe HTN with SBP in 200's requiring doses of IV Hydralazine.
Lopressor and Lisinopril were titrated up.
(the patient was on a low dose Prinivil as an outpatient).
Her BP medications will likely need further adjustment as an outpatient.
Iron studies revealed low serum Fe/TIBC ratio, but Ferritin was >500.
The patient was started on Vitamin B12 supplements and was continued on iron supplements.
Given suspicion for iron deficiency anemia and need for chronic anticoagulation as well as finding of Strep bovis in urine, GI were consulted and the patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy which were significant for gastritis and diverticuli in duodenum and sigmoid but showed no evidence of malignancy in colon.
The patient was on inhalers including steroids as an outpatient.
The patient was continued on Lasix 20 mg po daily.
The patient was on Levaquin for UTI which will also cover a pulmonary source.
She was told to resume her outpatient inhalers and to continue with a nasal spray.
She was continued on Pravachol  12.
