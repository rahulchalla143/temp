Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 yo woman with PMHx significant for Addison's disease on chronic steroids, COPD, chronic pain who presented to OSH with fever, cough, n/v/d, and lethargy.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to adrenal insufficiency and mild hypovolemia in the setting of not taking steroids and inadequate PO intake from nausea and vomiting.
Patient was started on stress dose steroids (100 mg of Hydrocortisone) and received IV fluid boluses with subsequent improvement in her blood pressures.
On admission she received broad antibiotics out of concern for sepsis; however, these were discontinued secondary to low clinical suspicion for bacterial illness and rapid improvement with hydration.
Endocrine was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding steroid tapering and recommended Hydrocortisone 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] through [**4-26**], then decreasing to double her home dose for 3 days, then continuing her on home dose.
However, as she developed a pneumonia (see below), she was discharged on 1 mg twice daily of Dexamethasone to be taken until her antibiotics are completed (higher dose kept in setting of current infection).
# Adrenal insufficiency: This episode of hypotension was likely secondary to nausea/vomiting (secondary to viral illness) and relative adrenal insufficiency due to inability to take po steroids and concurrent stress.
She responded quickly to IV fluids and stress-dose steroids.
Her steroids were slowly weaned, however she was continued on a higher-dose (1 mg twice daily of dexamethasone) due to her concurrent pneumonia.
She was instructed to taper to 0.5 mg twice daily afte completion of her antibiotics and to stay on this dose until follow-up with her endocrinologist.
She was afebrile and concern for resistant organisms was very low, so she was started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course.
She was started on simethicone and miralax with improvement in her symptoms.
# Hyponatremia - stable during her hospitalization .
# COPD: continued on outpatient regimen of combivent and advair.
# Depression/Anxiety: continued on outpatient regimen.
She would likely benefit from a neuropsych evaluation, as there is concern that this may be impacting her abilityto manage her medications and health on her own.
Initially, frequency of narcotics were reduced in setting of hypotension, but were restarted at her home dose during her hospitalization.
