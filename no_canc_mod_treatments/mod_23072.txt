These are incompletely evaluated and may be further assessed with IV contrast after resolution of acute symptoms.
Successful biliary sphincterotomy performed.
Gallstone pancreatitis and Choledocholithiasis: Patient initially transferred from OSH with symptoms of biliary obstruction (elevated LFTs and total bilirubin of 9.4) and pancreatitis.
Patient underwent ERCP with spincterectomy and extraction of multiple stones on [**8-3**].
Postoperative course with numberous complications including acute on chronic renal failure, acute anemia, acute respiratory distress and rising WBC count (all outlined below).
LFTs had trended down, total bilirubin was 1.4 and patient was tolerating oral intake.
Initially, patient was continued on his home verapamil SR 240mg daily although his ACEI was held secondary to creatinine of 2.1 (see below).
Labetolol was added temporarily prior to lap cholecystectomy.
Lisinopril was started at home dose on [**8-13**] of MICU stay.
Labetolol was also added to blood pressure regimen, and pressures became more well controlled and stable, with SBP ranging mostly in 120's - 130's.
Initially, patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn secondary to concern of VAP.
Nebulizer treatments were continued for symptomatic relief.
Dyspnea was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of poorly controlled HTN and all antibiotics were stopped.
Patient was weaned off oxygen requirement.
O2 sats were 94% on RA, and he responded to albuterol nebs.
His CXR also showed increased fluid, and he was given IV lasix.
After laproscopic cholecystectomy on [**8-9**], WBC count again rose to the 20s although patient remained afebrile and without focal symptoms of infection.
Abdominal exam was unremarkable, giving low suspicion for a surgical deep space infection.
When patient transferred to MICU on [**8-12**] for respiratory distress, there was initial concern for PNA given prolonged hospital course and recent intubation.
Antibiotics were started empirically on [**8-12**], but discontinued on [**8-13**] due to rapid resolution of symptoms.
Patient became agitated multiple nights, pulling at IV and foley (causing foley trauma with [**Known firstname **] hematuria), requiring halidol for behavioral control.
At baseline, patient exhibited marked cognitive impairment as indicated by mini-mental exam and his AMS may have represented features of his dementia.
7. chronic kidney disease: Creatinine has been stably elevated during admission, with baseline ~2.0, and consistent proteinuria on urinalysis.
Lisinopril was initially held on hospitalization, but restarted on [**8-13**] without incident.
After his foley catheter was removed, the patient did have some elevated post-void residuals.
His levothyroxine was increased to 112 mcg (his reported home dose) mg daily.
He should have his thryroid rechecked in 4 weeks and adjust meds as needed at that time.
Glaucoma: Home eye drop treatments were continued.
History of gout: Allopurinol was held given recent acute rise in creatinine above baseline elevation.
