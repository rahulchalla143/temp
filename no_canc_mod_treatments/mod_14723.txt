Cardiac catheterization showed an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 30, PA pressures of 69/20, 100% proximal left anterior descending lesion and 100% first diagonal lesion, 100% mid circumflex lesion, 100% obtuse marginal one, 100% right PDA and 100% RPL.
The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and scheduled electively for a coronary artery bypass grafting.
Status post renal cell carcinoma in [**2121**]; status post nephrectomy with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.1.
Status post perforated diverticulum in [**2135**], well healed by colonoscopy.

He was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the first diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1.
The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit on Milrinone, epinephrine and Levophed.
A General Surgery consultation was obtained and a CT scan was obtained which showed an unremarkable gallbladder, two small granulomas in the right lobe of the liver, some fatty infiltration of the pancreas without enlargement or fat stranding around the pancreas, grossly patent celiac and superior mesentery artery.
The patient's vasopressors were weaned off.
Renal consultation was obtained and felt that this was dye induced acute tubular necrosis in spite of the patient receiving peri-procedure Mucomyst.
On postoperative day number two, the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation without any difficulty.
The Renal Team felt that the patient needed more fluid resuscitation and with which his urine output increased.
It was recommended that the patient receive 25 grams of albumin as well as taking chest tubes off suction; the chest tube output decreased and the chest tubes were removed on postoperative day number six.
The femoral arterial line was removed and the patient got out of bed to sit in a chair.
The Neurology attending felt that perhaps the patient had some subtle neurologic findings and recommended obtaining an MRI at a future date as the patient could not have an MRI at that time due to the staples on his incisions.
Nephrology Team felt that the patient would continue to progress and signed off.
The patient was also noted to have a decrease in platelet count and heparin antibody was sent which was subsequently negative.
The patient was started on Lasix with good diuresis.
The patient's chest tubes were removed without incident without any evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is a minimal amount of serous drainage from the left chest tube site.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
