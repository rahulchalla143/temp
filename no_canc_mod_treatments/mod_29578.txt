Patient may benefit from nasogastric tube decompression.
New PICC line in satisfactory position as above.
Endotracheal tube is also in satisfactory position.
Chest Xray ([**2170-11-1**]) Endotracheal tube extends at least to the level of the carina with the patient's neck in a flexed position.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] is a 75 year-old retired firefighter with an extensive past medical history including chronic systolic CHF, afib s/p ablation on coumadin, HTN, and adrenal insufficiency who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fevers, hypotension and respiratory failure and was found to have MDR Klebsiella Pneumonia.
A R-sided IJ was placed in the ED as he required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was sedated and intubated with FiO2 40%.
He was weaned off pressors completely and extubated on [**2170-11-1**].
Initially he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin and aztreonam (due to his many drug allergies), but when cultures and sensitivities returned he was switched to meropenem on [**2170-11-2**].
Aztreonam was discontinued as Klebsiella was resistant to this medication.
COAGULOPATHY: On [**2170-10-1**], the patient's INR was noted to be 7.2 in the setting of Coumadin use and poor nutrition.
The patient was treated with vitamin K 1 mg PO x 1.
Coumadin was restarted on [**2170-11-5**] in the setting of INR 1.8.
For this, he received 2 units of PRBCs on [**2170-11-4**].
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Patient required stress dose steroids of 100mg Hydrocoritsone [**Hospital1 **] in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He was weaned to 25mg Hydrocortisone [**Hospital1 **] prior to being transferred to the floor.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: In the context of receiving fluid boluses for pressure support in the context of sepsis the patient became significantly volume overloaded.
He was diuresed with furosemide drip and then bolus doses after blood pressures stabilized.
He was satting 92-99% on 2L of oxygen and noted symptomatic relief in his SOB and cough.
He was continued on the meropenem for his pneumonia while in the hospital, but discharged on ertapenem (for ease of administration) for a total coverage of 14 days.
He was continued on his home dose of 5mg coumadin with improvement in his INR to 1.7 on day of discharge.
He was not bridged on heparin gtt as his PE was remote and given recent concern for bleed.
Hypertension Patient was hypertensive on transfer to the floor while awaiting receiving his BP meds.
His pressures were stable and within the normal range on his home blood pressure regimen on the floor.
Adrenal Insufficiency Patient was continued on 25mg [**Hospital1 **] hydrocortisone while in the hospital.
Chronic Systolic CHF The patient remained euvolemic to slightly volume depleted on the floor after intensive diuresis in the unit.
His furosemide was held in the context of the contraction alkalosis as noted.
He will likely need an increase in his furosemide dose at home.

You improved dramatically on antibiotics and will be discharged with a 9 day course of antibiotics.
You will need to continue to have your INR checked and your coumadin adjusted accordingly to maintain a therapeutic INR.
While in the hospital you required stress dose steroids for your adrenal insufficency.
You also required a blood transfusion as a result of a low hematocrit.
We held your lasix while you were in the hospital as you appeared to be dehydrated.
You should minimize your sodium intake.
