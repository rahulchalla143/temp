Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of CAD, status post MI, tachy-brady, status post pacemaker, CHF, diabetes type II, and depression who sustained a left hip fracture after a fall at rehab.
She was started on a 7 day course of prophylactic antibiotics cefazolin and levofloxacin.
She was started on a 6 week course of enoxaparin 40 mg SC for DVT prophylaxis post-operatively.
She responded to fluid bolus.
A cortisol stimulation test was borderline and she was started on stress-dose steroids.
She required fluid boluses to maintain her CVP and pressors to maintain her blood pressor.
On ICU day 3, she weaned off of the pressors.
Her stress dose steroids were stopped after a 3 day course since her pressures were stabilized and since she had a borderline cortisol stimulation test.
3) Pain control: She was started on tramadol and acetaminophen post-operatively for pain control.
She became responsive after a 1 mg dose of naloxone.
Her tramadol dose was adjusted to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], which she tolerated well.
Her outpatient gabapentin was also continued throughout the admission for control of neuropathy in her feet.
3) Delirium: She had a exacerbation of delirium post-operatively, which was most likely related to the peri-operative Morphine and Fentanyl administration.
* 4) CAD/Afib/AS: Pre-operatively, her aspirin and isosorbide were held.
Her sotalol was initially continued for rate control.
Her sotalol was held post-operatively given her hypotension.
Her sotalol was restarted on ICU day 4 once her blood pressure was stable.
She is not on Coumadin for anticoagulation since she has a risk for fall.
7) Diabetes: She was on Glyburide at rehab, but it was discontinued on admission.
She was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
This scale needed to be increased once she was started on the stress-dose steroids.
She was restarted on Glyburide 2.5 mg QD prior to discharge.
7) FEN: She passed a speech and swallow evaluation and was recommended to have honey thick liquids and pureed solids.
She received numerous fluid boluses to maintain her CVP during the first few days of her ICU admission.
* 8) Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin for post-operative DVT prophylaxis.
She was maintained on a PPI and bowel regimen.
9) Access: a right IJ catheter was placed given her hypotension.
Her son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 16343**] was also involved in her care and consented for surgery and care during this admission.
