Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 75 yo F h/o COPD on 3L with recent COPD exacerbation, HTN on [**Last Name (un) **] presenting with uvula swelling and urticaria which was concerning for allergic reaction to levofloxacin or Losartan.
# Uvula Swelling: Only new exposures include levofloxacin and prednisone.
Levofloxacin renally cleared and patient does have mildly decreased GFR, so the timing of this new medication may coincide with her reaction.
Both medications can cause an allergic reaction in less than 1 % of all noted reactions.
We emailed Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], allergist and the recommendation was to continue to hold levofloxacin and losartan, while was okay to start on HCTZ.
She was given an dose of epinephrine in the ED and then started on methaPred than transitioned to prednisone 40mg with recs to take it for 5 days.
she was instructed to stop taking levofloxacin and possible losartan.
- Prednisone 40mg for 5 days - Famotidine and hydroxy as needed for symptomatic relief - Hold levofloxacin and losartan - [**Month (only) 116**] consider allergist referral .
# COPD: On 3 liters at baseline, however did appear in mild to moderate distress on presentation which improved with neb treatments.
We also sent Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] an email to discuss possible starting on Azithromycin ppx for her recurrent COPD flares, although her resp appears to be at baseline.
- Continue steroids as above - Continue dulera, albuterol and ipratropium - Continue 3 liters NC - F/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  .
Given mild respiratory distress on presentation and pleural effusion, she was given only one dose of lasix 10mg IV with good response.
She was breathing comfortable during the rest of her stay, so further doses of lasix were given.
Managed with ranitidine and Aveeno - Treat as above plus Sarna prn .
# Diabetes:  Her glucose was elevated since she was placed on steroids and her insulin sliding scale was increased while on steroids.
I reviewed this information with her granddaughter and asked that her [**Name (NI) 31567**] be checked at home 4 times per day (before meals and at bed time).
I also recommended that she continues with her sliding scale and call her PCP if her glucose remains elevated >300.
Metformin was held while she was inpatient and restarted once she was d/ced.
- Hold losartan as above - Started on HCTZ 25mg daily - Asked VNA to check daily BPS - F/u with her PCP office in 1 week .

You were given an epinephrine injection, steroids and your medications, Levofloxacin and Losartan, were stopped as these sometimes may cause an allergic reaction and swelling of the face.
You did not have any evidence of airway compromise or obstruction, and you were continued on steroids and an anti-histamine, to be continued for 5 days total.
The following changes were made to your home medications: - Prednisone was STARTED to be taken for FOUR additional days - Famotidine was STARTED to be taken for FOUR additional days - Start Hydrochlorozide 25mg once daily for your blood pressure - STOP LOSARTAN since this is a concern that may have caused your allergic reaction.
YOU SHOULD AVOID TAKING A CLASS OF BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS CALLED ACE-I, [**Last Name (un) **] - STOP LEVOFLOXACIN since we are uncertain if this could had caused your allergic reaction.
