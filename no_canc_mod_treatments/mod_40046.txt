Tracheal Foreign body: Patient was evaluated by interventional pulmonology service, and bronchoscopy was performed on [**2104-11-8**] to remove the foreign body.
She tolerated the procedure well without complications.
During bronchoscopy the tracheostomy site appeared narrowed indicating good upper airway ventilation, and when the tube was covered she maintained O2 saturation.
Since she did not appear to require the trach tube to maintain adequate ventilation, the tube was removed.
Following the procedure she was maintained on oxygen via nasal canula which was slowly weaned as the lung distal to the site of the foreign body impaction re-expanded.
S/p chemo/radiation for tongue/laryngeal cancer: Speech and swallow evaluated patient and found no swallowing deficits.
PT deemed her appropriate for home discharge.
Secondary: History of laryngeal cancer with tracheostomy tube placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because part of the brush you were using to clean your tracheostomy tube broke off and became lodged in your airway.
Once the brush was removed your lung opened up again and you no longer needed oxygen.
We discharged you home with no tracheostomy tube and plans to allow the stoma to heal.
Please do not make any changes to your medications and please keep your follow-up appointment with your primary care physician.
