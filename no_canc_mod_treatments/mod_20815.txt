Possible explanations include transient apical ballooning syndrome, MI with recanalized artery, focal myocarditis, coronary vasospasm.
Differential diagnoses for abnormal LV function in the setting of EKG changes and normal coronary arteries included acute coronary syndrome s/p spasm or s/p auto-lysis, eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, and Takotsubo Apical Ballooning Syndrome.
Given her history, presentation, and clinical findings, Tokotsubo Apical Ballooning Syndrome was thought to be most likely.
CAD - The patient received integrillin x 18 hours following catheterization.
Then she was started on heparin b/o low EF with wall motion abnormalities.
After echo was obtained, the patient was started on coumadin.
She was discharged with INR 1.0, on Lovenox to bridge her to oral anticoagulation until her INR will become therapeutic.
She will continue Coumadin 5 mg po qhs and she was given prescription for INR check to be done in 3 days.
Lovenox teaching was done prior to the patient's discharge.
She should remain on oral anticoagulation for at least 2 months depending on improvement of LV function with goal INR 2.0-3.0.
The duration of her anticoagulation therapy will be decided by her cardiologist.
The patient was also started on aspirin, low dose beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor that were titrated up as BP and HR tolerated.
Prior to discharge, the patient's beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were changed to longer acting once-a-day formulations.
Echocardiogram was done on HD #3 and revealed EF 45%.
TSH, iron studies, and [**Doctor First Name **] were checked and were all within normal limits.
The patient was started on the Ace inhibitor and beta-blocker.
Sinusitis - the patient was continued on her outpatient regiment of prednisone 5 mg po 3x/week.
The possibility of adrenal insufficiency was entertained in the patient presenting with hypotension, but was felt to be unlikely with small doses of steroids and every other day dosing.
