HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old male with a history of hypertension and colon cancer status post hemicolectomy who is status post a nine foot fall from the cab of his truck on [**2188-10-2**].
The pain was controlled there with percocet and he was cleared by Physical Therapy for discharge home with a creatinine of 2.4 at discharge.
Given the patient's white blood cell count elevation, infiltrate and hypoxia, he was given one gram of ceftriaxone, aspirin for positive cardiac enzymes and morphine sulfate for pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.
The patient received in the Emergency Department aspirin, Flagyl and further morphine sulfate for pain.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy in [**2175**].
Accupril 40 mg q. day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs with temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure 122/65; pulse 102; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 84% on room air and increased to 97 to 100% on a nonrebreather.
Ecchymoses are present over the left anterior chest wall and he is tender to palpation on the left side of his chest.
Two plus dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.
The patient was begun on antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia and was placed on aspirin, beta blockers, given the elevated cardiac enzymes on admission.
The patient's O2 saturations initially stabilized on therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia and the patient was transferred to the Floor.
The patient was bolused with a total of two liters of normal saline with improvement of his systolic blood pressure to 100 to 105 and the patient was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
On readmission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he had an O2 saturation of 80% on six liters via nasal cannula.
The patient demonstrated increasing agitation and required 50 mg of Haldol for sedation.
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix with improvement of his respiration.
He was continued on a 14 day course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's respirations further improved with chest PT and he was transitioned back to nasal cannula and finally room air.
The patient was monitored on Telemetry and was noted to undergo atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140 on the [**10-10**] with V4 through V6 ST depressions of 1 mm.
He was anti-coagulated with heparin for prophylaxis of his atrial fibrillation.
The patient was initially taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on the [**10-23**], but was unable to undergo the procedure at that time secondary to mental status changes and the cardiac catheterization was deferred to a later date.
The patient was noted to have intermittent episodes of hypotension during subsequent hospitalization and his beta blockers and ACE inhibitor doses were titrated.
The patient's change in mental status were characterized by confusion that appeared to have a temporal component to it, with confusion occurring at its greatest at night time.
He required intermittent Haldol for sedation.
The patient was begun on Levothyroxine at 12.5 micrograms per day.
