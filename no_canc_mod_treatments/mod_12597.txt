HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where she was further loaded with Dilantin and phenobarbital and her Keppra dosages were adjusted and her status epilepticus was aborted.
Cultures were sent and the patient was started on the usual Intensive Care Unit measures including central venous access and arterial line for continues blood pressure monitoring.
After several liters of normal saline bolus, Ms. [**Known lastname **] improved clinically and her blood pressure responded appropriately.
At this time all of her antibiotics were discontinued and she was started on a fourteen day course of Ceftazidime.
With regard to her seizures as they were broken in the Intensive Care Unit with adjustments of her antiepileptic medications.
She was given intermittent phenytoin and phenobarbital.
Three or four days subsequently she developed facial twitches, which is consistent with epilepsia partialis continua and therefore her medications were adjusted accordingly.
Currently she is continued on phenobarbital 60 mg per nasogastric t.i.d.
with phenytoin suspension 350 mg per nasogastric q 12 hours along with Kepra 1500 mg po b.i.d.
Although it is possible to increase her antiepileptic medications we anticipate that given the high drug levels, we would be approaching the toxic levels shortly.
She now only requires intermittent suctioning and has two more days of Ceftazidime.

The only caveat is any tracheostomy decannulation or change needs to be done in a monitored Intensive Care Unit.
