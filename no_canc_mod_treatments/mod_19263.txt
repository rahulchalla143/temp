Central Line was changed on Admission.
Triple lumen now in place with tip at atriocaval junction.
Synercid was discontinued with initial addition of Daptomycin to antibiotic regimen.
It was felt that these bile collections were too small to add an additional drain at that time.
ID was consulted for revision of the antibiotic regimen to include Amikacin, Colistin and Tigecycline for the Klebsiella and Posaconazole & Caspofungin for the [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Mucor.
He remained on Bactrim for post transplant prophylaxis.
LFTs increased and this was attributed to the antibiotics as liver duplex was stable and immunosuppression was such that rejection was unlikely.
On [**10-12**], he underwent successful CT-guided aspiration and catheter placement within a biloma/abscess in segment VI/VII secondary to inadvertent self removal of this drainage catheter.
J tube was also self removed when he was delerious during a febrile/hypotensive episode necessitating SICU management.
J tube was replace with a red rubber catheter without difficulty.
Tube feeds were continued and he was seen by nutrition during this hospitalization as well as PT.
ID recommended colistin as the last option and unfortunately he did not clear the bacteremia.
He was discharged on his transplant immunosuppression to prevent rejection which consisted of Rapamune 0.5mg qd via the J tube.
Bactrim was continued for PCP prophylaxis and [**Name9 (PRE) 8005**] for prevention of encephalopathy.
His abdominal pain was managed well with po dilaudid.
Three hepatic abscess drains remain in place to gravity drainage which do not require flushing.
