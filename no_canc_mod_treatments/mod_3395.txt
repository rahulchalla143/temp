Admission Date:  [**2172-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Norvasc / Morphine / Niacin / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right renal artery catheterization and stenting Right renal artery gelfoam embolization Temporary hemodialysis line placement Exploratory laparotamy Right hemicolectomy Intubation and mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old with DM2, HTN, HLD, extensive vasculopathy including CAD s/p RCA stent [**2161**], bifemoral disease s/p L common iliac stent x 2, aortic stent who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital for stenting of renal artery stenosis.
Due to concern for perinephric/RP bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was intubated, a dirty right femoral trauma line was placed, and she was maintained on pressors (ultimately requiring 3 pressors - dopamine, levo, and neo).
ACT was 150, and 10 of protamine was given.
She was taken to IR where 3 peripheral branches of the right renal artery was embolized, and a HD line was placed under sterile procedure in the RIJ.
Due to persistent hyperkalemia (K of 6.4) she was given calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose.
Several amps of bicarb were administered for persistent lactic acidosis (HCO3 ~18-19) with ABG 7.17/43/116/17.
Her BP was managed with labetalol 600 [**Hospital1 **], Isosorbide Mononitrate 90 mg QD, Hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lasix 80 mg QD.
While at [**Hospital1 **] they were able to diurese her and improve her respiratory status, but her renal function worsened from a baseline Cr of 2.4 to 3.8 on transfer.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Embolization Report: HT RENAL ANGIOGRAM AND GELFOAM EMBOLIZATION, FOLLOWED BY TEMPORARY HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT  INDICATION: 71-year-old woman with right renal arterial bleeding, status post right renal arterial stent.
SEDATION: General endotracheal anesthesia provided by the anesthesiologist.
Needle was exchanged for a 4.5 French microsheath.
Inner cannula and wire were removed to place a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire, which was advanced into the right subclavian artery.
Microsheath was removed to place a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 2493**]-Tip sheath.
After removing the inner cannula, the sidearm was aspirated and flushed, and arteriogram was performed to assess anatomy at the arteriotomy site.
A 5 French angled glide cath was placed over the wire and within the sheath and carefully negotiated into the upper abdominal aorta, and eventually into the proximal part of the right renal artery.
A Renegade STC microcatheter was then used to sequentially access the caudal branch of the interpolar artery, caudal branch of the lower polar branch and subsequently, a peripheral (fourth order) branch arising from the cranial branch of the interpolar artery to perform Gelfoam embolization to near stasis, with appropriate pre-embolization arteriograms from these branches via the microcatheter, and post-embolization arteriograms from the right renal artery via the main catheter.
At the end of the procedure, catheters, and subsequently sheath were removed.
Attention was now directed to temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were printed prior to and following needle placement.
Inner cannula and wire were removed to place short [**Doctor Last Name **] wire, which was advanced into the IVC.
After appropriate measurements, removal of the microsheath and sequential tract dilatation with 12- and 14-French dilators under fluoroscopy, 14 French 15 cm hemodialysis catheter was placed.
Catheter was confirmed under fluoroscopy to be in the lower SVC.
Abdominal aortic and right renal artery stents were also seen.
Incidental note of low-lying ET tube was made, and the anesthesiologist notified during the procedure.
Successful placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, with the tip in the distal SVC, ready to use.
Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopy guided placement of 14 French 15 cm hemodialysis catheter via the patent right internal jugular vein, and with its tip in the lower SVC.
# Hypovolemic Shock/Hemorrhage: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from an outside hospital for management of resistant hypertension which had resulted in an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
Following a successful stenting of a near 99% stensosis of the right renal artery, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive in the holding area .
The hypotension (to systolic BPs in the 40s) was accompanied by back pain, and given concern for a retroperitoneal/perinephric bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
ACT was 150, and 10 of protamine was given.
While in the catheterization lab, her SBPs again dropped, and levophed and neosynephrine were added.
Afterwards, she was emergently taken to the angiography suite where 3 peripheral branches of the right renal artery were embolized, and a HD line was placed under sterile procedure in the RIJ.
Following embolization of the three peripheral branches of the renal artery, hemostasis was able to be achieved, and pressors were weaned in the IR suite.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
A right colectomy was performed, and the abdominal cavity was remained open for possible re-exploration.
At this point, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was dependent on 4 pressors (neo, levo, dopa, and vaso), and a fifth (epinephrine) was added at 10am.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly hypoxemic following her initial hemorrhage.
She was intubated for airway protection following the initiation of the massive transfusion protocol.
It is likely that a component of ARDS occurred in the setting of the massively pro-inflammatory state caused by bowel ischemia given her profound hypoxemia PaO2 of 40 while on 100% FiO2 and high PEEP 15. .
Acidosis was managed with intermittent bicarbonate boluses of 50mEq as well as a bicarbonate drip and CVVH.
# ESRD: Given hyperkalemia to 6.1, profound acidemia, and volume overload, a temporary HD line was placed at the time of her renal artery embolization and CVVH was initiated on [**2172-3-31**] when she arrived to the CCU.
