He was given sublingual nitroglycerin which transiently brought his systolic blood pressure down to 82.
The growing concern at this point was sepsis from C.Dif colitis and he was prepared for exploratory laparotomy with plan for completion colectomy.
Briefly, a completion colectomy and end ileostomy were performed.
He returned to the ICU at 8pm intubated, sedated, on multiple pressors and oliguric.
He failed to improve following surgery and significant measures were taken overnight to maintain hemodynamics.
A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH was begun overnight.
It was becoming apparent that he was not able to compensate for this septic shock despite aggressive intervention.
His extended family came to the hospital early in the AM at which point a consensus decision was made to have him transitioned to comfort measures only.
