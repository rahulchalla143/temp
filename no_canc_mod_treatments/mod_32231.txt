He was taken to the operating room for right tube thoracostomy and washout, debridement open tibia wound to bone, arthrotomy with debridement of ankle, intramedullary nail tibia fracture and closed reduction of the humerus fracture with manipulation.
He was later started on Lovenox per orthopedics recommendation and will remain on this until discontinued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He did have periods of agitation and was started on Clonidine.
He also required transfusion with packed cells early during his stay for falling hematocrit and hemodynamic instability.
Spine surgery was consulted for his spine fractures, these were nonoperative.
He was difficult to wean from the ventilator and the decision was made to perform an open tracheostomy.
He was eventually weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to the regular nursing unit.
His tracheostomy was removed at bedside on [**2156-11-17**] without any difficulties.
Because of his injuries there were some pain control issues; he initially required IV narcotics and was later changed to Methadone and Oxycodone which appear to be controlling his pain adequately at this point.
He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and has been recommended for acute rehab following his hospital stay.
