The patient's hernia repair was complicated by a prolonged hospital stay with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tracheostomy and ultimately an enterocutaneous fistula, which was treated with multiple abdominal wound debridements and was definitively treated with an exploratory laparotomy with a small bowel patient's postoperative course was complicated by a deep venous thrombosis in which an IVC filter was placed.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left colectomy in [**2151**], ventral hernia repair after that.
Multiple abdominal debridements and eventually an exploratory laparotomy with a small bowel resection and hernia repair and an IVC filter placement.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zantac, Labetalol, Buspirone, Colace, Morphine and Simvastatin.
The patient continued to have gastrointestinal bleeding and was transfused 9 units of packed red blood cells as well as plasma and on [**2163-11-5**] underwent a bleeding scan, which demonstrated brisk positivity in the cecal region.
The patient was started on low dose intraarterial vasopressin and this resolved the bleeding and the patient's bleeding resolved over the course of the next twelve hours.
The patient was resuscitated with packed red blood cells and hemodynamically improved.
Secondary to the patient's history of abdominal surgeries and complicated surgical course, surgery was not chosen as a first line therapy, but secondary to his failure to progress with nonoperative management it was decided that an operative procedure would be the best course of action due to the danger of embolizing an end artery to the cecum.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy through the previous mesh incision and a partial right colectomy with a primary anastomosis was performed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was kept in the Intensive Care Unit and hemodynamically stabilized.
The patient had a nine beat run of ventricular tachycardia on postoperative day two, which was treated with electrolyte repletion.
A Cardiology consult was obtained and no requirement for intervention was necessary.
The patient was restarted on his preoperative medications with advance to a regular diet as he showed bowel function and on postoperative day five he was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit and no further bright red blood per rectum and no further ventricular ectopy by telemetry.
PROCEDURES:  Angiogram with intraarterial vasopressin delivery and right colectomy for cecal bleeding.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged in stable condition tolerating a regular diet on oral pain medication to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain, Zantac 150 mg po q day, Labetalol as previously dosed.
Buspirone, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
and Simvastatin per previous dosage.
