He presented to an OSH where he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with ST segment depressions V4-V6 on his initial EKG; his second troponin returned at 7.68.
He was treated with heparin gtt, eptifibatide gtt, ASA, metoprolol, and clopidogrel.
He also received furosemide IV for treatment of congestive heart failure with effective diuresis.

On [**2130-5-30**], Mr. [**Known lastname 106768**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels.
Amiodarone and coumadin were started given his preoperative atrial fibrillation.
He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery.
His drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol.
The [**Last Name (un) 387**] diabetes service was consulted for assistance with his diabetes medication management.
As his sugars were elevated, insulin was started.
Mr. [**Known lastname 106769**] INR was markedly elevated on postoperative day 5 and as he remained in normal sinus rhythm, it was decided to discontinue his coumadin and amiodarone.
Vitamin K was given with good effect.
Thus, an ace-inhibitor should be started as an outpatient given his low ejection fraction and preoperative myocardial infarction.
