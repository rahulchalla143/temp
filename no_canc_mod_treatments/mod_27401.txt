Admission Date:  [**2160-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Status epilepticus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation EEG   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] is an 18 year old boy with a history of Lafora body disease (a progressive myoclonic epilepsy), who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72801**] at [**Hospital3 1810**], and who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] ED where he presented with status epilepticus the morning of admission.
His anticonvulsant regimen consists of Keppra 2250 mg in the AM and 2500 mg in the PM, Depakote 750 mg TID, and Clobazam 10 mg at 8:30, 10 mg at 1 p.m., 15 mg at 8;30 p.m., and 20 mg at 10 p.m.  During the week prior to admission he has had increasing frequency of his generalized tonic clonic seizures, with four seizures on [**4-28**], three on [**4-29**], and one on [**4-30**].
On [**4-30**] his family called Dr.[**Name (NI) 72802**] office and his morning dose of Keppra was increased from [**2152**] mg to 2250 mg.
He was given 2 mg Ativan IV, then became hypoxemic with saturations in the 70's.
At 12:30 p.m. he was given another 2 mg of Ativan, and at 12:51 was loaded with phenobarbital [**2152**] mg.
There is some reference to an order for Cerebyx 1000 mg as well, but it is not documented if or when this medication was given.
He has never required intubation in the past.
He has been taking all of his medications as prescribed.
Speech is dysarthric and gait unstable at baseline, able to eat po but needs help with all ADL's including toileting, bathing, dressing.
Physical Exam: Exam on arrival T 99.8   HR 82   BP 115/70  RR 14 Pulse Ox 100% on RA General appearance:  18 year old boy intubated and sedated in NAD HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Normal positioned endotracheal tube and NG tube.
Generalized beta frequency activity seen is most likely due to medications such as benzodiazepines or barbituates.
He was placed on bedside EEG, which throughout his course has shown encephalopathy and intermittent spikes (most prominent in L frontocentral and R frontocentral, as well as polyspikes), but no electrographic seizures.
This is thought to be due to the sedating medications he has received at [**Hospital3 **] and here (the initial valium, ativan, phenobarbital, and dilantin, and now the keppra, depakote, and clobazam), compounded with the effects of his seizure on a brain with underlying disease.
On [**5-7**], his am and hs doses of clobazam were halved (for total daily dose of 40mg).
Hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia in the left lower lobe, for which he was started on zosyn and clindamycin on [**5-7**].
He required several IV fluid boluses for slightly lower BPs or decreased urine output.
