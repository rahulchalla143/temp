In the Emergency Room, the patient was given Vicodin, morphine, Ancef and oral Levaquin.
The left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to be 31% at that time with global hypokinesis and enlargement.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 complicated by chronic kidney disease (several episodes of acute renal failure, receiving dialysis at that time), neuropathy and retinopathy.
Right popliteal-dorsalis pedis bypass in [**2183**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Lipitor 40 mg p.o.q.d., metoprolol 100 mg p.o.b.i.d., NPH insulin 36 units q.a.m., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d., Neurontin.
Extremities:  Left lower extremity below the knee amputation, no erythema or edema, right lower extremity with erythema and edema extending above the knee, status post right number one and number two toe amputations, heel ulcer healing with no drainage, beginning of skin breakdown on right shin and right foot but no drainage and no cuts/ulcers/lesions.
He has remained afebrile while on levofloxacin and clindamycin.
He received hydrocodone 5 mg orally, cefazolin 1 gram, levofloxacin 500 mg, and intravenous morphine 2 mg.
The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service, where intravenous metronidazole was added, cefazolin was changed to vancomycin pending the MRSA screen.
An electrocardiogram showed 1 mm inferior and lateral ST depressions and his chest pain resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
That day, antibiotics were changed to intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam 3 grams every eight hours and intravenous vancomycin 1,000 mg every 24 hours.
Both of these antibiotics were continued through [**11-8**].
He had received a total of three units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit less than 30.
Secondary to increasing serum creatinine, Captopril was also discontinued on that day.
The patient had received Kayexalate per rectum for a potassium of 5.6.
The Renal Service suspected acute tubular necrosis and Lasix boluses and isosorbide mononitrate were discontinued.
He rapidly became hypoxic around 2:00 p.m. and eventually required a 10 liter face mask.
He was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia at that time and was treated with renally dosed levofloxacin and clindamycin.
He was continued on aspiration precautions with the head of bed greater than 45 degrees with frequent tracheal suctioning.
A nasogastric tube was continued to low intermittent wall suction to minimize gastric aspiration, although this is of unclear benefit.
The cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was felt not to be a candidate for cardiac catheterization as his renal dysfunction was prohibitive.
Vascular Surgery was re-consulted to assess the patient's right lower extremity for possible revascularization or amputation.
As the renal function improved, cardiology was re-contact[**Name (NI) **] and they felt that medical management would be indicated at this time.
