Admission Date:  [**2172-7-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-7-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-4-25**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery Service  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman who is a patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 47696**] who was transferred in from [**Hospital3 3583**] status post a myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
Status post cancer and radiation therapy to the mouth.
Left carotid endarterectomy in [**2170**].
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Synthroid 0.025 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Flonase 2 puffs as needed.
Xalatan eyedrops once per day.
On [**7-7**], he had ultrasounds done which showed a right internal carotid stenosis of 60% to 69%, a left internal carotid stenosis of less than 40%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Plavix was placed on hold.
On [**8-3**], he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft from obtuse marginal to diagonal.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was still in good position which had been placed.
The patient was placed on right heart bypass with cannulas in the right atrium and pulmonary artery going into the left pulmonary artery.
The patient was brought to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit with a right heart bypass cannulation in place.
He was on the following drips:  Amiodarone at 1, dobutamine at 2.5, epinephrine at 0.3, and Levophed at 0.8, lidocaine at 2, and pitressin at 0.2.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was at 1:1.
He was on an insulin drip also.
He remained fully on Swan-Ganz catheter and monitored with maximum pressors and inotropic support.
He was critically hypoxic with instructions to do no cardiopulmonary resuscitation but to defibrillate only.
In the operating room, the patient coded and was asystolic on the way out of the operating room and then went back to the operating room on bypass times three.
That was when the intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the right ventricular assist device was placed, as the right ventricular wall was not moving.
They recommended continuous venovenous hemofiltration for fluid removal and oxygenation to help improve it, but the patient was clearly hypoxic and had cardiogenic shock.
The left femoral venous dialysis was placed under sterile conditions in the Intensive Care Unit on [**7-8**] in preparation for continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
The patient was seen again the next morning by the Renal Service with the right ventricular assist device still in place and massive volume overload after DOR noted on maximal ventilatory support with acute renal failure secondary to the prolong hypertension.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells, and his positive end-expiratory pressure was increased.
The patient was on a Levophed drip, amiodarone drip, epinephrine drip, and Milrinone, as well as dobutamine drip, lidocaine drip, as well as pitressin drip.
The patient was continued on propofol sedation.
Lidocaine was decreased to 1.
The patient was continued on perioperative vancomycin.
Levofloxacin was also added in.
He was sedated and intubated with massive anasarca.
He remained on amiodarone drip at 0.5, lidocaine drip at 1, dobutamine drip at 2.5, epinephrine drip at 0.3, Levophed drip at 0.27, and Milrinone drip at 0.25, vasopressin drip at 0.08, Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.4, propofol drip at 20, insulin drip at 1, as well as perioperative antibiotics.
He was continued on his right ventricular assist device and his intra-aortic balloon pump with acute tubular necrosis and was requiring vasopressors and on inotropic support.
He continued with continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
He remained on all of his inotropic and vasopressor support.
He was continued on perioperative antibiotics.
He was seen by clinical Nutrition Service for a discussion of starting some parenteral nutrition, but the patient continued to decline and stopped responding to his drugs with any full measure.
