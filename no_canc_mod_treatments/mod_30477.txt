If you have any fevers you should call your doctor and have blood drawn for a CBC with differential because the methimazole can cause you to lose your white blood cells which protect you from infection.
Because you have atrial fibrillation, you will need to be on coumadin to prevent blood clots and strokes.
You will need to check a coumadin level (INR) frequently until we know how much coumadin you need to take.
Please see the teaching sheet about how to take coumadin and what medicines can interact with coumadin.
Methimazole: a medicine to decrease the amount of thyroid hormone 2.
Metoprolol succinate: to lower your heart rate 3.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for fatigue, dizziness, skin or appetite changes, fevers or other signs of infection.
