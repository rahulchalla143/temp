HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement times two, history of congestive heart failure who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in [**2153-3-26**] with respiratory distress.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He has had a prolonged course including difficulty weaning off of the ventilator, requiring tracheostomy, requiring a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
His percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was complicated by hematoma in his intra-abdominal area and it was also complicated by renal failure, necessitating dialysis as well as multiple aspiration pneumonias.
He was treated with Ceftazidime, Vancomycin and one dose of intravenous Gentamicin.
He was treated initially with Ceptaz, single coverage and then Levaquin was added to double cover for Enterobacter.
He was able to be weaned off of pressor support and eventually onto tracheostomy collar.
At the time of discharge, he was tolerating a trach collar for 12 hours during the day with resting pressor support [**10-30**] overnight.
The patient will complete a 14 day course of Ceptaz which will be completed on [**6-3**], as well as a seven day course of Levaquin which also be completed on [**6-3**] and the patient will continue to be weaned off of the ventilator, hopefully achieving trach collar 24 hours a day.
He was initially on pressors, however, we were able to wean off of the Levophed, and with broad-spectrum antibiotics his blood pressure improved and he is maintaining MAPs in the 50s and 60s off all of blood pressure medications.
Renal failure - The patient has become dialysis-dependent, receiving hemodialysis three times a week.
He will continue his hemodialysis three times a week.
He will receive Erythropoietin with dialysis per Renal recommendations.
Abdominal hematoma - The patient initially suffered a large abdominal hematoma in the setting of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and anticoagulation.
Mitral valve replacement/atrial fibrillation - The patient requires anticoagulation for prosthetic valve as well as atrial fibrillation.
Currently he is going to be discharged on Coumadin 3 mg.  Should his INR drop below 2.5 we need to restart heparin without a bolus.
Should his INR get above 3, Coumadin needs too be decreased because he has had large intra-abdominal bleeds in the setting of INR greater than 3.
Diabetes - The patient is tolerating tube feeds at goal and subsequently has required insulin requirement.
We are planning to discharge him on 24 units of Lantus in the evening, covering with regular insulin sliding scale with goal fingersticks in the 80 to 140 range.
Nutrition - The patient has been maintained on tube feeds, Nepro at full strength at 35 cc/hr, through his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Access - The patient will be discharged with a right PICC line and a left subclavian hemodialysis catheter.
Prophylaxis - The patient will be discharged on Coumadin and Lansoprazole proton pump inhibitor.
DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation where he will undergo further rehabilitation on the ventilator, hopefully coming off the ventilator full time as well as physical therapy as well as speech and swallow therapy to initiate feeding p.o.
