Cardiac Cath [**1-11**]: PTCA COMMENTS: The patient was emergently brought to the catheterization lab after undergoing cardiac arrest thrice at an outlying hospital and again en route to our facility.
Prior to proceeding with intervention a 40cc IABP was placed for hemodynamic support for during and post  procedure afterload reduction and diastolic augmentation via standard technique through the righ common femoral artery.
It was planned to treat the lesion with PTCA and stenting.
A 6FXB LAD 3.5 guide catheter provided optimal support.
The lesion was pre-dilated with a 2.0 x 12 Voyager balloon at low inflation and a Quick Cat extraction  catheter was then advanced across the lesion twice due to the presence of thrombus.
Patient left the lab on pressor support with Dopamine, IABP, intubated and responsive only to painful stimuli.
Succesful primary PTCA and stenting of the RLADwith aa 3.0 BMS with prior thrombectomy.
Post dilated with a 3.0 NC balloon.
One vessel coronary artery disease due to sub-acute stent thrombosis.
Successful thrombetomy and angioplasty of a totally occluded LAD with restoration of TIMI 3 flow.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - akinetic; mid anterior - akinetic; basal anteroseptal - akinetic; mid anteroseptal - akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
There is mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses, bilateral scattered ethmoid air cells and bilateral sphenoid air cells, possibly related to prior intubation or inflammatory process.
A density is seen along the course of the LAD, suggesting placement of prior stents.
# CV: CAD - Patient was transferred from OSH with STEMI, initially loaded with plavix, acquired Vfib arrest resulting in multiple rounds of CPR at OSH and enroute to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient transferred to cath lab emergently (see results) with stent/iabp placement, ECHO showing severe systolic dysfunction in anterior septal region, LAD territory.
Heparin was held post-cath for concern for UGI due to NGT lavage with coffee grounds in ED with small drop in hct.
On HD#3, pt transferred to cath lab emergently for ST elevations in anterior leads, found to have in-stent thrombosis, thrombectomy and PTCA performed, IABP replaced, heparin initiated, plavix loaded at 300mg, began 150mg qd.
Patient was continued on his aspirin, statin, and plavix (75mg [**Hospital1 **]) and also heparin drip over the course of his stay.
Two weeks post in-stent thrombosis, patient's heparin was bridged with coumadin, with plan for continued anticoagulation.
Patient should also be continued on Plavix 75 mg PO BID for a month and then uninterrupted for at least year and possible longer.
The course at that point should be discussed with patient's cardiologist.
Patient should continue his Lipitor 80 mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, Digoxin 0.625 QD, Metoprolol XL 50 mg QD, and Plavix 75 mg PO BID x 30 days and then 75 mg QD thereafer.
Patient's captopril 25 mg TID was also switched to Lisinopril 15 mg QD.
PUMP - patient found to have EF of 20% with anteroseptal/anterior/apical akinesis, was aggressively diuresed on 40 IV lasix and will be d/c on Lasix 20 PO along with spiranolactone.
RHYTHM - Patient initially found to be in wide complex tachycardia with VF arrest with subsequent afib/aflutter and most recently with NSR with PAC.
Patient's amiodarone was d/c due to concern for amiodarone toxicity and he was continued on digoxin.
# PULM: Patient's airway was initially preserved with intubation and ventilator assistance in the setting of his cardiac code.
As per history, no intrinsic pulm disease was found to be limiting his pulmonary functionality, RSBIs remained below 70 for days.
Patient was initiall treated for an aspiration pneumonia and then transitioned to treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia, see ID discussion.
Due to some blood tinged sputum two weeks into his hospital stay and abnormal findings on his chest  xray, a pulmonary consult was placed, with the recommendations to defer on bronchoscopy and following clinically.
Patient was subsequently diagnosed with MRSA ventilation associated pneumonia as confirmed by [**1-27**] sputum.
He was treated with 13 days of Vancomycin which was switched to Linezolid on [**1-30**] for a 7 day course.
Patient was also empirically covered with Meropenem which was stopped after 7 days after no gram negative organisms were identified.
Patient will require further Physical therapy, spirometry and gradual titration of his oxygen demand.
Amiodarone as offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has been discontinued.
# GI: On hosptial day 1, patient had coffee ground emesis on nasogastric suctioning, which prompted holding patient's heparin administration.
Protonix [**Hospital1 **] dosing was initiated.
While intubated, patient was given tube feeds when appropriate, initially with increased residuals, but then with improvement on an appropriate bowel regimen.
# ID: Patient acquired a leukocytosis early in his hospital course with a concurrent low grade temperature just below 100 degrees, save some intermittent spikes to 102.
Concern for aspiration pneumonia, patient was initiated on levofloxacin and flagyl treatment.
Patient's multiple sputum cultures returned as MRSA and patient was treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, concurrently with cefepime.
Due to woresning chest x-rays during his course, infiltrative findings in the RLL and LML, cefepime was changed to meropenem.
Patient was continued on vancomycin, then linezolid and short course of meropemen as above.
Patient continue to improve as far as short term memory and recall, with intermittent delusions which may have been due to his strokes and improving ICU psychosis.
Patient was treated with Zyprexa qHs and diazepam prn.
