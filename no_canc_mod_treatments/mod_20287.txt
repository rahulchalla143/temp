[**2199-6-26**] CT Head: 8mm left parietal hygroma, final read pending at time of discharge but imaging reviewed with neurosurgical attending     Brief Hospital Course: This ia a 72F admitted to Neurosurgery for monitoring.
A xray confirmed a right clavicle fracture and Ortho was consulted and no surgical intervention was required.
