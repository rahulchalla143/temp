Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related involutionary changes  XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2206-2-11**] 1:24 PM FINDINGS: A large-bore dual-lumen dialysis catheter from a right internal jugular approach is in stable and standard course and position.
The main portal vein, anterior right portal vein, posterior right portal vein and the left portal veins demonstrate normal appropriate directional flow and waveforms.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
This could possibly be related to chronic endotracheal tube placement.
Thickened bladder wall with trabeculations are suggestive of a more chronic process.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL SUMMARY: 62 yo male with history of HBV/HCV/EtOH cirrhosis with hepatic failure s/p liver [**Date Range **] on immunosuppression, ESRD on HD, seizure disorder, polymyositis on prednisone, recent STEMI ([**2205-12-5**]) on ASA/clopidogrel, recent large GI bleed [**1-8**] duodenal ulcer s/p clipping and injection, and recent admission for sepsis (d/c [**2206-1-30**]) admitted from rehab facility with altered mental status and elevated WBC count.
He then had an apparent generalised tonic clonic seizure after 45 minutes on dialysis [**2206-2-12**] which was proceeded by a 1 minute episode of VT at 200/min for which he was unresponsive and received 2 chest compressions before waking up.
Of note, he had a prior seizure disorder though no episodes since [**2200**]; he had been on oxcarbazepine as prophylaxis.
After he was noted to have seizure during HD on [**2206-2-12**], post-ictal state from unobserved seizure was also in the differential for his altered mental status on initial presentation.
Further work up was undertaken and included LP (initially unobtainable at bedside; patient was ultimately intubated for this and other procedures and LP was performed by IR; CSF was notable only for elevated protein to 178; cultures were negative), MRI (which revealed multiple embolic infarcts as per report above); EEG (consistent with encephalopathy, no seizure activity documented); and CT scan to evaluate area of hyperdensity in occipital lobe concerning for progression of old bleed.
He was evaluated by the neurology consult service and oxcarbazepine was stopped, Keppra was started (dialysis protocol dosing).
Tacrolimus toxicity/PRES was considered as a possible etiology of symptoms, but MRI was not consistent with that diagnosis (instead revealed embolic strokes).
Tacrolimus was initially held in this setting but restarted at lower dose on [**2206-2-19**].
He was initially placed on heparin gtt where he was frequently supratherapeutic given his ESRD; this was stopped in the setting of Hct to 27 (from 40 on admission) and concern for expansion of old/subacute bleed in occipital region on imaging.
He was continued on his home aspirin/Plavix and was started on heparin gtt shortly thereafter, though this was cheifly for treatment of his embolic strokes.
Lactate was elevated to 8 and central venous O2 sat was as low as 32%.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn, pancultured, and started on pressors for pressure support.
He was changed from prednisone to stress-dose hydrocortisone for 3 days.
A CVL and an A-line were placed for monitoring; due to extreme difficulty with line placement, the A-line was placed by the general surgery team.
The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (initially including ampicillin and acyclovir for potential meningitis organisms) later narrowed to vancomycin for planned 10 day course.
Beta-D-glucan and galactomannan were negative.
He remained intubated until his blood pressures recovered.
He then failed SBT for two days as he was unable to be weaned from pressure support.
Ultrasound of the arm was notable for brachial/axillary non-occlusive DVT.
He had been anticoagulated for several days on heparin gtt for embolic stroke, but anticoagulation was held over concern for possible enlarging area of bleed in occipital region on head CT.  # ELEVATED LFTs, S/P LIVER [**Date Range **]: [**Date Range 1326**] was in [**2194**] and patient has generally done well since that time (initially for HBV, HCV, ETOH cirrhosis).
The patient was initially started on lactulose but this was held when he developed diarrhea (C. difficile negative) as hepatic cause of his encephalopathy was felt less likely given his laboratory profile.
Atorvastatin and Effexor were held during this admission.
He was continued on Cellcept and steroids throughout this admission, though tacrolimus was held from [**2206-2-12**] through [**2206-2-19**] given possibility of contribution to his neurologic presentation.
Patient was continued on prednisone 25 mg PO daily except for 3 days during which he was placed on stress-dose steroids for hypotension.
He was continued on Bactrim prophylaxis.
Renal failure thought possibly due to tacrolimus toxicity, but tacro was restarted on HD.
His Effexor and Ritalin were held during this admission.
# DIABETES MELLITUS: He was treated with a HISS while in house.
# NUTRITION: During intubation, an OGT was placed and the patient was started on tube feeds.
NGT was placed prior to extubation to continue medications and tube feeds as the patient was speaking and moving his mouth very little.
After several discussions between the patient's wife and his primary hepatologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], the decision was made to transition the patient to comfort measures only.
NG tube was removed and tube feeds were discontinued.
All medications except those geared towards comfort - morphine, zyprexa, tylenol, prochlorperazine - were discontinued.
The decision was made to not proceed with dialysis and dialysis catheter was removed.
Hospice care came to evaluated the patient and he was discharged to an inpatient hospice facility.
