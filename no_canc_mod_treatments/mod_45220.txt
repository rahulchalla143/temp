In brief, this is a 48 year old lady with a history of hepatitis C, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis who was initially transferred from [**Hospital1 328**] to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 536**] for respiratory failure status post intubation for community-acquired pneumonia, status post cardiac arrest secondary to tension pneumothorax in the form of a PEA arrest.
The patient's Dilantin and Trilafon were stopped as it was felt that this was likely clouding her picture.
After these anti-seizure medications were stopped, the patient's Neurological status decompensated and the patient became less responsive.
On [**2-1**], given the patient's lack of neurological improvement and decline after stopping the anti-seizure medications, this was discussed with Neurology and it was felt that the patient would benefit from an EEG and initiation of a new anti-seizure medication.
The patient was started on Keppra, 500 mg twice a day, and Ativan 0.5 mg twice a day and an EEG was performed the day after these medications were initiated.
The day after these medications were initiated, the patient showed marked improvement and has continued to improve from her neurological standpoint.
The patient's tube feeds were held on [**2-1**], and the patient's pancreatic enzymes were followed and decreased to less than 100.
The patient's tube feeds were re-initiated on [**2-3**]; the patient's Ativan is being weaned off and the patient will continue on Keppra 500 mg twice a day as this is contributing to her significant neurological improvement.
The patient is still awaiting a Rehabilitation bed and will be doing to rehabilitation once a bed is available.
Of note, the patient finished her course of levofloxacin for her Legionella and since her defervescence after the Dilantin was stopped the patient has not exhibited any signs of infection.
The patient has been taken off her Dilantin and Trilafon therapy.
The patient was started on Keppra 500 mg twice a day.
The patient finished her course of Levofloxacin and is not requiring any further antibiotic therapy.
