CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: 3-vessel CABG in [**2157**] at the [**Hospital1 756**] -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2157**] and [**2163**] -PACING/ICD: Placed in [**2163-5-12**] for NSVT and sick sinus syndrome 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% (TTE in [**2163**]) CRI with ARF in [**2163**] requiring 2 sessions of HD (baseline Cr 1.2) Retinopathy Hypothyroidism Cataract disease Gout Rubeosis iritis Carotid stenosis Insomnia Cholelithiasis Anemia Syncope   Social History: The patient lives with her husband.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**], DM2, SSS s/p PM/ICD placement in [**2163-6-11**] and dilated cardiomyopathy who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with fever and lethargy, found to have vegetations on AICD leads, Mitral valve and Tricuspid valvee and Enterococcal sepsis, was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-5**] where ICD leads were extracted and IV antibiotics were initiated for endocarditis.
She was started on vancomycin and ampicillin at the OSH.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-5**] for AICD lead extraction.
Prior to the procedure, her antibiotic regimen was switched to ampicillin/gentamicin upon learning the sensitivities of the organisms from the OSH culture.
With increased concern for embolization, she was monitored in the CCU, with continued airway protection with ET tube as well as central access with a subclavian line.
Due to post-procedure hypotension, her home anti-hypertensives were discontinued and she was maintained briefly on a dopamine gtt.
Post-procedure TTE confirmed the location of residual vegetations on tricuspid and mitral valves.
IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin/gentamicin was continued and planned for a total of 6 weeks.
Peak and trough levels of gentamicin were checked and therapeutic.
Her renal function was monitored closely during this time and worsening renal function prompted change from gentamycin to ceftriaxone.
PICC line was placed for continued Abx administration, her subclavian line was pulled after confirmation of this line placement.
Patient was seen by cardiac surgery who recommended repeating TTE after completion of Abx course for assessment of need for valve repair surgery.
She will need to have this ECHO done per her outpatient cardiologist and the report sent with pt to her appt with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient is discharged on continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for total 6 week course, last day [**2164-7-17**].
-- Continue on ampicillin and ceftriaxone for total of 6 weeks, last day [**2164-7-17**] .
Patient aggressively diuresised with Lasix ggt + daily Metalozone with good result.
Patient was continued on home digoxin, carvedilol.
Digoxin was decreased to three times a week because of renal function.
-- Monitor renal function, restart ACEi when renal function improves and stabilizes -- Diuretic regimen at time of discharge: held .
RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sick sinus syndrome, prompting the original placement EP study in [**2163**] which showed inducible polymorphic VT.  AICD was placed for primary prevention in the setting of depressed LV function (EF = 25-30%).
Patient will require continued telemetry monitoring while she is at rehab and at discharge per her outpatient cardiologist.
Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinin 1.2, trended up to peak of 2.4 in the setting of agressive duresis for heart failure and pulmonary edema.
Microscopy of the urine showed rare muddy-brown cast.Patient was also on gentamycin at the time, levels were theraputic but as contribution of gentamycin to ATN could not be ruled out this was switched to ceftriaxone.
Diuresis was held upon achievment of euvolemia, ACE-I was also held.
Elevated INR: Patient was not on anticoagulation on admission, but her INR was 3.0.
She was given vitamin K with good result, reversing her INR appropriately for her lead extraction procedure.
DM2: Patient takes Amaryl and janumet at home with 20 units of Glargine at hs, with last HbA1c > 7.
At time of transfer sugars were well controlled on Lantus 30 units QHS with supplemental ISS.
She was continued on her ASA 325mg and statin.
Hypothyroidism: She was continued on levothyroxine.
