Past Medical History: - Hypertension - osteoporosis, s/p total knee replacement in left knee several decades ago - history of heavy alcohol consumption - history of gout - questionable depression  Social History: Retired.
Stool ([**2141-9-19**]): FECAL CULTURE (Pending): -CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Pending): -FECAL CULTURE - R/O E.COLI 0157:H7 (Final [**2141-9-20**]): -NO E.COLI 0157:H7 FOUND.
Dilatation of the arch cannot be totally excluded and CTA could be performed to better evaluation.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound ([**2141-9-20**]): Pending  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old male with a PMH significant for hypertension, osteoporosis, gout, daily heavy alcohol use who presented with nausea and diarrhea for the last 3-4 weeks in the setting of long-term colchicine use, found to be in acute renal failure with hypotension that improved with IV hydration.
Continued daily heavy alcohol consumption and continued blood pressure medication intake in the setting of hypotension are also likely contributors to acute renal injury.
Patient was given over 5L of IVF in the ICU.
# Hypotension/tachycardia: Most likely cause was intravascular volume depletion as above, with decreased cardiac output given preload and stroke volume.
Given that his pressures remained stable, patient was initially started on diltiazem 180mg PO daily and clonidine 0.1mg PO daily.
Patient to be discharged on diltiazem 180mg PO daily, clonidine 0.1mg PO BID.
Colchicine medication has been held temporarily as patient does not appear to be having a gout flare-up currently.

Ciprofloxacin was initiated on [**2141-9-18**] with 250mg PO BID for planned 7 day course.
# Gout/Hyperuricemia: Colchicine stopped due to suspicion that this medication may have explained recent diarrhea episode.

Pain was treated with tylenol and codeine.
Patient will follow up with primary care physician in one week to consider reinitiation of medications at that time.
Free water deficit was calculated and patient was encouraged to take PO fluids for self-correction.
# Tortuosity on CXR: Per radiology, mediastinum widened mainly due to tortuous and elongated aorta.
Dilation of the arch cannot be totally excluded and CTA could be performed for better evaluation.
