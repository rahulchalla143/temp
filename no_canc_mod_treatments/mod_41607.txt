AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information section).
Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical spray.
Conclusions The ascending aorta tube graft appears abnormal.
There is dehiscence of the proximal aortic graft/valve apparatus with the intervalvular fibrosa, with a false lumen in communication with the left ventricular outflow tract.
The distal anastomosis of the aortic graft appears normal.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
IMPRESSION: Dehiscence of the composite aortic root valved conduit with an extensive aortic root abscess, as described above.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.

[**2125-12-4**] Conclusions No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion.
Extensive destruction of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with multiple sites of perforation and secondary severe, eccentric mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old male s/p Bentall(29 StJude mechanical Aortic valve graft) on [**2125-9-13**] with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was admitted for presumed endocarditis and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed, numerous times, with Mr.[**Known lastname 30380**] and his family, that he is presenting for a very high risk undertaking of reoperative root most likely with the homograft in the setting of fresh embolic strokes seen on CT scan and an inadequately treated fungal infection.
On [**2125-11-5**] Mr.[**Known lastname 30380**] was taken to the operating room and underwent Redo sternotomy and redo Bentall procedure and ascending aortic and hemi-arch replacement under deep hypothermic arrest with a 25 mm homograft and a 28 mm Gelweave tube graft.
Please see operative report for further surgical details.
He was transferred to the CVICU intubated, sedated, requiring multiple pressors and inotropic support to augment his cardiac function.
Postoperative bleeding occurred and aggressive resuscitation with multiple blood products ensued.
Vascular surgery reevaluated.
Vascular performed a fasciotomy on the right lower extremity, with wound vac placed.
The following day his hemodynamics allowed for weaning off of inotropic support.
The heart size was small enough for chest closure to be accomplished.
Postoperatively he developed persistent heart block with nonfunctional epicardial pacing wires after his redo Bentall/aortic homograft procedure.
Despite his weaning off pressors with a stable heart rate in the 50s, his EKGs suggest an escape focus with alternating conduction down the anterior and posterior fascicles.
EP was consulted and it was felt that he will eventually require a permanent pacemaker, but still being critically ill and actively being treated for fungemia, a pacemaker implantation would be premature at this time.
EP therefore placed a temporary pacemaker with the use of a temporary screw-in lead.
Flagyl was added to his antibiotic regimen, ID continued to follow.
IV Heparin continued and his result was HIT negative.
Please see operative report for further surgical details.
Please see operative report for further surgical details.
All lines were changed and he was given a line 'holiday'.
All lines were changed in IR.
A repeat TEE was done which revealed: Interval development of cavitary space surrounding the bioprosthetic aortic root and aortic graft compared with post bypass images obtained intraoperatively.
He had another leg debridement on [**11-27**] and had a tunnelled HD line and PICC placed on [**11-29**].
He also received large amounts of bicarb and volume.
Pressors were discontinued and ventillatory settings minimized.
