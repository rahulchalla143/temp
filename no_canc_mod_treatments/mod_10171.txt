The patient was discharged from his stay on a four drug TB regimen, HAART including Trizivir and Abacavir and Coumadin for left iliac deep vein thrombosis, prednisone 20 for a paradoxical reaction.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  INH 300 mg, rifabutin 300 mg, pyrazinamide 15 mg/kg/day, ethambutol 50 mg/kg/day, Trizivir 1 tablet po b.i.d., Nevirapine 200 mg a day, prednisone 20 mg a day, Bactrim DS every day and Coumadin 7.5 mg a day.
Culture of a catheter tip showed coagulase negative Staph.
Brucella abortus antibodies were negative.
It was felt that his fevers may be due to Abacavir sensitivity and Abacavir was stopped.
Tenofovir was started at that time.
A work-up was done including multiple cultures and imaging without any source of fever ever identified.
The Infectious Disease Team opted not to drain at this time.
The patient was treated for a urinary tract infection with levofloxacin for three days.
The patient was continued on antiretrovirals and TB regimen while here.
Several days prior to his discharge, he was put on two drug TB regimen and HAART was changed.
Please see discharge medications for HAART regimen.
The patient received aerosolized pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was started on heparin and discontinued on Coumadin in anticipation of her renal biopsy.
An nasogastric tube was dropped and after several lavages became clear.
The patient then became hypotensive, received several units of blood and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Renal consult was obtained and biopsy was eventually deferred since her creatinine went down to 1.2, although, this was felt most likely to be a drug reaction due to Tenofovir.
Bactrim was stopped due to possibly causing the increased creatinine as was Tenofovir.
Stavudine was started instead.
The patient was started on G-CSF with a good response.
