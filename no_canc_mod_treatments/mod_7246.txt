The patient has been managed on an outpatient basis with a VAC dressing and has been discharged to rehabilitation prior to this admission.
His abdomen was noted to have a wound VAC dressing in place; otherwise, it was soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this point the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] and was continued on his prior medications from a recent discharge medicine list and his VAC was placed to continuous suction.
The patient was on vancomycin during this time one gram q.
The plan at this time was to have Plastic Surgery to see the patient to evaluate a possible wound flap to cover the exposed graft.
Was voiding without complaint and the service was waiting for Plastic Surgery evaluation at this time for potential wound flap coverage.
The patient was given nutritional supplements with meals, Boost three times a day, and on [**2145-6-30**], the patient was visited by the Plastic Surgery service.
The patient received 5 mg of intravenous push Lopressor.
Electrolytes and blood cultures were sent and Foley catheter was inserted.
A second dose of intravenous Lopressor was given and his blood pressure was 206/90 at this point, heart rate of 137 and at this point 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor was hung and 10 mg was pushed.
A central venous line was also placed at this point without complications with the patient having insufficient peripheral access for the purpose of ABG drawing, hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient at this point was on metoprolol on hydralazine 25 mg q.
The patient was placed on nonrebreathable oxygen mask.
On the same day Plastic Surgery saw the patient and recommended that patient would likely benefit from right gracilis flap to protect and cover the open wound with kidney graft exposed.
The patient was then consulted to see Cardiology after this bout of respiratory distress and sinus tachycardia who recommended tighter blood pressure control and metoprolol was thus restarted at a dose of 150 mg p.o.
and aspirin was continued 325 mg q. day.
The patient continued to progress well during his hospital stay, was afebrile and without complaint and at this point was awaiting possible of Plastic Surgery flap closure for his open wound.
The patient was also followed by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy who suggested that the patient would likely benefit from a stint in rehabilitation before being discharged to home and, upon learning that the patient would not be able to be scheduled for plastic surgery closure until the following week, likely to occur on [**7-20**] or 4th of [**2144**], it was determined that the patient could be discharged to rehabilitation on the wound VAC.
