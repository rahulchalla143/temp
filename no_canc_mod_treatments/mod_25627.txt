Following a surgical workup she was brought to the operating room on [**9-14**] for off pump coronary bypass grafting x3.
Urgent off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x3, left   internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal and obtuse marginal artery.
Plan was to do coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair, but intraoperatively a transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated severe aortic disease and on opening the pericardium the aorta was found to be heavily calcified and hence decision was made to proceed with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and leave the mitral valve alone given her high risk for stroke.
She tolerated the operation well and post-operatively was brought to the cardiac surgery ICU for recovery.
She remained sedated through the operative day and on the morning of POD1 sedation was stopped and she was extubated.
All tubes lines and drains were remover per cardiac surgery protocol.
The decision was made that she would benefit from a stay at rehabilitation and on POD # 4 she was discharged to rehab at [**Hospital3 12564**] in [**Hospital1 3597**],NH.
