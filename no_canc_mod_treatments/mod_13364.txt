1-hour neuro checks.
On [**2140-12-19**] she had a central line placed in order to monitor a CVP in preparation for prophylaxis against vasospasm.
She was started on sodium tablets.
Her CVP remained low, and so her IV sugars were increased to 150 cc an hour.
On [**12-23**] she underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram which showed stable coil appearance of her P-comm aneurysm ad no vasospasm noted.
She continued to spike the fevers as of the [**12-24**], and her Dilantin was switched to Keppra in thoughts that it could possibly be a drug fever.
She was placed on Haldol and Fentanyl, which seemed to improve her situation and she was given a sitter for safety measures.

Her drainage was decreased to 10 cc on the 27th and to 5 cc an hour on the 28th.
She tolerated a decrease in CSF output well and remained neurologically intact and awake, alert.
She continues on aggressive IV therapy, though they were decreased down to 100 cc on her transfer and continued on Namodipine.
She was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy while in the Neuro step-down unit, who felt she ambulated well and was safe to be discharged as long as she had 24-hour care at home.
Her lumbar drain was discontinued on [**1-3**], and on [**1-4**] she underwent a lumbar puncture which showed an opening pressure of 13.
