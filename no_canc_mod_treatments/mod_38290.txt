You were in the intensive care unit to monitor you closely and for a temporary pacing wire which has been removed.
You are recovering from the procedure well and an echocardiogram shows that the valve is working well and the pressures inside your heart are lower which is beneficial to your heart.
Stop taking Aggrenox 2.
Start taking Aspirin and Plavix to keep the valve free of blood clots.
You will take these medicines for at least 2 months.
