The infant was delivered by Cesarean section under epidural and spinal anesthesia.
Due to the respiratory distress in the delivery room, the infant was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further management.
He was started on nasal cannula oxygen.
An ABG was done on admission with oxygen at 100% to rule out any cardiac anomalies.
The infant was transferred to nasal prong C-Pap due to worsening respiratory distress on the newborn day.
Respiratory symptoms continued to worsen over the next couple of days and on day of life 1, the infant was intubated and received 2 doses of surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome.
The chest x-ray at that time had worsened to atelectasis and surfactant deficiency.
The infant extubated from the ventilator on day of life 3 to nasal cannula.
The nasal cannula was subsequently weaned off on day of life 7 and the infant weaned to room air for a brief period of time but required reinitiation of nasal cannula shortly thereafter for desaturations.
The infant again slowly weaned off nasal cannula and most recent need for nasal cannula was on [**2142-6-4**] at 11 a.m. for a brief period of time with feeds.
Cardiovascular:  The infant was given normal saline bolus x1 on admission to the NICU for poor peripheral perfusion which improved.
The infant was noted to have a 2/6 systolic murmur on the day of discharge, but is well perfused with normal pulses, normal blood pressure, normal heart rate and rhythm.
Screening cardiac investigations including hyperoxia test, EKG, chest radiograph and 4-extremity blood pressure were negative and cardiology consultation suggested that this was likely a benign finding.
Enteral feedings were initiated on day of life 3 and advanced quickly by ad lib p.o.
feeding well, breast milk or Similac 20 with iron or breast feeding, taking all feedings by mouth and showing steady weight gain.
The infant has required no phototherapy treatment.
Hematology:  No blood typing has been done on this infant.
The infant received a total of 72 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin which were discontinued on day of life 3 when the clinical status normalized and the blood culture had remained stable up to that point in time.
feedings of breast feeding or breast milk with supplemental Similac 20 with iron as needed.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  The infant received hepatitis B vaccine on [**2142-5-28**].
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the Fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
