He was given an albuterol neb without improvement.
INR was 3.8 on coumadin which was held today.
He was given tylenol for fever.
Past Medical History: - Bilateral PEs on coumadin (diagnosed [**2176-11-25**]) -Subarchnoid hemorrhage [**1-17**] aneurysm and s/p VP shunt placement,  tracheostomy and PEG placement -Hyptertension -Hyperlipidemia -TIA -?

A right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter terminates within the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, unchanged in position in comparison to [**2176-11-27**] examination.
Unchanged ventriculomegaly with a right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter.
CT Chest [**2176-12-8**] TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the chest were obtained prior to and following the uneventful administration of 100 cc of intravenous contrast.
Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed at 2-mm slice thickness.
The patient is status post tracheostomy (2:28).
There is persistent moderate right basilar atelectasis with air bronchograms (3:56, 58); an early consolidation in this region cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 84M with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p coiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG ([**Date range (1) 91301**]), and bilateral PEs (12/12-15/11) presenting from rehab with tachypnea and found to have pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
He was initially started on vanco, cefepime and levofloxacin (day 1=[**12-9**]).
Levofloxacin was stopped [**12-10**], and he will be continued on vancomycin and cefepime through PICC line for total 8 day course, through [**2176-12-17**].
PICC line can be d/c'd once IV antibiotics are completed.
(Of note, only received 1 dose of levofloxacin due to low suspicion for resistant GNR infection.
If pt worsens after discharge would recommend restarting levofloxacin for double coverage.)
# Multiple Pulmonary Emboli: Patient had RUL,RLL, LUL and left lingula lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli at last hospitalization 12/12-19/11 and was started on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
Elevated INR likely related to metronidazole and levofloxacin use.
He was restarted on warfarin dose 2.5mg on [**2176-12-11**], and his INR on discharge was 2.3.
# C. diff: Diagnosed [**12-2**] at rehab and started on oral metronidazole which was continued during this admission.
He should continue metronidazole 500mg Q8 hours until 2 weeks after completion of IV antibiotics for HCAP (until [**1-1**]).
His losartan was held during hospitalization and should be restarted on discharge.
Foley was placed during admission [**10/2176**], and family understands the benefit in setting of sacral ulcers.
He was treated with vancomycin and cefepime as above for pneumonia.
Chronic Issues: # Hx SAH: Patient was admitted on [**10-28**] w SAH and IVH now s/p ACOM coiling, VP shunt placement, tracheostomy and PEG placement.
# Hypertension: Pt's home losartan held during hospitalization for ARF, should be restarted on discharge.
Transitional issues: - INR should be monitored closely while on metronidazole (was supratherapeutic on admission and warfarin held, restarted [**12-11**]) - Would recheck WBC if respiratory status worsens, if increasing consider restarting levofloxacin - Should continue IV vanc/cefepime until [**12-18**], can d/c PICC once antibiotic course complete - Should continue PO metronidazole until 2 weeks after completing IV antibiotics for c diff infection - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) will contact patient as outpatient with results of MRI.

You were started on IV antibiotics, which you should continue at your rehab facility until [**12-18**].
You were also started on an oral antibiotic (metronidazole) for an intestinal infection called C diff.
You should continue to take metronidazole until 2 weeks after you complete your IV antibiotics for pneumonia.
While you were here, your INR was elevated so your coumadin was held.
You were restarted on your coumadin at 2.5 mg by mouth daily.
You had an MRI of your brain, and you will hear from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] within the next few days regarding these results.
