She ultimately was scheduled for an exercise treadmill test that was positive, which led to a cardiac catheterization prior to this admission showing 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery and a tight proximal left anterior descending coronary artery lesion with a normal ejection fraction in the order of 50 to 70%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a subtotal gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma in [**2158**] leaving her B-12 deficient and therefore requires B-12 injections.
PREVIOUS SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the gastrectomy five years ago as well as a bunionectomy.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin for which she gets a rash and hives.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol 200 mg po b.i.d., Zestril 2.5 mg po q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, B-12 injections, 1000 micrograms po q day, Alphagan one drop OU b.i.d., Travatan one drop OU b.i.d.
as well as a multi-vitamin and calcium supplement.
She therefore was evaluated and admitted on [**2165-11-4**] for an elective coronary artery bypass graft with the presumptive diagnosis of asymptomatic coronary artery disease with left main lesion.
On [**2165-11-4**] she went to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three including grafts to the left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the oblique marginal as well as saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
She had a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular wires were present as well a two atrial wires, two mediastinal tubes as well as one left pleural chest tube were also present.
She was on Propofol drip for sedation with 20 mics per kilo per minute and she was noted to be in sinus rhythm.
She was not being given any pressure support except for volume.
Her Lasix and Lopresor was subsequently held.
She was started on aspirin and a cardiac diet was also started.
Her chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the floor by postop day one.
She made a level four ambulation on her second attempt with physical therapy and she denied any significant pain.
Her wires were removed on postop day three.
She continued to work aggressively with physical therapy and was getting out of bed ad lib.

as well as she will continue her B-12 injections and multi vitamins as she had done preoperatively.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three, left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to oblique marginal and right coronary artery for significant left main disease and three vessel coronary artery disease, normal ejection fraction.
Total gastrectomy for carcinoma in [**2158**] with B-12 deficiency.
