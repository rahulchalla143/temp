Per notes she had a CT scan of her left hip which was negative and was diagnosed with trochenteric bursitis and was sent home with vicodin and physical therapy.
Since that time she has been complaining of worsening left hip pain despite treatment with vicodin.
She received two liters of normal saline with improvement in her blood pressure as well as morphine for pain.

She was also started on IV nafcillin, however she developed persistent fevers, rash across her sternum and renal failure which raised concern for AIN.
She had received about 3 weeks of nafcillin before it was changed to IV vancomycin given the above concerns.
She should continue IV vancomycin until [**2175-12-20**] to complete the six week course of antibiotics.
Surveillance cultures were drawn following initiation of antibiotics and these were negative; she was also afebrile after the above procedures were complete.
Received fluids perioperatively and has led to volume overload grossly (especially noted in upper extremities, lower extremities, abdomen).
Diuresis has been cautious given renal function, although in general she auto-diureses.
Rapid HCT drops should be evaluated and would require repeat imaging.
Depression/Anxiety/OCD:  She was continued on her fluoxetine and mirtazapine.
We also discontinued her trazadone and would encourage eventual discontinuation of her benzodiazepines as this can worsen her cognitive impairment.

Anasarca 7.
This bacteria infected several places in your body including parts of your spine (your thoracic/lumbar spine), your left hip, and your left knee.
For these reasons, we started you on antibiotics and surgically cleaned out your spine, hip and knee.
As a result, we changed your antibiotics from nafcillin to vancomycin.
You will need to be on these antiobitics for a long duration (6 weeks).
You started your antibiotics on [**11-6**], so you should continue to take them until [**2175-12-20**].
You have a special line placed (A Picc line) for the antibiotic to be given.
While you were here, you also developed a lot of swelling because you had a lot of fluid given to you around the time of your surgeries.
You did initially require blood transfusions for this, however over the past week you have not required any.
(2) Vancomycin - You should continue to take 1 gm IV once a day until [**2175-12-20**].
(5) Simethicone - You can take this as needed for the pain that you have from gas.
(6) Ranitidine - Take this daily to help protect your stomach from acid.
(8) Vitamin D - you should take this daily.
(9) Aspirin - You should take 81 mg instead of 325 mg because of your history of bleeding - high dose aspirin can make it worse.
We stopped the following medications and they should be held until your outpatient doctors feel that they can safely restart them: (1) We stopped your amlodipine and labetalol since they were dropping your blood pressures too low.
(2) Aspirin 325 mg: we changed this to 81 mg daily because we wanted to lower your bleeding risk since you had a hematoma.
(3) We stopped your ibuprofen because your kidneys have been slightly injured during your hospital stay: you should not continue this medicine while your kidneys recover.
You also have a follow up appointment with neurosurgery to follow up your back surgeries on [**1-2**] at 10:00 AM.
