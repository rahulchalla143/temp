History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 98929**] is a 60 year-old female with a history of CAD (2-vessel disease with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] placed to RCA in [**5-17**]), diabetes and hyperlipidemia who presented for cardiac cath and is now being transferred to the CCU for monitoring after laceration of her right external iliac artery.
In [**2119-5-13**] the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for inferior ischemia on stress testing and exertional chest discomfort.
She has not tried nitroglycerin as her symptoms have always resolved with rest.
Cardiolite imaging was notable for a dilated LV cavity at stress consistent with exercise associated LV dysfunction.
Two 3.0mm Cypher stent were placed.
1mg atropine was given, followedy by a dopamine drip.
She was taken to the OR for exploration of the groin and repair.
She was then admitted to the CCU with complaints of continued right groin pain ([**10-21**]) and right eye pain.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2119-6-1**] anatomy as follows: --LMCA: without flow limiting disease --LAD: mid 50% calcified LAD lesion --LCx: 40% stenosis before takeoff of the OM1 which was a moderate size vessel without flow limiting disease --RCA: stents were widely patent (three overlapping 2.5 mm Taxus  drug-eluting stents placed [**2119-5-26**]) --Acute marginal: TIMI 2 fast flow --R-PL totally obstructed at its origin, but had collaterals from the LAD.
--Ostial RCA calcified lesion of 60% was further investigated with RADI Pressurewire --FFR changed from 0.95 to 0.85 with maximal hyperemia using IV adenosine indicating a hemodynamically insignificant lesion.
Arthritis 5. s/p thyroidectomy with resulting hypothyroidism 6. s/p c-sections x3 7.
O2 sat 96% on ambient air.
There was no thyromegaly; scars from her prior thyroidectomy were noted.
Pulses: Right: DP and PT via doppler Left:  Carotid 2+  DP and PT via doppler  Pertinent Results: Coronary Cath ([**2120-9-26**]) COMMENTS: 1)  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid (3.0 x 13 mm) and ostial 3.0 x 18 mm cypher DES.
Chest X-Ray ([**2120-9-26**]) IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process with appropriately positioned central venous catheter and no pneumothorax.

She also became transiently hypotensive after the catheter sheath was pulled.
Right external iliac artery laceration: Now s/p suture repair.
Coronary artery disease: She underwent stent placement in her RCA (two Cypher stents).
She continued on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol and statin/zetia.
Her actos was held and discontinued on discharge due to its association with CHF.
Rhythm: She was in normal sinus rhythm without any significant events on telemetry monitoring during her CCU stay.
Diabetes: - Metformin was held and she was placed on an insulin sliding scale.
Metformin was added to her discharge medication list.
