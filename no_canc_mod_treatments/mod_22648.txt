Heme reviewed peripheral smear which did not reveal schistocytes and thought this to be secondary to drug reaction or ITP and advised to wait on transfusing plt, reverse INR, and start prednisone 50mg Daily."

While this may reflect underlying ampullary stenosis, differential diagnostic considerations for the dilated pancreatic duct includes main branch IPMT.
Aspirin and coumadin were held and the patient was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
He was seen by vascular surgery, who given his hemodynamic stability, felt that he should be managed conservatively.
The patient was transfused 2 units of pRBC on [**2102-7-11**] with an appropriate bump in Hct to 28.2.
The patient was started on prednisone 100 MG daily.
He received one unit of platelets on [**7-11**] with a bump in platelet levels to 91K.
He should taper off prednisone slowly under the care of a hematologist (being set-up at this time), with 60mg of prednisone daily for 2 weeks and decreasing slowly afterwards, in case this is ITP.
He recevied the pneumovax and meningococcal vaccines.
Per history from an outside surgeon, the patient was on coumadin for a presumed, acute occlusion of the left foot that led to ulcerations.
The coumadin was held in the ED, and the patient was given 4 units of FFP and was reversed with vitamin K (5MG).
Per discussion with outside surgeon, the coumadin was to be held until further evaluation for the need of anticoagulation.
