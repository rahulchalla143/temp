ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:08:10 PM Probable sinus rhythm with a sinusoidal [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] consistent with severe hyperkalemia or agonal rhythm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: In comparison with study of [**5-19**], the right chest tube has been removed.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2121-5-20**] 2:06 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier films of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the upper portion of the SVC.
The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
A right PICC terminates at the origin of the SVC.
Minimal left axis deviation with right bundle-branch block.
patient was receiving KDur supplements at [**Hospital1 **], however this still should not have been enough to cause her degree of hyperkalemia.
patient has been hypokalemic since admission, and has required K supplements.
During resuscitation patient had two lines placed which were non-sterile.
She was therefore given prophylactic vancomycin and aztreonam until the lines could be removed.
The lines were removed after two days, once her INR was reversed with IV vitamin K. She did not develop any ekg findings suggestive of hyperkalemia throughout her hospitalization.
# Fluid Status: Patient was total body fluid overloaded throughout her hospitalization, requiring IV lasix to improve urine output.
She was eventually transitioned to her home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily.
Her lasix dosing was increased to 80mg PO BID on [**5-26**], as she still had an oxygen requirement and was still reporting edematous extremities.
Anticoagulated w/ coumadin as outpatient given frequent AT with RVR.
This was treated with amiodarone, verapamil and increased doses of metoprolol.
Her coumadin was restarted, and eventually increased to 4mg PO daily, which is double her home dose, to be titrated according to INR goal [**3-16**].
had persistent leukocytosis at previous admission, s/p 10 day course with aztreonam and clinda, finished on [**2121-5-19**].
She was not started on another regimen of antibiotics during this admission after completing her previous 10 day course.
