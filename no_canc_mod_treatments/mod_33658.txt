Brief Hospital Course: Pt seen in emergency room after MVA and CT C spine with findings of C5-6 jumped facet and C6-7 perched facet.
In discussion with attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] it was decided that she would benefit from urgent decompression with C7 corpectomy with allograft and plate from an anterior approach.
She tolerated this procedure very well with no complications.
Post operatively she was transfered to the ICU for further care including q1 neurochecks and pain control with dilaudid PCA.
The pain management team was consulted for recommendations to change to PO pain medications given her history of IV drug abuse.
Pain medications were altered in attempt of achieving adequate control.
She was started on Levaquin PO for 7 days.
Her central line was removed, and the tip of the catheter was sent for cultures.
