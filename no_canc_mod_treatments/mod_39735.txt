ED course: Temp 97.1, BP 215/95, HR 72, Sat 99% on 2l, started on nipride drip, titrated to 2mcg/kg/min, BP improved to 177/91.
Past Medical History: - Type 1 diabetes - HIV (boosted atazanavir, lamivudine, stavudine), dx'd [**2096**] - ESRD on HD, planned change to peritoneal dialysis in near future, on transplant list (clinical study for HIV/solid organ transplant) - Recent hospitalizations for Serratia bacteremia (presumed source AV graft) most recently treated with 6 week course meropenem - History of schistosomiasis - Restless leg syndrome - Peripheral neuropathy on gabapentin - S/p cholecystectomy   Social History: Moved from [**Country 4812**] in [**2091**].
Pulm: crackles [**12-12**] way up b/l, no wheezes Abd: LLQ with PD catheter appears clean, although no dressing in place, soft, ND, ND, no HSM Ext: 2+ edema nonpitting b/l, 2+ distal pulses Neuro: CNs II-XII grossly intact.
Surgical clips are seen adjacent to the right crus of the diaphragm.
A right subclavian central venous catheter is seen with tip in the distal SVC.
# SOB and HTN: The patient presented to the ED with fluid overload and hypertensive urgency and was started on a nipride drip.
On transition to the inpatient setting he was converted to a labetalol drip to avoid buildup of cyanide biproducts while he awaited hemodialysis.
He was continued on labetalol drip to maintain SBP < 180 with 160 as target.
He also continued his outpatient regimen of 160 diovan [**Hospital1 **] and 50 atenolol QD.
Renal: The patient had recently transitioned from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis, which was apparently insufficient, resulting in fluid overload, hypertension and admission.
The patient was discharged with plans to resume hemodialysis at his previous hemodialysis center under the care of his outpatient nephrologist.
His next hemodialysis treatment was scheduled for Wed. [**4-17**].
Anemia: Continue epogen at HD.
The patient's non-con Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral wedge shaped opacity, and the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, given his relative immunosuppression and his recent hospitalization with full course of levofloxacin.
However, the lung was not entirely clear, and it was felt prudent to continue an [**7-19**] day course of IV antibiotics.
For this reason, the patient was dosed one gram of ceftazadine and one gram of vancomycin following his dialysis on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-15**] and he was written a prescription to receive one gram of vancomycin and one gram of ceftazadine after each of his dialysis sessions on [**4-17**] and [**4-19**].
Thus, the antibiotic course was planned as described above.
