The patient also denied dysuria, hematuria, flank pain, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, chest pain, or palpitations.
The patient then received labetalol 20 mg intravenously times two without resolution.
A Nipride drip was started, and the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood pressure under better control at 170/119.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair times three.
History of renal artery aneurysm; status post repair in [**2144**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy; status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Right hip fracture; status post open reduction/internal fixation.
Labetalol 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
For his hypertensive urgency, the patient was continued on the Nipride drip and remained stable.
For the likely small-bowel obstruction, the patient was to have a repeat abdominal computed tomography done with by mouth contrast.
Therefore, the patient was able to take orally the contrast material, and the option to place an nasogastric tube was deferred for the time being given that the patient had no nausea or vomiting.
Despite increase in oxygen requirements, the patient was placed on a nonrebreather and still had an oxygen saturation of approximately 89%.
However, during intubation after visualization of the vocal cords and placement of an endotracheal tube down the trachea copious gastric contents filled the endotracheal tube which was then removed and replaced by the covering attending without any complications.
However, on replacement of the endotracheal tube there was still a significant amount of gastric contents emanating from the endotracheal tube.
At that point, 2 mg of [**Year (4 digits) 104247**] and 60 mg of propofol were given.
The blood pressure, therefore, decreased to approximately 80 systolic which was corrected wit fluid boluses and some dopamine and discontinuation of the Nipride drip.
The endotracheal tube position was then confirmed by chest x-ray.
The patient's blood pressure continued to require pressors for blood pressure support.
For the aspiration pneumonitis, he was covered with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
For the respiratory failure, the patient was kept on an FIO2 of 100% and was requiring continuous positive end-expiratory pressure.
On hospital day three, despite the continuation of pressors, and antibiotics, as well as oxygen supplementation the patient succumb to the septic shock, actually via a cardiac arrest and deceased on hospital day three.
