The patient had been on a week-long binge of heroin and ethanol.
He was intubated and sedated but was moving all four extremities spontaneously.
A head computed tomography showed further blossoming of contusions, and a ventricular drain was placed on [**2139-12-14**].
On [**12-15**], the patient's intracranial pressure continued to climb and his hydrocephalus was worse despite ventricular drain placement.
The patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation of the subdural hematoma, the left frontotemporal hematoma, and craniectomy.
On [**12-19**], the patient was still intubated and was moving the left side spontaneously.
Currently on oxacillin for ventricular drain coverage.
The patient was on no other antibiotics at this point.
Levofloxacin was added for gram-negative blood cultures that were positive from [**12-18**] and gram-negative rods in his sputum.
On [**2139-12-22**], the patient had tracheotomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube performed without complications.
The cerebrospinal fluid continued to remain stable and without infection on the tracheostomy mask.
He was following commands on the left side, localizing in the right upper extremity.
Santalol was discontinued on [**2139-12-25**].
The patient was started on vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in his sputum, and oxacillin was discontinued.
He was following commands and was moving all extremities spontaneously and purposefully.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2140-1-9**] for cranioplasty and replacement of bone flap.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Postoperatively, the patient remained neurologically stable status post cranioplasty and status post bone flap replacement.
He tolerated that without any changes in his neurologic status, and his ventricular drain was eventually clamped and discontinued.
The ventricular drain was discontinued on [**2140-1-13**] along with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain that was in place.
His gastrojejunostomy tube had been removed.
His Foley catheter was out.
The patient's staples should be removed on postoperative day fourteen from his cranioplasty surgery incision (which was on [**2140-1-9**]).
