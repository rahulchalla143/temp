SOB [**1-10**] decompensated CHF given CXR showing worsening effusion and edema.
Infection was a less likely trigger given the absence of leukocytosis and hx of aztreonam and vancomycin prior to admission.
UCx and wound cultures were negative, though the patient presented with thick secretions.
PE less likely given anticoagulation with lovenox at rehab and absence of supportive hx.
On [**2126-7-3**], while actively being diuresed (on a lasix drip with metolazone), the patient had episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness (a code was called).
This was thought likely to be cause by a combination of hypotension, slight bradycardia and medications administered prior to the code (zofran and morphine).
Patient had persistent hypotension after the code and the patient was started on dopamine.
The patient briefly had an elevated oxygen requirement in the MICU, but was kept on aztreonam and vancomycin (as previously started by vascular team with indefinite time course).
However, the patient had subsequent fevers and metronidazole was started for concern for aspiration.
Of note, an ART line was placed while in the MICU for accurate measurement of BP and ABG.
Subsequently, her lisinopril and carvedilol were resumed.
The EP team did not recommend amiodarone at the present.
Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for >8 weeks on aztreonam and vanc for double coverage given e/o from OSH ([**Hospital1 1474**]) with wound cultures on [**2127-5-8**] positive for E. coli R to TMX-SMX, gentamicin, amp, cipro; Proteus R to tmx-smx, cipro, levo, cirpo, nitro; and MRSA R to cefazolin, oxacillin, clina, pen, erythro, confirmed with wound cultures from [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient was therapeutic on vancomycin as an inpatient, with troughs within range.
The goal is to continue with the IV Aztreonam and Vancomycin for indefinite duration.
Initially it was thought to be due to aspiration PNA--she was on Falgyl and completed 7 day course.
Also her PICC line was taken out on [**2127-7-8**].
A new PICC was placed on [**2127-7-11**].
Blood cultures grew coag neg staph from [**7-11**] from 1/2 bottles - likely contaminant given that she was already on Vanc which was therapeutic.
Urine cultures grew out yeast initially, with resolution after removal of the Foley catheter.
Gabapentin and tylenol were adequate for pain, with only low doses of morphine as needed, as narcotic effect was causing her somnolence.
This may also reflect a drug suppressive effect on bone marrow, but the rest of the CBC has been wnl.
Diabetes: insulin regimen was titrated and upon discharge, it was NPH 22U in am, 12U in pm; insulin SS beginning at 4U for FS 151-200mg, with increment of 2U for every +50mg.
Pulmonary: She had aspiration PNA as mentioned above and completed Flagyl course.
Incentive spirometry as well as chest PT and continued treatement with nebs were encouraged, and the patient's respiratory status improved to an oxygen requirement of 1-2L NC, with CPAP as needed at night.

We adjusted the following medications: we increased your insulin NPH does to 22U in the morning and 12U at night.
You are also on a sliding scale of insulin with meals, starting at 4U at a glucose>151, and increasing by increments of 2U for every 50mg glucose.
We added the following new medications:  Lisinopril, for protection against heart failure, and carvedilol and spironolactone to protect your heart.
We gave you gabapentin and morphine on an as needed basis for your pain.
Morphine must be used in very low doses as it may make you confused or drowsy.
You have an outpatient appointment with a cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Tuesday [**8-5**] at 3:20pm, where you will discuss options for medication called amiodarone, and use of a implanatable cardiac defibrillator vs. biventricular pacemaker to control your heart rhythm.
