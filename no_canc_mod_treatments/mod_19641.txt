[**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins was performed.
On arrival active patient medications included Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and sedation with Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Midazolam 4 mg/hr.
All other home medications were intially held.
Given suspicion for meningitis in the setting of seizure + fevers patient was given one dose of Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV with infectious disease consent required for further treatment.
Patient was initially seen on unit by Neurology who recommended continuation of Keppra, EEG to evaluate for seizure activity, ECHO for new murmur + fever, LP when INR < 1.5, and an increase in versed drip with consideration of dilantin load if patient seized again.
HD#2 ([**2131-8-3**]):  Patient received Tylenol for fever overnight and had ECHO and EEG in the morning.
Prior to admission patient had taken coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and on transfer to MICU initial INR was 2.5, patient was initially given 3 units of FFP with following INR=1.7.
He was also bolused with Dilantin 1000 mg IV once since patient was also displaying tremor in LE bilaterally while sedated.
Patient remained tachycardic to the 120s-130s depsite the increase in sedation and diltiazem 60 mg PO QID was started with diltiazem 5 mg IV for immediate control.
To empirically cover aspiration pneumonia Vancomycin & Flagyl were started and ID approval for Ceftriaxone therapy (to cover pneumococcus) was obtained.
Ampicillin was also started to cover Listeria monocytogenes and acyclovir was started due to concern for HSV encephalitis after blood drawn for HSV PCR.
LP was re-attempted prior to which patient received an additional 5 units of FFP with following INR=1.3.
Following LP tube feedings were intiated and changed later in the day to include fiber with a goal of 90 cc/hr.
HD#4 ([**2131-8-5**]):  Patient remained febrile, with attempts to wean sedation aborted due to increased patient anxiety/agitation.
In light of negative blood/CSF/urine cultures acyclovir, ampicillin and ceftriaxone were discontinued.
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] continued to take Vancomycin for [**8-4**] sputum culture that grew 2+ G(+) cocci in pairs and clusters and Flagyl for empiric tx of C.diff diarrhea despite negative stool toxin screens.
Also continued to have loose stools with output of 2L, flagyl discontinued due to multiple negative C.diff toxin screens.
However, stool was re-sent for C.diff A&B toxins and banana flakes were added to tube feeds to bulk-up stools.
Urine output continued to be poor, patient was given one-time dose of lasix IV 40 mg with transient increase in UOP.
Patient was placed on trial of pressure support starting @ 13:00 and continuing on throughout the night without adverse events.
Sedation was gradually weaned with fentanyl decreased from 75 mcg/hr to 60 mcg/hr and versed at 4.0 mg/hr.
Patient continued to have episodes of anxiety throughout the day for which he was given Lorazepam 1 mg IV for breakthrough relief.
PICC line was place in right arm in the a.m.  Zosyn 4.5 mg IV Q8H was started to empirically cover G(-) organisms causing pneumonia .
Azithromycin 500 mg PO BID added to cover atypical causes of PNA (mycoplasma/chlamydia/etc).
GI consulted for increased, watery stool output (patient has h/o UC treated with 6-MP, requested consult to determine any additional management options/symptomatic relief).
Patient on coumadin as outpatient for A.fib, held on admission to perform LP.
Heparin ggt restarted for DVT prophylaxis.
Given another single dose of lasix 40 mg IV to removed third-spaced fluid, net -850 cc at end of day with LOS fluid net +8.6L.
Overnight, patient became agitated on CPAP+PS, AC restarted briefly for a few hours and placed back on pressure support.
HD#7 ([**2131-8-8**]):  Patient placed back on Pressure Support with PS 15/PEEP 8 (increased from [**11-7**]).
Arterial line placed in right arm without complications.
Dosed again with Lasix 40 mg IV to removed fluid that had third spaced into tissues/pleural space.
Patient also became tachycardic with HR increase to 130s-140s, diltiazem drip increased to 10 mg/hr.
Began having apneic episodes on pressure support and was placed back on AC at 20:00.
Sedation weaned to Versed 3.0 mg/hr and fentanyl 25 mcg/hr.
Lost last PIV access, patient only with arterial line and right PICC line.
Tube feeds held due to continued high gastric residuals.
During late afternoon/evening patient was dosed once again with lasix 20 mg IV with repeat Cr 1.8. .
Lasix held today, monitoring Cr for improvement of [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient remained on AC vent overnight, RISBI in the a.m. 103, mid-day ABG on AC 7/46/36/106.
Patient maintained own ventilation for 30 min at which time respirations were ~40/min, SaO2 92% and patient having difficulty breathing.
Trial was stopped and patient put back on pressure support with PS 5/PEEP 0.
Also recommended changing azithromycin to doxycycline if spiked temp again.
HD#10 ([**2131-8-11**]):  Stopped diltiazem gtt & started esmolol gtt to control HR & BP.
Sedation weaned and discontinued and patient extubated, after which patient was tachypneic but ABGs looked good.
HD#11 ([**2131-8-12**]):  Patient continued tx with IV vancomycin (dosed by levels) and renally-dosed zosyn.
Stopped drip and gave metoprolol 25 mg PO TID, soon increased to 75 mg PO TID with additional dosing of diltiazem 10 mg IV once to control rate.
Patient then started on diltiazem 30 mg PO QID in addition to metoprolol 75 mg PO TID to control rate, though patient continued to be tachycardic and HTNive throughout day.
Metroprolol increased to 100 mg PO TID and diltiazem increased to 60 mg PO QID.
Overnight patient remained confused, likely residual effect of multiple heavy sedatives, and attempted to climb out of bed and required one-time doses of ativan & zyprexa.
Patient will require one-on-one sitter upon tx to floor.
Metoprolol was increased to 100 mg PO TID and diltiazem was increased to 60 mg PO QID to control heart rate.
Later that night patient dropped sats to 85% and given CPAP for 30 minutes with improvement.
Initially struggling against ventilator requiring increases in sedation, suctioning of ETT showing brownish-[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum.
Arterial line placed [**2131-8-8**], d/ced by pt on [**8-11**].
Pt extubated [**8-11**], required supplemental O2 via NC and HiFlow NRB over following days & developed tachypnea and hypoxia early morning of [**8-15**] requiring re-intubation.
[**8-15**] LENI and L UENI show no DVT, CT chest same day showing new bilat LL consolidation concerning for aspiration, bridging small-to-moderate pleural effusions and new hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
NGT placed prior to extubation for tube feedings due to recent h/o aspiration.
02, wean as tolerated to maintain Sa02 >90%.
-aspriation PNA most likely culprit, cont IV vanc/zosyn renal dosing.
Currently on day 13/14 of zosyn regimen, will extend until chest can be re-imaged and abscess confirmed/ruled-out.
-continue lasix gtt with goal of net negative 1L fluid balance today.
If patient auto-diureses may stop gtt and begin scheduled regimen.
[**8-11**] Non-contrast CT of head/chest/abdomen for eval of possible sinusitis and surveillance of occult focus of infection =>no infectious source.
- Tylenol PRN for fever - Continue broad coverage of PNA.
Zosyn renally dosed to 2.25 gm IV Q6 hours, back on scheduled vanc 750 mg IV daily, follow vanc levels - check routine vanc levels.
Likely due to hypovolemia/prerenal azotemia secondary to lasix diuresis.
- Cr stable, monitor daily - Renal consult, appreciate recs - Dose medications for patient's creatinine - continue lasix gtt, stop if Cr >2.5.
[**Month (only) 116**] start schuled IV lasix this PM.
Morning of [**8-15**] found to be 155 but patient sedated after reintubation and difficult to assess for mental status changes.
-Na now WNL -NGT placed prior to extubation and tube feedings stopped.
[**Month (only) 116**] gently re-start tube feedings this PM.
-continue Lasix gtt and monitor UOP.
Previously on coumadin for A.fib.
- on heparin drip at 1400 U/hr.
Holding coumadin 5 mg PO daily.
- continue metoprolol 100 mg TID, PO diltiazem increased at 90 mg PO QID.
Differential for seizures include infection, stroke, metabolic encephalopathy, drugs, head trauma, tumors, etc.
7)Ulcerative colitis: Patient on Mercaptopurine as outpatient.
- continue mercaptopurine 75 mg PO daily.
- Continuing home statin, on oral beta blocker and CCB for rate & pressure control.
- repeat speech & swallow study in the AM - restart Nutren full-strength tube feedings tonight at 10 cc/hr with goal of 45 cc/hr, advance as tolerated and checking residuals Q6 hours .
10)Access: Right PICC line placed [**2131-8-6**].
Arterial line placed [**2131-8-15**] in RUE and PIVx1 (20g).
Will likely need 1:1 sitter due to increased PM agitation, pulling NGT, well-controlled with IV ativan.
3)  Continue IV zosyn (day 14) due to concern for ?
Medications on Admission: Digoxin Diltiazem 240mg PO daily Lasisx 40mg PO daily Isordil Coumadin Omeprazole Purinethol 75mg PO daily Keppra 750mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: Keppra 750 mg PO BID Diltiazem 90 mg PO QID Metoprolol 100 mg PO TID ASA 81 mg PO daily Lasix 40 mg IV BID Zosyn 2.25 gm IV Q6 hours (day 14/16) Protonix 40 mg IV daily Mercaptopurine 75 mg PO daily Ativan 1 mg IV PRN agitation  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent seizures/status epilepticus of unknown etiology requiring intubation complicated by aspiration pneumonia and recurrent fevers.
