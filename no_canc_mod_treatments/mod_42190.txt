Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 48639**] is a 79 y/o lady w/ developmental delay who presented from her group home for a right pelvic and femur fracture.
She also underwent workup for possibe seizure given the history obtained by providers at her group home.
# Right pelvic and femur fracture: s/p surgery [**2126-5-31**].
Now s/p ORIF of right subtrochanteric hip fracture with intramedullary nail on [**5-31**].
Pain well controlled with Tylenol and low-dose narcotics (which were not needed by the time of discharge).
She was started on enoxaparin prophylaxis on [**5-31**] which should continue for 4 weeks (end day [**6-28**]).
Seizure could explain her high lactate on presentation (~7).
Tramadol was stopped due to risk of decreasing seizure threshold.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D; she might benefit from bisphosphonate therapy as an outpatient.
After the operation on [**5-31**] she was noted to go into a fast heart rhythm (HR 140's); no EKG was done.
She was given Metoprolol 5mg IV.
Also over the next few hours, she  received a few liters of IV fluids and 2 units of blood.
Alternately, this could be related to the fact that she did not receive her home Metoprolol prior to the procedure causing tachycardia.
She was able to be continued on her antihypertensive medication (Lisinopril) and also Metoprolol.
She was s/p surgery with only 200cc blood loss, however did have pelvic/femur fractures which can bleed extensively.
No antibiotics were continued once she was admitted, and her leukocytosis resolved (WBC 6.8 at discharge).
Besides her episode of hypotension (see above) she did require her antihypertensive medications and her blood pressure was reasonably controlled.
She was continued on her Lisinopril and Metoprolol.
