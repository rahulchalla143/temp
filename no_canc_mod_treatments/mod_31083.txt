He was given ASA, Plavix and started on Heparin drip.
No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given secondary to HR in 40s and a low blood pressure with 100-110 systolic BP.
At the time of CCU transfer the patient was asymptomatic and his Heparin drip had been discontinued.
At baseline, the patient has very limited functional status as well and has significant co-morbidities, including COPD, Diabetes/II, and hypothyroidism.
Past Medical History: CARDIAC HISTORY : Cardiac risk factors are positive for Diabetes, HTN, Obesity, but negative for hyperlipidemia.
ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender and non-distended.
He was given ASA, Plavix and started on Heparin drip.
No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given because of the patient's low heart rate in the high 40s -50s range in conjunction with his ongoing low blood pressures in the 100-110 systolic range.
The patient's presentation and workup did not warrant any invasive procedures at this time.
A lipid profile was explored and showed reasonable values with no overt hyperlipidemia as his total cholesterol was 160, HDL 41, LDL 95 and Triglycerides 121.
The patient was continued on his daily Aspirin and his Metoprolol was initially held given his mild bradycardia but continued once his rate improved.
He also had improvement in his low blood pressures throughout his hospital stay but it was felt that he should discontinue his HCTZ at time of discharge in order to avoid any additional BP drops and he was also advised to defer his Metoprolol dose if his heart rate dropped below 50 or his home systolic blood pressure dropped below 100.
The patient was asked to discontinue his HCTZ and to start taking Lisinopril 2.5mg daily with Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily for appropriate control of his blood pressure.
He was also advised to follow-up within 1 week with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his hypertension and additional co-morbidities as outlined above.
The patient's heart rhythm was monitored continuously on telemetry while in the CCU and he was initially in sinus bradycardia so his beta-blocker was held and eventually continued.
Given the patient's history of hypothyroidism, he was continued on his usual home dose of Levothyroxine and his TSH was checked and found to be within normal limits.
The patient's COPD was also monitored and he was continued on his usual intermittent levels of low flow oxygen via nasal cannula and his home medications, Advair and Spiriva were continued.
Theophylline was initially held and then continued.
In regards to the patient's DM2 management, he had well controlled finger stick glucose levels and was managed on a sliding scale protocol with regular insulin and his home glyburide was held during his CCU stay.
He was placed on a diabetic heart healthy diet and had good PO intake throughout his hospitalization.
