She presented with complaints of weakness and hypotension and most likely cause was infection (UTI/urosepsis and cellulitis given leg findings.)
Initially, CVL placed in ED and CVP >20 in ED.
Then, this was changed to vancomycin and cefepime.
She was given fluid boluses with minimal effect and decreased urine output ultimately to 5cc/hr.
Ultimately, it was decided to make her comfort measures only as she was rapidly developing multi-organ failure resistant to treatment.
