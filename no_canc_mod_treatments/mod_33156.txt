[**2145-2-12**]: ERCP for colonic stent placement for a retracting stoma [**2145-2-16**]: ERCP for colonic stent (Wallflex 105mm by 23mm stent; LOT# [**Serial Number 84111**])placement for a retracting stoma   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4379**] is a 59 year old female who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with a left-sided diverticulitis/colitis and microperforation containing collection within the pelvis.
At the OSH, she was on bowel rest and TPN was initiated on [**2145-1-14**].
She was also on Zosyn, Levaquin and Flagyl with minimal improvement.
Her hospital course was complicated by ARF secondary to intravascular volume depletion which was treated with volume resuscitation.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further surgical management of her sigmoid diverticulitis.
PSHx: Multi-level laminectomy [**2135**] and [**2138**] followed by fusion, Repair of large incarcerated ventral hernia with mesh sublay complicated by wound infection requiring incision and drainage, debridement and VAC placement [**2143-5-17**], Pilonidal cyst excision complicated by persistent drainage [**2143-2-14**], Tubal Ligation.
(L)LQ prior JP site (now discontinued) clean/intact with DSD cover.
However, this ultrasound is extremely limited given patient's body habitus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital and admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2145-1-16**] for further treatment of sigmoid diverticulitis with microperforation and acute renal failure.
She was made NPO except medications, started on IV fluids, started on empiric IV Flagyl and Levaquin, and continued on Oxycontin 80mg TID plus OxyIR PRN for pain with good effect.
PICC line from OSH was cleared for use, and TPN started.
Neuro: Upon admission, the patient received home Oxycontin 80mg TID plus PRN OxyIR with good effect.
Post-operatively, she received Fentanyl along with either Propofol or Midazolam for sedation.
She was transitioned to Methadone and Dilaudid IV PRN once transferred to the floor for post operative pain with adequate pain control.
CV: Initially on pressors in the SICU, which were weaned off.
Patient started back on home Metoprolol and HCTZ while in SICU for hypertension with good effect.
Pulmonary: Post-operatively while in the SICU, the patient was transitioned from being intubated on mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary edema to nasal CPAP once the pulmonary plethora improved.
As recommeded, the patient received aggressive IV fluid rescusitation with a goal of keeping a positive fluid balance every day over the next few days with good response.
Also, she received blood transfusion to address her anemia as well as low oncotic pressure.
She did require a number of doses of Lasix for secondary fluid overload when on the floor, but chronic lower extremity edema was ultimately controlled with home HCTZ.
Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
According to calorie counts, however, the patient did not take in adequate calories or protein enterally, thus required parenteral nutrition in the form of TPN at discharge, which was cycled.
GI: On [**2145-1-25**], the patient underwent descending colostomy, sigmoid resection, and adhesiolysis (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
On [**2145-2-12**], the patient underwent ERCP for colonic stent placement for the retracting stoma.
On [**2145-2-16**], the patient returned for repeat ERCP for a second colonic stent placement again for retracting stoma, which was sutured in place.
A bowel regimen was started.
She will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13543**] (Surgery) as an outpatient for stoma revision and stent removal.
ID: Upon admission, the patient was started on empiric IV Flagyl and a fluoroquinolone (first Levaquin, then Ciprofloxacin) for perforated diverticulitis.
On [**2145-1-19**], the Cipro and Flagyl were discontinued, and changed to IV Zosyn with Vancomycin added on [**2145-1-27**].
Antibiotic therapy was  completed on [**2145-2-16**].
Wound care and pressure relief resulted in significant improvement; at discharge wound was approx.
Post-operatively, the large midline incisonal wound intitially received saline moist-to-dry dressings, which were changed to a VAC dressing using black foam at 125mmHg on POD#17 with resultant improved wound healing and granulation.
Abdominal JP drain to bulb suction, with scant output, discontinued on [**2-24**].
At discharge, incisional wound, pilonidal cyst wound and stoma care continued as outlined.
For transport to the rehabiliation facility, the VAC dressing was taken down, and a wet-to-dry dressing placed.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout her stay; sliding scale insulin was administered accordingly.
Iniitially after admission, she was transfused three units of PRBCs with a resultant hematocrit of 28.4% pre-operatively.
Post-operatively on POD#6, the patient required an additional three units of PRBCs for a hematocrit of 21.1% with good response.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get mobilized with assistance as early as possible.
Both Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy follwed the patient throughtout admission.
By discharge, the patient required assist x [**1-30**] people and a rolling walker to ambulate short distances (i.e.
