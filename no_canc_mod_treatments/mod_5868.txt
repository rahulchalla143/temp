Mother's cervical dilatation continued to progress.
She received Pitocin following progressive dilatation, and declined cesarean section due to increased risk with classical incision, including infertility.
The infant emerged without activity, received positive pressure ventilation by mask.
Infant was intubated without difficulty at about two minutes of age.
The infant was without evidence of spontaneous activity, and continued with gasping intermittently.
The baby was placed on high-frequency ventilation with a MAP of 8, frequency of 15, and oxygen weaned to 31% FIO2.
The baby was given two normal saline boluses and one bicarbonate bolus.
Chest x-ray initially showed a high endotracheal tube that was advanced, bilaterally well-expanded lungs, evidence of reticulogranular pattern, diffuse, consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
Umbilical lines in good position, and no pneumothorax.
Respiratory:  The baby was placed on high-frequency ventilator as described above.
He received a total of 12 mEq/kg of bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis.
Baby was transitioned to the conventional ventilator due to difficulty oxygenating on HFOV, with ventilator settings of 20/5 and a rate of 30, and about 60 to 70% oxygen.
He received three doses of surfactant, and managed to wean down to ventilator settings of 19/5 and a rate of 22.
Cardiovascular:  The baby initially received three normal saline boluses and was started on dopamine and required 20 mg/kg/hour of dopamine.
Hydrocortisone for replacement on day of life one for blood pressure instability was added.
His dopamine ultimately weaned down to 13 mcg/kg/hour.
As stated previously, had a UAC and a double-lumen UVC line in.
Was receiving initially maintenance intravenous fluids, and then was started on hyperalimentation and interlipids for nutritional support.
A blood culture was sent, and he was started on ampicillin and gentamicin.
The baby also received fentanyl from his time of birth as needed for pain control.
Family:  From prior to delivery through delivery and after delivery, the medical team was very concerned about [**Known lastname 4946**] long-term prognosis.
The father arrived on [**3-6**] in the morning, and was updated in several meetings on [**Known lastname 4946**] progress, with the long-term prognosis and serious concerns for devastating sequelae given early manifestations including significant perinatal depression, persistent abnormal neurological examination, diffuse posterior sagittal echodensities on head ultrasound, and seizure activity.
After several meetings with [**Known lastname 4946**] family, the parents decided to redirect support to comfort measures only with full agreement of the medical team.
