However, a discussion with the patient and her family led them to the conclusion that she did require valve replacement surgery and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2150-7-21**] to pursue valve replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, breast cancer status post lumpectomy times three, psoriasis and glaucoma.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 5 mg p.o.
Toprol XL 100 mg p.o.
Zestril 10 mg p.o.
Isosorbide Sustained Release 30 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Multivitamin p.o.
?F, a pulse of 54, a blood pressure of 130/70 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on three liters by nasal cannula.
She had previously refused coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2149-2-5**].
The patient remained on the medical service until she was taken to the operating room on [**2150-7-24**], at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement and a mitral valve replacement with tissue valves as well as coronary artery bypass grafting times one by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on propofol, Levophed and milrinone intravenous drips.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained intubated, on a mechanical ventilator.
She remained on insulin drip as well as the milrinone intravenous drip.
On postoperative day #2, the patient was placed on a low dose dopamine drip.
She remained on insulin drip.
She also remained on mechanical ventilation following an unsuccessful attempt to wean her from the ventilator.
The patient remained in the intensive care unit over the next three days, on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and marginal hypoxia with attempted ventilator weaning.
On [**2150-7-29**], the patient was noted to have significant pleural effusions by x-ray and a right chest tube was placed.
On postoperative day #6, the patient remained on the ventilator.
She was weaned and extubated later in the day on postoperative day #6.
The patient's dopamine was weaned slowly and was presently at 2 mcg/kg per minute.
The patient was restless and agitated requiring intravenous Haldol at times.
Her chest tube was discontinued and the patient remained hemodynamically stable in the cardiac surgery recovery unit.
On postoperative day #8, [**2150-8-1**], the patient was on nasal cannula oxygen with marginal oxygen saturation in the 90% to 93% range.
She was begun on amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation and had been maintained on tube feedings during her intensive care unit stay.
On postoperative day #9, the patient was begun on oral intake.
She was started on NPH insulin and had been progressing, although slowly, in a stable fashion.
On postoperative day #10, the patient remained on intravenous heparin drip to anticoagulate her for her atrial fibrillation, low dose dopamine drip, amiodarone and Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
A chest tube was placed in the left pleural space and 1400 cc of dark blood were obtained.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and a subsequent chest x-ray showed the tube to be in good position with evacuation of the effusion.
The chest tube had remained in place.
The patient had been started on levofloxacin for a question of tracheobronchitis.
She did not have positive sputum cultures; however, she clinically improved from a pulmonary standpoint after the levofloxacin was initiated.
She was tolerating diuresis and physical therapy was initiated.
it was felt that her chest tube should stay in until she was again therapeutically anticoagulated to be sure that she did not have any increased bleeding associated with her anticoagulation.
On [**2150-8-8**], the chest tube was discontinued when her INR had reached 2.1 and there was no evidence of bleeding.
The patient had already been on levofloxacin for five days and, at this time, was begun on vancomycin intravenously.
However, since the patient clinically improved over the next few days on the vancomycin, it was felt judicious to leave her on the vancomycin despite not having specific bacteria to be treated with it.
The patient is to continue on her antibiotic course of levofloxacin for tracheobronchitis as well as vancomycin for cellulitis of her right lower extremity, which is improving.
She is oxygenating well and remains stable.
The patient is ready to be discharged today, [**2150-8-13**], to a rehabilitation facility to progress with cardiac rehabilitation for increased strength and endurance.
?F, a pulse of 61 in normal sinus rhythm, a respiratory rate of 18 and a blood pressure of 135/56 with an oxygen saturation of 97% on two liters by nasal cannula.
Her target INR should be 2 to 2.5 for treatment of postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Her sternal incision is clean, dry and intact with Steri-Strips in place.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
Vancomycin 1 gm intravenous q.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Percocet 5 mg/325 mg one p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged to a rehabilitation facility to assist with increasing strength, mobility and endurance and cardiac rehabilitation.
She is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] approximately one month after her surgical procedure.
Status post aortic valve replacement.
Status post mitral valve replacement.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
