The patient was admitted to the MICU where she was started on a heparin drip and did not receive thrombolytic therapy.
The patient improved clinically with heparin drip and did not require thrombolysis given that she appeared clinically stable on admission.
The patient was transferred to the general medical floor on [**2137-4-5**], at which time she was continued on her heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic on Coumadin.
The patient's oxygen was weaned to off.
Given persistently subtherapeutic INRs, the patient was switched from a heparin drip to Lovenox for potential discharge.
Given the patient's obesity, antifactor Xa level was ordered, but could not be successfully coordinated with her Lovenox dosing and blood draws on the floor.
Arrangements were made with the patient and her primary care physician for blood draws and monitoring of her Coumadin and Lovenox doses.
As noted previously, the patient was anticoagulated for her pulmonary emboli.
The patient was evaluated with iron studies, which suggested an iron deficiency anemia.
She was placed on iron sulfate as well as vitamin C for absorption.
It is anticipated that she will be evaluated with a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
