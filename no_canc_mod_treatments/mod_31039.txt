HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man who presents with the above chief complaint and his past medical history includes numerous medical problems including non Q wave MI times two, status post CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, history of TIAs, history of lower GI bleed and diverticulosis.
At that time the patient was treated with steroid injections and po Prednisone which caused an increase in his blood sugars.
For this increase in blood sugars he was started on Humalog approximately 3-5 days ago as his sugars have been in the 300-400's on his previous regimen.
He has a chronic cough secondary to post nasal drip which is unproductive of sputum.
5) Status post CABG in [**2139**].
9) Lower GI bleed status post polyp removal.
MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po q d, Lopressor 20 mg po q d, Multivitamin, Doxazosin 4 mg q h.s., Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Allopurinol 300 mg po q d, Ranitidine 150 mg po q h.s., Glyburide 10 mg po bid, Diovan 80 mg po q d, enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Quinine as needed, NPH 20-30 units q a.m., 10-15 units q p.m., Humalog sliding scale started three days ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 99.5, heart rate 83, blood pressure 170/125, respiratory rate 18, satting 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Gait and coordination were not tested.
An echocardiogram from [**2160-4-25**] showed mild left atrial dilatation, non obstructive focal septal hypertrophy, depressed LV function 1+ aortic regurg, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fraction could not be estimated at that time.
The patient is in new onset atrial fibrillation but Lopressor will be increased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control.
Given the patient's trace guaiac positive stool, history of lower GI bleed, the decision was made to start the patient on Heparin as he had multiple risk factors for stroke elevating him into a higher level of category including his past history of TIAs.
No empiric antibiotics will be started at this time.
He will be written for an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital and fingersticks will be checked qid.
His oral hypoglycemics will be held for now.
The patient will be given antiemetics as needed to control the nausea and vomiting.
His pain will be controlled with non Opioids as much as possible as Opioids have given him bad reactions in the past.
The patient is maintained on Heparin and the plan will be to transition him to Coumadin, then to discharge the patient and bring him back at 1-2 months for TEE and cardioversion at that time after anticoagulation, as it is unknown how long patient has been in atrial fibrillation.
IV fluids were given and EKG was done that was unchanged.
The Heparin was discontinued and an NG lavage was performed that showed dark brown fluid in the stomach with occasional clots which were Gastroccult positive.
The patient was transferred to the CCU at that time and transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], discontinuation of all NSAIDS and anticoagulation.
Hematocrits were continually followed and an H. pylori antibody was checked.
On the fourth hospital day the patient was transferred back to the floor from the unit after the EGD and the 2 units of packed cells when patient was stabilized.
He denied anymore episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, bright red blood per rectum, melena or vomiting of blood.
At this time his Aspirin was changed to 81 mg from 325 mg and the patient was not on either Heparin or Coumadin.
The patient will return for a repeat upper endoscopy in one month.
At that time if the ulcers are healed, anticoagulation will be pursued with the eventual goal of performing a TEE and cardioversion either chemical or electrical, once the patient has been on stable anticoagulation for one month.
The patient's Lopressor dose at the time of discharge is 37.5 mg po tid.
He will be treated for H. pylori infection.
