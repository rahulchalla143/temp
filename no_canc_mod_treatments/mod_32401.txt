She was administered 40mg IV lasix x 1 with 1L urine output and was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
MRI demonstrated T11-T12 cord compression and she was taken for T8-L2 posterior spinal fusion with T11 laminectomy.
Her post-operative course was complicated by the following: - atrial fibrillation with tachycardia with adequate control with metoprolol - bilateral pleural effusions - This was thought related to severe atelectasis and was treated with aggressive chest PT.
Coumadin was restarted upon discharge.
- C. diff - diagnosed wtih C.diff and started on flagyl - UTI - Enterococcus UTI and started on amoxicillin - Acute Renal Failure - Creatinine peaked to 1.9 during previous admission .
She was administered kayexalate and aspirin 325mg PO x 1. .

INPATIENT  Brief Hospital Course: 71F with bilateral lower extremity paralysis s/p fall, anklyosing spondylitis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and h/o DVT p/w three days of worsening dyspnea.
She was therefore transferred to the MICU where pigtail catheters were placed in the pleural space bilaterally and drained significant amounts of fluid.
A right subclavian line was also placed in the MICU because IV access was difficult to attain.
She was aggressively diuresed because of anasarca, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was negaative three to five liters each day for the first five days after being transferred to the floor.
AutoDiuresis continued and the patient's anasarca improved, she was then started on lasix to maintain negative fluid balance.
Her chest tubes were eventually placed to waterseal, with the right being removed first.
The new CT drained a large amount of fluid immediately and then the drainage decreased significantly, the tube was pulled three days later and the fluid did not reaccumlate.
# Anasarca:  The patient was severely volume overloaded, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was diuresed aggressively with marked improvement, as described above.
She was given boost supplements with each meal but her albumin only slowly began to improve, likely that she was losing a large amount of protein through her CT. Pt.
# Lower extremity paralysis: Patient was recently discharged after being admitted for LE paralysis which occured in the setting of a traumatic fall, spinal compression fractures, and an epidural hematoma.
During her prior hospitalization, she underwent T8-L2 posterior spinal fusion w/ T11 laminectomy and decompression of her hematoma.
She also was managed with other prophylactic treatments for her SCI, including repositioning in bed q2h to decrease her risk of bed sores and intermittent straight cathing to decrease her risk of UTI (compared to the risk associated with an indwelling catheter).
However, an indwelling bladder catheter was ultimately placed because the patient was being aggressively diuresed for anasacara.
She was treated for one E.coli UTI and then had a foley change for enterococcus colonization.
# Lower extremity DVT:  Patient was diagnosed with a DVT a few months prior to admission and was admitted on warfarin.
However, warfarin was held in anticipation of a thoracentesis.
Because she has an IVC filter in place (placed during her prior hospitalization because anticoagulation was contraindicated in the setting of an epidural hematoma), she was not initially bridged with heparin when her INR fell below 2 because she was awaiting chest tube placement.
After chest tubes were placed bilaterally, a heparin gtt was started and continued until her INR was greater than 2.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was maintained on an ISS and had a HbA1C<7%.
She was initially managed with bactrim but developed hyperkalemia.
The bactrim was discontinued and the patient's potassium levels subsequently normalized after 48 hours.
Zosyn was started and the patient completed a 10 day course of antibiotics for complicated UTI.
She was discharged without the foley, but with [**Month/Year (2) 7219**] for q4h timed voids (straight caths) because of the decreased risk of UTI associated with this method, when compared to indwelling catheters.
# C diff:  Patient had diarrhea and positive c diff toxin during her prior hospitalization and was continued on flagyl.
Flagyl was continued for two weeks after the patient's last antibiotic dose for for UTI.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a CHADS score of 2 and aspirin will be adequate for long-term thromboembolic ppx, though she may be anticoagulated with warfarin indefinitely considering that her DVT was likely idiopathic in etiology.
Her metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] because she continued to have HR around 100, and she was also monitored on telemetry.
# Hypertension:  Stable, patient was continued on metoprolol.
Lisinopril was d/c'd to give BP room for lasix and metoprolol.
#Decubital ulcers: The wound nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7219**] on wound care and the plastic surgery team was also consulted to debride a gluteal ulcer.
