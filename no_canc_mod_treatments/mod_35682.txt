His treatment consisted of oxygen through nasal cannula but patient was not on antibiotics since he remained afebrile throughout the course of hospitalization.
Three days post aspiration patient did not require any supplementary oxygen and his lung exam significantly improved.
Initially NG tube was inserted with nutritional supplement feeding.
He also received TPN through IV line for several days prior to PEG placement.
He will continue on Protonix and additional studies such as H. pylori antibody was sent which results are still pending during discharge.
If this result is positive, patient should be treated with antibiotics since this could be cause for his findings during endoscopy.
The cause of his severe dysphagia was believed to be due to mechanical cause and patient might be evaluated in several months with additional swallowing study.
