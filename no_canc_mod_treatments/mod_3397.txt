She tripped while walking down the stairs and hit her head on a driveway.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was intubated upon arrival for airway protection secondary to worsening mental status and emesis/bloody secretions.
She was admitted to the MICU as Neurosurgery did not recommend surgical intervention.
She was started on mannitol.
Initially, she was placed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which were discontinued after 3 days.
Per neurosurgery, it was okay to restart coumadin (on [**12-3**]) but this was not done by the MICU team.
The MICU team did discuss anticoagulation with the patient's family on multiple occasions, including the risks and benefits of remaining off of the anticoagulation with her known atrial fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction.
Her fingersticks were difficult to control requiring an insulin drip while in the ICU.
In the ICU, she became febrile and was placed on vancomycin and meropenem for an 8 day course.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse friable mucosa in both bronchial trees and a small amount of thin secretions.
Lavage of her left upper lobe grew nothing, but sputum culture did grow MSSA.
Her central line was removed and a PICC was placed prior to coming to the floor.
It was difficult to get her therapeutic on Dilantin so she was changed to keppra.
Type 2 DM, on glyburide as outpt 2.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20% in [**12-28**], status post biventricular pacer internal defibrillator.

[**11-26**] CT C-spine No fracture or subluxation is identified.
[**11-27**] Left Humerus and Forearm X-rays Two views of the humerus demonstrate normal bony anatomy.
Diagnostic considerations again include pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
[**12-4**] CT Head w/o Contrast No significant interval change in the large right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a similar degree of right-to-left subfalcine herniation.
[**12-6**] PICC placement Successful placement of a single lumen 4 French PICC via the right basilic vein.
[**12-7**] Portable CXR Dobbhoff tube with its tip likely within the body of the stomach.
Right-sided PICC line somewhat withdrawn with its tip likely within the vicinity of the junction of the right and left brachiocephalic veins.
[**12-7**] Portable CXR Dobbhoff tube at the thoracoabdominal junction, above the gastroesophageal junction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19205**] is a 71 year old female with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented status post a fall with bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages and large right intraparenchymal bleed initially cared for in the MICU now extubated and improving on the general medical floor.
The patient should continue on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
She is to continue to physical therapy and occupational therapy at the rehabilitation facility as she will hopefully continue to improve over the course of the next weeks to months.
As per the patient's family, they are comfortable waiting until after the patient's PEG tube situation is resolved prior to restarting her coumadin.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated due to aspiration of blood from epistaxis as well as deteriorating mental status.
In the ICU, she had a prolonged wean from the ventilator due to congestive heart failure, requiring diuresis.
Her course was also complicated by ventilator associated pneumonia, for which she was treated with approprite antibiotics during her MICU stay.
- On the floor, the patient was restarted on her prior dose of lasix due to concern for continued element of congestive heart failure.
She should continue on her amiodarone.
Her family is comfortable continuing without the coumadin for now until the issue surrounding her potential need for a PEG tube is resolved.
- The patient was continued on carvedilol and spironolactone.
- She also received PO lasix as above for volume overload.
# DM: Very difficult to manage in ICU, requiring insulin gtt at times.
Uptitrating NPH and humalog sliding scale - high sugar 220 yesterday.
# Hyperlipidemia: The patient should continue her atorvastatin.
# Hypothyroidism: The patient should continue her levothyroxine.
Her anemia in the ICU is likely due to frequent phlebotomy during her ICU course.
Her guaiac positive stool could be due to Dobhoff placement.
- Her tube feeds are at goal.
A PEG tube is on hold for now per discussion with the patient's family.
As the patient's speech and swallow study was somewhat confounded by her depressed mental status, her family would like to continue for now with tube feeds.
Should she need a PEG tube at a later date, they will consider it.
# Ppx: The patient should remain on SQ heparin until she is able to get up.
She should be on aspiration precautions with the head of the bed elevated.
She should receive a bowel regimen as necessary, but she is having bowel movements.
