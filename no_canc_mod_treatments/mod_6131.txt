Interventional Pulmonology was unable to dilate for tracheostomy placement at the bedside, so the patient was taken to the operating room where her tracheostomy stoma was dilated and a new tracheostomy tube was inserted.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and reported being able to breath easier with the new tracheostomy.
