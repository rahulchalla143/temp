The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
There is a well-seated aortic valve bioprosthesis without paravalvular regurgitation and without residual valvular stenosis.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs.[**Known lastname **] was admitted for heart failure requiring aggressive diuresis.
Cardiac work up revealed an aortic valve area of 0.6 and 3+ mitral regurgitation,and coronary artery disease.Preoperatively it was noted that she had candidial intertrigo in the bilateral groin, presenting a risk for infection at the proposed catheter insertion site for surgery, and the surgery was subsequently postponed until her intertrigo resolved with oral diflucan therapy and topical miconazole therapy.
[**2168-6-8**] she underwent aortic valve replacement(#21mmpericardial), mitral valve repair (#28mm ring), and coronary artery bypass graft (Left internal mammary artery grafted to Left anterior descending artery/Saphenous vein grafted to Diag/Posterior descending artery).Cross Clamp time= 125 minutes.
Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 140  minutes.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the CVICU requiring pressors for optimimal cardiac output and hemodynamics.
She remained in the intensive care unit on milirone which was weaned off post operative day 2 but remained in neosynephrine to augment her blood pressure.
Epicardial wires were maintained and heparin started due to atrial fibrillation.
Vancomycin was continued for a 7 day course as per ID, to cover for blood culture believed to be a contaminant.
POD#11 she was found to be C-Difficile positive and was placed on Flagyl x 14day course.
