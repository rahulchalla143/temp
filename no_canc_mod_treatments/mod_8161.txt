She was transferred for elective catheterization with known left main bypass grafting.
Cardiac catheterization of [**2196-6-23**] demonstrates right coronary artery graft and native vessel totally occluded, left main trunk disease of 50%, anterior descending native vessel totally occluded and bypass graft with a proximal and marginal shows an 81% stenosis, second obtuse marginal with a 50% stenosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease with angioplasty to the circumflex in [**2192**], stent placement to the right coronary artery secondary to re-stenosis in [**2192-10-1**], coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein grafts to the right coronary artery and diagonal coronary artery in [**2193**].
She had severely diseased right coronary artery graft and required stenting of the right coronary artery graft.
A follow up catheterization in [**2196-1-1**] showed patent diagonal and right coronary artery grafts with a 50% stenosis of the diagonal.
She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year which showed distal left main trunk mildly tapered, irregular left anterior descending artery with diagonal saphenous vein graft patent but graft with a 70% stenosis The circumflex was a non-dominant system with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal.
She has a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia which was complicated by thrombosis.
Previous surgery includes the coronary artery surgery, aorto-bifemoral bypass grafting in [**2194**], left shoulder surgery for Erb's palsy at the age of 12, appendectomy in [**2166**], cervical spine surgery in [**2175**], lumbosacral spine surgery in [**2195-12-2**], bladder suspension in [**2174**].
Medications at the time of admission included aspirin 1 q day, Nitro-Patch .4 mg q day, Ultrase 2.5 mg q day, Atenolol 50 mg q day, Plavix 75 mg q day, Lipitor 40 mg q day, Tri-Chlor 20 mg q day, Depakote 500 mg q a.m., 500 mg at noon and 750 mg q p.m., Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d., Synthroid .15 mg q day, Prevacid 15 mg q day, Darvocet p.r.n., Flexeril 10 mg b.i.d., Celebrex 200 mg q day, Microcide 12.5 mg q day, Premphase 1 q day, Zovirax lip ointment on a p.r.n.
However, she had sever underlying vascular disease that appeared to be acutely worse.The patient was begun on a Hirudin drip and she improved back to her perceived baseline and recommendations were for long term anticoagulation.
It was determined, from the cardiac standpoint, with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery, that the patient's coronary artery disease would be treated medically.
On [**2196-6-29**], the patient underwent a right axillo-bifemoral bypass graft.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the SICU for continued care.
The Hirudin drip was continued for a goal PTT of 50 to 70.
Coumadin was begun and she was transferred from the SICU to the VICU.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that the patient will need some rehabilitation for gait training and strengthening prior to being discharged to home.
Kefzol was started for right pretibial erythema.
On postoperative day number six, physical therapy was requested to re-evaluate the patient and rehabilitation screening was begun.
Aspirin was added to her drug regimen and the Kefzol was converted to Keflex.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:  Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 1.25 mcg q day, Nitro-Patch 0.4 mg q day, Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
