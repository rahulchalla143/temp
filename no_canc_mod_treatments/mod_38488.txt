[**2163-8-14**] Technically successful placement of 10 French Flexima biliary-type catheter into the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous fluid collection as described.

He was relatively unstable in the ER with tachycardia to 150 and was diaphoretic due to sepsis and was therefore admitted to the SICU for further resuscitation and management.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 26 and his blood pressure remained stable.
He felt much better following drainage and was covered with IV Cipro, Flagyl and Vancomycin pending culture results.
* You have improved with drainage of the collection and antibiotics.
* You will be discharged with the drain in place so that the area can continue to drain.
Bring this record with you to your first appointment so that the doctor can determine if and when the drain should be removed.
* Continue your antibiotics as prescribed.
Keep a log of your daily drain out-put and bring it along when you see the doctor.
As you will need to have a CT to re-image your abdomen to check the status of your abscess, we recommend not beginning therapy with metformin for your blood sugars until after the CT is completed.
