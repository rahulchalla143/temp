Admission Date:  [**2142-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-4**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: nausea, abdominal pain, and bilious emesis consistent with small bowel obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 4/16 L inguinal hernia repair [**5-17**] thoracentesis [**5-23**] tracheostomy/PEG placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 85 y/o F with abdominal pain X3 days with nausea and vomiting nonbloody bilious emesis.
NGT was placed by ER which immediately put out 2200 cc bilious material.
Virtual colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 958**] revealed 3.2 x 2.4 cm polypoidal villous-type adenoma in the right colon.
Past Medical History: Pancreatic cyst, Mitral valve disease, Severe tricuspid regurgitation, Aortic regurgitation, History of rheumatic fever, MVR, Chronic atrial fibrillation, Congestive heart failure, Iron deficiency anemia, Hypertension, Seizure disorder, CCY, Left inguinal hernia, Cerebellar infarcts  Social History: No alcohol.
She is accompanied by her son at the time of presentation   Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: At the time of discharge:  - Vitals stable (afebrile, HR in 70s, SBP ~120), maintaining adequate oxygenization on trach collar during the day, CPAP overnight - sleepy but arousable, alert, and conversant - lungs with crackles and diminished breath sounds bilaterally - heart irregular - abdomen soft but distended, G-tube in place without erythema or drainage; midline incision clean, dry, and intact with steri-strips intact; no significant tenderness to palpation - 1+ peripheral edema  Pertinent Results: At the time of discharge:  - her INR was therapeutic on oral coumadin with a level of 3.6 on [**6-4**] - her WBC was normal, and was 6.8 on [**6-4**] - her hematocrit was stable and 27.8 without evidence of bleeding - of note, her serum bicarbonate had increased slowly to a level of 45 on [**6-4**], with current plan to begin acetazolamide to normalize her labs  Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and underwent a KUB which demonstrated multiple dilated loops of small bowel consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
She was admitted, resuscitated with IVF, and underwent serial examinations.
She was loaded with digoxin, given vitamin K to reverse her coumadin, and started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
Her bowel obstruction did not clinically improve, and she was therefore taken to the operating room on [**2142-5-10**] for lysis of adhesions and L inguinal hernia repair.
She tolerated the procedure somewhat well, although she did require vasopressors during the case.
She ultimately had difficulty weaning from ventilatory support, and she was extubated [**5-15**] and subsequently re-intubated.
She was found to have pleural effusions, and given the tenuousness of her respiratory status, she underwent thoracentesis on [**5-17**] where 700 cc of fluid was removed.
Despite this, she continued to require ventilatory support and discussions were undertaken regarding the utility of tracheostomy and PEG placement.
The family agreed to this, and on [**5-23**] she underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG placement in the SICU, which she tolerated well.
She was thereafter transitioned back onto enteral coumadin once she was tolerating tube feeds via her G-tube.
Her pain was well controlled peri-operatively, and she is experiencing no pain at the time of discharge, requiring only occasional tylenol for relief.
She remained anti-coagulated and was on coumadin at the time of discharge for her mechanical valve.
Her home lopressor and lisinopril doses had not been resumed, although should she develop hypertension this can be re-started at rehab.
Pulm: as described above, she had significant difficulty weaning ventilatory support throughout her hospital stay, and eventually underwent tracheostomy.
She was treated for pneumonia transiently with vancomycin/zosyn but was off all antibiotics at the time of discharge.
Her ventilatory support was weaned slowly, and at the time of discharge she was tolerating trach collar during the day and was being rested overnight on CPAP [**10-29**] for mild tachypnea.
Her tracheostomy site was clean, dry, and intact without bleeding.
GI: following her exploratory laparotomy and hernia repair, the patient slowly regained bowel function.
At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating her tube feeds at goal (nutren pulmonary at 35cc/hr), and although she had mild abdominal distention she had no nausea or vomiting.
GU: she has a foley catheter and has continued to make adequate urine output throughout the duration of her hospital stay (>25cc/hr).
At the time of discharge, she had developed a metabolic alkalosis and was receiving acetazolamide and holding her home dose of lasix, although this can be re-started at rehab if her bicarbonate normalizes.
Heme: As mentioned above, she was transitioned to a heparin drip throughout her hospital stay (which was titrated), and following PEG placement was transitioned back to enteral coumadin.
She was being screened for ventilatory rehab because of her tracheostomy and requirement for the ventilator.
