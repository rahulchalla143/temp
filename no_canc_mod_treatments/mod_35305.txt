Was febrile and hypotensive and intubated for lethargy/airway protection.
He was found to have septic shock [**1-4**] either central line (had old R subclavian central line since [**6-17**]) vs PNA.
Given concern for expansion, his coumadin was stopped (INR reversed) and he underwent IVC filter since LE dopplers showed RLE DVT.
Past Medical History: 1. severe OSA - BiPAP at 16/8 at night 2.
CVA, LARGE R MCA stroke [**6-9**] (MRA with distal occlusion R MCA), residual weakness L sided, L hemineglect, bulbar dysfunction (dysphagia s/p g-tube [**2116-6-15**], slurred speech) 6.

Found to have RLE DVT, s/p IVC filter [**7-2**].
Transfered to Gen Med [**7-5**] for further management.
Unable to perform endoscopy given high risk procedure in this patient per anesthisiology.
-plan to monitor hgb qweek while on ASA and heparin SC.
All blood/urine cultures, including RIJ tip NTD.
-cont on Vanc, cefepime, and flagyl for broad coverage, day [**7-12**] today.
-tylenol for fevers, CIS .
Intubated on [**7-1**], extubated [**7-2**].
-cont Abx as above -cont O2 to keep sats around 93%, frequent suctioning by NS when unable to swallow/clear secretions, chest PT -also cont albuterol/mucomyst nebs for cough/thick sputum.
-cont BiPAP for severe OSA -NO oral intake when depressed MS, aspiration precautions, continue speech therapy .
-appreciate neuro recs: okay to resume coumadin (for VTE) HOWEVER, will not do this given concern for unmasking GIB that we couldnt adequately eval.
-Will resume ASA 325mg (also heparin 5000U SC tid for VTE) for stroke prevention.
-keep BP with goal SBP b/w 120-160 to prevent extension of hemmorhage while maintaining cerebral perfusion -cont PT/OT, SCDs, TEDs, kinair mattress, speech therapy -plan to t/f to [**Hospital1 1319**] for long term/rehab today .
Dysphagia [**1-4**] bulbar dysfunction; s/p PEG on TF, however, surprisingly doing WELL with oral intake as long as awake/alert enough to swallow properly.
Passed swallow eval, though needs ongoing speech therapy and reassessment.
VTE: bilateral PEs, R peroneal DVT s/p IVC [**7-2**], now off coumadin given recent finding of ICH over prior stroke territory and poss GI source of dropping hgb.
-as above, will not place on couamdin as he has IVC filter and asymptomatic for his PE/DVT given high risk for GIB that we couldnt adequately rule out.
-instead will place on ASA 325mg and heparin 5000U tid.
