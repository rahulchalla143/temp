The patient was noted to have a FENA of 0.9% even with diuretics on board.
The patient was given 2 mg of intravenous Bumex in the Catheterization Laboratory with about 300 cc.
of diuresis in result.
The patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.
Bumex 2 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
Avandia 4 mg p.o.
Zestril 2.5 mg p.o.
Lopresor XL 25 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Serax 15 mg p.o.
Urinalysis with leukocyte esterase moderate, white blood cells 41, squamous epithelial cells 5.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-7-20**], ejection fraction less than 15%, severe left ventricular systolic depression with akinetic anterior septum, hypokinesis/akinesis of anterior wall, inferior wall and apex.
Three plus mitral regurgitation, two plus tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient's situation was not helped by the fact that about two doses of her Bumex were held because she was initially felt to have been over-diuresed.
She seemed to be responding well to this dose of Bumex given her urine output.
The patient was also kept on Dobutamine as an ianotropic given her severely depressed left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
Once the patient's intake was stemmed, she started becoming net negative.
To further meet these goals, the patient was started on Natrecor, initially at 0.01, and then titrated to 0.2 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
Surprisingly, her cardiac index was higher than expected at 3.28 on 12 of Dobutamine and 3 of Neo-Synephrine.
Given that the patient was already well hydrated for her treatment of sepsis, the team still felt that diuresis was the goal for this patient and to maintain at least one to two liters negative per day.
In the future, she may be possibly a candidate for biventricular pacing should the need arise.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor.
Beta blockers were held secondary to hypotension.
The patient was kept on Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine.
The patient was given Benadryl and Zantac for treatment of any possible systemic allergic reaction.
Because of her hypotension and fever, she was stared on empiric Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient also received a dose of intravenous Dexamethasone both to cover any adrenal insufficiency and for any possible allergic systemic reaction.
As already noted, she had a Swan placed on [**2122-7-25**].
Her Neo-Synephrine was also titrated down as tolerated.
The patient never came close to requiring any emergent dialysis for ultra-filtration.
The patient was placed on Renagel and Tums.
A new right sided arterial line was replaced on [**2122-7-26**].
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were discontinued.
The patient's pain was controlled with standing Tylenol and p.r.n.
