Admission Date:  [**2111-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-7-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT GREEN TEAM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatic heart disease status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement with mechanical valves on [**Hospital 197**] transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital after he presented there on [**2111-7-10**] complaining of nausea, vomiting, and weakness for two days.
At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 70s, hyperkalemic with potassium of 6.9, digitoxin toxic level of 2.9, and acute renal failure with BUN and creatinine of 96/10, and coagulopathic with an [**Year (4 digits) 263**] of 8.9.
Patient at that admission was diuresed with Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with good result and discharged on [**7-5**] with a BUN and creatinine of 20/1.1.
Following discharge, the patient was taking Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], aldactone, Glucophage, lisinopril, which had just been started at discharge.
One day after discharge on [**7-6**], the patient began experiencing lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, weakness for which he cut his ACE inhibitor dose in half.
Patient was also given D50 +10 units of insulin, 1 amp of sodium bicarb, Kayexalate, 1 amp of calcium gluconate, all for his hyperkalemia.
Patient was also bolused with normal saline and put on a dopamine drip as well as a dobutamine drip for his low systolic blood pressure to the 70s.
Patient was also given 1 amp of Digibind for his digoxin level of 2.6.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the patient's systolic blood pressure decreased to the 60s while in the parking lot, so his dopamine drip was increased to 5 mcg/kg/minute.
Rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve repair and aortic valve repair in [**2110-3-10**] complicated by atrial fibrillation and asystole requiring DDD pacemaker placement, also complicated by pericardial effusion and pleural effusions.
Status post chest tube and pleurodesis as well as a pericardial window.
Aldactone 12.5 once a day.
Digoxin 0.125 once a day.
Lasix 80 twice a day.
Lisinopril 5 once a day.
Flomax 0.4 once a day.
Metformin 500 twice a day.
Aspirin 81 once a day.
Coumadin 4 once a day.
Protonix 40 once a day.
Serzone 300 once a day.
Ambien 10 once a day.
Lipitor 10 once a day.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate of 70, blood pressure 95/37, MAP of 57, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula, temperature 98.6, respiratory rate 14.
Therapeutically, the patient was switched from his dopamine and dobutamine drips to norepinephrine drip.
Patient also given normal saline boluses of 250 cc x4 on the day of admission.
The patient's hypotension responded well to normal saline boluses, and were in the 120 range.
Patient's norepinephrine drip was tapered and stopped, and the patient's systolic blood pressure remained in the 100-115 range.
Acute renal failure:  Likely combination of prerenal due to his hypovolemia as well as secondary to his high dose of Lasix, aldactone, lisinopril, and metformin at admission.
Renal consult was brought in and believed that the acute renal failure was related to medication toxicity as well as hypotension leading to acute tubular necrosis.
Starting on the second day after admission began diuresing briskly likely due to his IV fluid boluses as well as his post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.
Patient's ACE inhibitor, Glucophage, Lasix, and digoxin were all held throughout his hospital stay.
Patient was given Zofran IV once at admission, and had no complaints of nausea or vomiting throughout his hospital stay.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient's beta blocker, aspirin, and ACE inhibitor were all held.
After numerous IV fluid boluses, the patient developed some crackles about half way up his lungs bilaterally.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Patient's fingerstick glucose remained in the 100 range throughout his hospital stay and did not require regular insulin-sliding scale.
Coagulation:  Patient's coagulopathy at admission was reversed with 6 units of fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K IV.
The patient was maintained on a Heparin drip throughout his hospital stay as he has mechanical valves.
Patient was restarted on Coumadin on [**2111-7-13**] at 4 mg.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient maintained on a renal, cardiac diet, which was tolerated well throughout his hospital stay.
Patient's potassium decreased from his elevated levels to within normal limits with in one day of his hospital stay.
Patient also placed on albuterol nebulizers prn as well as fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
Prophylaxis:  Patient on Heparin drip, proton-pump inhibitor throughout his hospital stay.
Famotidine 20 IV q12.
Odanzetron 2 mg IV q6h prn.
Insulin-sliding scale starting at 1 unit of regular insulin for fingerstick glucose of 151-200, and increasing by 1 unit for every 50 of glucose.
Salmeterol Diskus 50 mcg one inhalation per q12h.
Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled twice a day [**Hospital1 **].
Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg po or IV q4-6 prn.
Heparin IV weight based.
Albuterol nebulizer q6h prn.
Warfarin 4 mg po q hs, restarted on [**2111-7-13**].
