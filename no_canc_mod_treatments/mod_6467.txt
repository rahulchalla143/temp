Per family's report, a CXR was obtained 2 weeks ago, and they were told there was a pneumonia, so she was given a 1 week course of levofloxacin (last dose 2 days ago).
She received ASA 162mg and a dose of lasix 20mg IV for presumed heart failure.
She was seen by CT surgery, who felt that surgery would be needed to repair the tear, but that given her age and comorbidities, conservative management with BP control was indicated.
CT surgery discussed this with the patient and her family.
