Interventional radiology tagged red blood cell scan with attempted percutaneous ablation.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and IR intervention.
He received 2 units of FFP and 1 unit of packed red blood cells prior to discharge.
He had a colonsocpy on [**2175-11-18**] which showed persistent active bleeding with diffuse clots suggestive of diverticular bleed in the setting of anticoagulation with coumadin and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
The patient's INR was reversed with FFP and he also received vitamin K.  He also required blood transfusion.
He received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells and 8 units of FFP.
There was an emergency release of 3 units of packed red blood cells and 2 untis of FFP.
The pacemaker was placed due to atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.

He was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells as well 3 units of FFP and vitamin K for an INR of 3.2.
The patient was admitted to the ICU where he received 3 additional units of red blood cells.
The procedure was then aborted.
He received 3 more units of red cells to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30.
On hospital day 3, his metoprolol and lasix were resumed and his blood pressure remained stable.
Prior to discharge, an discussion was held with GI, the patient's primary care physician (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]), outpatient cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and outpatient gastroenterologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23804**]), and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] from general surgery about the option of surgical intervention for his diverticular disease and the need to weigh the risks of surgery, including possibility of total abdominal colectomy given degree of diverticular disease, bleeding on anticoagulation, and stroke off anticoagulation.
After hearing of the available options and the relative risks of each, the patient decided that he would like to hold on surgery and continue with anticoagulation to reduce his stroke risk.
He was therefore discharged home to restart his Coumadin without a bridge and to have a stress test for further risk stratification in the event that he does elect to have a surgical intervention in the future.

You received 7 units of blood on the day you were admitted.
You were also found have a slightly increased INR at 3.2 (this is the value that in monitored while you are taking Coumadin) and you were given vitamin K. Having a high INR puts you at increased risk for bleeding.
Your bleeding resolved without further intervention.
Going forward it is very important that you closely monitor your INR or coumadin level so that your blood does not become too thin.
You must also monitor for early signs of bleeding; these include increased amounts of bright red blood in your stool, lightheadedness or fast heart rate which may be felt a palpitations.
We have made several appointments with cardiology, GI, your primary care doctor and surgery to help guide your further management in preventing another GI bleed.
You should RESTART your COUMADIN, at 1mg per day on [**2175-4-5**].
You may also want to discuss the risks and benefits of coumadin therapy.
