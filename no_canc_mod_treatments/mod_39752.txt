IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis.
Is the patient a candidate for surgery or CoreValve.
Based on [**2179**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.
### Pending studies: none   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old Russian-speaking male with history of osteoarthritis s/p L hip arthroplasty in [**2165**], CAD s/p MI, critical AS non-operable due to age and comorbidities, DM2, COPD on 2L O2 at home, history of post-operative pulmonary embolism that presents principally with mechanical fall and resultant non-operative left proximal femoral periprosthetic intertrochanteric fracture.
Hospital course complicated by acute systolic heart failure likely multifactorial with large contribution secondary to excessive afterload from severe AS and flash pulmonary edema in setting of pain, constipation, and tacyhcardia.
He was placed on standing tylenol, oxycodone 5 mg prn, and lidoderm patch for pain management, which may need to be uptitrated as he mobilizes.
He was started on calcium/vitamin D and outpatient empiric treatment with bisphosphonate or BMD could be considered.
He is on lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for DVT PPX.
Continue lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for at least two weeks.
After 2 weeks, would need determination whether lovenox can be stopped and should be based on whether patient has become consistently mobile.
# Acute systolic heart failure with flash pulmonary edema in setting of critical AS Patient was not reporting angina or syncope on admission.
Patient became hypoxemic requiring 10 L O2 on FM on [**3-27**] with flash pulmonary edema in setting of tachycardia corrected with metoprolol IV and transferred to CCU.
In the CCU, he underwent diuresis (net negative 2.5 L), maintained on supplemental oxygen, and did not require biPAP.
He was converted to his home lasix 40 mg PO qD given approaching euvolemia.
Symptomatic therapy with cautious use of diuretics was recommended given patient extremely preload dependent.
He was discharged on lasix 40 mg PO qD.
He was placed on fall precautions and assessed by physical therapy.
Orthopedics advised pain control as needed and physical therapy.
He was continued on ipratroptium INH TID.
We later determined he also takes flovent at home.
He is on home oxygen (2 L at baseline) with goal pOX 87 - 93 %.
Type II DM (last A1c 6.9) Patient not on any medications at home.
He was continued on ASA 81, atorvastatin.
He is not on a beta blocker secondary to history of bradycardia.
# Insomnia Continued on trazodone  # Mild malnutrition Albumin 3.3 on labs.
# CONTACT: Daughter (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (5) 94554**]  # CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI  # Transition of care - monitor for constipation given pt started on narcotics for pain control - uptitration of pain regimen as patient begins to mobilize - continue lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for at least two weeks.
After 2 weeks, would need determination whether lovenox can be stopped and should be based on whether patient has become consistently mobile.
