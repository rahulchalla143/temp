She was given morphine 1mg IV x 2, lasix 20mg IV x 1 (leading to 300cc of urine in [**1-4**] hrs), a trial of bipap for 15 minutes with significant improvement in her symptoms.
Past Medical History: PMH: [**Location (un) 805**] syndrome, developmental delay, steroid-induced diabetes, afib with left atrial clot, diastolic CHF, COPD, diverticulitis, MR, malnutrition  PSH: mitral valvuloplasty ([**2100**] - [**Hospital1 112**])   Social History: She was at Bostonian [**Hospital1 1501**] after last discharge.
[**Name (NI) **] brothers, no longer able to walk or take care of ADLs; decline in last few months since recurrent PNAs.
Patient is status post median sternotomy.
CXR [**4-30**]: A tracheostomy tube and left-sided PICC are in unchanged positions.
#Lactic acidosis: Patient developed abd pain and required pressors overnight on [**5-3**].
She was started on pressors at times maxed levofed and neo.
Flaygl was started and surgery was consulted and determined need for emergent OR for colectomy.
She has a history of MSSA but also given her stay at a rehab facility, healthcare associated pneumonia and hospital acquired pneumonia were also considered.
Patient treated with Vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given her recent hospitalization within 90 days, her stay at rehab, and severity of illness as well as MRSA positive in her Nares.
She was put on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and home dose of steroids.
Patient was diuresed with 20 IV lasix daily.
The patient tolerated mechanical ventilation well and was switched from assist control to pressure support.
Her steroids were down titrated.
Interventional pulmonology performed a tracheostomy on [**4-26**].
She underwent IR placement of JG tube on [**4-27**].
She was put on pressure support once trached which she tolerated initially but would pull low tidal volumes and needs resting at night or after oxycodone.
On [**4-26**], she tolerated trach collar for many hours but became hypercarbic to pCO2 of 57 and was put on the vent to let her rest.
She completed 8 day course of zosyn on [**5-2**] and will complete 10 day course of linezolid on [**5-4**].
- Continue linezolid 600mg twice daily until [**5-4**] (day [**9-10**]) - Continue albuterol nebs every 6 hours, ipratropium 6 puffs QID and Flovent 6 puffs twice daily .
# Nutrition: Patient with very poor PO intake during hospitalization, albumin low at 2.9.
A Dobhoff was placed on [**2103-4-19**], with placement confirmed by x-ray.
Tube feeds were started on [**2103-4-19**] although the Dobhoff then clogged.
The patient received tube feeds during this time.
Tube feeds started through G-J tube on [**4-27**].
- Continue tube feeds: Nutren 2.0 Full strength; Starting rate: 30 ml/hr; Advance rate by 10 ml q12h Goal rate: 30 ml/hr Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml Flush w/ 30 ml water q6h - Continue multivitamin, Vitamin B12 50mcg daily and Vitamin D 400mg daily - Continue lansoprazole, simethicone and zofran for GI upset, nausea .
Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive overnight on [**4-30**] likely related to escalating doses of metoprolol amd small doses of narcotics and ultram which she seems sensitive to.
- Continue home digoxin and metoprolol per below - Limited narcotic medications for pain (oxycodone 2.5mg q8 hours if absolutely necessary).
Rate well controlled on PO diltiazem and home digoxin - this was later decreased to 30mg QID and her metoprolol decreased from 12.5 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] given bradycardia into HR50s (asymptomatic), especially when intubated.
Coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR and the patient started on lovenox bridge.
Metoprolol was uptitrated again briefly for BP and HR control, but subsequently was downtitrated due to bradycardia.
Diltiazem was stopped on [**2103-4-26**].
She was bridged back to coumadin after her procedures.
Metoprolol was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-29**] but held for hypotension and then decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
- Continue Digoxin 0.125mg daily - Continue Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily - Check INR daily as supratherapeutic on discharge.
Resume home coumadin 5mg daily when INR <2.5 .
History of dCHF: Patient with MVR s/p valvuloplasty in [**2100**].
Lasix was initially used for aggressive diuresis and beta blockers given judiciously.
The patient was felt to be overly diuresed eventually and received a few small fluid boluses while intubated, for lower urine output.
Gentle diuresis was resumed when she developed lower extremity edema ([**12-3**]+).
- Continue gentle diuresis with Furosemide 20mg daily PRN (previous home dose was 20mg daily) .
Patient continued on lantus and SSI both of which were increased/tightened throughout hospital course.
Glargine was stopped on [**4-29**] for hypoglycemia and her sliding scale was made more conservative to only cover glucose >200.
- Continue low insulin sliding scale (fingersticks every 6 hours, 2 units for BS>200, 4 units for BS>250, 6 units for BS>300).
The patient can possibly be transitioned off insulin now that she is off steroids.
COPD: Patient on recent long steroid taper since [**Month (only) 956**] [**2102**].
She was continued on standing nebs and advair, as well as steroids (intermittently home 10mg or 30mg vs. IV solumedrol).
In particular, the patient was on IV solumedrol during intubation and slowed tapered to PO steroids.
Her spiriva was ultimately restarted and atrovent was discontinued.
- Continue albuterol nebs every 6 hours, ipratropium 6 puffs QID and Flovent 6 puffs twice daily .
She was taken emergently to the OR for a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy.
She was taken to the SICU intubated and on pressors post-operatively.
She was treated with zosyn, flagyl and vanco enemas for her rectal remanant but remained floridly septic with hypotension, hypothermia and profound acidosis.
Medications were discontinued and she expired shortly thereafter.
