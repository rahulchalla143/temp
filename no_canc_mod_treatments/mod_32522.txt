The patient has been intubated, the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina with its tip.
Tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina.
The course of the nasogastric tube is constant.
There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pacer devices in place.
[**2128-3-31**] Ventricular pacing throughout falling on the end of what appears to be a P wave with thus very short interval between the P wave and the QRS complex.
# VT/VT:  The patient's paceer interrogation showed multiple episodes of VF and VT and associated firing that most likely explain her symptoms of syncope, near-syncope, and right sided tingling.
She was transferred to the ICU for sedation and intubation to reduce the catecholamine drive for these arrhythmias and reduce the number of shocks instigated.
The patient was initiated on loading doses of amiodarone to suppress her ventricular arrythmia.
She was intubated and sedated for approximately 24 hours without VT/VF.
The patient subsequently self-extubated, tolerated this well, and was diuresed to improve her volume overload.
Prior to discharge her QTc was noted to be prolonging to 490s, therefore amiodarone dose was decreased to 200 mg daily and mexiletine was initiated.
Digoxin and mexiletine doses were 50% of typical due to interaction with amiodarone.
# CORONARIES:  Last cath in [**2124**] showed clean coronaries.
Continued statin; switched from lovastatin to atorvastatin on admission due to formulary availability, switched back on discharge.
Digoxin, spironolactone, torsemide, and [**Last Name (un) **] continued.
Received 1 dose Cipro, switched to cefpodoxime due to concern of QT prolongation.
Improved the following morning, although may continue to require treatment with Tylenol.
Transitional Issues: - follow left heel pain - potential workup of elevated PTT - consider sarcoid workup for underlying etiology of arrhythmia, ACE level pending - please follow EKG for QTc prolongation given concurrent therapy with digoxin, amiodarone, and mexiletine.
- please follow electrolytes after discharge to avoid hypokalemia; may require KCl supplementation  Medications on Admission: Carvedilol 25 mg twice a day digoxin 0.125 mg daily lovastatin 20 mg daily omeprazole 20 mg daily spironolactone 25 mg daily torsemide 80 mg daily Diovan 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening  Discharge Medications: 1. digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: [**12-29**] Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You were sedated and intubated to help reduce the frequency of this irregularity.
We made the following changes to your medications: - START cefpodoxime for urinary tract infection (4 more days, last dose 4/14) - START amiodarone and mexiletine to control your heart rhythm - REDUCE your digoxin and valsartan doses, as these drugs can interact with amiodarone  Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below  Weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
You will need a basic metabolic panel to check your potassium and creatinine as well as an EKG to check QT interval.
