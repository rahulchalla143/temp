Discharged to rehab initially where she was noted to have a new 02 requirement (not on oxygen at home previously), and presented from rehab on [**12-23**] to [**Hospital3 1280**] w/ acute SOB.
Pt improved with diuretics and O2, but worsened over 24hrs and was transferred to [**Location (un) 620**] ICU on [**12-25**].
Pt did not respond to Lasix or Natrecor.
She was placed on Ceftaz in addition to coverage with Vanc/Levo, and rash developed, so ceftaz was discontinued.
On [**12-29**] pt had an episode of hypotension and was started on dopamine because she was already so fluid overloaded.

ABG at time of intubation revealed a respiratory acidosis.
The patient remained intubated until [**1-3**] when she was successfully extubated.
Post extubation the patient continued to have intermitent episodes of tachypnea and hypoxia requiring additional oxygen supplementation in the form of a face mask and nasal cannula.
She improved quickly after onset of these episodes when she received treatment with IV lasix, albuterol nebs, and morphine.
At the time of discharge she was stable on 2 L NC but had additional supplemental O2 requirements during exertion.
She was not using this therapy on a regular basis but it could potentially be useful in the future.
CV: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG with reportedly patent grafts by cath [**2119**].
During her hospital stay, patient initially required blood pressure support with dopamine in the setting of initial sepsis.
She was quickly weaned off pressors and did not require any additional BP support during her stay.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed soon after her initial arrival to the ICU in order to differentiate the nature of her shock (cardiogenic vs. septic).
The catheter was used for several days for intensive monitoring to keep MAP >60, CVP >10, and PAWP >20.
At the time of discharge the patient continued to be on a statin, ASA, B-blocker, and ACE for BP control.
She may require a cath to revaluate her cardiac function after discharge from rehab.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the time of discharge the pt still had evidence of fluid overload as part of her CHF exacerbation and was benefiting from continued diuresis with Lasix.
Renal was consulted during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay for concern for AIN in setting of Ceftaz administration but results from urine sediment were more consistent with ATN (muddy brown casts seen in urine and patient had relatively quick recovery).
Patient was started on steroids on admission in the setting of sepsis and continued for suspected AIN, will be discharged on a slow oral taper of prednisone.
Subclavian artery puncture during central line placement: Occurred during night of admission.
The patient did require transfusions during her hospital stay.
She completed a 14 day course of Flagyl while at [**Hospital1 18**] and surveillence c diff after therapy was negative.
Coagulopathy: On transfer, patient had an elevated INR as she was on coumadin previously s/p CVA.
She was reversed and coumadin was held during her admission here.
After initial removal of hardware on [**12-5**] the patient was started On vanco and levo and was planned to continue these antibiotics until [**2121-1-19**] for supposed GNR and definite GPC on gram stain in OR [**12-5**].
The patient also had a JP drain which remained in place until the day of discharge and was placed in traction transiently per ortho.
After I&D by ortho on [**1-2**] the patient received a one time dose of Zosyn and the rash flared up again.
They agreed with drug-reaction etiology and stated no treatment was necessary, it would resolve over time and Vanc should be continued to treat the Right hip infxn.
