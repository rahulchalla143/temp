HPI: Ms. [**Known firstname **] is a 44 year old woman with a history of childhood ASD repair, and in [**9-/2132**], an ascending aortic dissection treated with a 30mm tube graft and a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical aortic valve.
Post operatively a [**Company 1543**] Sigma SDR303 B pacemaker was placed due to complete heart block.
She has not had a TTE, stress test, or cath since that procedure.
At baseline, she uses a wheelchair due to extremely poor exercise tolerance.
These films were also reviewed with surgery and comparison to prior films showed similar aneurysm present 1 and a half years ago and perhaps some persistance as early as [**2131**] (difficult to read the film from '[**31**]).
Past Medical History: ASD repair 7 years of age [**9-15**] Ascending aortic dissection treated emergently with 30 mm tube graft and mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve.
HTN Breast reduction surgery Cholecystectomy Foot surgery TAH/BSO Arthritis PM for complete heart block (s/p arrest post operatively [**9-15**])   Social History: Lives with husband and daughter.
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
There is delayed enhancement of the false lumen within the descending aorta, with near equal mixture of contrast more inferiorly, suggesting possible prior dissection fenestration procedure.
There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and aortic valve/ascending aortic repair.

Neuro Consult for Headaches: Impression: Patient is a 43 year old woman with complicated past cardiac history with history of ascending aortic dissection status post AVR and graft, complete heart block, congestive heart failure, with admission for dyspnea.
Recs: -Soft cervical collar and hard pillow qHS -NSAIDs or other antiinflammatory for pain relief in place of narcotics -Continue Valium (try 2 mg tid standing as not as sedating) or can substitue Skelaxin 800 mg po tid or Flexeril 5-10 mg po tid for neck spasm -CT C spine to rule out acute disc herniation -Heat and/or massage to the neck might be helpful -If there remains concern for aneurysm and subarachnoid bleed, CTA of the head is reportedly 95% sensitive for this but would not be able to rule it out completely   Brief Hospital Course: # Ischemia: Had cardiac catheterization to r/o ischemic etiology of CHF, which demonstrated clean coronaries.
Her ASA therefore was discontinued upon discharge.
# Pump: CHF thought most likely to be due to cardioplegia stemming from prior dissection and valve surgery.
Decision made to pursue BiV pacer and ICD placement due to low EF and possible dysynchrony seen on TTE.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] also had markedly elevated right-sided pressures on cardiac cath, with PCWP 42, and was aggressively diuresed for several days.
She was treated medically with ASA, metoprolol, and captopril (which were transitioned to Toprol XL and lisinopril prior to d/c).
She was started on digoxin 0.25mg PO qD and spironolactone 25mg PO qD, and was set up with CHF nursing, with an outpatient appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.
Nutrition was also consulted for assistance in educating Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] about low sodium, and coumadin diet.
Lead placement good, capturing well.
Complicated by moderate hematoma in pacer pocket, heparin transiently held.
Received vancomycin 1gm IV bid x 48 hours, then Keflex 250mg PO qid x 5 days periprocedurally.
CTA was done, which confirmed aortic dissection extending to level of iliac bifurcation distally (see above for details).
# Aortic Valvulopathy:  St Jude valve in place.
Maintained on heparin bridge to coumadin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.
She was instructed to hold her coumadin for 1 day, then restart, and to follow up on [**5-24**] to have her INR rechecked.
She did have notable trapezius spasm, and was treated symptomatically with tylenol and cyclobenzaprine.
