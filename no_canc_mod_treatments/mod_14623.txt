Her clinical exam was limited by the fact that the patient received high doses of paralytics prior to transfer.
Despite the paralysis, patient had frequent twitchings on both arms and we decided to load the patient immediately with fosphenytoin 1000mg and gave ativan 4mg.
She was also put on propofol and the twitching stopped.
The patient was maintained on dilantin while in house with no subsequent seizures.
Homocysteine level should also be checked, and perhaps a hypercoaguability workup as well if indicated.
Patient was started on folate conservatively.
She did have hypertension above her goal SBP of 130mmHg, and was thus started and maintained on lisinopril without side effects.
