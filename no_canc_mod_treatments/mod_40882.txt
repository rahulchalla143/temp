She underwent cardioversion and converted to sinus rhythm.
She was started on amiodarone and digoxin was stopped, and continued on heparin until right groin presented with hematoma.
She underwent ultrasound that ruled out pseudo aneurysm and vascular surgery was consulted.
She did have drop in hct from admission at 32 down to 24.8 and was transfused with packed red blood cells, and responded appropriately.
