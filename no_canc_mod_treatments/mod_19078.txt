The right internal jugular line was removed in the meantime interval.
CXR Portable ([**2141-10-21**]): Interval removal of tracheostomy tube.
Brief Hospital Course: 53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failure; s/p recent trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions; now s/p replacement of trach and continued labile BP of unclear etiology.
COPD exacerbation also on differential given considerable wheezing on admission.
Initially treated with vancomycin, ceftaz, and TMP-SMX (given history of Stenotrophomonas).
As no clear indication of active pneumonia (afebrile, slightly elevated WBC count which may be due to steroid therapy, and + culture thought to be colonizers), was started on treatment with short course of ceftaz for bronchitis.
Tobramycin, which was initially added for double coverage of pseudomonas, and vancomycin were discontinued.
- Steroids initially increased and tapered to home dose on discharged (hydrocortisone 20mg PO QAM, 5mg PO QPM) - Needs aggressive sunctioning for continued considerable secretions - Staying on vent may be best option given patient?????
On discharge decreased steroid dose to home regimen as above.
Continued effexor, risperdal and depakote.
Continued valproic acid as above.
