He had successful L4-L5 laminectomy on [**2184-1-20**].
On [**2183-1-22**] he developed chest/shoulder pain, tachycardia, EKG changes and troponin elevation consistent with [**Date Range 7792**].
Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia, so he was started on antibiotics for HCAP coverage.
He was transitioned from 4L NC to face tent with 35% Oxygen.
He was administered 5mg IV metoprolol with improvement of heart rate to the 110s, but also a drop in SBP to the 80s.
He was given 500cc NS over 60 minutes and transferred to the CCU for further management of Afib with RVR.
He previously had one episode of atrial fibrillation following his CABG.
Rate control was attempted with diltiazem 5 mg IV.
Past Medical History: PMH: CAD w/ MI, mild chronic stable angina, hypercholesterol, abdominal hernia, PAD PSH: CABG [**54**], [**2181-5-2**] R [**Name (NI) 1793**] PTA/stent  Social History: Lives with wife.

3.Medical management for [**Last Name (un) 7792**].
4.No need to continue heparin and would not manage with clopidogrel given recent spine surgery.
ETT: [**2184-1-7**] INTERPRETATION: 69 yo man s/p CABG in [**2154**] and stent to LAD in [**2170**] was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort.
The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes.
The hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion was appropriate.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-LAD anastomosis stenosis and distal 50% stenosis with a 2.25x20mm Taxus Atom stent that was postdilated to 2.5mm in the mid and proximal portion.
CTA chest [**2184-1-23**] FINDINGS: Sternal wires and post CABG changes are present.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, including an intrafissural component of effusion on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and PCI, PVD and h/o [**Hospital **] transferred to CCU on POD#3 [**2184-1-22**] s/p L4-L5 laminectomy, with [**Month/Day/Year 7792**].
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
ASA 81 mg was resumed as well on POD 3 as dictated preoperatively by his cardiologist.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol.
The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet.
Foley was removed on POD#2.
#[**Date Range 7792**]/ACS - pt s/p [**Date Range 7792**] [**2184-1-22**] in postop setting.
Medical management for [**Month/Day/Year 7792**] was pursued.
CP resolved until [**1-28**] when pt had midnight episode of chest tightness - he described this as similar to previous episodes at home relieved with nitro although those episodes on exertion and this time lying in bed.
Again pronounced ECG depressions in same leads (anterolateral and inferior) which resolved within 10 minutes, this time pt was administered IV metoprolol with po for longer-lasting effect.
Isosorbide dinitrate was started, which was exchanged for nitro patch prior to discharge.
Patient also started on Renolazine.
- recurrent episodes of nocturnal stable angina managed by uptitration of antianginals: nitro patch and Ranolazine.
Apart from [**Name (NI) 7792**], pt also had fevers, leukocytosis, and CXR findings concerning for ?pneumonia on transfer to the CCU.
Initially rate was controlled with dilt drip and pt was anticoagulated with heparin gtt (no bolus - this was approved by orthopedics in post-op setting) and was initiated in setting of [**Last Name (Titles) 7792**].
PT was monitored on telemetry, and did not require electrical cardioversion as he was never unstable.
[**2184-1-26**] pt started on metoprolol and loaded with digoxin and given daily doses until [**2184-2-1**].
After adequate diuresis and resolution of decompensated heart failure, patient spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and digoxin was discontinued.
Given high CHADS score, patient was continued on anticoagulation for PAF with heparin gtt transitioned to warfarin.
On day of discharge, INR was 2.0 - initiation of metoprolol to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control - initiation of warfarin for anticoagulation  # CAD: Patient has known CAD, s/p CABG and occluded SVG-RCA.
s/p Echo which showed no new wall motion abnormalities, EF 45% at baseline, s/p cardiac catheterisation which showed OM1 lesion.
No stents placed, plan was to continue medical management.
Continued on aspirin 325, initially heparin gtt, plavix was held as pt was in post-op setting.
Metoprolol initially not tolerated by the pt but was eventually able to wean from dilt gtt and metoprolol was started.
Continued rosuvastatin and glucose control.
- optimize medical management for CAD: ASA 325mg, initiation of bblocker, statin - if renal function stabilzes, please consider initiation of ACEI  #fevers/leukocytosis: On transfer to CCU pt had fevers, leukocytosis>16, CXR findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.
Antibiotics continued for 7d HCAP treatment course.
Fever/leukocytosis and tachycardia along with recent immobility s/p spinal surgery, high risk for PE.
Pt was started on empiric heparin gtt for [**Year (4 digits) 7792**] which also addressed possibility of PE.
Initially hct monitored QID in setting of beginning heparin gtt.
Patient reported his last colonoscopy 10 years ago, due for a followup colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 956**], of note his mother died of colon CA at age 63.
Pt was significantly fluid overloaded on transfer to the CCU and was diuresed aggressively on lasix gtt transitioned to boluses.
HCAP coverage was continued to cover possible septic state from multifocal pna.
BP improved with control of Afib and aggressive diuresis.
#hyperkalemia - central venous line was placed to deliver larger quantities of potassium.
Hyperkalemia resolved with aggressive diuresis.
At this time levoquin was DCd (see fever/leukocytosis above, C/f HCAP) and flagyl was initiated, with good response.
Pt eventually tolerated liquids and diet was advanced without issue.
#singultus - pt was given thorazine for hiccups and became extremely somnolent with difficulty finding words.
Pt was treated with ativan prn with good effect.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - continue medical management of CAD/ angina with uptitration of nitrates as needed.
Currently on nitro patch and ranolazine.
Also on ASA, bblocker and statin - continue anticoagulation with coumadin for paroxysmal afib - consider initiation of ACEI given significant CHF once renal function has stabilized - f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] as needed for laminectomy   Medications on Admission: ALBUTEROL SULFATE [PROAIR HFA] - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 1  puff tid prn HYDROCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN - 5 mg-500 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by  mouth [**Hospital1 **] prn NITROGLYCERIN - 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual - Place one tablet under tongue for chest pain, repeat every 5 minutes times 2 prn  Lipitor TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE - 0.1 % Cream - apply topically to legs  once every 1-2 weeks as needed Lovenox OMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [PRILOSEC OTC] - (OTC) - 20 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
