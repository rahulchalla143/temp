On the day of delivery with recurrent vaginal bleeding, decision was made to deliver via cesarean section.
Routine measures provided a good response.
Early Neonatal Intensive Care Unit course was remarkable for evidence of respiratory distress with grunting, retractions and oxygen requirement and the infant was placed on CPAP and managed in the Intensive Care Unit.
Due to persistent respiratory distress and nonresponsive to CPAP, infant was intubated and given Survanta.
The infant remained on mechanical ventilation and was intubated for a total of three days.
He was electively transitioned to nasopharyngeal CPAP at 6 cm of water on day of life 3.
He was transitioned off of CPAP to nasal cannula oxygen and then room air by day of life 5.
He was bolused with caffeine prior to extubation and did demonstrate some mild evidence of apnea of prematurity following extubation.
He remains on maintenance caffeine.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Due to the mechanical ventilation and moderate degree of surfactant deficiency, he was kept npo for the first days of life.
He received parenteral nutrition for two days, after which he was slowly advanced up on his feedings.
He is currently receiving 130 cc per kg per day of mother's milk 20.
His most recent set of electrolytes was obtained on the [**1-18**] of sodium 142, potassium 5.7, chloride 108, bicarbonate 21 with anion gap of 19.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  He has had a soft abdomen and is tolerating his feeds with minimal residuals and we are just advancing these feeds slowly.
Phototherapy was started at that time.
Medications:  The infant is on caffeine citrate 15 mg po pg daily.
