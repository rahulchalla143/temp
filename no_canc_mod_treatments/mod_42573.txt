He remained in atrial flutter with heparin for anticoagulation.
He was occasionally tachycardic to the low 100s which was treated successfully times two with intravenous Lopressor.
The patient was started on intravenous acyclovir and maintained on this throughout his hospital course.
Two times over the course of the hospitalization, the patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit in order to receive BiPAP treatment overnight.
He was also given a course of intravenous steroids which was later tapered to p.o.
The patient was also started on levofloxacin and Flagyl to treat possible aspiration pneumonia; although, a sputum culture ended up being negative, and the Infectious Disease consultation did not think the patient had a pneumonia, and these antibiotics were subsequently discontinued.
He was also started on prophylactic antibiotic eyedrops.
Initially, it was thought that the patient's altered mental status might be secondary to Tylenol No.
He was continued on nasal CPAP; however, two hours prior to the initial finding of hypotension and bradycardia, the patient expired at 1 o'clock in the morning of [**2138-9-25**].
