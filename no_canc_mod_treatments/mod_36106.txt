She was discharged on warfarin 3mg orally daily.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 69**].
This blood clot likely came after your surgery, and formed in your legs then traveled to your lungs.
You were given medications to thin your blood, and will continue treatment for at least 6 more months.
You have been started on a medication called warfarin (AKA Coumadin).
The effects of this medication are checked with a blood test called the international normalized ratio (AKA INR).
Your INR is a number that reflects the "thinness" of your blood, and the goal INR for your treatment is between [**1-6**].
Your INR will need to be checked frequently in the beginning of your treatment (3-5 times a week), and will gradually be checked less (3-4 times a month) as your medical team helps adjust your medication to keep your INR between [**1-6**].
You should anticipate occassional warfarin dose adjustments (maybe more in the beginning), in order to keep your INR in the 2-3 range.
Warfarin metabolism is affected by the foods you eat, specifically leafy green vegetables.
You can eat the same foods you usually eat, but avoid drastically changing your diet and speak with your physician before changing your diet as your warfarin dose may need to be adjusted.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is important that if you suffer a fall or traumatic injury while taking warfarin that you call your doctor or report to the emergency room for evaluation to make sure you are not bleeding internally.
Please take all medications as instructed.
Please note the following medication changes: *NEW: -Warfarin 3mg orally daily (oral blood thinning medication; note that the dose may have to be changed) -nystatin  100,000 unit/mL Suspension  Sig:  Five (5) ML orally 4 times a day for thrush for 10 days.
-ranitidine 150 mg oral daily (acid suppression medication) -Senna 8.6 mg tablets 2x a day as needed for constipation (stimulant laxative) -Colace 100 mg capsule 2x a day (stool softener) -Methyl salicylate-menthol oitnment apply topically as needed for pain -Nitrofurantoin 100mg orally twice daily for 14 days -Tramadol 50mg [**12-5**] pills every 6 hours as needed for pain.
*CHANGED: -Increase your dose of lisinopril from 2.5mg to 10mg by mouth daily.
-Decreased the dose of your potassium chloride pill to 10mEq (1 tab) per day.
Please stop your home metoprolol as well.
You will need to be followed the [**Hospital 197**] clinic for monitoring of your blood INR while you are on Coumadin (also known as warfarin)  *Anticipated stay at rehab is less than 30 days.
