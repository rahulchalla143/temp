AEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):     ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):  CXR [**5-31**]:  CHEST AP: Compared to the earlier exam, there has been interval placement of a right IJ CVL.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation s/p recent hospitalization for ablation, discharged on [**5-18**], who returns with fatigue x 3 days, and fever to 102 with chills, found to have UTI by UA and evidence of pyelonephritis on CT scan, hypotension on admission responsive to 4 L IVF, thought to be urosepsis.
Changed to PO antibiotics when transferred to the floor.
Possibly with acquisition of pyelo during last admission during which time she probably had a foley catheter in.
Post hydration, patient was euvolemic to hypervolemic - she had rales at bases, CHF on CXR [**5-31**], we encouraged PO intake and patient did not require further IVF.
Patients home atenelol was held but restarted as an outpatient.
Given recent groin instrumentation during a-flutter ablation, could have had significant bleeding into groin - has large ecchymosis in R groin.
More likely bled into L groin though, given intense L groin pain 1 week ago (however this could also be related to UTI).
Held atenolol given hypotension, but restarted on discharge - bp 140 at one point.
