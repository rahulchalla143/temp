Nasogastric tube with both side port and the tip above the gastroesophageal junction raised increased risk for aspiration.
The tube should be advanced at least 12 cm.
NG tube with both tip and side port above the GE junction should be advanced at least 12 cm.
Micro: None  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 56 year old woman with Crohn's disease complicated by rectovaginal fistula and multiple SBOs s/p multiple abdominal surgeries, also with prior SVC surgery now on fondaparinux, who was transferred to ICU from ED for hypotension and HCT drop of 15 in past 4 days likely due to her right upper extremity hematoma.
The most likely source of this anemia is acute blood loss from large hematoma in RUE (below) thought to be related to trauma from venipuncture on routine outpatient lab work in the setting of her anticoagulation with fondaparinux.
Her fondaparinux was discontinued by her PCP on Thursday [**10-30**].
# Right Upper Ext Hematoma: Likely due to deep stick in right antecubital fossa on Monday while on fondaparinux for her SVC surgery in [**2115**].
Surgery was consulted and felt that no surgical intervention was indicated.
Of note, patient ate solid foods including a hamburger in the ED and oatmeal for breakfast the following morning while advised to be NPO.
She responded well to IV fluids and did not require pressors.
Her home antihypertensives were held on admission and restarted on discharge.
She was given one dose of levofloxacin emperically in the ED, but there was no concern for infection on the floor and this was discontinued.
# Pain Management: Patient's home pain regimen had been escalated by PCP given pain from hematoma (above) to 4-8 mg dilaudid PO Q4H prior to admission.
S/p ~13 surgeries including transverse / ascending colectomy with ostomy reversal in [**2096**].
Patient symptoms resolved the morning after admission following a bowel movement.
She was noted to have stenoses of right subclavian and SVC and underwent angioplasty by IR in [**2115**].
She has been anticoagulated as outpatient on fondaparinux, though this was held by PCP two days prior to admission.
Euthyroid on exam, home levothyroxine 50mcg po daily was continued.
# Hypertension: Home antihypertensives were held on admission given transient hypotension (above) and were restarted on discharge.
If she needs emergency access, she will require intraosseous access.
# Hx HIT: Avoid all heparin products.
# Transitional issues: - Patient should have hematocrit checked within 1-3 days of discharge to monitor for stability (last hct 24.6)  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
