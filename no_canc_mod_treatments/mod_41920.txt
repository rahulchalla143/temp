Nasogastric tube looped above the diaphragm, likely in the patient's hiatal hernia.
The nasogastric tube has been removed.
Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC.
Nasogastric tube looped on itself within a hiatal hernia with the tip extending superiorly into the esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the ACS service in the Emergency Room and admitted to the hospital for conservative treatment of his partial small bowel obstruction with IV hydration, gastric decompression with a nasogastric tube and serial exams.
He had no pain and no elevation of his creatinine therefore this incidental finding would be worked up if it did not pass on its own.
He did have some low urine output which responded to IV fluids but that was secondary to low intravascular volume as opposed to renal failure from an obstructing stone.
His NG tube was replaced due to persistent vomiting and eventually his abdomen was soft however his ostomy was not active.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
A PICC line was placed on [**2105-9-18**] for hyperalimentation as he continued to be NPO.
By post op day #5 he developed anasarca and was treated with IV Lasix and 25% Albumin.
A nasogastric tube was replaced and he had a Ct scan of the chest and abdomen revealing a new right upper lobe pneumonia.
Urine and blood cultures were negative and he was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
He underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest PT incentive spirometry and nebulizer treatments.
He was given a ten day course of antibiotics for his physical and xray findings and all of his cultures including sputum were negative.
He had his ostomy digitalized and eventually had an enema which helped to increase output.
He began clear liquids on post op day 15 as his ileus seemed to resolve.
He improved with vigorous diuresis and was eventually placed on daily lasix.
He eventually was able to take ground solids and nectar thick liquids without aspirating.
On [**2105-9-27**], zosyn was changed to cefepime for pneumonia.
He became febrile on [**2105-10-4**], and all antibiotics were stopped and PICC was pulled with tip sent for culture.
On [**2105-10-9**], CTA chest was obtained for poor respirations, finding acute pulmonary embolism, and the patient was started on a heparin gtt.
The patient was started on vancomycin and meropenem.
A perihepatic abscess was found and a drain was placed by IR.
Infectious disease did not recommend anti-fungal antibiotics.
Due to aspiration risk, on [**2105-10-14**], a G-J tube was placed by IR.
On [**2105-10-15**], due to failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, the patient underwent bedside tracheostomy.
The patient was continued on heparin gtt and started on warfarin for PE.
When the perihepatic abscess drain ceased to produce fluid, it was withdrawn.
At the time of discharge on [**2105-10-21**], the patient's ventilatory dependence was weaned to CPAP on PEEP 5.
He was receiving vancomycin (most recent course started on [**2105-10-9**]) and meropenem (most recent course started on [**2105-10-10**]) for pneumonia and peri-hepatic abscess.
Antibiotic requirements should be reassessed after 4 weeks of antibiotics.

Please call your doctor or go to the emergency department if: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
Please take any new medications as prescribed.
G-J tube Care: *Please look at the drain site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warmth, and fever).
*You may shower and wash the drain site gently with warm, soapy water.
Place a drain sponge for cleanliness.
These include wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your head.
Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet: Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.
Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin.
These foods contain vitamin K: Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli, Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower, Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens, Parsley, Kale, Endive.
Be careful on special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually would on any regular day of the week.
It is very important to talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, vitamins, or herbal products.
