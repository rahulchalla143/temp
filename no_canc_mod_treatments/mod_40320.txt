Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o male with HTN, HLD, h/o AR and ascending aortic aneurysm s/p AVR c/b pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis and pericardial window who presents with recurrent pericardial effusion without echocardiographic findings of tamponade physiology.
He had an echo which demonstrated a significant amount of pericardial fluid but without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
It was determined that his pericardial effusion was not the cause of his syncopal event or intermittent shortness of breath and no further management of this issue was undertaken at this time.
His home lasix was discontinued as it was beleived that he was likely hypovolemic and that his event may have been caused by orthostatic hypotension.
He was arranged with outpatient follow-up.
He was briefly taken off his coumadin and managed on heparin drip for his [**Hospital3 9642**] valve but his coumadin was resumed when it was determined he would not require a procedure.
He was continued on his home metoprolol but his home lasix was discontinued.
His tamsulosin was initially held for concern of tamponade but was later continued.
He was instructed to take this medication at night given our concern for possible orthostatic hypotension.
He was continued on his home latanoprost and brinzolamide eye drops.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -He will need continued close outpatient monitoring of his symptoms as he may develop tamponade in the future if his pericardial window malfunctions.
