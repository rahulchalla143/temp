CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):  On [**12-8**], at 12:30, the patient was found to be unresponsive.
The patient had not received any narcotics, and the only medications were intravenous Lopressor and intravenous antibiotics.
The patient had a further neurologic workup including a tensilon test which was stopped secondary to bradycardia; however, an acetylcholine antibody receptor was sent off and was still pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient was started on Lovenox treatment dosing until his Coumadin resulted in a therapeutic INR.
The patient was to continue to be anticoagulated with a goal INR of 2 to 3 and was to continue Lovenox bridging until he reaches that goal.
The following day, the patient did have some increasing gas; however, after tube feeds were held and given some simethicone this resolved.
The patient did have a little bit of diarrhea with his tube feeds which was likely secondary to daily lactulose.
Otherwise, the patient was continued on his antibiotics of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration.
Otherwise, the patient was continued on his prophylactic regimen of proton pump inhibitor, bowel regimen, and Lovenox and Coumadin as described above.
The patient was unable to take nifedipine secondary to an inability to crush the tablet for administration through his gastrojejunostomy tube.
