At echocardiogram so the patient was started on Oxacillin intravenous for empiric treatment of SBE.
The patient was discharged to rehab with plans for a total six weeks of treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

IMPRESSION:  Given the patient's presentation with the petechial rash, low grade fevers, peripheral eosinophils, elevated serum creatinine and onset of symptoms ten to twelve days after Oxacillin was started the presumptive diagnosis was Oxacillin induced acute interstitial nephritis.
Given his acute renal failure the patient's Furosemide and Lisinopril were held, Oxacillin was discontinued and Levaquin was started.
Although the rash was most likely secondary to Oxacillin induced AIN, given the associated acute renal failure and low grade fever the possibility of vasculitis was considered and serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent.
Arterial blood gas was performed, which showed 7.29/37/99 on 3 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.
He was then transferred to the MICU where he became hypotensive and transiently required pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
He was therefore started on intravenous steroids for empiric therapy of AIN as well as bicarb to increase his serum pH.
Given his hypotension the resulting concern for sepsis the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened with the addition of Vancomycin to Levofloxacin.
He was continued on steroids and bicarb and he was started on Furosemide drip with Dyazide diuretics for clinically apparent congestive heart failure exacerbation.
He was also started on Hydralazine for after load reduction.
A trial of weaning the patient off ventilators was not attempted secondary to his metabolic acidosis.
The patient was also started on tube feeds.
On hospital day number seven a right Quinton catheter was placed and the patient was initiated on hemodialysis.
He was then started on Fluconazole renally dosed and the PICC line was pulled.
ID Service felt the patient should be started on Vancomycin for a treatment of MMSA bacteremia and that Levaquin should be stopped.
At that point Fluconazole was stopped and Prednisone was restated for treatment of AIN.
On hospital day number ten sputum culture with gram stain showed gram positive cocci, which was speciated to staph aureus and the patient was continued on Vancomycin.
He was therefore started on a steroid taper and was hydrated with fluids to maintain blood pressure and renal perfusion.
Given his continued improvement there appeared to be no indication for further hemodialysis and therefore the patient's Quinton catheter was removed on hospital day number twelve.
He also experienced an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation on hospital day number fourteen and was started on Metoprolol.
Urine sediment demonstrated muddy brown casts and nondimorphic red blood cells consistent with ATN.
Given these findings in concert with the BUN of 169 on hospital day number seventeen he was strongly encouraged to take ample po fluids with a goal of avoiding treatment with intravenous fluids.
The patient's BUN had slowly decreased to 141 with intravenous fluid although his mental status was inconsistent and his po intake remained poor.
A 24 hour urine collection done demonstrated alarmingly low creatinine clearance of 14 and therefore his collection was repeated for confirmation.
In addition, given the patient's poor po intake an nasogastric tube was placed on hospital day number 23 in order to initiate tube feeds.
The patient pulled his nasogastric tube within 24 hours and he subsequently pulled out at least five more nasogastric tubes during the next several days.
On subsequent examinations the patient refused to answer questions through an interpretor and given the presumptive diagnosis of depression the patient was started on Paxil empirically.
A temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed on hospital day number 27 and hemodialysis was initiated on hospital day number 28.
The patient received three straight days of hemodialysis and by hospital day number 33 after four rounds of hemodialysis the patient's BUN had fallen to 41 and his mental status appeared to improve.
Given his chronically poor po intake and his multiple episodes of pulling out feeding tubes the patient received a PEG tube, which was placed on hospital day number 31.
He was initially scheduled to receive both a Perm-A-Cath and a PEG tube on hospital day 31, but the patient's family refused Perm-A-Cath placement, which was instead tentatively arranged to be done on an outpatient basis.
Tube feeds were initiated after the procedure, which the patient tolerated without difficulty.
By the time of this dictation the patient received a steroid taper for acute interstitial nephritis and he had completed six weeks of antibiotic treatment for MMSA bacteremia and MRSA sputum culture.
He was stable on his medication regimen and stable for discharge to rehab.
