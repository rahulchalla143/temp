This alternated with mixed frequency alpha (8 Hz) and theta ([**7-14**] Hz) waveforms.
There were also infrequent bifrontal bursts of low amplitude 1 Hz delta which were superimposed with beta activity.

CSURG FA6A [**2150-9-8**] 8:41 AM CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**0-0-**] Reason: eval for effusion  Final Report INDICATION: Status post CABG, evaluate for pleural effusions.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
On [**8-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass grafting.
Dilantin was inititated.
Given the EEG findings, Keppra was added to Dilantin while Ativan was given prn.
Feeding tube was subsequently placed to ensure adequate nutrition.
She otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and was transfused with PRBCs to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
A third antiseizure medication Vimpat was added, and Propofol was started for EEG burst suppression therapy.
Amiodarone was initiated on postoperative day six for episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Empiric antibiotics were started on postoperative day seven for concern of RLL consolidation versus pleural effusion.
Following extubation, she underwent speech and swallow evaluation which showed a functional swallowing mechanism without overt sign/symptoms of aspiration.
Her diet was therefore advanced and tube feeds were discontinued.
Anticonvulsant therapy was continued per neurology recommendations, and cardiac medications were titrated accordingly.
While at rehab, she will continue to require speech therapy in addition to physical and occupational therapies.
At discharge, her pain was well controlled and surgical incisions were healing well.
