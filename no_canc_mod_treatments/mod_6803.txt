Her oxygen saturation was found to be 77% on room air and increased to 88% with 2 or 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
A chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion, so the patient was given Furosemide 40 mg IV.
Following diuresis, her respiratory rate decreased, and her oxygen saturation improved to the mid 90s on 6 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was subsequently given Metoprolol 5 mg IV for a blood pressure of 181/106; she also received 1 in of Nitropaste and an Aspirin.
She was transferred to the floor after receiving an additional 25 mg of Captopril p.o.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On initial exam, temperature was 96.9?????
LABORATORY DATA:  On initial laboratory evaluation, white count was 12.4, hematocrit 47.3, platelet count 196,000, white count differential demonstrated 89.9 segs, no bands, 6.4 lymphs, 3 monocytes, 0.2 eosinophils, 0.5 basophils; PT 21.3, PTT 30.9, INR 3.0; initial serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarb 25, BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 202; initial CK was 115, MB fraction 5, troponin 0.5; initial urinalysis demonstrated large blood, greater than 300 protein, [**4-27**] red cells, [**1-20**] white cells, many bacteria, no yeast, 0-2 epithelial cells.
The patient was therefore treated with Levofloxacin for her pneumonia.
She was also started on BIPAP for her respiratory failure which was subsequently used as needed for respiratory distress.
She was given BIPAP, intravenous steroids, and Nitroglycerin sublingually, Furosemide, and nebulizer treatments.
She was subsequently found to have E. coli resistant to Levofloxacin on a urine culture, so her Ceftriaxone was continued.
She was therefore continued on her antihypertensive medications and her other outpatient medications as noted above.
Her LFTs were normal, and the patient was subsequently started on Atorvastatin.
They also recommended crushing her medications in pureed foods.
On transfer, she continued to breath at a respiratory rate of 40 but appeared clinically comfortable.
As noted above, she was started on Atorvastatin.
Her blood pressure remained elevated ranging between 160-190 systolic throughout her time on the Medicine Floor; therefore, her blood pressure medications were titrated up as noted below.
While this finding was though to most likely represent contamination and not true infection, and given that the patient was clinically improving with a combination of Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone, the decision was made to not treat the patient for her MRSA in her sputum; however, should the patient clinically decompensate in the future, treatment of her MRSA should clearly be considered.
