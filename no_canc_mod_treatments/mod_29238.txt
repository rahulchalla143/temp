[**Doctor First Name **] s/p MVC and increasing rigidity on exam in all extremities REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**Doctor First Name **] pontine lesion, please perform with Gad CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES  TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
INDICATION: Question [**Doctor First Name **] status post MVC and increasing rigidity on exam in all extremities, evaluate pontine lesion, please perform with gadolinium.
MR OF THE BRAIN: The examination is markedly limited by patient motion during image acquisition on nearly all sequences.
A right frontal subdural collection containing hemorrhagic products which are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on gradient echo sequences, is increased in size from the prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**5-25**] and probably stable in size in comparison with the head CT of [**6-3**], [**2128**].
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  Reason: [**Location (un) **] obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 23 year old man with diffuse axonal injury s/p open G-tube placement, with emesis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**Hospital **] obstruction INDICATION: 70-year-old male with head trauma, NG tube placement.
FINDINGS: The NG tube is in unchanged position in the left mid abdomen.
The NG tube has been removed.
He was also placed on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis; this was eventually discontinued.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63264**] in 3 months with repeat head imaging.
He remained in the ICU for several weeks; he initially had problems with elevated heart rate and blood pressure; both improved with IV Lopressor and Hydralazine.
A tracheostomy and PEG were placed on [**5-30**]; he was eventually weaned off the ventilator.
Patient pulled his tracheostomy out on HD #30; he maintained adequate airway control throughout the day and evening and so the tracheostomy was not replaced.
He did have an ileus with fevers, concerning for obstruction; his tube feedings were placed on hold.
The ileus did eventually resolve; his tube feedings were restarted; he was started on Reglan and is currently tolerating these with minimal residuals.
Vascular surgery was consulted for placement of IVC filter given his high risk for thromboembolism.
