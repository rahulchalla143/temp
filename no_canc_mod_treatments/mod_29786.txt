Hypoxemia/Acute systolic heart failure:  On initial presentation, CXR demonstrated possible right lower lobe pneumonia, so patient was started on levofloxacin.
However, symptoms did not improve x 2 days, and crackles were heard on exam, so repeat CXR was performed and demonstrated volume overload.
The patient was treated with IV lasix for diuresis, was started on an ACE I for afterload reduction, with improvement in symptoms and oxygen requirement.
He will be medically managed with Lasix 40 mg po qday, metoprolol XL 25 mg po qday (goal of 50 mg limited by hypotension), lisinopril 2.5 mg po qday.
He was educated on fluid restriction and a low salt diet.
He did require a small amount of potassium repletion while on Lasix, and was discharged with instructions to take 10 meq potassium daily.
They were noted to be very mildly elevated, and therefore his outpatient Rilutek was held as the possible etiology of his mild transaminitis.
