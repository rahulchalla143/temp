She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization prior to undergoing a scheduled aortic valve replacement.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2119-11-16**] revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.86 cm squared and a mean gradient of 33 mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 58%, and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia which was treated with atenolol, known aortic stenosis, spastic colon.
The patient describes a history of scarlet fever as a child, arthritis of both knees, history of renal calculus, significant hearing loss, cataract surgery, status post D&C, status post bilateral knee replacements, bilateral appendectomies, status post tonsillectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Atenolol 25 mg po q day, cholestyramine 4 mg po q day, Fosamax 70 mg once a week.
She also took nitroglycerin sublingual prn, Percocet prn, Compazine prn, and Serax prn.
Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2119-11-17**] where she underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
Please refer to operative report for details of surgical procedure and operative event.
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on intravenous amiodarone, intravenous Levophed, and IV propofol drips.
She was initially atrially placed via her temporary epicardial wires.
Patient was initiated on insulin drip for hyperglycemia at that time.
On the night of her surgical day, [**11-17**] into the morning of [**11-18**], the patient was noted to have questionable seizure activity.
Patient's anesthesia drugs were reversed and she was noted to have increased jerky-type movements.
Patient was started on Dilantin for witnessed seizure activity.
She had a stable cardiac rhythm at that time and her epicardial wires were discontinued to facilitate emergent MRI scan to evaluate the etiology of her seizure activity.
Patient was then initiated on a Heparin drip.
Patient was placed on ceftriaxone empirically pending results of a culture which was sent at that time.
She also was placed on intravenous Levophed to keep her systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg to optimize cerebral perfusion at the recommendation of the Neurology staff.
She remained hemodynamically stable, although febrile at times with full ventilator support and no seizure activity noted.
The patient continued to be febrile for the next 24 hours or so, and remained on empiric antibiotics pending results of cultures.
On [**11-20**], patient remains on IV amiodarone drip, although no other vasoactive drips were continued at that time.
She remained on some insulin intermittently to treat hyperglycemia.
She had some atrial fibrillation also on that day for which she received an additional bolus of IV amiodarone.
On the following day, [**11-21**], the patient continued with ventilator weaning.
Required minimal ventilator support, but it was felt inappropriate to extubate her at that time due to patient's inability to protect her airway.
She was maintained on Dilantin to prevent further seizure activity and her electrolytes were being repleted.
Patient was started on tube feeds which she was tolerating well and appeared to be waking up appropriately.
The following day on the [**11-23**], patient continued with burst of atrial fibrillation treated with intravenous Lopressor and continued on the intravenous amiodarone.
Her tube feeds were held, and later morning of [**11-24**], the patient was extubated successfully.
Her intravenous central line has been discontinued and sent for culture which ultimately turned out to be negative, and her ceftriaxone was discontinued since the only positive culture from the previous fever spike was urine, which had been adequately treated.
[**Name (NI) **] chest x-ray showed a continued left pleural effusion for which a chest tube was placed.
Patient also underwent a bedside swallowing evaluation by the Speech and Swallowing therapist to evaluate safety of airway protection and risk of aspiration.
It was felt that she visually did at least fairly well by her bedside evaluation and a modified barium swallow is recommended to be followed up on.
She was begun empirically on Vancomycin IV and levofloxacin via nasogastric tube at that time due to increasing white blood cell count.
On [**11-28**], the patient did undergo a modified barium swallow, which she passed well, and she was at a low risk for aspiration.
She was resumed on her cholestyramine and the Gastroenterology service was reconsulted on [**11-29**] due to increasing diarrhea.
She was begun on Coumadin at the recommendation of the Neurology Service for her stroke as well as for her history of multiple postoperative episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Her IV Heparin drip for anticoagulation was discontinued because her INR had become therapeutic with Coumadin dosing, and she remains stable today on [**2119-12-4**] and is ready to be discharged to rehabilitation facility to continue with physical therapy and increasing mobility.
Her sternum is stable with a small amount of serous drainage at the top area of her wound.
Erythema is significantly decreasing on the Vancomycin and levofloxacin.
Patient remains on a cardiac diet with aspiration precautions.
The patient is scheduled to have a PICC line placed today in the Interventional Radiology Department so that she may continue to receive her Vancomycin for another five days.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 400 mg po q day, Dilantin 300 mg po bid, metoprolol 75 mg po bid, aspirin 81 mg po q day, cholestyramine 4 grams po q day, psyllium one packet po q day, pantoprazole 40 mg po q day, acetaminophen 650 mg po q4h prn, miconazole powder 2% topically qid prn, Vancomycin 1 gram IV q12 hours x5 more days.
Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x5 more days, also to end on [**2119-12-10**].
Patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin coverage for a glucose of 150-200 she should receive 3 units subQ, blood glucose of 200-250 6 units subQ, and a glucose of 250-300 9 units subQ.
The recommendation of the Neurology Service, is to continue anticoagulation for at least 6-8 weeks.
The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] at area code ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**] upon discharge from rehabilitation facility.
She should follow up with him regarding continued amiodarone dosing and also for anticoagulation followup.
Discharge diagnosis is aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, postoperative atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident with seizure activity, pleural effusion, urinary tract infection.
