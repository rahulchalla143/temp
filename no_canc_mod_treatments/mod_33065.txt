How will I be treated for this condition ?
You will receive two daily subcutaneous (underneath the skin) injections of enoxaparin (Lovenox) for 5-7 days along with a longer course of an oral medication called warfarin (Coumadin).
It is important to give the medication exactly as directed.
When your INR is at 2, this means that you blood is thin enough to be on coumadin alone.
The level of INR when you are on coumadin is 2-2.5.
The dose of warfarin may be adjusted according to the results of the blood tests.
What should I do if I miss a dose of enoxaparin or warfarin?
Like enoxaparin the major complication of warfarin is bleeding.
You should avoid taking medications that contain aspirin, medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Orudis KT, Actron Caplets), or any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Keep enoxaparin syringes at room temperature.
