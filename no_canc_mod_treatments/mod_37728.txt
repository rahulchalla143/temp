Her most recent ED visit was on [**1-15**] for hypotension after 6L paracentesis, the patient was resuscitated with IVF and discharged back to rehab that evening.
Her only other interval change is L2 compression fracture with potential canal comprimise, but no significant neurologic deficits.
Management per ortho-spine is conservative - with a TLSO brace when out of bed.

Induction immunosuppression was administered (solumedrol and cellcept).
Simulect and ATG were not used as she was not sensitized.
A ureteral stent was placed as well as 2 JP drains near the liver and one near the kidney.
On POD1 she was transfused 1u prbcs and 2 units of plt.
She was managed with ivf, albumin and lasix to approach a urine output higher than 100 cc/hr.
On POD2 she was able to be extubated and a kidney transplant U/S showed very minimal peritransplant fluid, otherwise unremarkable appearance of transplant kidney.
She had delayed graft function of the kidney necessitating intermittent hemodialysis during the first week.
Stool samples for C. diff were sent and were negative x3, so it was managed successfully with Imodium.
A Dobbhoff catheter was placed for enteral nutrition.
She was also progressively more distended and an U/S guided paracentesis was performed on POD11 draining 2L.
An additional paracentesis was performed on POD12 and sent for cultures.
Ophthalmology ruled out any eye involvement, and decision was made to place a PICC line for Micafungin iv x 2 weeks.
On POD13 her insulin requirement increased requiring an insulin gtt, and [**Last Name (un) **] consult.
The rest of her hospital stay she did very well, and we held hemodialysis since POD15.
She worked progressively with physical therapy and occupational therapy, walking with walker and TLSO brace for her back problems.
As she has been treated with Bactrim and due to her PNC allergy and QT prolongation, atb treatment was restricted enough to decide to wait for the urine cultures and follow this up.
