HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient showed minimal response to seven days or oral Flagyl 500 mg three times a day for his Clostridium difficile stool.
He continued to have somewhat of a decrease in his white blood cell to 16.
It was decided by the time that he would be switched from oral Flagyl to oral Vancomycin 125 mg p.o.q.i.d.
The patient was started on the oral Vancomycin yesterday and feels that he has somewhat better control of his stool today.
A dry sterile dressing is to be placed over these incisions at lease three times per day to prevent them from getting infected.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  (same as previous discharge summary with the addition of the Vancomycin 125 mg p.o.q.i.d.
