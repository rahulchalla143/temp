He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, where he was treated with cefepime.
Linezolid was also started in the acute setting because of a report indicating that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had grown VRE from a wound culture.
His linezolid was discontinued because the source of the VRE culture was established as a superficial wound and was unlikely to be the source of his current bacteremia.
His cefepime was changed to ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h and flagyl was added per Infectious Disease recommendations.
He was discharged on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for a planned course of 14 days or until his follow-up appointment with surgery; ceftriaxone was discontinued because of concern for an allergic reaction to this medication.
This was initially thought to be concerning for sepsis, but it resolved with IV fluids and he experienced no further hypotensive episodes while in the hospital.
No changes were made to his insulin regimen on discharge.
He was given 7.5mg warfarin on [**10-30**], and was discharged on his home regimen of 5mg warfarin on discharge.
His home medications were continued as previously prescribed.
