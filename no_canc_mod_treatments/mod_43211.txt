Patient initially presented to BIDN on [**8-9**] with right leg weakness.
So, aspirin was decreased from 325 to 81, and her coumadin was held.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] has known 80-99% stenosis of the Right ICA as well as bilateral ECA stenoses.
Now, on the Left, she has multiple near-occlusive placques in the distal, extracranial ICA (per carotid U/S and MRA from BIN 7/19-22/[**2204**]),distal to her stent.
She had an acute CHF exacerbation in setting of dietary indiscretion as well as noncompliance with dialysis.
Lasix was increased from 40mg PO qd to 80mg PO qd.
Deferred heparin drip given large territory ACA stroke.
Renal whise, pt has ESRD and was on HD 3x/week.
Apparently, earlier in the day, she was able to move her right leg but now cannot.

Severe stenosis of the bilateral extracranial internal carotid arteries, with measurements given above.
Please note that these measurements of degree of stenosis are not determined with accuracy due to the diameter being under the limits of precision reached by CT, and the diameter of the patent lumen may be overestimated.
Chest X-ray FINDINGS:  Dialysis catheter noted and unchanged.
Chest x-ray [**8-25**]  An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.
An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
A dual-lumen catheter is present, with tips over the mid and distal SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 72 yo RH woman with history of CHF (EF 30%), afib on Coumadin, ESRD on HD (now daily), DM II, HL, HTN, COPD who initially presented to BIDN where she was found to have a L ACA infarct and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of b/l carotid stenoses (s/p L ICA stent) for CEA vs. angioplasty.
Pt already on maximum medical therapy with warfarin, aspirin and plavix.
She has also had stenting of the Left carotid in [**2202**].
However, she has failed all of these interventions and has had a stroke.
Medically, she has ESRD on HD, CHF, afib and is thus quite high risk for CEA.
Pt is poor surgical candidate given imaging findings and multiple comorbidities.
She was continued on plavix, aspirin and crestor.
Also, in BIDN, coumadin ws initially held in the setting of small hemorrage on CT.  Re-started warfarin here as pt is high risk for embolic stroke in setting of afib.
However, as below, on HD 2, INR was elevated to 9.6, then repeat to 8.
So, discontinued warfarin and reversed with Vitamin K. Pt refused FFP adamantly despite understanding the risks.
She was restarted on warfarin on [**8-18**] as INR was < 2.
Of note, her RLE cramps was thought to be related to the stroke, and baclofen was initiated as a trial to alleviate her discomfort.
Given dilantin load and was transferred to neuro ICU for further management.
She was on lasix at home, but it was discontinued while at [**Hospital1 18**] given patient's blood pressure was persistently between 90-120 and on dialysis.
- CAD s/p multiple stents last in [**4-/2204**]: NSTEMI and Unstable Angina.
While at [**Hospital1 **], patient was noted to have elevated troponin in the setting of chest discomfort.
It was thought that she had an NSTMI, but heparin was not administered because of the finding of focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage associated with her ischemic stroke.
She was thought not to be a candidate for intervention given recent ischemic stroke and high risk of bleed.
She was continued on isosorbide mononitrate, aspirin, plavix, crestor, and metoprolol.
Also with large territory NSTEMI involving lateral and inferior leads, trop continued to trend up from 1.23 to 1.4.
Per cardiology c/s, pt started on heparin drip x48 hrs and amiodarone x24 hours.
She also required 2 pressors (phenylephrine and norepinephrine) - hypotension in setting of propofol and CVVH.
Warfarin was held when it was supratherapeutic, but it was restarted on [**8-18**] after vitamin K administration.
However, pt was not tolerating HD as she would become quite hypotensive.
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone on [**8-10**].
CTX was discontinued on [**8-18**] when repeat urine culture returned to have mixed flora and when her leukocytosis resolved.
Patient was afebrile thus primary ICU team did not feel that treatment with antibiotics was warranted at the time  # Supratherapeutic INR.
This occurred likely in the setting of antibiotics use.
Patient received 10 mg vitamin K but not FFP as she declined.
Her INR returned to 1.8 on [**8-18**] and she was reinitiated on warfarin at home dose.
Her O2 supplement requirement came down to 2 L with above measures.
Explained complexity of medical situation, particulary, volume overload, dropping blood pressures, and multiple pressors as well as inability to tolerate dialysis.
Concered at that point that patient may pass in the next several days despite aggressive care.
On further discussion with the family, decision was made to transition to comfort measures only on [**8-25**] once entire family was at bedside.
