[**2108-7-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The right subclavian line tip is at the right atrium and should be pulled back for about 2 cm to secure its position at the cavoatrial junction or low SVC.
The patient is after recent surgery of the left arm, most likely related to left humerus fracture.
There is no evidence of right-sided pneumothorax after pacemaker implantation.
Brief Hospital Course: 87yo woman was admitted after fall with humerus fracture.
She underwent Left axillary to brachial artery bypass with reversed right greater saphenous vein by vascular surgery and open reduction left proximal humerus fracture with manipulation by orthopedics.
Patient's pain was very well controlled with standing tylenol 1000mg TID.
She will also be followed by occupational therapy at acute rehab.
Metoprolol and ASA were started.
Upon transfer, she was given separate trials of PO diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control, which were both unsuccessful.
During the first couple of days, she had conversion pauses lasting up to 4.7 seconds; however, the patient was soon mostly controlled in sinus bradycardia with rate in the 50s with frequent PACs and PVCs.
Due to the lability of the patient's rate and rhythm, a pacemaker was placed on [**7-16**].
The pacemaker was not placed until the urinary tract infection had completely cleared.
Sulfa drugs were avoided due to a reported allergy; fluoroquinolones were avoided because the patient had a prolonged QT initially.
She was treated for 14 days for a complicated UTI; the pacemaker was placed after finishing a full 10 days of antibiotics.
The urinary tract infection was likely largely contributing to the altered mental status of the patient on admission and post-operatively.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home statin was continued.
She was confused about where she was most of the time, and required frequent reorientation.
# Anxiety/Depression: Patient was put on sertraline which appeared to help.
Patient was on subcutaneous heparin for DVT ppx.
She was continued on ranitidine given that it is home med, though no clear h/o GERD.
