ENT and Nsurg were consulted, and he was admitted to Nsurg for further management.
On Nsurg, he received a total of 30mg vitamin K and 5 units of FFP to reverse his INR (he is on warfarin for afib).
He was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole as well as standing nebs.
He was receiving lorazepam 0.5mg IV Q2H with little impact.
In the AM he was re-evaluated by Med Consult, who started diazepam 5-10mg PO Q2H and Zyprexa for agitation.
He was increasingly SOB, so he received Lasix 20mg IV x1.

A-fib, on coumadin 2.
Right frontal extra-axial hematoma, likely subdural, 2 mm in greatest transverse dimension.
Right frontal extra-axial hematoma, likely subdural, 2 mm in greatest transverse dimension.
Hepatic and left renal hypodense lesions are incompletely characterized as they are only visualized on non-contrast sequences, but statistically most likely represent simple cysts.
If there is clinical concern for acute ischemia, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
Post-traumatic changes with a right frontotemporal contusion,  demonstrating expected evolution since the prior study.
- Please note that patient does have a tendency to wax and wane, and still has evidence of frontal brain contusion on imaging - Continue to work with Physical and Occupational therapy as much as posible - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain), re-orient frequently and encourage family at bedside .
- Continue Prednisone taper as follows: [**2-11**]: 60mg daily [**2-12**]-14: 50mg daily [**2-14**]-16: 40mg daily [**2-16**]-18: 30mg daily [**2-18**]-20: 20mg daily [**2-20**]-22: 10mg daily OFF [**2-22**] - Continue pain control as needed with tylenol .
Heparin gtt was restarted, in discussions with neurosurgery, with a lower goal of PTT 60-80 in the setting of his ICHs.
Patient was restarted on Coumadin on day of discharge - Continue heparin gtt (currently 3000 units/hour) with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of his intracranial hemorrhages - Continue Coumadin at 4mg daily.
Patient had been on coumadin for atrial fibrillation for 4-5 years with several ablations.
Given his admission for cerebral contusion and multiple intracranial hemorrhages, his coumadin was initially stopped and his INR reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Patient's most recent ablation had been at [**Hospital6 1708**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2129-1-15**] (ph: [**0-0-**]).
Patient was initially started on Esmolol gtt which was weaned off.
He was also started on Digoxin but per Cardiology recommendations, this was discontinued (patient's small left ventricle was felt to make Digoxin ineffective/potentially harmful in managing this patient's Afib/flutter).
Also per their recommendations, his home Sotalol was held in the setting of recent INR reversal and risk of thromboembolic events with cardioversion from Sotalol.
- Continue Labetalol 800mg TID - If would like better heart rate control, can switch to Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg TID and titrate up to effectiveness - Patient has an appointment to see his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4455**] for Wednesday, [**2-16**] at 1pm.
He should discuss with him the possibility of restarting Sotalol, using Metoprolol for better rate control, as he is anti-coagulated again.
Patient was briefly on TPN instead of tube feeds and eventually redeveloped good stool output.
As his ileus resolved, patient was resumed on tube feeds and by day of discharge, patient was swallowing well and tolerating PO diet - Continue PO diet - If patient is not taking in adequate caloric intake, can place Dobhoff for supplemental tube feeds .
# Hypertension: Patient initially hypotensive, likely in the setting of sedation for intubation (fentanyl and versed).
His home ACE-inhibitors and ARBs were held given his rise in Creatinine.
He was briefly on Nifedipine gtt, Esmolol gtt and received Hydralazine, Labetalol IV.
- Continue Labetalol 800mg PO TID - Given stability of creatinine, can add Lisinopril if blood pressures are not well controlled - Continue to control gout pain with tylenol as needed .
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was initially intubated for desaturation and tachypnea.
He had a prolonged intubation course given altered mental status during spontaneous awakening trials that made it concerning that the patient would not be able to protect his airway and/or clear secretions.
Patient was initially on Cefepime and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
He was later started on Vancomycin and completed a two week course for health-care acquired pneumonia given persistent fevers.
- Continue albuterol and ipratropium inhalers as needed .
He was treated with valium 10mg IV every hour as needed for this initially, briefly transitioned to propofol given intubation.
- Continue thiamine, folate and multivitamin - Patient should see social worker to discuss his alcohol use .
# Diabetes: Patient was on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
He can resume his home glipizide upon discharge # Access: PICC line .
