For that reason, she was taken to the operating room on [**2152-10-5**] at which time she underwent a repair of the aortic dissection with 32 mm Dacron graft and partial cardiopulmonary bypass.

She therefore underwent placement of a percutaneous trach on [**2152-10-25**].
She was deemed to be appropriate to transfer to rehab on [**2152-11-7**] where she will continue her recuperation.
