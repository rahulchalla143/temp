PROCEDURE: IR guided R hip aspiration [**2132-11-14**]: Successful right hip joint aspiration of approximately 0.5 cc of viscous, cloudy joint fluid, which was sent for culture and Gram stain.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, anterior wall, septum and anterior septum.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] contact[**Name (NI) **] stat for a possible cardiac catherization for further diagnosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/o female c/ h/o DM, ESRD on HD atraumatic R hip pain, fever to 101 in ED, white count, and MRI signs concerning for R hip osteomyelitis.
Source most likely via R arm fistula graft for HD, especially given staph aureus.
Vancomycin was started as emperic coverage and this was switched to cefazolin given that patient grew MSSA.
Patient's AV fistula graft was suspected as being the source and was removed by vascular surgery on [**2132-11-16**].
The patient then underwent R hip joint wash out by orthopaedic on [**2132-11-17**].
Pain control: Patient's pain was better controlled on MS contin 30mg PO BID + Dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg IV Q3H PRN pain.
ESRD: Continued HD schedule.
Held dialysis line placement [**3-17**] bacteremia.
Patient was on Metoprolol XL.
CODE EVENT: ============ During her case, anesthesiology attending noted that it was difficult to record her blood pressure, so left a-line was placed with SBP 85-95.
She also received a few boluses of phenylephrine.
Phenylephrine gtt and levophed gtt started with BP 80/40s.
Heparin given but BPs continued to decline.
Dopamine and vasopressin also started in addition to several rounds of bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, and insulin for presumed electrolyte abnormalities.
On two occasions, pulse could not be determined and CPR commenced for 2-3 minutes with return of circulation.
Initially, was going to go to cardiac catherization for evaluation of coronaries (?RV infarct) and CTA, but on hold as pt decompensated.
She was transferred to MICU on [**2132-11-17**] for further management on 4 pressors (epi, vasopressin, levophed, and dopamine).
Four pressors were on maximum settings to maintain MAPS>60.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were started (vancomycin and zosyn).
