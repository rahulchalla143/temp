The patient was admitted to the hospital about one week ago for 24 hours and only received some intravenous Lasix.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil 30 mg p.o.q.d., oxazepam 15 mg p.o.q.d., Univasc 15 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., insulin, Pravachol 20 mg p.o.q.d., aspirin, Centrum Silver, vitamin E and garlic.
On the day of admission, hematocrit was 38.1, white blood cell count 9.6, platelet count 337,000, prothrombin time 19.2, INR 2.4, blood sugar 166, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1, sodium 132 and chloride 94.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral-popliteal bypass, status post left femoral-popliteal bypass and status post below the knee amputation in [**2196-2-17**].
He continued on aspirin and Univasc and remained on the cardiology floor.
On [**2197-9-12**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for evaluation.
On [**2197-9-12**], his white blood cell count was 8.2 with a hematocrit of 38.7, platelet count 288,000, prothrombin time 15.4, partial thromboplastin time 28.7, INR 1.6, sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarbonate 29, BUN 41, creatinine 1.4, and blood sugar 163.
He had had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the catheterization laboratory in his right femoral artery.
He is status post left lower leg amputation.
A Foley catheter was in place.
The patient was also started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were continued, as well as aspirin and the heparin drip.
On [**2197-9-15**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on milrinone and Levophed as well as continued mechanical support with his intra-aortic balloon pump that had been placed preoperatively.
Of note, his saphenous vein grafts were obtained from the lesser saphenous area as well as distal greater saphenous, distal to the femoral-poplitea graft in the left lower extremity due to his prior peripheral vascular surgery.
Of note, the patient had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the following additional medications: Epinephrine drip, amiodarone drip and propofol.
On postoperative day number one, Amicar and epinephrine drips were off.
The patient had received 14 units of fresh frozen plasma, ten units of packed red blood cells, one unit of cryoprecipitate and four units platelets for continuing bleeding postoperatively.
He was on an amiodarone drip at 1, insulin at 12, Levophed at 0.24, milrinone 0.375, propofol 25 and cisatracurium at 1.
He was on levofloxacin and vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
He was back on a Neo-Synephrine drip and a Dopamine drip was started and then discontinued.
He had an output of 4.79 with an index of 2 on the following drips:  Amiodarone, Ativan, insulin, Levophed, milrinone, morphine and Neo-Synephrine at 3.5.
His creatinine rose to 2.2, his potassium was 5, BUN 14, white blood cell count 11, hematocrit 27.8, while he remained intubated and sedated on his drips, with attempts to wean his PEEP.
He was hemodynamically stable on his continued multiple drip supports and remained paralyzed and sedated.
His hematocrit rose to 30 with a white blood cell count of 12 and he remained on drug support in the Intensive Care Unit.
He continued on levofloxacin and vancomycin also as his support.
He got good diuresis with a Lasix drip.
The patient also remained on vasoconstrictors to help maintain tone.
Vasopressin was also started to help maintain his tone.
He remained on amiodarone, Ativan, dobutamine, insulin, Levophed, morphine, Neo-Synephrine and cisatracurium for paralyzation in the Intensive Care Unit.
A renal consult was obtained on [**2197-9-19**] and they attributed the patient's sluggish renal function, which had now risen from 2.1 to 3.1 creatinine and BUN of 57, to cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion of his kidneys.
On [**0-0-0**], the patient remained on maximal medical and mechanical support but he continued to move downhill, with multi-organ failure.
All the issues were explained to the family by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**], but they requested continued intervention and refused comfort measures only.
He remained on dobutamine, Neo-Synephrine, vasopressin, morphine, vancomycin, insulin and Ativan drips.
Renal continued to follow him but were unable to recommend dialysis as his prognosis was extremely poor and was due to lack of perfusion from his heart.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting time three.
