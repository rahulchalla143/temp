Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, CVA, GI bleed, AS, iron dificiency anemia who presented to an OSH s/p fall and on TTE was found to have aortic stenosis.
At the OSH, he was initially admitted for managment and evaluation of mechanical fall and failure to thrive.
A thoracentesis was performed under ultrasound and 1050 cc of clear yellow fluid was drained consistent w/ transudate effusion.
He was diuresed approximately 2.5 Liters w/ IV lasix 30mg q12 hs.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations.
Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
There was aspiration with thin barium as well as penetration with all consistencies of barium administered.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin barium and penetration with all consistencies of barium.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, history of stroke (CVA), GI bleed, aortic stenosis, iron deficiency anemia who presented to an OSH status post fall and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
Per video swallow study, was aspirating everything that he was eating and speech and swallow recs were to not take anything PO.
After extensive discussion with his family members, it was decided that he would not want to pursue feeding tube for nutrition.
He was diuresed for 3 days with lasix 20 mg PO daily with acetazolamide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] with a net negative of 2.5 L and resolution of his respiratory distress.
TTE also demonstrated preserved ejection fraction and prior cardiac cath at an outside hospital showed no significant coronary artery disease.
He was evaluated by Cardiac surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] independently re: surgical repair, however, based upon overall nutritional status and respiratory difficulty, he was not a candidate for open valve replacement, core valve, or valvuloplasty.
It was felt that since his symptoms (respiratory distress) responded well to medical therapy and he was a poor surgical candidate, it would be more reasonable to manage him conservatively.
Continued his metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg PO once daily prn shortness of breath.
He also developed a contraction alkalosis in the setting of diuresis with the effusions making it difficult for him to adjust his respiratory to compensate.
With diuresis, the patient's breathing improved, and his oxygen was gradually weaned to 2L (home requirement for years).
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: CHADS2 score 4 (htn, age, stroke).
He was continued on metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily.
# Hypernatremia: When he was NPO for one day, his sodium increased from 144 to 151.
Not eating much to cause reflux # Benign prostatic hypertrophy:  discontinued finasteride, has a foley in place.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please continue to provide ongoing care focused on comfort to include: oral care and observed feedings, possible antibiotics as needed for symptomatic pneumonias, pain control, symptom control such as diuresis, secretion management or nausea/constipation.

This is because of your aortic valve stenosis which causes heart failure.
Your aortic stenosis was managed with diuresis and your respiratory status returned to [**Location 213**].
After discussions with you and your family, it was decided that a feeding tube would not help with possible aspirations and so you should eat whatever you want to continue nutrition.
The following changes were made to your medications: - STOP all of your medications except: - metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily to control your heart rate - senna and docusate 1-2 tabs twice daily as needed for constipation - acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650 mg per mouth or rectum every 6 hours for pain - morphine sulfate oral solution 2.5-10 mg every 2 hours as needed for pain - citalopram 20 mg daily - furosemide 20 mg daily as needed for shortness of breath or tachypnea - lorazepam 0.5-1 mg every 2 hours as needed for agitation .
