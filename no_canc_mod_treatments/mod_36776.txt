The bile duct was selectively cannulated with a balloon catheter and .025 guidewires.
Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a recent hx of cholecystitis and cholangitis ([**1-/2152**]), managed medically due to concurrent NSTEMI w/trop >84 underwent an interval laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy on [**4-3**], which was complicated by an iatrogenic CBD transection and cardiac enzyme elevation.
The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and management of his bile duct injury.
Cardiology assessment recommended an alternative Toprol dose but otherwise recommended no further cardiac opitimization for surgery.
The patient underwent a A PTC drain had been placed on [**4-6**] after occlusion was noted on ERCP at an OSH.
There the patient was started on Vanc/Pip-Tazo, omeprazole for GI prophylaxis, Dilaudid PCA for pain control and was made NPO.
