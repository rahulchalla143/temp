He was made NPO, an NG tube was placed, he was started on IV fluids, and a foley catheter was inserted.
Neuro: Initially, the patient received Dilaudid IV PRN, which was converted to a Dilaudid PCA with adequate pain control.
Given his history of advanced AIDS off anti-retroviral therapy and CNS toxoplasmosis, a head MRI with and wihtout contrast was performed, which demonstrated decrease size in the left basal ganglia abnormality and decrease in enhancement compared to a previous MRI performed on [**2153-9-21**].
The patient required multiple IV fluid boluses in order to maintain hemodynamic stability.
GI/GU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
Due to persistent nausea and episodes of vomiting on [**2154-12-3**], another NG tube was placed to low wall suction.
During prior admission, cryptosporidium parvum had been identified, and the patient started on nitazoxanide, which was continued.
As noted, the patient required multiple IV fluid boluses.
Patient had been off last ART regimen consisting of Epzicom and Isentress as well as prophylactic medications for over 1 month.
Re-initiation of anti-retroviral therapy was held due to history of poor adherence with plans to re-evalaute readiness for HAART once able to tolerate oral intake.
Standard and Mycolytic cultures, CMV vial load, crytococcal Ag, and standard and specialized stool analyses including cryptosporidium, microsporidium, AFB, isoporidium were again sent.
The question of MAC prophylaxis versus treatment was again raised pending return of mycolytic cultures.
The patient was continued on nitazoxanide for diarrhea, presumed due to crytosporidium parvum.
The incisional wound located at the lower aspect of the midline incision, measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm x 1cm, initially received moist-to-dry gauze dressings [**Hospital1 **], which was changed to a VAC dressing with white sponge at 125mmHg on [**2154-12-3**].
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
General Surgery continued to follow the patient as consultants, primarily for wound care.
Urine culture from [**12-4**] also grew cipro resistant E Coli and he completed 7 day course of Ceftriaxone ([**12-8**] - [**12-14**]).
New spike on [**12-18**] was most likley due to post procedural inflammation from G-J tube placement.
He was started on Nitazoxamide without much improvement.
High dose azithromycin was added to the regimen without improvement and therefore was switched to weekly MAC prophylaxis dose.
ID evaluated for possible paromomycin availabily but was unsuccessful.
After multiple discussions including at ID conference, the decision was made to start HAART given getting his CD4 counts above 100 is his only possible option for successfuly treatment of the cryptosporidium.
Multiple attempts for post pyloric dobhoff was unsuccessful due to either difficulty of the procedure or came out soon after placement with vomitting.
After discussing with all the teams involved including Surgery and patient, the decision was made to place G-J tube by IR.
IR placed a GJ tube on [**12-18**] and tube feeds and HAART regimen was started on [**2154-12-19**].
His HAART regimen was Lamivudine 100 mg daily (started on 50 and then uptitrated as renal function improved), Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine 200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.
He recieved compazine, zofran and ativan for control of nausea.
He was made NPO and his HAART medications as well as nitazoxamide were held.
After transfer back to the floor, the patient continued with persistent, voluminous, watery diarrhea up to 4 liters daily.
He has been continued on zofran, compazine, and ativan for nausea.
The GJ tube has been placed to gravity and continues to drain approximately [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18978**] ml daily.
Patient was initially on dilaudid PCA which was switched to IV morphine.
Pattern of bowel gas was suggestive of air trapped in mucosal folds although pneumatosis could not be excluded.
Tube feeds were discontinued, patient was made NPO (including HAART and nitazoxanide), and GJ tube was placed to gravity for decompression.
He was initially treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole for potential transolocaiton of abdominal contents.
On [**2154-12-30**], the patient's abdominal pain markedly improved, his GJ tube was clamped, and he was started on a clear liquid diet.
HIV/AIDS HAART regimen as above was started on [**2154-12-18**] and discontinued on [**2154-12-25**].
PCP prophylaxis was switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause cholestasis.
Patient recieved azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis, though this was discontinued on [**2155-1-1**].
After aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient had improving kidney function with baseline creatinine of 1.3.
He has been maintained on large amounts of IV fluids, currently 250ml of normal saline per hour, with fluid boluses as needed to keep up with GI losses.
Again, the patient received aggressive fluid therapy with transient improvement in his heart rate.
Dapsone was discontinued as above.
He was briefly on tube feeds, however, he re-started TPN therapy after he could no longer tolerate tube feeds.
# Palliative Care Several family meetings were held as well as discussion individually with the patient regarding goals of care.
The hope is that the patient will be able to transition to hospice after a rehab stay.
