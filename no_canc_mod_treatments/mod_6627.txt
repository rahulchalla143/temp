ON [**12-5**]:  HISTORY: Infiltrate and effusions.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Left subclavian catheter tip projects over the mid portion of the right atrium.
The patient has had median sternotomy, coronary bypass grafting, and tricuspid valve replacement.
After stabilization in the ED with appropriate meds and lab work-up, pt was brought for a cardiac catheterization.
was admitted and received medical management under cardiology service and consulted cardiac surgery for surgical revascularization.
Prior to surgery pt was started on a Heparin gtt to keep pt.
Pt's surgery was delayed several days secondary to elevated INR and was awaiting her INR to decrease less than 1.3 prior to surgery.
On [**2143-11-12**] pt was brought to the operating room where she underwent a Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3 (Lima to LAD, SVG to OM, Diag), MAZE procedure, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] ligation, Tricuspid Valve Repair w/ 28mm CE Annuloplasty ring, and patch with pericardium to LV wall.
tolerated the procedure well with total bypass time of 117 minutes and cross-clamp time of 77 minutes.
She was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on the following gtts: Milrinone, Epinephrine, Levophed, Amiodarone, and Propofol.
Diuretics were initiated on POD #1 and Inotropes were continued for BP control.
remained on mechanical ventilation until POD #3 and aggressive pulm.
toilet was initiated following extubation.
Her chest tubes were removed and post chest tube pull revealed no pneumothorax.
By POD #4 pt was weaned off of all gtts, except for Amiodarone and Milrinone.
Coumadin was restarted and Amiodarone was switched to PO.
Video swallow study revealed aspiration of liquids and swallow delay and a post-pyloric Dobbhoff feeding tube was place by IR.
had slowly worsening respiratory distress/acidosis/oxygenation and despite PT, diuretics, inhalers, oxygen she was reintubated on POD #11.
had to be restarted on Inotropes at this time for pressure support.
She was restarted on Vanco and remained intubated until POD #16 (aggressive PT initiated) .
Chest CT [**11-25**] revealed bilat pleural effusions, adjacent atelectasis, pulmonary edema w/ patchy peripheral opacities, moderate pericardial effusion, and retrosternal fluid collection.
She eventually had bilat thoracentesis on POD#13,14.
had to be transfused red cells multiple times d/t low HCT.
She continued to have AFib and will be discharged with Amiodarone and Coumadin.
Pt remained NPO at time of d/c and repeat speech swallow performed.
