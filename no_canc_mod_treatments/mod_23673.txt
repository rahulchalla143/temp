[**2116-6-5**] laparoscopic reduction of hiatal hernia, repair of diaphragmatic defect with pledgeted sutures, pexy of stomach to diaphragm, and laparoscopic liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85535**] is a 52 year old female with a history of mental retardation and migraine headaches who is transfered from [**Hospital 792**]Hospital for further management of hepatitis.
Her sister and [**Name2 (NI) 802**] noted subtle changes in her behavior as far back as [**2115-10-13**] that became increasingly pronounced over the following months, viral hepatitis work-up was reportedly negative.
She was noted to have hyperammonemia and was treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy with some improvement in mental status.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin was elevated at 385.
She required antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) to treat HAP and aspiration PNA.
While on the medicine service, her hospital course was complicated by ongoing aspiration events felt to be a result of her large hiatal hernia and esophageal dysmotility.
On [**2116-5-28**], she was intubated and transferred to the MICU for increasing dyspnea and acute respiratory failure.
She was extubated soon after on [**2116-5-29**] and was treated for HAP/aspiration pneumonia, but antibiotics were stopped on [**2116-6-1**].
On [**2116-6-5**], the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery service and underwent laparascopic hiatal hernia reduction with percutaneous liver biospy.

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPICE CARE: Ms. [**Known lastname 85535**] was initially admitted to the hospital from [**State 792**]after being diagnosed with hepatitis that was found to be end stage liver disease (cirrhosis) from NASH.
Briefly, her hospitalization course was complicated by intubation for aspiration pneumonia with subsequent respiratory arrest.
She also underwent a hiatal hernia repair to help decrease the risk of aspiration, she was in the ICU for transient shock liver and renal dysfunction.
She was also not tolerating oral, NG tube feeds.
All non-essential, non-comforting medications were discontinued.
Pt was started on oral Morphine for pain, oral Ativan for anxiety, Scopolamine patch to minimize secretions from the Morphine.
- please continue with 5-10mg PO Morpine every 4 hours as needed for comfort, this may need to be increased pending her discomfort - please continue with 1mg Ativan PO every 4 hours for anxiety - please continue with 3 Scopolamine patches to the neck to decrease secretions - please continue with Bisacodyl 10mg PR as needed if the pt does not have a bowel movement for several days and seems uncomfortable from constipation - please continue with Acetaminophen PR as needed for any fevers  PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO THORACIC SURGERY SERVICE/MICU:  # Elevated liver enzymes: liver biopsy pathology slides were obtained from [**Hospital **] Hospital and reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] pathology.
Patient was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and thoracic surgery was consulted.
Patient was then transferred to the MICU and started on HAP coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn.
Patient was initially covered with vancomycin, but this was stopped on [**6-2**].
Patient received fluconazole IV x 3 days, and foley catheter was changed.
Initial speech and swallow found esophageal dismotility on barium swallow, without coughing and patient was placed on diet of thin liquids and pureed solids.
FROM TRANSFER TO THORACIC SURGERY SERVICE/SICU ([**2116-6-5**]):  KEY EVENTS: [**6-6**]: Hepatology rec likely volume down, supportive care.
[**6-7**]: Placement of R subclavian CVL, started levo for sbp support, adequate UO, one dose of lasix 20 mg IV in am, improved liver function, rising creatinine [**6-9**]: continues with minimal UOP.
Started albumin 25g TID and lasix drip with improvement in UOP, low dose levophed started to increase renal perfusion.
[**6-10**] started CVVH, CT torso, placed HD line, bedside ECHO [**6-11**] CVVH at bedside, Cr / BUN / weight trending down, INR stable at 1.5.  started vanco, [**Last Name (un) 2830**], fluc.
RIGHT SC removed and new triple lumen placed in LEFT subclavian.
[**6-15**]: had HD performed at bedside with 1.5 L removed.
Became febrile to 104 and received ice packs and fan.
[**6-16**]: HD was cancelled [**1-14**] fever, HD planned for [**6-17**], may not need renal recs albumin and lasix in interim; we gave lasix 40 mg once with adequate response, hepatology - f/u LFTs, no acute events, afebrile > 24 hours, d/c'ed RIJ HD line.
[**6-17**]: Vancomycin started for coag neg staph on RIGHT IJ HD catheter.
UOP improving, lasix PRN.
Received lasix with good output, however, afternoon lytes with hypernatremia (147).
[**6-19**]: we D/Ced Fluconazole given completion of course for yeast cultures.
She was cleared for thin liquids and pureed foods with swallow eval.
[**6-23**]: last dose of Vancomycin was given in the AM.
With aggressive diuresis with lasix and metolazone her respiratory status improved tremendously and she was extubated to face mask on [**7-11**] and transferred to the floor on [**7-15**] on nasal cannula.
She received a long course of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, daptomycin, linezolid, flagyl and micafungin.
It was noted that her fevers appeared related temporally to tube feeds and her fevers seemed to resolve when she was transitioned to tpn.
# Constipation/ileus/abdominal distension: Patient had difficulty with high residuals and persistent fevers seemingly associated with tube feeds.
Thought likely due to ileus and the distension improved with tpn (tube feeds held,) and erythromycin.
She was continued on ursodiol and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
She was initially receiving lactulose, but this was discontinued due to high residuals in her tube feeds and concern for worsening abdominal distension.
Patient most likely had Vit K deficiency from chronic antibiotics, NPO status, and malabsorption/ileus.
There was no need for reversal of anticoagulation during her MICU stay.
