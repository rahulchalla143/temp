Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin prior to your injury, you may safely resume taking this on XXXXXXXXXXX.
