In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
Arterioles show moderate-marked mural thickening, with hyaline change.
Her renal failure continued, and she was discharged with anticipation of dialysis in the near future.
She unfortunately developed a subcapsular liver hematoma during the procedure, however this was stabilized with FFP and Vitamin K which the patient had already been receiving.
During her hospitalization she received more than 14 units of FFP to keep her INR < 1.5, as well as DDAVP x 5, and multiple dosese of vitamin K.  Prior to discharge, her INR had remained < 1.5 on it's own for > 48 hours.
Her transaminases had trended down almost into the normal range (111 and 41 for ALT and AST respectively), and her total bilirubin had trended down to 5.9 from a peak of 40.3.
The etiology of the liver insult remains unclear, however the zithromax course that she had received is a potential [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and she should therefore not receive zithromax in the future.
The renal team did not feel that she met criteria for urgent hemodialysis, however, and she was therefore seen by the dialysis team and set up with outpatient follow up for probable need for dialysis in the near future.
She was also started on lasix at the recommendation of the renal team, with the hopes of improving her fluid  balance and controlling her hypertension (see below).
3) Pneumonia:  At the outside hospital she had been found to have a LLL PNA and was therefore already on levo/flagyl on transfer.
4) Hypertension:  She has a history of hypertension, and had been taking toprol XL 25 mg daily.
A labetalol drip was started very briefly, for only a few hours.
On the floors, Mrs.[**Known lastname 59024**] blood pressure was moderately well controlled on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and amlodipine 10 mg daily.
She was given lasix 40 mg PO once prior to discharge, and discharged on 80 mg PO daily, per renal, plus toprol XL 100 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily.
