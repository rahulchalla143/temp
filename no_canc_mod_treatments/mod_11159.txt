He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further treatment of his cardiac disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were Lopressor, nitroglycerin, Prinivil, Zyprexa, Lipitor, Serzone, Glucotrol-XL 5 mg p.o.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2101-1-14**] and underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with 60% middle subtotal distal and apex with diffuse first diagonal.
The patient was then consented for cardiac surgery.
On [**2101-1-18**], the patient was taken to the operating room where a coronary artery bypass graft surgery times three with left internal mammary artery to the [**Year (4 digits) 11641**], saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, left anterior descending artery, and an aortic valve replacement using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] #23.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory and hemodynamically stable condition.
He still remained intubated though.
He was receiving bedside physical therapy to help him maintain his mobility.
Because of his inability to wean off the ventilator, the patient underwent a bedside tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.
On [**2101-1-25**], the patient also had a bronchoscopy for his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement which showed some mucous plugging.
At this point, placement to rehabilitation was considered as the patient was going to be a long-term ventilator wean, and he would obviously need rehabilitation for his cerebrovascular accident.
He had a right peripheral inserted central catheter line placed for intravenous access; and, at this point, he was then slowly starting to be weaned from his ventilator, and his hemodynamic medications.
He had a tracheostomy, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery with aortic valve replacement.
Status post right cerebrovascular accident with right hemiplegia, global aphasia deficits.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
