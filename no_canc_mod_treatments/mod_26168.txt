No stent was placed at that time.
On [**8-2**] pt was extubated without difficulty and was seen by speech and swallow who felt she was aspirating with thin liquids and recommended nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
She was cleared by swallow for a regular diet and thin liquids and her tube feeds were stopped.
Tracheal resection was planned for [**8-7**].
on [**8-7**] she was made NPO after midnight and her argatroban drip was held 4 hours prior to the procedure.
Post-operatively her argatroban drip was restarted at her stable pre-op dose of 5.75.
She was transfered out of the unit on POD 1 and was given 5mg coumadin in order to stop the argatroban.
This resolved with 15mg IV lopressor and her PO dose was placed back to 25 [**Hospital1 **].
