Her obstructive lung disease was so bad that she was being considered a candidate for a lung transplant.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was given treatment with nebulizers, terbutaline, intravenous Solu-Medrol, intravenous Levaquin and transient Heliox therapy.
Unfortunately, none of these therapies seemed to work and the patient became increasingly acidemic.
She was placed on Bi-PAP but subsequently became increasingly tachypneic and tachycardic.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems before intubation was remarkable only for a productive cough of yellow sputum.
Positive PPD status post INH therapy times six months.
Atenolol 50 q. day.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
Singulair 10 q. day.
Celexa 50 q. day.
Clonazepam 0.5 q. day.
Albuterol q. four hours p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.9 F.; blood pressure 127/81; pulse 110; saturation of 100% on assist control of 600 by 8 with 8 of PEEP and 40% FIO2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In light of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was placed on high dose steroids, frequent bronchodilators and adequate antibiotic coverage with Augmentin initially.
She was intubated and sedated appropriately.
Over time, it was attempted to wean her from the ventilator, but unfortunately as her pressure support was decreased to minimal levels, the patient would become desynchronous with the ventilator, requiring immediate paralysis for ventilation.
The patient eventually received both a tracheostomy tube and a PEJ tube via surgery.
She was given tube feeds for nutrition and her vent settings were slowly weaned to pressure support.
For her underlying anxiety disorder, the patient was placed on an around the clock regimen of Valium with p.r.n.
An EMG was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of critical care polyneuropathy.
Because it took a while for the patient's mental status to return to baseline off of all sedation, a head CT scan was performed to evaluate for any signs of an acute hypoxia.
Fortunately, the CT scan confirmed the presence of a pan-sinusitis but no acute cerebral injury.
Secondary causes of hypertension such as pheochromocytoma, carcinoid, and hyper-thyroidism were all ruled out.
The patient's renal function remained excellent throughout her hospital stay with occasional episodes of oliguria which responded well to fluid boluses.
As a result, the patient was started on iron supplements.
She was placed on heparin subcutaneously and Pepcid for adequate prophylaxis.
She was thus treated with adequate doses of Oxacillin for a total 14 day course through her PICC line that was placed by Interventional Radiology.
The patient developed some diarrhea during her hospital stay as well and was ruled out adequately for Clostridium difficile toxin.
Once the patient was stable on pressure support settings, Physical Therapy was consulted to improve the patient's motor tone and strength.
Prednisone 15 mg q. day until [**2-15**].
Oxacillin 2 grams intravenously four times a day until [**2-21**] (a complete two week course).
Valium 5 mg twice a day.
Heparin subcutaneously twice a day.
Colace 100 mg twice a day p.r.n.
Pepcid, 20 mg twice a day.
Albuterol inhaler and nebulizers p.r.n.
Serevent 2 puffs twice a day.
Flovent 6 puffs twice a day.
Celexa 50 mg q. day.
Singulair 10 mg q. day.
Captopril 50 mg three times a day.
Iron sulfate 325 mg twice a day.
Ativan 1 mg q. three hours p.r.n.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Nitroglycerin paste p.r.n.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day.
She is to slowly be weaned off of her ventilator.
