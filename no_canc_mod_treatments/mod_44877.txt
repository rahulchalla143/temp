Medialization of bilateral carotid vessels  TTE (Complete) Done [**2186-2-15**] at 3:02:50 PM      FINAL The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 64 yo female with a PMH of ESRD on HD, Hep C, h/o polysubstance abuse, HTN, artificial hip who presented with abdominal pain, dizziness, and subjective fevers/chills in setting of missing 1 week of HD, having used cocaine the AM of admission, discovered to have FUSOBACTERIUM bacteremia.
Her HD line was removed, and after blood cultures cleared was replaced.
The ID team was consulted, and placed on ceftriaxone and metronidazole for two weeks.
A TTE to assess for vegetations did not show any vegetations.
Patient had a PICC line placed for IV abx.
Heme/Onc was consulted, and did not feel that the patient met criteria for HITT antibody testing, and recommended that she continue using heparin products.
Her platelet count rose to 118 from 155 on day of discharge; Heme/Onc felt that her drop was likely secondary to a medication effect, which might coincide with her discontinuation of meropenem.
Heme/Onc recommending adding on B12 level and methylmalonic acid levels given a known history of borderline B12.
Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology, though consider that hypoglycemia could be secondary to prolonged sympathomimetic use, such as cocaine binge, which can cause hypoglycemia, or infection.
Unlikely to be medication effect and patient was not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics.
We continued her pain regimen with Tramadol, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen.
Thigh/Hip pain: Was stable during hospitalization; patient was continued on her lidocaine patch, and PT cleared her for walking.
Patient recieved HD on the day of her discharge on [**2186-2-16**].
Abdominal pain: Improved during hospitalization with IVF and pain control.
