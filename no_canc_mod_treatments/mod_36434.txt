He was given morphine, Unasyn and Flagyl, transfused PRBC and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was admitted to the MICU.
He had an elevated lactate, leukocytosis and tachycardia though was normotensive with IVF and blood products.
Infectious colitis was also considered and all stool studies were negative.
Patient's abdominal exam continued to worsen, his lactate increased despite IVF and ABX so surgery was consulted and he had an exploratory laparotomy on [**7-22**] that showed diffuse bowel edema/mucosal inflammation but no necrosis, no resection was performed.
He was transferred to the Trauma SICU and Unasyn started, Flagyl was continued.
On [**7-23**] Unasyn/Flagyl was switched to Zosyn when OSH called to say he had a GNR in his blood culture from ED (pre-antibiotics).
From an ID standpoint, the team was then called by [**Location (un) 100633**]/[**Location (un) 5503**] micro lab that the GNR had Acinetobacter Baumannii growing from aerobic blood culture drawn in the ED prior to antibiotic therapy ([**7-21**]) that was sensitive only to Collistin and Tigacycline (MIC 4), intermediate to Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and resistant to Bactrim, Ceftaz, Cipro, Imipenem, Gentamycin, Tobramycin, Aztreonam.
They recommended completing a course of Zosyn as he was non toxic with a normal WBC and no fevers.
His catheter was replaced this morning and the plan is to try a third voiding trial once he is more ambulatory.
He was placed on Lantus and was gradually increased to 14 units qPM with a tighter sliding scale.
Prior to admission he was on NPH [**Hospital1 **]..
He has been on a diabetic diet but generally needs coverage QID.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor he was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service who recommended a short term rehab prior to returning home to help increase his mobility and endurance safely.
