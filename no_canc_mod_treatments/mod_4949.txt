His recent history is significant for an admission from [**7-25**] to [**8-8**] for left foot osteomyelitis for which he was treated with vancomycin and fluconazole.
He was re-admitted from [**8-12**] to [**8-17**] with fevers thought to be due to a PICC line infection.
His PICC was replaced and he was re-started on vancomycin, continued on his fluconazole, and started on a two week course of levofloxacin.
In the ED he was febrile to 102.8 and started on Vanco, Levo, and Flagyl.
Overnight, his SBP dropped into the 80s and after receiving 5-6 L NS he was started on peripheral dopamine gtt with response.
He was initially admitted to the MICU and started on broad spectrum antibiotics (caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) **], ceftazidime for h/o pseudomonas infection, vanco for MSRA).
He was also started on flagyl for complaints of increasing diarrhea and leukocytosis (c.diff positive on [**8-18**]).
He required pressor support for some time and was also started on hydrocort/fludrocort for a low random cortisol (9.2).

He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, caspofungin, and vancomycin).
A stool sample was positive for c. difficile and he was started on metronidazole as well.
Initially he needed blood pressure support with pressor agents and was started on hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone due to a low random cortisol.
After his blood pressure stablized off pressor agents he was transferred to the regular floor on [**8-20**] and he remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile until discharge on [**8-22**].
He was weaned off both hydrocortisone and fludricortisone and his blood pressure remained stable.
He was discharged with instructions and prescriptions to complete a 14 day course of flagyl 500 tid and a 30 day course of fluconazole 400 qd.
He had daily dressing changes and did an excellent job of staying off his feet and elevating his foot whenever possible.
He was given a prescription to complete a 30 day course of fluconazole 400 qd and has a follow up appointment with his podiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-4**].
Diabetes Mellitus: This was initially controlled with an insulin drip in the MICU.
When he was transferred to the floor he was started on his home dose of metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] and was put on a sliding scale.
His lisinopril 5 mg qd was also re-started.
His blood sugar control was adequate on this regimen and he was encouraged to follow up on this issue with his PCP.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine was elevated initially in the ED (2.2) but returned to his baseline (0.9) with hydration and this was thought to be due mostly to a pre-renal state.
He was maintained on his keppra and encouraged to follow up with neurology at some point in the future.
