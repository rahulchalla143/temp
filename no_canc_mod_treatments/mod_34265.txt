You were initially started on antibiotics in case there was an infection.
The kidney doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and you were started on medication and albumin to help the kidney function, which slowly improved.
The antibiotics were stopped since there was no evidence of infection.
We tried gentle diuresis to pull of the fluid but the kidneys were still not doing well enough to restart the diuretics.
The following medications were changed during this admission: - STOP Nadolol - STOP Lasix - STOP Spironolactone - STOP Gabapentin for now until we know where your renal function settles out - STOP Nitroglycerin tablets (this can cause low blood pressure) - STOP Sucralfate - STOP Clotrimazole troches (as you no longer need these)  - DECREASE the dose of Pantoprazole from 40mg by mouth twice daily to once daily (you have the prescription for twice daily, so just take it once daily for now)  - START Midrodrine 10mg by mouth three times daily - START Ondansetron 4mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea  Please continue the other medications you were taking prior to this admission.
