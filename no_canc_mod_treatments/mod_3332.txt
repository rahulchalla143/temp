She was intubated with rapid improvement in her arterial blood gas, but her systolic blood pressure subsequently dropped into the 50s and she was started on a dopamine drip.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with her dopamine drip partially weaned, and her systolic blood pressure in the 120s.
She had no acute changes on her electrocardiogram, but a heparin drip was started due to concerns of a possible acute coronary syndrome.
She maintained her blood pressure, overnight on the night after admission, as the dopamine drip was weaned off.
The dopamine drip was stopped entirely on the morning after admission.
She remained stable on a mechanical ventilator overnight, and on the day after admission she was extubated without difficulty.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was seen by the Pain consultation service who recommended stopping all of her outpatient pain medications and staring a morphine patient-controlled analgesia to evaluate her daily opiate needs prior to starting a new pain control regimen.
The patient and family adamantly deny that the patient was overusing her narcotics at home.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2195**], status post myocardial infarction.
[**2200-3-25**] cardiac catheterization showed a patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and occluded saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, a 40% stenosis in the right internal mammary artery to right coronary artery, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 26, and occluded left main coronary artery, a proximally occluded right coronary artery, 50% mid stenosis of the circumflex, and a 100% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.
Chronic low back pain, status post laminectomy times two in the past.
She is maintained on chronic narcotics at home.
