After surgery initially he did feel well with moderate inotropic support and intraaortic balloon pump support.
He developed severe episode of ventricular tachycardia prior to chest closure.
He continues to have low cardiac output syndrome and acidosis despite maximal inotropic support and intraaortic balloon pump support.
Cardiogenic shock, treated with IABP and emergency CABG x 3.
