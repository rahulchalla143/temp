HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 63-year-old Caucasian female who was admitted [**2109-7-24**] for a right hip replacement.
Of note, she has a past medical history significant for Sjogren syndrome and was on chronic prednisone until early [**Month (only) 116**] when she suffered a hip fracture, status post hip replacement on [**2109-4-16**].
Her hip replacement was complicated by recurrent infections requiring the removal of the orthopaedic hardware.
This was again complicated by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and candidal hip infections; for which she was initially treated with linezolid and then switched to Synercid.
She was treated with AmBisome as well for the candidal infection.
The patient's hardware was removed on [**2109-8-12**] with Girdlestone procedure.
Unfortunately, Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced many recurrent complications including new hematoma formation in the right hip extending into the right thigh requiring surgical intervention; specifically, evacuation with persistent vacuum suction to the open wound.
She required a short course of pressors; specifically a dopamine drip.
These were weaned as she received volume and packed red blood cells.
Intravenous antibiotics, transfusion support, intravenous fluids, and continued hip evacuation through suction was pursued.
