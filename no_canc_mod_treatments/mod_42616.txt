Large subcutaneous hematoma, similar in size to perhaps slightly decreased, with similar fluid-fluid levels.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 year-old female with history of congestive heart failure, diabetes [**Name (NI) **], multiple pulmonay emboli on chronic anticoag who was recently bridged on lovenox for colonoscopy and presented with an abdominal hematoma.
1) Hematoma: Patient had been on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin and an IVC filter given history of pulmonary emboli.
Restarted warfarin on [**11-4**], however, subsequently developed hematocrit drop from 29 to 21 as a result of over-anticoagulation with heparin during warfarin bridging.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued, she was transfused 2 units of blood and then transferred to MICU for protamine reversal.
MICU course included multiple transfusions of red blood cells as well as FFP.
A central venous catheter was placed and removed just prior to her discharge to the floor.
Other than increasing ambulation and getting the pt's pain under control with oxycodone SR 30mg Q12h and oxycodone 20mg q4hr as well as 1-2mg IV morphine q3-4hr prn for breakthrough pain.
Pt was started on a lidoderm patch to try to help control pain at site of hematoma.
Pt was also maintained on her gabapentin which was increased to 300, 300, 400mg a day to help with her neuropathic pain from DM.
Vascular assessed that the hematoma did not need to be drained surgically and that her IVC filter was still in good position and should not be replaced.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], vascular surgery, and ophthomalogy all assessed pt and her history and gave opinions about whether pt should restart anticoagulation at any point.
Vascular surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that her risks of bleeding outweighed her risks of having a PE and that her IVC would help prevent a PE while another bleed might be fatal.
They remarked that if she was restarted on anticoagulation that it should be coumadin and not heparin or lovenox as she seemed to have more bleeding problems from those anticoagulants than coumadin and that no anticoagulation should be started until her hematoma has resolved.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] had suggested restarting coumadin without a heparin bridge and starting and adjusting the dose very gingerly with tight INR monitoring and control as they did not think she had a bleed while on coumadin.
They wanted to better assess the pt's bleeding and anticoagulation that she was on when she had the bleeding and it seemed that the pt bled when supratherapeutic on lovenox and heparin but not coumadin.
The pt will be following up with [**Last Name (STitle) 1978**] in 2 weeks after discharge, with ophthomology 2.5 weeks after discharge and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5263**] in 2weeks after discharge.
She was placed on standing nebulized treatments and this alleviated the symptoms to some extent.
She was maintained well on her nebulizers and bi-pap at night for her OSA.
Patient reported decrease in vision on presentation to ED, especially with straining, movement.
She was also given stool softeners and cough suppressants to decrease strain.
3) Diabetes [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: Patient was maintained on her home regimen of 42 units glargine at night plus sliding scale insulin coverage.
On [**11-15**] the pt's creatitine starting to rise slowly and reached as high as 1.2 which was again likely caused by prerenal causes secondary to pt being off IVF and not taking in enough fluids to counteract her being on her diovan and lasix home doses.
The diovan was stopped and the lasox was held for 3 days and restarted back at 40mg for two days before agains being on 80mg dialy home dose again.
Completed 7-day course of Ciprofloxacin on [**11-4**].
New UA and culture show E. coli UTI, resistant to bactrim and foley was removed and pt was started on ceftriaxone for 10 days and follow up UA was negative for UTI and the culture is pending.
Pt was restarted on her home dose of urecholine for urinary retention on [**11-26**].
6) Hypercholesterolemia: continued simvastatin .
8) OSA: Bipap at home settings of 11 I, 8 E. .
Prior to ICU admission, patient was maintained on an IV heparin drip with a plan to start coumadin when PTT reached 60-80.
Coumadin was re-introduced [**11-4**].
With fall in Hct and ICU admission, pharmacologic anticoagulation was DC'ed entirely.
She will be kept on pneumoboots for rehab.
Pt was maintained on a bowel regimen to keep her BMs regular and to decrease straining to help maintain .
