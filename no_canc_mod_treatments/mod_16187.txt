He was unable to be adequately managed with Lasix and Bumex and required Natrecor for adequate diuresis.
We were able to continue his beta blocker, aspirin and statin as well as his ACE inhibitor.
His ACE inhibitor was switched from captopril to lisinopril for more convenient once daily dosing.
He was started on heparin and Coumadin for this thrombus with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
Heparin was discontinued prior to discharge when this goal was reached.

In addition, low dose digoxin was added for further rate control and augmentation of cardiac output.
Protonix was continued throughout hospitalization.
The patient was started on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with apical thrombus.
In addition, his hematocrit declined and he needed to be transfused during the hospitalization to maintain hematocrit above 28 as he has known heart failure and coronary artery disease.
