LE Doppler [**2131-12-13**] FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins.
Started on lovenox at therapeutic dosing.
Pt did have precancerous polyps on recent colonoscopy per his report however these were removed and found in the very recent past.
On arrival, clinically appeared so well and was hemodynamically stable and it was felt that the risks of lysis were too great to proceed with the procedure now in clinical picture of such stability.
Placement of IVC filter also considered but given that pt had already been on anticoagulation for 24 hours it was less likely that LE clots would mobilize at that point.
Although prior hypercoagulable workup in [**2127**] was reportedly negative, pt likely has some underlying propensity for clotting and it was felt that accordingly the IVC filter would likely clot off within several weeks, possibly prior to removal.
Hypercoagulable workup sent and pt was started on warfarin.
Protein C, S, antithrombin, anticardiolipin results were pending at the time of discharge.
#gout - continued allopurinol, colchicine .
In setting of recurrent PEs there must be heightened concern for malignancy (although pt without smoking history and only with one small nodule, most likely incidental and benign) 2) pt should have referral to heme/onc on DC, given this is his second episode of PE unprovoked  Medications on Admission: HOME MEDICATIONS: folic acid 1 tab daily dose unspecified colchicine 0.6 mg daily allopurinol 100 mg daily .
