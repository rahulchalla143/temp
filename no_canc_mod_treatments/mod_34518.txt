History of Present Illness: 49 M c/ PMH HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis, presented on [**3-10**] for biopsy and fiducial placement into liver by interventional radiology for 2 liver nodules that are being followed.
HE was subsequently transferred here for further care and management.
He required multiple boluses of midazolam and high doses of propofol gtt to maintain sedation.
He spiked temperatures as high as 103.3- these were attributed to administration of blood products and cultures and antibiotics were not sent.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 49 yo M with Hep C and EtOH Cirrhosis who presented after liver biopsy with hemothorax now who was transferred to the hepatorenal service following a prolonged MICU course complicated by delirium tremens and pneumonia.
He had been intubated for hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, HTN, in the presence of high grade fevers).
He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Later in his MICU course he was started on vancomycin and cefepime for a question of ventilator associated pneumonia, as extubation was proving to be difficult.
His antibiotics were stopped in sequence as he remained breathing well on room air, afebrile, and with a decreasing white count.
He received three days of vancomycin and four days of cefepime.
He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin and quickly returned to his baseline mental status.
His lasix and aldactone were held.
EtOH Cirrhosis complicated by ascites, varices: The patient was maintained on a low salt diet.
He continued on lactulose and rifaximin.
He was started on an insulin sliding scale which was discontinued once he was off TPN and tolerating po's without evidence of hyperglycemia.
His TPN was discontinued prior to discharge.
