She was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, and zosyn which was narrowed to nafcillin on [**9-25**].
Her SICU course was complicated by MSSA pneumonia, a left femoral DVT for which she was intially started on heparin gtt followed by coumadin on [**9-27**], and confusion felt to be secondary to sedating medications, potential alcohol withdrawal, and possibly hepatic encephalopathy (lactulose was discontinued on [**9-20**]).
Medicine Floor Hospital Course:  # MSSA Epidural Abscess - Pt found to have epidural abscess s/p decompression and laminectomy, per ortho spine.
She was given a C-spine collar for stability.
Pt treated empirically (vanco and cefepine and cipro) for epidural abscess and then narrowed to Nafcillin after sensitivities returned positive for MSSA.
Pt will continue nafcillin for extended therapy until she follows up with ortho-spine outpatient.
**REHAB: -Continue Nafcillin regimen (day 1=[**2183-9-25**]).
She will be on this for several months, per ortho-spine reccomendations.
Both the epidural abscess and the pna had the same MSSA infection and were treated empirically with vanco, cipro and cefepime, followed by nafcillin after sensitivities returned.
Started on therapeutic heparin drip followed by therapeutic lovanox [**Hospital1 **] injections.
She began her bridge to coumadin on [**2183-10-1**].
Pt will go to rehab on lovenox 60 [**Hospital1 **]/coumadin 2.5-5.0mg daily bridge.
She will continue coumadin therapy for at least 6 months, depending on ortho-spine and primary care physician's recommendations.
Thus, team felt comfortable continuing anticoagulation for the next several months.
She has been overlapped on both lovenox and coumadin for 48 hrs at time of discharge.
Was getting coumadin 2.5mg daily on day of discharge -INR goal: [**3-12**] for treatment of DVT.
Lactulose was discontinued in setting of diarrhea and was not restarted.
When diarrhea completely resolves, pt should re-start lactulose at rehab to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
Diarrhea caused K+ and bicarb wasting and she was repleted daily.
Diarrhea improved over the last few days of hospital course and she was given yogurt probiotics to help with antibiotic induced diarrhea.
**REHAB: -consider restarting home lactulose regimen (8 tablespoons/day) when diahrea resolves.
We repleted for bicarb <20.
She was placed on CIWA protocol anyway, given her significant alcohol history.
Her home oxazepam was held and may be restarted at rehab if patient develops any anxiety or tremulousness.
Was on lactulose chronically at home but was stopped during hosptialization when pt had acute diarrhea.
She was given thiamine, folate, Multivitamin daily.
CIWA protocol was initiated at begining of hospitalization.
# Anemia - Has chronic anemia, on aranesp at home, likely related to splenomegaly and alcoholism.
#Renal Insuficiency: Pt came in with Cr=1.5 After fluid hdyration and surgery, Cr came down to 0.7-1.1 range.
She was given lactated ringers and gentle fluid hydration.
# Hyperglycemia - patient without history of diabetes but was given ISS for hyperglycemia in setting of tube feeds and post-op.
# Hypothyroidism - Contined home regimen of levothyroxine 50 mcg daily .
# Depression - Contined home regimen of Zoloft 150mg daily & Ritalin 20mg TID .
# Multiple Sclerosis - Copaxone was held since admission since there was concern that it might make pt more immunocompromised in setting of acute infections.

You must continue to take coumadin for at least 6 months and follow up regularly at special coumadin clinics to check your blood and make sure it is thin.
Do not stop taking coumadin until your primary care doctor or the orthopedic doctor tells you to.
