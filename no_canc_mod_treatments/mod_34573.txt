Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with dwarfism, chronic hypercarbia, obesity hypoventilation syndrome transfered for tracheostomy evaluation, expired during admission  Chronic respiratory failure likely due to hypoventilation of obesity.
She was intubated endotracheally and ENT replaced a longer trach, and patient was kept paralyzed and sedated in order to prevent losing the airway and allow tract to epithelialize.
She was started on broad antibiotic coverage.
On further discussion with family, it was decided that being on the ventilator chronically was not in line with patient's goals of care so it was decided to pursue comfort measures rather than aggressive treatment.
