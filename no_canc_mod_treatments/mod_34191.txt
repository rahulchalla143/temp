Normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve.
Malpositioned NG tube, with side ports at the level of the GE junction, advancement recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart valve and a fib, admitted for anticoagulation before PVI ablation by EP the day after admission.
Initially his INR was 3.1, so heparin drip was discontinued.
Continued on home dose of atenolol and aspirin.
Continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily.
He was then treated with IV diazepam for withdrawl per CIWA protocol.
On [**3-7**] patient was restarted on Warfarin 10mg but had a significant Hct drop and was treated with Vitamin K, platelets and FFP on [**3-8**].
# Respiratory status- For his respiratory status, patient was initially intubated for delirium, inability to control bleeding.
On [**3-8**] he was also started on Vanc/Levofloxacin for concern for CAP and GPC in sputum & CXR concerning for left lung process.
[**3-11**] Vanco was discontinued as sputum grew MSSA.
Also on [**3-15**], he spiked a new fever and was pancultured and antibiotics were broadened to Cipro/Vanc/Zosyn for VAP.
Given his failure to improve for several days following, IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible trach placement but could not do so given his C-collar.
His cough was not overly strong initially and he did require frequent suctioning but was able to protect his airway.
On [**3-20**] his sputum culture revealed ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES and his antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime.
The patient finished a full 8 day course of cefepime and had no furthe symptoms.
# Groin Hematoma- For his traumatic sheath pull, EP and Vascular continued to monitor his groin wound and provide recommedations.
Given his AVR, EP encouraged heparin gtt as much as possible to minimize the risk of emobolic CVA.
Ultimately, patient was restarted successfully on a heparin gtt without a Hct drop until [**3-15**].
Vascular evaluated the patient and thought a wound exploration was warranted.
On [**4-8**] pt was reevaluated by vascualar surgery, looked well, and his staples were taken out.
Patient was treated with thiamine, folate and a multivitamin given his alcohol history.
For concern for hepatic encephalopathy he was started on Lactulose.
His lactulose was discontinued as hepatic encephalopathy was unlikely.
Pt intially had significant sundowning and agitiation that would require haldol 2-3mg overnight.
He may require a small dose of haldol for the next few days, but we do not expect this to be an ongoing issue with is resolving delirium.
Thaimine and folate were added to his outgoing medications.
He can come out of C collar for showers and shoort periods but should careful to avoid hyperextension.
# Atrial fibrillation- For his atrial fibrillation, patient underwent PVI placement.
Given his tenuous status, warfarin was not restarted after the initial trial on [**3-7**] while the patient was in the MICU.
Plan to restart Warfarin on the floor.
He was continued on Amiodarone taper per EP service.
Pt is going to be continued on Amiodirone.
Concerning anticoagulation pt was placed on heparin while his INR became subtherapeutic, but was d/c once pt reached his goal of 2.5-3.5 (due to the mechanical valve).
Pt's warfarin was increased to 9mg four times per week, and 7.5mg three times per week.
PICC in place and plan to cont vanco for 6 wk course.
The cultures were reviewed by Infectious disease who believed that the bactermia was contiminant and vancomycin was discontinued.

Imaging also revealed that you have narrowing in your spinal canal so you were placed in a hard cervical collar.
We treated you for pneumonia with Zosyn, and were thought to have endocarditis but the bacteria in the blood was found to be a contaminated and the antibiotic was discontinued.
