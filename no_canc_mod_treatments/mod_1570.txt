She was begun on beta-blocker for the CHF, but was unable to tolerate the drug secondary to bradycardia and increased dyspnea.
She presented for placement of a dual- chamber pacemaker, as synchronized AV pacing will improve her tolerance of beta-blocker and CHF.
Mitral valve replacement in [**2155**].
VDI pacemaker placement in [**2155**].
AV conduction block: The patient has a history of complete    AV conduction block as a complication of mitral valve    replacement in [**2155**].
This was controlled on admission with    VVI pacemaker; however, given the patient's development of    CHF over the two months prior to admission and her    inability to tolerate beta-blocker, she was admitted for    placement of a biventricular pacemaker for synchronized AV    pacing.
In preparation for her procedure, the patient's Coumadin was discontinued,and IV heparin was started to maintain anticoagulation therapy.
She was maintained on IV heparin, weight-based protocol until her pacer revision was performed on [**2165-6-24**].
Following her pacemaker revision, the patient's Coumadin was restarted with a goal INR of greater than 3.
IV heparin was continued until INR was greater than 3, at which time the heparin was discontinued, and the patient was continued on her current Coumadin dose.
At the time of discharge, INR was greater than 3, and the patient was recommended to follow-up with her primary care physician for continued Coumadin monitoring.
Treatment was continued    with her outpatient doses of Lasix and Lisinopril with    good affect.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and felt that the patient was at high operative risk and would be better served by anticoagulation and thrombolysis.
The patient was admitted to the CCU for treatment and observation and was treated thrombolytic therapy using alteplase.
Treatment was continued with IV heparin until Coumadin was therapeutic with an INR greater than 3 as above.
At the time of discharge, it is evident that she will require repeat mitral valve replacement in the near future.
