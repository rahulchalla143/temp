IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-4-25**] 6:37 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2189-11-19**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with valve replacement and intact midline sternal wires.
Rare urothelial cells, numerous neutrophils, and few red   blood cells.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with history of Afib on coumadin, prosthetic mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves (rheumatic fever), who presented with 18 hours of hematuria and black stools, found to have an acute 8pt drop in hematocrit within the first day of admission.
She was found to have pseudomonal urine infection and ulcerations of bladder on cystoscopy which were cauterized.
She had recurrent bleeding of the bladder and overall required 15 units of pRBC as well as other products.
Eventually, she was restarted on a heparin gtt with lower target PTT while bridging to warfarin for her mechanical heart valves.
Cytoscopy on [**2193-4-30**] showed ulcers and excoriations in bladder that were cauterized; urine cytology showed no malignant cells, then atypical specimen following.
She was off heparin gtt, aspirin, and coumadin for 3 days starting [**2193-5-3**] given bleeding.
Eventually restarted on heparin gtt [**5-6**] bridging to coumadin.
On [**2193-5-15**] the foley was discontinued and she continued to have urine output (no clots) which was not grossly bloody.
# Bladder atony: After the foley catheter was removed, she was having high post-void residuals.
# Bioprosthetic/mechanical valves: Patient has 3 non-native heart valves due to history of rheumatic heart disease--2 metallic and one bioprosthetic valve, was on coumadin at home.
Balancing risks and benefits, heparin was held from [**5-3**] to [**5-6**] in the setting of bladder bleeding which allowed time for clot organization in the bladder.
Heparin gtt was restarted on [**5-6**] and bridged to warfarin with INR goal 2.5-3.5.
Her discharge warfarin regimen was 7.5 mg daily everyday except 10mg on Tuesdays/Thursdays and she was therapeutic.
She was treated with a total of 19 days of cefepime due to ongoing instrumentation for CBI.
Because she had high post-void residuals after foley was removed (see above), urology recommended checking another urinalysis which looked improved from prior.
The cultures grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and she was started on 10 days of linezolid 600 mg PO BID (was intermittently instrumented).
She should continue the linezolid until [**2193-5-30**].
#Atrial fibrillation (Afib)- For anticoagulation changes, see above.
For rate control, she takes metoprolol at home.
Had episode of afib with rapid ventricular response in ICU with HR 160s so patient was placed on diltiazem gtt for rate control.
Metoprolol was restarted once hematuria was stable and she did not have any rapid rates.
Discharge regimen was metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.
# Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia likely from receiving 16 units PRBCs with only 1 bag of platelets.
Her platelet count was monitored closely (especially since she was on heparin gtt for anticoagulation) but it returned to [**Location 213**].
# Osteoporosis: continued alendronate 70 mg weekly, calcium and vitamin D supplements.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued simvastatin 40 mg daily .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please complete her course of PO linezolid 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] for VRE urine culture - Please monitor INR very closely because elevated levels will likely predispose to recurrent hematuria.
Adjust her dose of warfarin as needed to maintain therapeutic levels.

You were restarted on your coumadin very slowly for the mechanical heart valves that you have.
Please make the following changes to your medications: - START senna and colace daily - START milk of magnesia 30 mL daily as needed for constipation - STOP aspirin - START linezolid 600 mg twice a day until [**2193-5-30**] - CHANGE your warfarin (coumadin) to 7.5 mg 5x per week (Mo, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun) and 10 mg 2x per week (Tues, Thurs).
You should bring your medications to each appointment so your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] update their records and adjust the doses as needed.
