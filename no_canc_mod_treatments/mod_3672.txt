The patient was continued on her prednisone, CellCept, and FK 506.
We opted to treat her conservatively with aspirin and Lopressor, per the recommendation of the Cardiology Service.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis initially resolved on the insulin drip and aggressive hydration.
We initially maintained her on a regular insulin sliding-scale with a reduced insulin dose given her dramatically decreased oral intake.
The patient was initially treated with half of her insulin dosage.
The dose was subsequently increased to her full dose of NPH insulin.
She was once again started on an insulin drip.
She was again treated with intravenous fluids with potassium supplementation.
The patient remained on the insulin drip for 24 hours until her gap resolved and bicarbonate increased.
The patient subsequently had appropriate control of her blood sugars on 22 units of Lantus at bedtime.
