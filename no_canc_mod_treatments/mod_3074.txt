She was admitted to the medical floor, where she was started on ceftriaxone for her UTI and vancomycin for her cellulitis.
Given her echo findings, elevated BNP/troponin the floor team was concerned that she may have a PE so she was empirically started on a heparin gtt as she was unable to get a CTA because of her [**Last Name (un) **] and radiology felt a V/Q scan would not be useful in the setting of her poor baseline CXR.
ABG done at that time was 7.22/59/70, she was placed on her nighttime bipap for her respiratory distress.
VS on arrival to the ICU were: 100.4, 80, 105/43, 20, 99% on bipap with 6L.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is empty with a Foley catheter in place.
===================== Chest X-ray ([**2122-6-18**]): ===================== FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.
NG tube courses in the stomach, its tip out of view.
Left PIC catheter is seen coiling in the brachiocephalic veinor in azygos vein, unchanged in position.
Widened mediastinum can be attributed to mediastinal lipomatosis, as seen on [**2122-6-5**] CT exam.
Labs Pending at time of discharge: 2 blood cultures and 1 Urine culture   Brief Hospital Course: Hypoxic and Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of her hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, including obesity-related hypoventiliation syndrome, pulmonary edema, and possible PE.
A heparin infusion was initiated for a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
A heparin drip was empirically started.
She required nasal intubation in the ICU due to poor oropharyngeal anatomy, begining on [**2122-6-6**], and was unable to be successfully extubated as she developed post extubation stridor.
Tracheostomy was pursued with good results on [**2122-6-17**].
Additionally, given possible pulmonary edema aggressive diuresis was initiated with a lasix infusion and metolazone, resulting in a net negative diuresis of about 10 liters for her length of stay.
Patient was started on oral coumadin prior to discharge.
She will require at least 6 months of oral anticoagulation.
She was treated with a furosemide infusion and metolazone.
Her medications should continue to be renally dosed.
Of note, her Valsartan and Lisinopril were held given renal compromised.
She was treated with ceftriaxone for 7 days.
Cellulitis: She was treated for cellulitis of the right lower extremity with vancomycin for a total of 14 days.
An insulin infusion was initiated, resulting in improved glycemic control.
Her insulin was titrated to glargine 8 U qday with a regular insulin sliding scale every 6 hours.
As the patient was only receiving tube feeds upon discharge, this will most likely require adjustment, specifically changes to short acting insulin and meal time dosing.
Hypertension: Her home medications of HCTZ, lisinopril and valsartan were initially held.
Once she was stabalized, she was started on amlodipine 5mg daily with adequate blood pressure control.
Given multiple antihypertensives prior to admisison, will most likely require reinstitution of additional antihypertensive agents if goal of <130/80 mmHg is not acheived.
After tracheostomy, patient did not require any positive pressure ventilation, only trach mask for saturations around 96%.
She will most likely require positive airway pressure when tracheostomy closes up as lots of redundant oral pharyngeal soft tissue.

Your breathing became so poor that you required mechanical intubation to help you breathe.
Attempts were made to take you off the ventilator, however you were unable to safely have the tube removed due to airway swelling.
You were started on a heparin drip to keep your blood thin, as well as another medication called "Warfarin (aka Coumadin)" to keep your blood thin.
This is likely due to the low blood oxygen you experienced on initial presentation.
Of note, the following medications were discontinued.
Please speak with your doctor before making any changes in your medication regimen.
STOP TAKING: Valsartan 40 mg daily HCTZ 25 mg daily Gabapentin 200 mg twice daily Lisinopril 30 mg daily .
You will be going to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility for further strengthening and care.
