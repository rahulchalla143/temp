The patient was put on a heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
In addition, he was given 40 mg of IV Lasix for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
He was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
He was treated with IV nitroglycerin drip, morphine, and Lasix.
The patient was thus started on dopamine and dobutamine.
The following day, these medications were weaned off and the patient was maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula and CPAP during his episodes of respiratory distress.
A discussion was had with the family about the possibility of hemodialysis with regards to the patient's code status.
The patient's family stated that they would need an additional hour to make a decision on these matters.
Thus, no further interventions were attempted.
