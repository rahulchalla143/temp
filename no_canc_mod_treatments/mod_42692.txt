Pt currently at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab - reportedly received ativan 1mg and ambien for agitation and became more confused than at baseline and fell.
She was aggressively diuresed in the MICU for O2 sats in the 70's on 5L NC with a lasix gtt and nitro gtt.
Seen by pulmonary consult who rec swallow eval (no overt aspirations when eating slowly), ANCA (negative), diuresis, and attempt at slower prednisone taper.
She was treated with 40mg IV lasix and put out approx 300 cc urine.
Was also given solumedrol 125mg IV, Ceftazidime 1gm IV, Vancomycin 1gm IV, and Morphine 1mg IV.
CAD s/p PTCA [**Month/Day (2) **] to LCX, RCA, PDA (last cath [**8-20**]) 2.

many ecchymoses from heparin injections.
Was initially on BiPAP for approx 8 hours and was diuresed aggressively with lasix gtt.
She initially responded and was being weaned to lower amounts of oxygen for a few days.
She was initially treated with IV solumedrol given poor clinical picture on presentation but then switched to PO steroids given unclear of utility.
She was initially given cefepime and vanc for broad coverage given severe hypoxia but once diuresed she improved so drastically so changed coverage to levoflox.
She seemed to improve for a few days, but then even despite negative I/O's each day (autodiuresis) she began to have more difficulty with oxygenation.
Oxygenation and overall respiratory status continued to worsen and this was felt possibly secondary to her underlying interstitial lung disease (which was never very well understood).
