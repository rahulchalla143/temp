ET tube and NG tube remain in place.
There is a small right pneumothorax, and right chest tube remains in place.
This examination was read in conjunction with the followup study performed 20 minutes after this, and in the followup study, there is a chest tube in the left chest with almost complete re-expansion of the left lung.
[**2104-12-7**] CXR: ET tube is in good position with its tip about 4.5 cm above the carina.
Bilateral tubes are seen.
NG tube in good position.
[**2104-12-10**] KUB: FINDINGS: The NG tube tip is seen in the expected location of the distal stomach.
IMPRESSION: NG tube tip in expected location.
[**2104-12-12**] CXR: Chest tubes remain in place, without evidence of large pneumothorax.
[**2104-12-22**] MRI c-spine: 1.
Multilevel degenerative joint disease with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament with associated moderate spinal canal stenosis and impingement on the anterior portion of the spinal cord mostly at levels of C2- C3 and C3-C4.
He received multiple rounds of epinephrine, atropine, and DC defibrillation, and was placed under cooling protocol and amiodarone continuous infusion in ICU.
He also had developed pneumothoraces noted after cardiac arrest, necessitating chest-tube placement by thoracic surgery service.
Required intubation for cardiac arrest and subsequent to extubation on [**2104-12-15**], had respiratory distress.
This was treated with methylprednisolone, ipratropium, and albuterol nebs.
Albuterol was changed to xopenex due to tachycardia and agitation.
Required re-intubation for MRI on [**2104-12-22**], with difficulty, was eventually weaned and extubated on [**12-26**].
He then completed an oral corticosteroid taper.
Subsequently, on medical floor, he had episodes of tachypnea at night that were thought to be related to agitation and delirium, and these improved with a standing quetiapine as recommended by psychiatry.
Subsequently, scheduled quetiapine was discontinued as patient's mental status improved, although later readded prn as below.
He may have had a seizure when leaving AMA given his unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and incontinence.
Initially while intubated he was given benzos for agitation and these were gradually weaned off.
He was also given thiamine, folic acid, and a multivitamin or banana bags when he was unable to take POs.
PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph, thought to be likely source.
Per infectious diseases consultation, despite negative echocardiograms, decision was made to treat for 6-week course of Vancomycin for presumed endovascular infection, completed [**2105-2-13**] pm.
His PICC was removed [**2104-2-15**].
Per the family, the patient has untreated bipolar disorder and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.
He received IV thiamine for concern for Wernicke's encephalopathy.
Per neurology, and later psychiatry, recommendations, the patient was treated with seroquel, and after subsequent improvement in his mental status due to treatment of medical conditions, this was discontinued.
In mid-[**Month (only) 404**], patient became more agitated with staff, so quetiapine prn was restarted.
# Hypertension: HTN previously treated with lisinopril and atenolol.
During this admission, regimen required several adjustments, and once agitation improved, his anti-hypertensives were able to be discontinued, since his blood pressure also improved.
Per ortho-spine consultation, patient was placed in [**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar until C-spine lesion could be excluded.
He was placed on a PPI intially for GI prophylaxis given his history of alcoholism and high dose steriods.
Started on ferrous gluconate.
# Nutrition: Initially received tube feeds through NG tube in ICU, but was transitioned to oral diet after speech and swallow evaluation.
Started on tamsulosin 0.4mg daily [**2-2**], with dose increased to 0.8mg and finasteride added on [**2-6**].
By discharge, had not required straight cath for over 1 week.
