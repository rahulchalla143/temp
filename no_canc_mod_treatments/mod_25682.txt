Pt had recently been admitted in [**6-12**] for cardiac stenting for 100% stenosis of RCA using BMS.
On [**7-17**], pt admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] and underwent Right thoracotomy with esophagectomy and J-tube placement, complicated by SBO thought due to stricture at duodonal anastamosis.

On arrival, an a-line was placed and CVL was replaced.

Patiemt on ventilator and unable to wean.
Family made patient DNR (no pressors) and then CMO, patient was taken off the ventilator and expired shortly thereafter.
