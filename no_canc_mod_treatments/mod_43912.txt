Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**], with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and R foot infection [**7-2**] now presenting with suprapubic pain, low grade fever, leukocytosis and hypotension.
He had multiple potential sources of infection including UTI, R foot ulcer s/p debridement and BSI.
He did grow out Pseudomonas from urine, for which he was treated with meropenem x 14 day course given resistance in the past.
Pt completed 14d course of meropenem for pseudomonas UTI.
He is s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on [**2178-8-25**].
# Hypotension - BP dropped to systolic 80s in ED, was responsive to IVF boluses and also was on levophed in MICU.
Responded to nebs, nitro, lasix, morphine and bipap.
Soon after, dc/d nitro drip, poor UO thus started on lasix drip.
Lasix was titrated and diuril added as needed to maintain 1-2L negative daily.
On [**2178-8-27**], patient was +600mL, so additional 60mg IV lasix administed prior to transfer to the floors.
Pt became hypotensive and bradycardic while on the commode on [**2178-8-30**] requiring atropine, transfer to MICU, pressors (dopamine) and intubation [**1-26**] ventilatory failure.
He was hemodynamically stable throughout this time and was started on lasix gtt and metolazone.
He diuresed well on this regimen and was extubated within 24 hours.
He was converted to PO lasix and called back out to the floor, under the management of the cardiology service.
After Cr bumped after several days of aggressive diuresis, patient was switched to torsemide as monotherapy for diuresis.
Felt that patient could benefit from LHC to attempt to restore blood flow to regions noted on echo to be hypokinetic.
After procedure, patient was restarted on heparin bridge to coumadin and was felt to be clinically stable for discharge.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure - During flash edema episdodes, pt w/ pulmonary edema, poor oxygen sats.
Over the course of his admission, the patient had three episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation; all resolved with aggressive diuresis and the patient was able to be extubated.
# Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD explantation.
Held antihypertensives including metoprolol, lisinopril and spironolactone as above given hypotension.
Diuresis as above.
Restarted lisinopril on discharge but continued to hold metoprolol and spironolactone as it was felt patient could not tolerate at this time due to HR 60s and SBP 90s-100s on discharge.
# s/p Mechanical AVR - on coumadin, INR supratherapeutic on admission, and patient with high sensitivity to coumadin doses (?
He is s/p Vitamin K administration and reversal.
Now currently on coumadin 5 mg QHS and heparin gtt for bridging (requires bridge [**1-26**] severe CHF).
cdiff toxin was sent and pt was started on PO flagyl.
C. diff EIA was negative and patient's diarrhea resolved, at which point PO flagyl was discontinued.
# DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS.
Patient had elevated CBGs during hospitalization initially that were controlled after uptitrating sliding scale to provide aggressive mealtime coverage.
The following sliding scale was achieving good glucose control at the time of discharge: At all mealtimes, give 4 units of insulin if glucose 50-150, 12 units if 151-200, 16 units if 201-250, and so on with extra 4 units for every CBG range in increments of 50.

You were found to have a severe urinary tract infection and were treated with IV antibiotics.
Your hospital course was complicated by numerous occurrences of rapid fluid collection in the lungs causing difficulty breathing and requiring intubation three separate times.
We felt that you would benefit from cardiac catherization to see if there were any blockages that could be precipitating your episodes of pulmonary edema.
You received cardiac catherization which showed no new blockages that could be intervened on; therefore, the plan was to continue you on medical management.
The following medications were changed during your hospitalization: DISCONTINUED furosemide DISCONTINUED metolazone ADDED torsemide (instead of the two above medications) for removal of excess fluid DISCONTINUED metoprolol for now as your blood pressure and heart rate may not tolerate it DISCONTINUED spironolactone for now as your blood pressure may not tolerate it INCREASED gabapentin to 600 three times a day for better control of your neuropathic pain ADDED docusate for constipation ADDED senna for constipation ADDED bisacodyl for constipation ADDED miralax as needed for constipation ADDED lorazepam as needed for anxiety.
You were not restarted on this medication in the hospital because we were not sure your blood pressure could tolerate them at this time.
At that time, your wound will be re-examined and a decision will be made regarding whether your wound VAC needs to be continued.
