She recieved blood transfusions and her bleeding stopped, she remained stable and was able to be discharged to home with physical therapy.
Initially tolerated procedure well, but developed left thigh pain prior to transfer from suite and left thigh hematoma was noted.
She briefly required dopamine for hypotension.
She was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring where she was quickly weaned from dopamine and FemStop was removed without incident.
Is s/p stenting to RFA and PTA to LFA.
Prasurgrel was initially held in setting of acute infection with continuation of ASA 325.
Prasugrel was restarted prior to discharge after hemostasis and resuscitation was ensured.
# Hypertension (HTN): Home regimen includes lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and HCTZ 25 daily.
Lisinopril was then restarted without incident.
# Diabetes mellitus (DM): Continued sliding scale insulin with 34 units lantus while in house.
