The pregnancy was complicated by maternal diagnosis of repeated episodes of tachycardia which failed therapy with Labetalol but were successfully treated with Atenolol.
She presented on the day of delivery with a history of decreased to no fetal movement for two weeks.
The baby had a biophysical profile of two out of eight on the day of delivery and so was delivered by urgent cesarean section secondary to that status in addition to a nonreactive fetal heart rate tracing.
He responded to stimulation, bulb suction and bag and mask ventilation for one to two minutes.
He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for prematurity, hypotonia, and respiratory distress.
In general, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] was pink and was breathing comfortably on continuous positive airway pressure.
His neck was edematous, right side greater than left, with an area of subcutaneous fluid collection.
His skin examination revealed a few scattered petechiae on his right cheek and periauricular area.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  After requiring positive pressure ventilation for several minutes in the delivery room, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] continued to have respiratory distress.
He was placed on continuous positive airway pressure with improvement of his respiratory distress.
He required continuous positive airway pressure for the first 36 hours of life, then was able to transition to room air and has had no respiratory difficulty since that time.
Cardiovascular:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] initially had somewhat decreased perfusion on admission and therefore received a normal saline bolus.
He received a single bolus of sodium bicarbonate at 2 meq/kg with some improvement.
He was initially held NPO on intravenous fluids of D12.5W at 60 cc/kg/day.
There was one additional period of low blood glucose that occurred on day of life four, requiring two D10 boluses but thereafter blood sugar was completely stable.
At 48 hours of life, it had risen to 7.0 and single phototherapy was begun.
He has not required blood transfusions during this hospitalization.
He was begun on Ampicillin and Gentamicin.
He had Gentamicin levels that were appropriate prior to his second dose and at 48 hours when his blood cultures were negative, antibiotics were discontinued.
On [**1-6**] he began a 5 day course of Illotycin for R eye drainage with good clearing.
