HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2134-4-26**], for angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary artery which was unsuccessful.
During that admission her course was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed for which she underwent an emergent left femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after an iliac stent was placed for acute leg ischemia followed by a large left retroperitoneal hematoma.
She is to be admitted at this time for right carotid endarterectomy followed by coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, asthma, dyspepsia, arthritis, emphysema, carotid stenosis on the left 80-99% and on the right 30-80%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was a direct admission to the Operating Room on [**2134-7-27**], at which time she underwent a right carotid endarterectomy.
In summary, the patient had a right carotid endarterectomy with shunt Dacron patch done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.
She remained in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for two days and on postoperative day two she was transferred from the Vascular Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care.
Also on postoperative day two the patient was seen and assessed by Cardiothoracic Surgery and scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On [**7-30**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room by Cardiothoracic Surgery at which time she underwent an off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting times two.
In summary, the patient had an off-pump CABG times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She had propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and Neo-Synephrine at 0.4 mcg/kg/min.
Her anesthesia was reversed.
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the day of surgery by remained in the Intensive Care Unit because intravenous nitroglycerin was required to control her blood pressure.
On postoperative day two the patient continued to have requirement for intravenous nitroglycerin.
On postoperative day three the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for planned stenting of her ramus stenosis.
In summary, the patient had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and successful stenting of a ramus stenosis.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of the day and the following morning the patient was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next two days with the assistance of the nursing staff and Physical Therapy, the patient's activity level was increased and on postoperative day six from her cardiac surgery and nine from her vascular surgery, it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care.
