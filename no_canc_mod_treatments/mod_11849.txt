His extremities at the time of admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed he had right groin sheaths in with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place.
His left anterior descending artery had a total proximal occlusion which received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent was placed.
After nitroglycerin and diltiazem treatment, TIMI-III flow was obtained.
Given the nature of his infarct and pressures noted during catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
He was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.
His balloon pump was weaned on [**2160-10-17**], and removed.
He was therefore started on Coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.
The patient responded well to mild diuresis with intravenous Lasix, as he was found to be significantly volume overloaded after cardiac catheterization.
