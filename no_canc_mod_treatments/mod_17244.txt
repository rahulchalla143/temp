Admission Date:  [**2175-1-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2175-1-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction times three) who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital secondary to respiratory distress requiring intubation and sedation.
At that time he was sent home on treatment with Bactrim double strength.
The patient was then intubated and sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment.
Isosorbide 60 mg by mouth once per day.
Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
Vital signs revealed his temperature was 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 90, his blood pressure was 145/76, his respiratory rate was 21, on a ventilator AC 510/5 saturating 100%.
A chest x-ray revealed endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube properly placed.
The patient had been on a heparin drip, but this was discontinued shortly thereafter.
A statin was started despite the questionable history of an allergy.
His beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up.
The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix as needed.
The patient was treated with hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction.
ACE inhibitor was held secondary to an increased creatinine, and Lopressor was titrated up.
Throughout the remainder of his course he showed no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure, and no further Lasix was required.
ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  This was felt to be secondary to Bactrim with an acute interstitial nephritis picture as there was positive eosinophils.
On this presentation on [**1-5**], initially the patient was started on Levaquin for questionable pneumonia; however, after extubation the patient was saturating well.
Therefore, the antibiotic was discontinued as it was felt that this was likely a viral bronchitis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had upper respiratory infection symptoms and a temperature at home prior to admission.
The patient was initially on Levaquin for a question of bronchitis/pneumonia but was stopped on [**1-6**].
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the Friday after his discharge to have his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine checked.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg by mouth three times per day.
The patient had been treated with pravastatin in the hospital with no adverse effects; however, reports repeated problems with statin medications in the past and was treated with niacin.
