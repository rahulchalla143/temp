Multiple spine fractures, most pronounced at T4 and T5, where there is involvement of the vertebral bodies and narrowing of the central spinal canal.
Right pneumothorax and bilateral lung contusions.
C5 right pedicle, C6 right lamina, C7 left transverse process, and left 2nd rib fractures.
Right pneumothorax, and left lung contusion.
Left median and ulnar motor conduction studies recording 2nd lumbrical and first palmar interosseous respectively revealed normal minimal prolongation of latency in both nerves.
Right median antebrachial cutaneous sensory response was normal.
However, given the complexity of the patient's injury, multiple mononeuropathies and cervical radiculopathies also could explain or contribute to this constellation of abnormalities.
Repeat study after the cervical collar is removed may provide additional diagnostic information regarding the possible contribution of cervical nerve root injury.
Brief Hospital Course: HD#1 - Patient received endotracheal tuber for airway protection, neurosurgery was consulted, high dose Solu-Medrol started, right chest tube paced for pneumothorax, and MRI of C/T/L spine obtained.
Right subclavian line was placed for venous access.
HD#2 - Hematocrit dropped from 35 to 24, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units fresh fozen plasma for coagulopathy with INR=1.5.
Had increased glucose and an insulin drip was started.
Chest tube was placed on water seal and then pulled when repeat CXR demonstrated no pneumothorax.
Tube feeds were held for increased residual.
Continued to be intubated and maintained on a fentanyl, propofol, and insulin drips.
Central line was changed over a wire.
HD#6 - Started on Zosyn for sputum culture with gram negative rods.
Went to operating room with neurosurgery for open reduction of T4-5 fracture dislocation, T2-T3 posterior thoracic arthrodesis utilizing locally harvested vertebral autograft supplemented with Vitoss foam and infuse bone morphogenetic protein, and a T2-T8 posterior segmental spinal instrumentation utilizing the [**Location (un) **] spinal fixation system.
HD#7 - Required fluid boluses for decreased CVP and urine output.
HD#8 - Still on Zosyn, cefazolin started, fentanyl and propofol drips continue, insulin drip discontinued and now on RISS.
HCT dropped to 24 and patient recieved 1 unit PRBC and 2 units FFP.
Still on fentanyl and propofol drips as well as Zosyn.
Started on Vancomycin and Flagyl.
HD#12 - ID consulted, Zosyn and Flagyl stopped and vancomycin and meropenem started.
HD #17 - Chest radiograph showing improving bibasilar infiltrates, medications changed to PO.
Ortho requests patient stay in L upper extremity orthoplast splint when using arm.
HD #18 - PEG and tracheostomy tube placed.

All cultures including blood culture and central line tip continue to have no growth.
Tube feeds now being cycled over 17 hours at 100ccs/hour.
Overall physical thearpy consultants believe he has "excellent rehab potential."
The patient has a tracheostomy and continues to be weaned from supplemental oxygen.
He also has a resolving pneumonia and will receive his 14th and last dose of levofloxacin tommorrow.
The pneumothorax on initial presntation has also resolved on most recent chest x-ray.
* From a nutrition standpoint, the patient is on tube feeds via G-tube of promote w/ fiber full strength patient was getting a total volume of 1680ccs cycled over 17 hours.
