The patient received 2.5 liters of normal saline, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for presumed pneumonia.
She then became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60/palp and was started on a dopamine drip at 24 mcg/kg and given a 500-cc bolus of normal saline times six.
After fluid resuscitation, her dopamine drip was slowly weaned down.
Status post gastrojejunostomy tube placement in [**2188**].
B12 deficiency diagnosed in [**2193**].
Left hip fracture; status post open reduction/internal fixation in [**2183**].
Levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once per day.
Flagyl 500 mg by mouth q.8h.
Synthroid 0.075 mg by mouth every day.
She improved rapidly with normal saline boluses.
Therefore, she was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl.
KIDNEY STONE ISSUES:  The patient was given copious fluids in order to flush the kidney stone.
PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY TUBE ISSUES:  On the second day of admission, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was noted to be halfway out of the patient's abdomen.
Therefore, the Gastroenterology Service was consulted, and they recommended removing the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and replacing with a new one.
Before they were able to do this, the initial percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube fell out on its own.
Gastroenterology did replace the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and recommended getting a stoma nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in order to evaluate the site of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Although dressings were continually changed, this bile had caused severe erythema and excoriation and skin breakdown around the area of the gastrojejunostomy tube.
Therefore, it was quite necessary that aggressive wound care be instituted in this area before any tube feeds could be restarted.
This would involve some sort of an ostomy placement with the gastrojejunostomy tube going through the ostomy in order to protect the skin.
NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was initially started on tube feeds; however, when it was noted that her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was draining copiously, the tube feeds were stopped.
There were many conversations with the patient's son regarding this issue, as he was quite distraught at her tube feeds being stopped for any number of hours.
It was explained to the son that the tube feeds could not be continued as the patient was draining the tube feeds onto her skin.
In addition, respiratory therapy was consulted to suction the patient and had found tube feeds in the patient's upper airways.
The tube feeds were not started until the replacement percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was inserted into the stomach.
The patient was maintained on intravenous fluids while she was off of the tube feeds.
Therefore, she was aggressively treated with albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers which seemed to improve her respiratory status.
Therefore, Respiratory Therapy was suctioning her throughout this hospitalization.
HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on her Synthroid.
[**Name (NI) **] stated this to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on several occasions.
However, upon discussion with other physicians, he did agree that she could stay until the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was replaced and until her respiratory status returned to baseline.
Levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg p.o.
Scopolamine patch one q.72h.
Miconazole powder 2% one application twice per day (apply around percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site).
Neutra-Phos one packet by mouth four times per day.
Albuterol nebulizer one nebulizer q.6h.
Atrovent nebulizer one nebulizer q.6h.
Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously q.8h.
