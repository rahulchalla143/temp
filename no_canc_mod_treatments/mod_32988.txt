Per notes he had HD yesterday and received 2 units PRBCS during HD and hct was 35 during HD.
INR was noted to be 4.3 , so pt received 5 mg of vitamin K. VS at NH were T 97.5 HR 104 BP 108/59 and sats of 98%.
He had a lavage of his g-tube that was clear and received protonix 40 IV x2.
He received an additional 5 mg of vitamin K and 2 units of FFP here.
Of note, pt recently admitted [**Date range (1) 77791**] for new atrial fibrillation, septic shock (urosepsis), and acute on chronic renal failure now requiring dialysis and was discharged to [**Hospital1 **].
Past Medical History: # DM2 # CRI (baseline 2.5)- recently started on HD # CHF # Trached and vent dependent [**1-17**] PNA in [**12-23**] # Morbid obesity # Afib on Coumadin # Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: Used to live with wife, who is HCP.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: VS: T:  HR: 120s BP: SBP 70s-90s  RR:  O2 sat: Gen: obese male, mentating appropriately, NAD, pale HEENT: anicteric sclera, dry MM Neck: supple, dialysis line in place Cardio: distant heart sounds, tachycardic, no murmur appreciated Pulm: CTAB anteriorly, no w/r/g Abd: soft, obese, NT, ND, +BS, G tube in place Ext: hyperpigmentation on shins, 1+ peripheral edema, 1+ DP pulses b/l Neuro: Alert, awake, mentating appropriately and responding to commands.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-2**] Tracheostomy tube tip terminates about 9 cm above the carina, and the cuff is overdistended, as communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2150-4-2**].
EGD [**2150-4-2**] Impression: Internal bumper of the recently placed PEG tube was seen in place.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **] - Watch Hct .
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
A double-lumen central line tip is in the proximal-to-mid one-third of the SVC.
The tracheostomy tube projects approximately 5 cm from the carina, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with h/o ESRD on HD, tracheostomy who initally presented with anemia and melena.
# GI Bleed:  On admission, he had melena in his rectal tube and gtube lavage was reportedly negative.
His melena at that time was felt most likely to LGIB, in the setting of recent initiation of anticoagulation and supratherapeutic INR.
ASA and coumadin were held on admission as well as his BB.
Aspirin and coumadin were held in the setting of active GI bleeding.
His ASA and coumadin were restarted.
With aggressive IVF resuscitation and transfusions on admission, patient became volume overloaded.
With CVVH, over 40L of fluids were removed.
However, in the setting of diuresis, the patient dropped his blood pressures and required Neo to maintain SBP over 90 and MAP greater than 55.
Neo was able to be weaned off with IVF boluses.
# Relative adrenal insufficiency:  Pt was started on a course of stress dose steroids after [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test had a less than target range increase after cosyntropin was administered.
# Chronic kidney disease, stage V:  The patient was started on dialysis for renal insufficiency during his previous admission.
He was on CVVH initially and then transitioned to HD 3x/week.
His temporary line was also tunneled in IR during this admission without complication.
A second tunneled line was placed by IR on [**4-20**].
He was started on midodrine to support his BP during dialysis.
His beta blocker and anticoagulation was initially held in the setting of his GIB.
He was restarted on his BB as tolerated by his BP.
He was also transiently on digoxin for improved rate control while on CVVH; this was discontinued as his HR came under better control with BB.
Pt was treated with a 14 day course of Vancomycin given his hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated WBC at the time.
# Respiratory failure:  Pt has a tracheostomy and initially required vent support.
With mobilization of his excess fluid, the patient was weaned to a trach mask while in the hospital.
Mechanical ventilation was restarted and he was maintained on this until discharge.
However, in the context of his increased oxygen requirement and cxr findings he was started on tobramycin and was already on vanc for a presumed line infection (positive blood cultures).
He will need to have his tobramycin and vancomycin dosed at HD.
Please give 80 mg of IV tobramycin after HD and check level prior to HD.
IV vancomycin should also be dosed after HD with levels drawn prior to HD.
Results of the BAL should be followed up and if pt has clinically improved the antibiotics should be discontinued.
Heme/onc was consulted and performed a bone marrow biopsy.
# DM2:  Pt was covered with a sliding scale for his Type II Diabetes.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Pt was continued on his simvastation.
# FEN:  Pt received tube feeds via G-tube at goal.

While you were in the hospital, an EGD showed a clot around your PEG tube site, which likely contributed to your bleeding.
For a brief time, you needed medications to help support your blood pressure.
In addition you were started on tobramycin for acetinobacter and stentrophomonas in your sputum when your oxygen requirement increased.
Please continue to take your medications as directed.
If you have more bleeding from the rectum, vomiting of blood, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care provider or go to the Emergency Department.
