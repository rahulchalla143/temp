[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *6.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Pericardium - Effusion Size: 1.0 cm INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis.
The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Aortic regurgitation is also appreciated on cine sequences (sequence 7, image #29).
The dissection extends into the left subclavian artery as well.
The findings were subsequently discussed with cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], prior to surgical intervention.
Ascendnig aortic dissection originating at the dilated (6 cm) aortic root, extending to proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta, consistent with [**Location (un) 11916**] type A aortic dissection.
Involvement of all great vessels, as described above.
He was admitted to MICU, a subsequent CT scan showed aortic dissection and he was brought emergently for replacement of ascending aorta and resuspension of aortic valve on [**2-27**].
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU, see OR report for details.
Patient did well in the immediate postop period, he remained hemodynamically stable, was weaned from the ventilator and extubatedon POD1.
On POD2 he was weaned from all vasoactive IV medications and on POD3 was transferred to the floor for continued care.
