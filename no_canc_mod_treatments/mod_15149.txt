HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease recently admitted status post fall with surgical resection of damaged lung parenchyma, multiple compound rib fractures.
She was found to have a gangrenous right colon status post colectomy with end ileostomy, second look on [**10-23**] small bowel resection and end ileostomy preceded by third look, found to have small bowel perforations times two.
She was placed on a tracheostomy on [**11-9**] and was noted to have positive Klebsiella sputum Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas at that time; she was discharged on [**11-21**] to rehabilitation on TPN via PICC line.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be hypotensive at 80/47, was given Solu-Medrol 125 intravenously times one, started on Linezolid, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime with aggressive intravenous volume resuscitation.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent in [**2162**].
Post care complications with gangrenous colon resection, small bowel perforation status post multiple bowel resections.
Lopressor 12.5 p.o.
Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o.
Octreotide 0.1 mg subcutaneously twice a day.
Ativan 1 mg p.r.n.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female with coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post lengthy surgical admission requiring multiple bowel resections, who presented from a rehabilitation facility on TPN via PICC.
The patient was admitted for a sepsis protocol.
Started on Dopamine a.d., weaned off [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] of greater than 70; started on Vancomycin to cover Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus possible line infection.
The PICC line was discontinued and culture of tip grown again positive for fungemia and bacteremia.
In light of high grade sepsis, the patient was continued on Linezolid initially and transitioned to Vancomycin to cover enterococcus species.
She was initially started on a dose of amphotericin transitioned to intravenous fluconazole.
The patient was weaned off pressors on hospital day one and stabilized.
Empiric antibiotic coverage was discontinued at that time.
The patient was weaned off pressors and successfully volume resuscitated and given one unit of packed red blood cells as well as normal saline boluses to maintain MAP.
A PICC line was placed on [**2168-1-12**] via Interventional Radiology.
Given lack of anaphylactic reaction or hives, a trial of Ampicillin was performed with 250 mg intravenously times once.
Transition from Vancomycin to Ampicillin 2 grams three times a day was made.
The patient to continue on Intravenous Ampicillin times two weeks and transition to amoxicillin for an additional two more weeks at rehabilitation facility.
Will continue on fluconazole for remaining four week course as well to be terminated at same time as amoxicillin.
Note:  In rehabilitation facility, PICC line may be removed once completion of Ampicillin therapy.
Cardiac:  The patient has a history of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent.
Continued on a beta blocker titrated up, metoprolol and an addition, Lisinopril once blood pressure stabilized was made.
The patient would benefit from outpatient stress test once intravenous antibiotics are complete.
Gastrointestinal:  Status post multiple bowel surgeries.
The decision to place a G-tube was made on hospital day seven.
G-tube was placed by General Surgery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and began continued tube feeds with goal of cycle tube feeds at night to meet 100% of nutritional requirements.
The patient remained on nebulizers and aggressive pulmonary toilet, appropriately diuresing once hypotension resolved and mobilization of extra vascular fluid was achieved.
At time of discharge, the patient was saturating 97% on two liters nasal cannula with a goal of weaning per O2 saturations greater than 92%.
The patient to continue on nebulizers and appropriate respiratory Physical Therapy, incentive spirometry, at outpatient rehabilitation.
Blood sugar is consistently in the 100s, not requiring regular insulin sliding scale coverage.
Insulin sliding scale was continued during hospital course in concern for insulin resistance secondary to hypercortisol state during sepsis, currently resolved.
Ampicillin two grams intravenously q. eight hours times two weeks.
At completion of #1, amoxicillin 875 mg p.o.
Fluconazole 400 mg p.o.
Captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
Albuterol nebulizers, one nebulizer inhaler q. two p.r.n.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
Fentanyl patch 50 micrograms an hour transdermal q.
Albuterol Ipratropium one to two puffs inhaler q. four hours.
Tylenol 650 mg q. four to six p.r.n.
Zofran 2 mg intravenously q. six p.r.n.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q. hour until ambulating.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Octreotide acetate 100 micrograms subcutaneously twice a day.
Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o.
The patient is to continue with rehabilitation and Physical Therapy as well as Respiratory Therapy with goal to wean O2 to oximetry saturation of greater than 92%.
Will continue course of intravenous antibiotics times two weeks; at that point, PICC line will be discontinued and transitioned to oral for a total of one month of therapy.
Per recommendations of Rehabilitation facility, the patient will be returning to primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 108**] for remainder of care and rehabilitation.
As caloric goals are met via G-tube, if patient is able to tolerate increased p.o., discontinuation of G-tube can be made at that time.
