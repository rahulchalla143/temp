Balloon angioplasty of brachiocephalic fistula stricture, [**2139-1-20**] 3.
PEG tube placement 4.
HD Tunnel catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is an 87-year-old female with a past medical history significant for end-stage renal disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anemia, who lives at a nursing home and was noted to have decreasing urine output and increasing BUN/creatinine.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 4, status post AV fistula placement complicated by stenosis status post by angioplasty with only residual stenosis.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, ileostomy bag intact.
[**1-20**]: AVFistula angioplasty IMPRESSION: 1.
Contained rupture of the fistula during angioplasty, which was treated by balloon tamponade with resolution .

Her hospitalization was complicated by AV fistula laceration and hematoma, status post repair with subsequent stenosis of her fistula, and repair of the stenosis complicated by laceration.
Initially, all sedating medications and psychiatric medications were held, including her Risperdal, Prozac, and fluoxetine.
These were subsequently restarted during her hospitalization.
Morphine was held for concern of contributing to her altered mental status.
Following her PEA arrest, she did not regain consciousness and the family ultimately withdrew care.
Fluid shifts during hemodialysis were felt to be a contributor, though it should be noted that her fluid balance was maintained neutral during that session.
She did have short requirement for vasopressors for several hours following the episode, however, was quickly weaned off.
Initiation of hemodialysis was performed via her AV fistula.
However, this was complicated by laceration of her fistula requiring repair by transplant surgery in the operating room.
This repair was again complicated by laceration, but was stabilized with balloon tamponade.
She subsequently underwent placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter and started hemodialysis via this catheter on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.
She underwent several sessions of hemodialysis uneventfully, prior to her PEA arrest at dialysis on [**2139-1-26**].
The patient developed a fever and was found to have developed a nosocomial aspiration pneumonia that was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for a period of ten days.
and had tube feeds delivered via a nasogastric tube.
However, the patient self-discontinued her nasogastric tube twice and was unable to take medications p.o.
A PEG tube was placed and tube feeds delivered via her PEG.
She was loaded with amiodarone for rhythm control with reversion to sinus rhythm.
Use of nodal agents including calcium channel blockers and beta blockade were limiting given her hypotension.
Anticoagulation was not initiated in the setting of her recent hematoma from her AV fistula.
Her tunneled hemodialysis catheter was left in place, as these positive blood cultures were not felt to represent bacteremia.
Her baseline hematocrit was noted to be between 29 and 30.
She was continued on iron supplementation and erythropoietin given at dialysis.
She required multiple blood transfusions in the setting of her AV fistula bleed, as described above.
She had a right brachial AV fistula, right subclavian hemodialysis line placed on [**2139-1-8**], and peripherally inserted central catheter line, and PEG tube.
A PEG tube was subsequently placed on [**2139-1-23**] and tube feeds administered via this PEG.
