Admission Date:  [**2162-2-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-2-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-1-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Direct admission for jejunostomy feeding tube.
In the past, she has undergone esophagectomy with a colonic interposition and treatment of an apparent esophageal stricture.
In addition, she has undergone several gastric surgeries and multiple lysis of adhesions for small bowel obstruction.
A celiac alcohol ablation was performed instead for pain control.
Since the surgery in [**2161-9-22**], she has complained of worsening abdominal pain and inability to tolerate p.o.
TPN has been attempted in the past; however, due to extensive SVC, and internal jugular thrombi, a PICC line could not be maintained and this was not a current option.
She was recently switched from methadone to Oxycodone and slowly titrated up her dose for chronic pain control.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 68-year-old with chronic abdominal pain, extensively worked up in the past, admitted electively for feeding jejunostomy tube placement secondary to failure to thrive and inability to establish access for TPN.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the ACOVE Medicine Service for elective jejunostomy feeding tube to be placed by Interventional Radiology.
An NG tube was placed at the bedside on the evening of admission and she went to Interventional Radiology the following morning for fluoroscopic guided J tube placement.
However, due to her unusual anatomy with status post esophagectomy, her stomach was above the costochondral margin and was unable to be insufflated with either NG tube or Dobbhoff feeding tube.
Therefore, the procedure was aborted as Interventional Radiology would not be able to safely place the feeding tube.
General Surgery was then contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of placement of jejunostomy in the OR.
She went to surgery on [**2162-2-23**] for open jejunostomy feeding tube and lysis of adhesions.
A #12 French feeding tube was inserted into what appeared to be the jejunum lumen.
Although adhesions were lysed while in the Operating Room there did not appear to be a significant number of small bowel adhesions at this time.
Tube feeds were started at low rate after surgery; however, the patient developed significant nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and tube feeds were subsequently held.
An NG tube was again placed under fluoroscopy the evening of [**2162-3-1**] and a repeat CT of the abdomen with contrast through the NG tube was performed the following morning.
Therefore, the Surgical Team did not feel that there was significant obstruction at that point and tube feeds were restarted.
She was not taken to the OR as it was not felt that the jejunostomy tube was causing an obstruction.
The nasogastric tube, however, was left in place and placed on low-intermittent suction and the patient's nausea and vomiting resolved.
The NG tube was clamped on postoperative day number ten and as the patient did not develop any emesis for 24 hours, the NG tube was discontinued the following morning.
Unfortunately, significant nausea and vomiting developed after the tube was removed and, therefore, it was replaced at bedside by the surgical attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], on [**2162-3-9**].
It has been on low continuous suction since with trials of clamping the tube being unsuccessful.
Therefore, on [**2162-3-9**], postoperative day number 14, the jejunal feeding tube was changed over a wire by Interventional Radiology and replaced with a 8.5 French pediatric feeding tube.
The tube extended 37 cm into the small bowel which was at the site of previous jejunostomy feeding tube placed by General Surgery.
It was felt by the Surgical Team that if any mechanical obstruction had been occurring from the feeding jejunostomy tube that this would be lessened by placing a smaller caliber feeding tube.
At the time of this dictation, it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be; however, possible outcomes include:  Removing the J tube entirely and maintaining the patient on TPN, returning to the OR for repeat feeding tube placement, repeat attempt at pancreatectomy or gradual resolution of nausea and vomiting and no further intervention will be needed.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  As stated above, Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] was admitted for failure to thrive secondary to poor p.o.
Tube feeds were initiated as described above intermittently throughout the first half of her hospitalization.
As her tube feeds were inconsistent and were not providing adequate nutrition, TPN was initiated on [**2162-3-6**], postoperative day number 15.
Her nausea and vomiting was difficult to control with antiemetics, however, Ativan and high-dose Zofran appeared to be most effective.
She is on Lovenox as an outpatient for possible hypercoagulable state which is being followed by a community hematologist.
On [**2162-3-4**], she went for repeat interventional radiology procedure for line placement.
The procedure took approximately six hours and there were no difficulties encountered afterwards.
Her 80 mg q.d.
Lovenox was switched to 40 mg b.i.d.
IV heparin was not able to be used due to inability to monitor PTT as peripheral blood could not be drawn.
Coumadin was not able to be administered as she has variable absorption due to chronic nausea and vomiting.
At which time, empiric coverage with Levaquin and Flagyl were initiated.
Coverage was discontinued after five days as she had been afebrile with a normalized white count.
As there were no signs of infection, antibiotics were not restarted and she continued to be afebrile.
PAIN CONTROL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] is on a well-established regimen of pain control as an outpatient with the addition of alcohol ablation to celiac plexus performed in [**2161-9-22**].
For her acute pain after surgery, she was transiently on a Dilaudid PCA and was transitioned to p.o.
PSYCHIATRY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] has a history of anxiety and depression and was continued on her outpatient regimen of Buspar, Elavil, Zoloft, and Klonopin.
At this current time, her following diagnosis and medications are listed below.
