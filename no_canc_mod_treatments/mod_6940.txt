Upon discharge from the hospital after her catheterization, she was started on Imdur 30 mg po q d.  Arrangements were made for the patient to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
After his assessment of the patient's condition and history, it was decided that she should undergo a coronary artery bypass graft.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Imdur 30 mg po q d, Altace 10 mg po q d, Atenolol 25 mg po q d, EC ASA 81 mg po q d, as well as Xalatan and Cosopt eyedrops.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**8-3**] the patient was admitted and underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft times three.
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending; aortic saphenous vein graft to the major obtuse marginal graft and aorta saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and in stable condition.
She was hemodynamically stable and Lopressor was started.
Her chest tube was not removed.
On postoperative day #2 the patient was extubated without incident, and her chest tube was subsequently removed.
She was noted to have a labile blood pressure, so an Nitroglycerin drip was started.
She was making an adequate amount of urine and was started on Lasix and Lopressor.
On postoperative day #3 the patient went into an atrial fibrillation and was started on an Amiodarone drip.
She also was started on a Clonidine patch, and had her Lopressor held secondary to bradycardia.
She received a 500 cc bolus of normal saline and a 20 mg dose of IV Lasix with good effect.
By postoperative day #5 the patient was only ambulating at an activity level of 2, so she was subsequently screened for rehab placement upon discharge from the hospital.
Her Foley was discontinued.
Notably she had an acute decrease in her sodium level from 134 to 128 overnight, despite the absence of any changes in her medication and/or diet.
All of her electrolyte deficiencies were repleted and the patient was placed on a 300 cc free water fluid restriction as well as sodium chloride salt tablets.
On postoperative day #6 she was noted to have a scant amount of serosanguineous fluid drainage from the superior aspect of her right graft incision without purulent discharge or significant erythema.
The incision on her right lower extremity continued to drain scant amounts of serosanguineous fluid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 50 mg po bid, Amiodarone 400 mg po bid times four days, then 400 mg po q d, Hydralazine 50 mg po qid, Lasix 20 mg po q d times one week and potassium chloride 20 mEq q d times one week.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times three.
