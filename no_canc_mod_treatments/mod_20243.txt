Admission Date:  [**2178-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-4-29**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an unfortunate 80-year-old female with a prior medical history of hypertension, osteoporosis, prior left carotid stenosis, and had subsequent left carotid endarterectomy as well as history of polymyalgia rheumatica, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident as an unrestrained driver with possible loss of consciousness.
Subsequent to this, the patient was stabilized and received her protocol imaging.
She was admitted to the Trauma Critical Care Unit for further resuscitation.
Her right upper extremity and left upper extremity were somewhat limited by pain, however.
Her abdomen became progressively more distended and had hemodynamic instability requiring high dose of dopamine and Levophed.
She only had 100 cc estimated blood loss during this procedure.
Received 1200 cc of intravenous fluids and urine output was 700 cc for the case.
Over the ensuing days, the patient progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome as defined by her PAO2:FIO2 ratio being less than 200 with bilateral infiltrates particularly worse on the left side, where she had a confirmed contusion and left hemothorax.
There was no obvious persistent pneumothorax, however, as her daily chest x-ray evaluation confirmed this with a left chest tube being repositioned.
She was given maximal lung protective ventilation strategy including paralysis, low tidal ventilation, and permissive hypercapnia and permission hypoxia.
Her tube feed regimen was serially increased.
She had a pulmonary artery catheter that had been placed during her postoperative course for guidance of her fluid and electrolyte therapy.
We were able to dial back her intravenous fluids, titrate up her tube feedings to a goal.
Ultimately, her ARDS seemed to improve and she was actually switched from an assist control setting into a pressure support ventilatory mode.
Her pain control was a [**Last Name **] problem.
She did receive a left-sided rib block several times during her ICU course to enhance her pain control and to give her an opportunity to participate in her pulmonary rehab and vent wean.
We utilized a variety of agents including NSAID therapy with Vioxx as well as Roxicet elixir to control her pain.
She ultimately necessitated placement of an open tracheostomy tube, which was performed on [**2178-4-27**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The plan was to place a discharge summary addendum with the results of this were back if she were able to pass her speech and swallow evaluation, she will be titrated on an oral regimen and serially advanced accordingly with tube feeds being cycled at night and dialed back as needed as she took adequate p.o.
However, if she failed her speech and swallow evaluation, she will likely need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding access and then a repeat speech and swallow evaluation as an outpatient can be performed in a couple of weeks when her aspiration risk was reduced, and that her mental status has improved.
However, this was florid and did not necessitate antipsychotic regimen or one-to-one sitter or any restraining mechanism.
Pulmonary wise:  The patient was on pressure support ventilation approximately anywhere from 18 to 20 mmHg being utilized.
She will continue prolong ventilatory wean.
She had multiple left sided rib fractures, left scapular fracture, and right distal clavicular fracture, and her analgesic regimen will be key to control so that she can participate in her ventilatory wean and have adequate strength and analgesia to pull an adequate tidal volume to allow appropriate weaning as needed.
She will receive standard trach care as needed.
She had a #6 Shiley trach tube placed at the time of surgery on [**2178-4-27**].
Cardiovascular wise:  The patient was stable on a beta-blocker 25 mg p.o.
Her baseline cardiac medications included a beta-blocker and aspirin.
Aspirin can be added back as needed on an outpatient basis in the vent rehab facility.
If she were to fail this evaluation, she will get a PEG tube placed, and continued on Impact with fiber full strength at 60 cc per hour.
Ultimately, she can be reassessed for possible swallowing function in the rehab setting so that she can ultimately hopefully be weaned off a tube feeding regimen.
She was not receiving any additional motility agents such as Reglan at the time of this dismissal note.
For Endocrine:  She should be on a sliding scale regimen.
She should be placed on a NPH regimen and tighten her sliding scales for normoglycemia with goal blood sugars of 120-140 can be achieved.
The patient almost certainly has some component of insulin resistance or perhaps undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
GU/renal:  She had a Foley catheter for urine output monitoring.
She was making approximately 1-1.5 liters of urine per day.
Ultimately on dismissal, she likely will not have her radial arterial line unless deemed appropriate by the ventilatory rehab facility.
Additionally, she was receiving feedings through a nasogastric tube pending the speech and swallow evaluation.
She may not end up with a PEG tube, thereby removing that nasogastric tube accordingly.
Prophylaxis:  She should continue on Prevacid 30 mg/NG q.d.
She can be on Lovenox 30 mg subq b.i.d.
for DVT prophylaxis, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Dulcolax suppository 10 mg p.o./p.r.
If she is still vent dependent, then she will stay at the [**Hospital 5442**] Rehab until which time, she has been weaned from the ventilator and then she may follow up on a prn basis to the Trauma Clinic.
TREATMENTS AND FREQUENCIES:  She will continue on aggressive enteral feeding regimen her speech and swallow evaluation will proceed.
If her swallowing is poor, then she will receive a PEG tube for enteral access and feeding, and this can be reassessed as an outpatient in the ventilatory rehab setting to see if she can ultimately be started on an oral regimen.
She was not requiring any motility agents at this time to assist her with her tube feeding tolerance.
She will need aggressive Physical Therapy.
Additionally, she should continue aggressive Physical Therapy, be out of bed, get a chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry, and trach care as standard fashion.
Status post exploratory laparotomy.
Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
