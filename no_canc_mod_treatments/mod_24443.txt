steroid inhaler at baseline.
He claims compliance with steroid inhaler despite its abcense on his [**Hospital1 **] medication list.
Last exacerbation 3 months ago requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital **].

He was in "moderate" withdrawal on admisison to [**Hospital1 **], and started on Ativan and methadone detox protocols.
It appears that he was not reliably using his asthma maintenance medications.
Patient was started on Tamiflu + Levofloxacin received 3 days of Levofloxacin, but this was discontinued at the time of transfer out of the ICU.
He also was treated with steroids which were gradually tapered, Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **], and nebs.
He was discharged on Prednisone 10 mg po q day, which he will receive for several more days.

History of withdrawal but not seizures.
He was treated with clonidine and valium on a CIWA scale.
Pt was covered with Vancomycin IV while awaiting results of surveillance blood cultures and cardiac echo.
Pt was treated as follows:  - Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] - Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO/NG TID - BuPROPion (Sustained Release) 150 mg PO BID - Quetiapine extended-release 200 mg PO HS - traZODONE 50 mg PO/NG HS:PRN insomnia Pt was covered with a CIWA scale during the admission for his history of alcohol and benzo abuse, however, I strongly suspect that his CIWA actually reflected pt's anxiety and NOT active withdrawl at the time of discharge.
