Of note, pt recently started HD, and earlier in summer pt had been noted to have right renal mass on CT and tried multiple times to undergo an MRI but was unable to tolerate it.
Marked atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta; a suprarenal aortic	 aneurysm measuring 4.3 cm in diameter is noted.
HD 2 and 3, pt required 3 units total of prbcs for continued drop in Hct although pt with subjective improvement of symptoms; pt recieved hemodialysis on HD 3 but RIJ tunnel cath is poorly functioning.
IR evaluated pt for possible intervention but decided to observe unless brisk (ie Hct drop >5) active bleed or hemodynamically stable.
The patient repeatedly became confused after taking ambien/benzos so these medications were discontinued.
Urology's final recomendation was to f/u as outpt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] in clinic to discuss elective partial nephrectomy vs total nephrectomy 6 weeks after bleeding stops.
Interventional radiology was reconsulted in light of the continuing bleed, and offered the option of a total embolization of the right renal artery to stop the bleeding, but the patient decided to take a watchful waiting approach for now.
M He was continued on metoprolol for rate control and was not anticoagulated given the risk of worsening the bleeding.
HTN: He was periodically hypertensive during hospitalization but was managed with metoporolol and captopril, then changed to enalapril for QD dosing at discharge.
He was continued on dialysis medications and supplements.
PPX: The patient was maintained on a PPI, pneumoboots were used to prevent DVT, and colace and senna were used to prevent constipation.
