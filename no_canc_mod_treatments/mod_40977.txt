[**2141-5-3**] CXR: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in overall severity, accompanied by persistent small left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and borderline cardiomegaly.
ET tube in standard placement.
While in the ICU, he was diuresed with IV Lasix, switched to oral Lasix with good results.
He was also continued empirically on Vancomycin and CTX for coverage of CAP.
Sputum gram stain returned positive for GN diplococci, and culture eventually grew Moraxella catarrhalis.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2141-5-5**].
He was briefly started on heparin, which was discontinued in the setting of a hematocrit drop and probable demand ischemia rather than ACS.
He was deemed a poor catheterization candidate given his stage IV CKD, and medical management was advised.
He was continued on ASA and statin.
Toprol was changed to Metoprolol (not renally cleared), which was titrated up.
He was started on Captopril while in the ICU, subsequently discontinued in the setting of an acute rise in his creatinine.
Hydralazine and Isordil were subsequently started (lower dose than before admission).
He was placed back on Lasix 40 mg daily.
Please note that while in the hospital, his oral Lasix was transiently held in the setting of hyponatremia, which improved after holding Lasix for 48 hours.
He needs to remain on Lasix from a cardiac standpoint.
He was also discharged oh Hydralazine 25 mg PO QID and Imdur 30 mg daily for afterload reduction (acute rise in creatinine with Captopril).
GI bleed: While in the hospital, he was noted to have guaiac positive stools, associated with a hematocrit drop to 24 on [**2141-5-2**] (albeit also in the setting of a short course of IV heparin).
He was placed on PRotonix 40 mg twice daily (initially IV then PO), and Carafate PO QID.
CRI: Patient with known CKD with fluctuating creatinine at baseline, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] as an out-patient.
He had no indication for acute hemodialysis, although it is likely that he will need long-term hemodialysis in the near future.
His Lasix was held for 48 hours, with eventual improvement in his sodium to 131.
He was also placed on fluid restriction 1000 mL.
He will need close out-patient follow-up of his sodium and creatinine.
Lasix was restarted at the time of discharge (40 mg daily).
