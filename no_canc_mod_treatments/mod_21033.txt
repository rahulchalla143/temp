During her stay at [**Hospital1 46**], the patient was started on Levaquin, IV steroids, and theophylline.
The patient was initially given Cardizem in addition to digoxin and then changed to Amiodarone load on [**2163-5-16**].
Levaquin 500 mg IV q.d., started on [**2163-5-11**].
Protonix 40 IV q.d.
Synthroid 100 micrograms q.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg IV q.d.
Solu-Medrol 40 mg q. eight hours.

Pertinent laboratories included a white count in the 20,000 range which progressed to a bandemia of 12% bands.
LDL 72, HDL 66, triglycerides 119, iron studies within normal limits with the exception of ferritin at 193.
She was extubated on rounds on [**2163-5-19**], the day after admission, after she tolerated pressure support 5 and 5 well.
Shortly after which, she developed hypertension and difficulty breathing so she was passed on BIPAP, given nitroglycerin and 20 mg of IV Lasix which resolved.
She eventually was maintained on 02 by nasal cannula and did well.
Her IV Solu-Medrol was continued for several days as she was quite wheezy on examination.
Additionally, she completed a seven day course of levofloxacin  at the outside hospital for pneumonia/bronchitis.
She was not started on a beta blocker given her severe COPD.
Cardiology was consulted and there was no need for inpatient catheterization at this time.
They suggested discontinuing Amiodarone and digoxin and it is unclear what her rhythm actually was.
She may need an elective EP study as an outpatient for consideration for pacemaker placement.
She was started on Diltiazem and this was titrated up for her atrial tachycardia.
PUMP:  Her digoxin was discontinued and she had a normal EF on the transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital.
HYPERTENSION:  Her ACE inhibitor and digoxin were titrated up given her blood pressure.
Her Foley was changed out and a repeat U/A and urine culture was sent.
On the day of transfer to the floor, a repeat U/A showed some white blood cells and some white blood cell clumps and thus she was started on levofloxacin.
She was afebrile; however, this is in the setting of IV Solu-Medrol.
An Infectious Disease workup ensued as the patient was afebrile; however, this was in the setting of IV steroids.
Thus, she underwent a head CT which revealed evidence of sinusitis and thus she was treated with Bactrim and Augmentin.
HYPOTHYROIDISM:  She was continued on her Synthroid.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  She tolerated a p.o.
with regular insulin sliding scale while on steroids, a proton pump inhibitor, subcutaneous heparin, and pneumatic compression boots.
