Neurology felt that this bleed was likely due to Amyloid angiopathy and recommended weaning of the Keppra and restarting Asprin as soon as possible.
Repeat evlauation by Speech Therapy revealed that the patient is at high risk for aspiration.
He has had several dobhoff tubes placed that he pulled out as his mental status is not yet cleared.
Ultimately a PEG tube was placed.
He has required haldol during this hospital stay.
It seems that he is awake and agitated at night and then requires haldol administration.
