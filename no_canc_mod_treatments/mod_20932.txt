CT of the chest showed acute rib fracture including the right third, fourth and fifth with hematoma.
Patient also had bilateral knee films which did not show any signs of fracture.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for the presence of the peri-aortic hematoma.
The patient was transferred back to the trauma ICU where the patient underwent intubation for presumed respiratory failure.
The patient was started on antibiotics.
The patient was treated for the pneumonia and was slowly weaned from the vent settings; however, the patient did not tolerate being off of the ventilator support.
Thus, the patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
After the patient was intubated, the patient also was noted to have a significant amount of effusion on the left chest and the chest tube on the left side was placed to remove the effusion.
The chest tube was subsequently discontinued when there was a minimal amount of fluid coming from the chest tube.
The patient, of note, also was in atrial fibrillation during this time which was controlled with both Lopressor and Amiodarone.
After the patient was trached and PEG'd, the patient was doing well with Neurontin and Roxicet and Tylenol for pain management.
The patient was on Amiodarone and Lopressor.
The patient tolerated periods of trache mask but continues to require some ventilatory support.
Gastrointestinal: The patient was on tube feeds.
The patient was off of antibiotics and finished his course of antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia.
The patient was recommended to transfer to the ventilator rehab for further care.
