Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery immediately distal to the supraclinoid internal carotid artery bifurcation.
Recommended followup imaging to exclude hemorrhage.
OG tube extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
COPD, cardiomegaly, ?pulmonary hypertension, and mild upper zone redistribution.
Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct with blood products indicating hemorrhage in the basal ganglia region.
Probable subarachnoid hemorrhage along the midbrain and right ambient cistern which can be further evaluated with a followup CT as the immediate post contrast CT demonstrated vascular enhancement due to presence of contrast and was limited for evaluation of subarachnoid blood.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2135-6-23**] 6:13 PM NG tube tip is in the stomach.
The tip of an enteric tube projects over the middle midline abdomen.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2135-6-26**] 12:00 N IMPRESSION:  AP supine and right decubitus abdomen shows persistence of a large pneumoperitoneum, but because of differences in patient positioning, I cannot tell if there has been a much of a change since [**6-24**].
She was administered IV tPA as she was within the time window and had no contraindications.
At neuro-intervention, they catheterized the right ICA with Merci catheter was placed and they catheterized the right MCA with the use of a Solitaire stent retriever and following balloon angioplasty of a high grade stenosis of the right MCA, there was TIMI 2 flow at the end of the procedure and she was transferred to the Neuro ICU post-procedure.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and A1c 5.4% and FLP revealed Chol 159 TGCs 66 HDL	84 LDL 62.
She was therefore started on atorvastatin 10mg qd.
Given her ischemic stroke, Aspirin was started and due to her large infarct, anticoagulation was deferred.
This was complicated by excessive abdominal insufflation during the procedure with a tense abdomen, and thus had a protracted intubation in the PACU.
Following her PEG, she was started on warfarin, and aspirin and s/c heparin are to continue until her INR is therapeutic.
She continued to have a considerable pneumoperitoneum on repeat imaging although abdomen was soft and patient was uncomfortable, hence tube feeds were held for bowel rest and were restarted on [**2135-6-27**].
To allow autoregulation, she was started on [**2-7**] home dose of her home furosemide and this was eventually changed to po and other anti-hypertensives were held.
She was initially only started on aspirin and latterly anticoagulated with warfarin and to continue aspirin and s/c heparin  until INR is therapeutic.
# Nutrition/GIS: She was kept NPO given aspiration risk and she initially had an NG tube.
This was complicated by excessive abdominal insufflation during the procedure with imaging showing a very large pneumoperitoneum.
She initially had a tense abdomen and given her large pneumoperitoneum, she was kept intubated overnight in the PACU.
However, in the next days after her operation, she still had a considerable pneumoperitoneum on repeat imaging and although abdomen was soft, patient was uncomfortable and the decision was to hold tube feeds for bowel rest.
Tube feeds were restarted on [**2135-6-27**] and she tolerated this well.
The last day of treatment is [**2135-6-27**].
# Ophthalmology: She was started on her usual glaucoma eye drops.
On transfer to the floor she was noted to bradycardic to 40s and timolol eye drops were initially stopped.
Bradycardia settled and timolol was restarted at half concentration.
Transitional issues [ ] Patient will require daily INR monitoring and to stop aspirin and s/c heparin when INR therapeutic [ ] Next INR to be drawn on [**2135-6-28**] [ ] Patient had bradycardia to 40s (no HD compromise) and resolved after stopping timolol eye drops.
Reintroduced timolol eye drops at half dose.
[ ] Patient had PEG tube inserted [**6-23**] and had excessive insufflation of abdomen requiring protracted intubation and tube feeds restarted [**6-25**] then held for bowel rest given patient discomfort and continued pneumoperitoneum.
Please uptitrate her tube feeds as tolerated.
[ ] Please monitor her serum potassium and restart Klor-Con or potassium supplements if needed.

To try and treat your stroke, you were given clot-busting medication and went to neuro-intervention to open up the blood vessel.
You were seen by the speech and swallow specialists and you needed a feeding tube through the nose.
As you had persistent swallowing difficulties you had a feeding tube inserted into the stomach called a PEG tube.
This may be only temporary if your swallow improves such that you can be started on an oral diet.
We initially treated you with aspirin for your stroke however when you had your PEG tube inserted, we started you on a blood thinner called warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke given your atrial fibrillation.
Warfarin requires frequent monitoring initially and can cause increased bleeding and hence if you cut yourself you will be more prone to bleeding.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and were started on an antibiotic for this.
Medication changes: We STARTED warfarin 5mg daily We STARTED aspirin 325mg daily (stop when INR > or = 2) We STARTED atorvastatin 10mg daily for our cholesterol We DECREASED furosemide to 20mg twice daily We DECREASED timolol to 0.25% drops daily  Please continue your other medications as prescribed.
