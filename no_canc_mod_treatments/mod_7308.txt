Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement to L cirucmflex artery and rescue of jailed OM.
Pt given lasix and transferred to CCU.
s/p venous stripping 4 Pulmonary fibrosis, baseline sat 92 on RA.
P 80 BP 145/56 RR 27 O2 89 on NRB after lasix and metoprolol T 98.6 P 63 BP 126/56 R 24 O2 94 on 3.5 NC.
HEENT: NC in place.
Ext: Cool extremities, but not cyanotic.
ABG revealed severe hypoxia at the end of the case which responded to lasix and IV nitro without necessitating intubation.
Right femoral arteriotomy was successully closed with a 8F angioseal closure device.
Brief Hospital Course: This 71 year old gentleman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity presented with 5 hours of chest pain  and was found to have an ST elevated MI for with he underwent emergent cardiac catheterization with stent placment to LCx with rescue of jailed OM1.
His wedge pressure elevated during the procedure and the post cath course complicated by hypoxia (blood gas 7.36/40/56) requiring non-rebreather therapy.
He was given lasix treatment and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit.
He had subsequent improvement in oxygenation as he diuresed and was weaned off oxygen support successfully.
The patient remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable after his catheterization and his cardiac enzymes trended downward.
He was discharged with instructions to continue all antiplatelet, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive medications as prescribed in hospital and to follow up with his primary care physician and with [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology.
In summary, this is a 71 year old gentleman admitted to the CCU for inferior STEMI status post catheterization with DES to L circumflex artery.
Post cath course complicated by respiratory distress secondary to volume overload successfully treated with diuretic therapy.
Issues and plan from this hospitalization:  1) Cardiovascular, STEMI s/p cath, elevated wedge pressure a) Perfusion--STEMI (deep ST depressions in precordial leads STE in aVR) s/p cath to LCx (99% lesion) c OM1 rescue (70% residual stenosis) -ASA, plavix, -Pt started metoprolol which was changed to Toprol XL on discharge, also restarted felopidine in hospital.
2) Resp status, after cath was 89-90 on NRB, with pO2 of 63 on ABG.
After diuresis sat to 93-95 range on 2 L NC.
Pt needs to continue ASA, he was given protonix in hospital for stomach protection.
He will continue ASA and protonxi and follow up with his PCP and cardiologist should this become an issue.
6) Prophylaxis  included colace and PPI.
