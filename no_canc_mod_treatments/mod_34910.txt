Physical Exam: HR 71 RR 12  145/60 5'3 [**12-9**]" 168# NAD, obese skin unremarkable large firm left parotid mass neck supple, full ROM CTAB RRR 4/6 SEM with radiation throughout precordium to carotids abd + BS warm,well-perfused, no peripheral edema or varicosities noted MAE [**4-10**] strengths, grossly intact 1+ bil.
The calculated aortic valve area was 0.5 cm2.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is being AV paced.
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 16-22 mmHg).
Aorta appears intact post decannulation 3.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-2-27**], an aortic valve bioprosthesis is now present.
