HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, on home O2 with a baseline of 93 percent on two liters, with a history of bronchiectasis and two recent admissions for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in [**3-/2145**] and [**4-/2145**] requiring Medical Intensive Care Unit stays complicated by hypotension requiring pressors and acute renal failure, prerenal and ATN who was at home in her usual state of health until last night when she was noted to have acute shortness of breath and needed to increase her home O2 from chronic two liters to five liters.
O2 saturation was 88 percent on room air to 95 percent on 50 percent face mask.
She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin and given Lasix 20 mg intravenously.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum following hernia repair and again in [**3-/2145**] with documented pneumonia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema on chronic home oxygen 2-4 liters nasal cannula.
Symptomatic bradycardia status post VDD pacer in 11/[**2143**].

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.1 with 69 percent polycytes, 12 percent bands, 12 percent lymphocytes, three percent monocytes, hematocrit 29.9, potassium 3.1, creatinine 1.0 with a baseline of 0.8-0.9, INR 1.4, CK 92, troponin less than 0.01, lactate 1.5.
The patient received aggressive chest physical therapy and suctioning by Respiratory and subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where the patient received aggressive chest physical therapy, Mucomyst and guaifenesin with clearing of her secretions and improvement of her oxygenation from four liters to her baseline of two liters.
The patient continued to be treated on vancomycin when she was transferred to the floor after being in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a total of 2.5 days.
Her levofloxacin was discontinued at this time.
The patient had an attempted blind tap without ultrasound guidance, which was unsuccessful.
The patient should have aggressive chest physical therapy and is currently being screened for rehabilitation for possible transfer today given her recurrent mucous plugging as the source of her hypoxia.
The patient was initially given vancomycin and levofloxacin, but sputum was growing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, so levofloxacin was discontinued.
Question of long- term antibiotics was brought up by the primary pulmonologist, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2146**], M.D., who is likely leaving.
She was given a one time dose of Lasix with improvement of her hypoxia.
Her home regimen of Lasix was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg p.o.
Anemia:  The patient had no evidence of guaiac positive stools, but her hematocrit initially was down to 25.2, likely due to blood draws while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
She received a unit of packed red blood cells followed by 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with significant improvement and stable hematocrit.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was on a low sodium diet given her history of congestive heart failure.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on Protonix and subcutaneous heparin.
