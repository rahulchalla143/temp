She was felt to be intravascularly dry, so she was given IV fluids.
She had a thorough workup for causes of her diarrhea (infectious, structural, medication related etc.)
During the admission, an echocardiogram was performed, demonstrating worsening systolic function (EF 15-20%), but she was felt to be intravascularly dry, so her Lasix was held.
Given the patient's concern that her diarrhea started at the same time as metoprolol (75mg daily), this medication was also stopped (and switched to carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Her Imuran was initially held during the last hospitalization but was restarted after a conversation with her [**Hospital1 112**] rheumatologist.
She was given 4mg IV ondansteron x 2, in addition to ceftriaxone and azithromycin given an equivocal chest x-ray.
On review of systems, she reports nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above.
She denies fevers, chills, chest pain (but perhaps some chest "heaviness"), palpitations, pleuritic chest pain, cough, weakness, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain, constipation, hematemesis, hematochezia, urinary symptoms.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune complexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy was thought to be more likely.
She was treated with steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved from an EF of 15 to 33%.
She did require temporary CCU transfer for milrinone given worsening EF, however was weaned after a few days and transferred back to the floor in stable condition.
Her mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her poor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine, lisinopril and amlodipine.
Reported 3 pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, in the setting of recent d/c Lasix and IVF resuscitation, LE edema also suggested fluid overload.
Her sxs improved with diuresis and symptomatic management and she was discharged on oral torsemide.
She was also treated with BP control and bblocker therapy.
Initially contined on Plaquenil and Imuran, as well as prednisone.
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended aggressive therapy with steriods, cytoxan and plasmapheresis.
Received solumedrol 1g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 30mg IV q12hrs, which was uptitrated to 60 q 12 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was ultimately discharged on prednisone 60mg orally daily.
She was also placed on atovaquone PCP prophylaxis in the setting of immunosuppression.
Prior to cytoxan, she received 7.5mg Lupron for ovarian protection with plans to pursue egg harvesting for fertility as an outpatient.
Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held due to her continued improvement.
She improved with symptomatic tx and treatment of her HH.
Platelet drop was too quick to be related to Cytoxan and likelihood of developping 4T score is 3.
Worsening renal failure with creatinine increased to 3.7 up from 1.4 on admission.
While her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis, diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and creatinine remained stable.
# HTN: BPs improved with uptitration of hydralazine and addition of lisinopril.
Pt concerned that hydralazine may be causing joint pain.
Given this and her improved renal function, lisinopril was uptitrated and hydralazine discontinued.
Pt was given one unit of PRBCs while in patient and started on epo with good improvement in her crit.
medication side effect (IVIG, hydralazine) vs lupus flare, however pt has never had joint pain with lupus flares in the past.
Hydralazine was discontinued, symptomatic relief with tylenol, PT.
