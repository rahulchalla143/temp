He reports leg swelling that has been stable for 2 months since starting HD in [**12/2182**] and fluctuates with dialysis.
On ED exam, had extremely faint bibasilar crackles, faint wheezing, difficulty taking a maximal inspiration due to cough, protuberant abdomen but soft NT.
Pt received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and benzonatate.
CXR showed fluid overload, so pt is admitted for HD to remove fluid.
On the floor, pt has been started on HD - 3L removed with plan for repeat HD tomorrow.
Past Medical History: - Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (EF 15% [**11/2182**] at [**Hospital1 112**]) - Chronic kidney disease of unknown recent level - Hypertension - Hx left basal ganglia lacunar infart, [**2176**] - Hypercholesterolemia - Elevated PSA with enlarged prostate; more recently the patient chronically straight caths himself - Recurrent UTIs w/ report of sterile pyuria - Hemorrhoids - s/p Right inguinal hernia repair, [**1-/2181**]   Social History: He lives at home with his wife and daughter.
Dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis and relative preservation of basal inferior and inferolateral function (LVEF = 25 %).
Foley catheter within the urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: 71M with h/o ESRD on HD (M/W/F), chronic systolic HF (EF 15-20%) s/p MI presenting with nonproductive cough x3d.
Reasons for exacerbation considered in this pt initially included dietary indiscretion, worsening myocardial function (although enzymes and EKG unimpresive), insufficient volume removal at HD (unlikely given large-volumes recorded) and/or medication noncompliance (esp diuretic).
Chart review (see PCP notes from [**12/2182**]) reveal that at the [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) **] [**2182**], cardiomyopathy was attributed to irreversible ischemia in the mid-to-distal LAD distribution as demonstrated on Stress Echo.
Cardiology consult service recommend adjusting medications as follows: - transition from lasix to torsemide 40 mg QD - transition from metoprolol to carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **] - start spironolactone 25 QD - start metolazone 5 QD - increase lisinopril 20 QD He continued to require regular dialysis for 3L fluid removal per session, but weights, volume status, HR and BP were stable on this new medication regimen for several days prior to discharge, even through 2-day weekend HD "holiday."
# ESRD on HD On HD qMWF via RIJ HD line since [**83**]/[**2182**].
During this admission, he underwent numerous extra dialysis sessions for total >15L volume removal via HD, including 8L within the first 2 days.
Patient counseled on low-salt diet, but may need more frequent and/or higher-volume dialysis sessions in the future if volume overload continues to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
HD frequency will require intermittent reassessment.
# TRAUMATIC FOLEY REMOVAL Patient had foley catheter placed, as above.
At time of anticipated discharge on HD 10, he suffered large-volume urethral bleed after foley catheter removal (9 pt Hct drop over the subsequent 6 hours).
Seen by urology consult who recommended replacing foley for tamponade.
Ongoing hematuria for 3-4 days, until the day of discharge, when urine was yellow, clear of frank blood and clots.
Despite strong urging of medical staff to keep foley in place until scheduled urology follow-up in a few days, patient insisted upon catheter removal.
Catheter removal was atraumatic, no further urethral bleeding.
On lisinopril at home; this was increased to 20 mg QD.
Also started on carvedilol and lasix switched to torsemide for CHF management (as above).
BP baseline improved fto 110s after these medication adjustments.
GI recommended capsule endoscopy but patient refused.
Hct stabilized within 24h and remained stable for several days, until it fell 9 pts a second time in the setting of traumatic foley removal (as above).
Suspected to be [**2-27**] volume contraction in the setting of frequent large-volume ultrafiltration at HD.
