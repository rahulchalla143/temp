He stated he had several weeks of exertional and rest angina responsive to sublingual Nitroglycerin which he had been taking approximately every other day.
On the day of admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital he awoke with 10/10 chest pain which initially was relieved with two sublingual Nitroglycerin but then returned and was unresponsive to a third Nitroglycerin.
He was brought to the [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room and was treated with Morphine, Heparin and Intactly and ruled out for an myocardial infarction.

Vital signs includes a heart rate of 78, blood pressure 124/65, respirations 20 with an O2 sat of 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
His right coronary artery has known occluded proximal distal vessels from his mammary artery, his saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal was occluded.
The saphenous vein graft to the OM 1 is known to be occluded.
Given this information he was considered to be a possible candidate for coronary artery bypass graft and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was consulted.
Also an intra-aortic pump was placed.
Upon seeing the patient it was felt that he would be a candidate for surgery which was scheduled for the following morning.
On [**2142-8-21**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a reduced sternotomy that included saphenous vein graft to the OM, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior left ventricular branch.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 166 minutes with a cross clamp time of 137 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm.
Dobutamine, Levophed, Insulin and Propofol drips with two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires.
Intra-aortic balloon pump and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
Upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit it was noted that he was acidotic and this was corrected through ventilatory changes.
He was also noted to have minimal urine output and his Foley was changed and there was improvement in his urine output following.
By the first postoperative day he had improved slightly and was somewhat more hemodynamically stable therefore, his intra-aortic pump was discontinued.
Also on this date his Dobutamine was weaned to off and attempts at weaning off his Levophed drip.
By the second postoperative day he continued to require Lasix to assist with his urine output and while trying to diurese him attempts were made to begin ventilatory wean.
By postop day four, he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and received bolus of Amiodarone and was eventually started on the Amiodarone drip.
He did eventually convert to normal sinus rhythm and was continued on the Amiodarone drip while intubated.
At this point he was receiving intermittent doses of diuretic with Lasix and continued in normal sinus rhythm.
He had undergone a renal ultrasound because his creatinine had bumped to a peak of 1.9 despite the fact that he continued to make urine while on Lasix drip.
Also on this date was noted to have further episodes of A-fib and A-flutter and was started on Lopressor and started on Diltiazem drip and continued on the Amiodarone.
He continued to receive aggressive diuresis and pulmonary toilet.
On postop day nine he did have his cortise changed to a triple lumen and cortise was sent for culture.
He had been on Vancomycin up until this point and was started on Levaquin for further treatment.
On postop day two he did receive a PICC line for intravenous access and also for his antibiotic treatment.
By postop day 15 he had been stable in the Intensive Care Unit, required less pulmonary toilet and it was felt that he was ready to be transferred to the floor.
Of note, he was started back on insulin regimen and to assist with this [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3408**] consult for endocrinology was placed.
There have been multiple adjustments in his insulin regimen including NPH insulin and regular insulin sliding scale, all very much dependent on his p.o.
While he has been on the floor he has been receiving physical therapy and does ambulate some.
It is felt that now he would be stable and ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further physical therapy work before returning to his home.
His right heel has an ulcer and also there is an ulceration of his decubitus.
Lopressor 100 mg three times a day.
