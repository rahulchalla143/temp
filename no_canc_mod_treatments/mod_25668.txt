Limited evaluation of gallbladder does not demonstrate evidence of acute cholecystitis .
Transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU because surgery and ERCP services at the OSH were hesitant to intervene in this morbidly obese patient with multiple comorbidities.
His symptoms were thought to be caused by either gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or cholecystitis.
ERCP performed here showed no gallstones, sludge or obstruction to explain elevated LFTs; CBD stent was placed (will require removal by repeat endoscopy as an outpatient after discharge).
HIDA scan did show biliary obstruction and surgery recommended percutaneous cholecystostomy, however patient's exam and LFTs improved after stent placement.
Repeat u/s showed a contracted gallblader and did not show evidence of cholecystitis, therefore no further intervention was performed.
Initial ABG with elevated paCO2 and on initial presentation he was somnolent, poorly ventilating when oversedated which all improved with BiPAP, which he wore at night and during daytime naps and during periods of increased somnolence.
He required intubation for ERCP and was difficult to extubate, with high PaCO2 on ABGs.
Of note, he is on high dose opioids at home for chronic pain: 120 mg MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]D + PRN oxycodone; these pain meds were reduced  as they were thought to contribute to his somnolence and hypoxia.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient on home metoprolol 25 TID but unaware of his atrial fibrillation; unclear whether this is new.
Initially required diltiazem gtt for rate control in the ICU,  then stabilized on a PO regimen of metoprolol and diltiazem.
#Chronic pain: Patient on pain meds at home as above.
# Edema: patient has chronic venous stasis and is on lasix at home.
Initially on IV lasix boluses with good response.
# Code: Full Code  #Pending items: -Needs follow-up with ERCP for stent removal in 8 weeks (they will arrange) -INR must be monitored closely in rehab to maintain goal of [**1-15**].

There did not appear to be a blockage that could be removed, however a stent was placed to keep your gallbladder from becoming obstructed.
For this reason, you were evaluated for surgery and placement of a tube that could be used to drain your gallbladder, but after time your abdominal pain and liver enzymes improved.
You did not need further intervention.
You were given IV antibiotics and will need a total of 10 days.
You were treated with metoprolol and diltiazem for this condition, and the optimal doses of these medications were determined while you were here.
You should follow up with a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment of this condition.
You should continue your medicines with the following important changes.
Continue Warfarin 7.5 mg daily and adjust dose based on INR (goal [**1-15**]) Continue Unasyn 3 mg every 6 hours for one more day.
Decrease Oxycontin IR to 10-20 mg every 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain (from 30 mg) Decrease MS Contin to 75 mg PO every eight hours (from 120 mg every 8 hours) Decrease to Glargine 50 units QAM Increase Metoprolol Succinate 150 mg daily Start Diltiazem extended release 240 mg daily   Followup Instructions: Department: ENDO SUITES When: THURSDAY [**2133-8-20**] at 12:00 PM  Department: DIGESTIVE DISEASE CENTER When: THURSDAY [**2133-8-20**] at 12:00 PM With: [**Name6 (MD) 1948**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1949**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**] Building: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] Building ([**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] Complex) [**Location (un) 1951**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: Main Garage                                [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 617**]
