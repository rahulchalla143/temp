The ultrasound revealed no flow in the radial artery with a good collateral flow on the ulnar side; however, due to the appearance of the site, it was decided that no intervention would be attempted at that time and simply to be followed closely from a medical standpoint and skin breakdown monitoring etc.
She was seen by Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech Therapy who made recommendations largely with regard to passive range of motion, some strengthening exercises, and general mobility issues.
For this reason, diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was undertaken on [**2134-3-28**], and at this time, 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed from the pleural space.
Because of this, she was continued on her prior antibiotics with a plan being that the outside hospital would contact [**Hospital1 **] for follow-up on the pleural effusion culture results and taper their treatment accordingly.
The patient also continued to be on tube feeds which she tolerated well and had no further complications of her G-tube placement site which continued to be clean.
At the time of discharge, her INR was still subtherapeutic, and she was discharged on Heparin and Coumadin for this.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
per tube q.d., Zantac 150 mg per tube b.i.d., Senokot 10 mg per tube p.r.n., Tylenol 650 mg p.r.
q.6 hours p.r.n., Lopressor 25 mg per tube b.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 120 or heart rate less than 60, Silvadene creme to left wrist b.i.d., Colace 100 mg per tube q.d., Heparin 1450 U/hr IV, Oxacillin 2 g IV q.6 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg per tube q.d., tube feeds of Promote with fiber at 60 cc/hr with free-water flushed of 120 cc b.i.d.
She will need to have coagulation studies including PT, PTT, and INR followed every day, and Coumadin dose adjusted to a therapeutic range of [**3-14**] based on the results.
When INR is therapeutic, Heparin should be discontinued.
While the INR is coming up, the recommended range for the PTT on Heparin should be between 60 and 90, and no Heparin boluses should be given to maintain a therapeutic PTT.
The results of the thoracentesis done on [**3-28**] are still pending at this time for culture and sensitivity, and the [**Hospital3 **] Hospital should be contact[**Name (NI) **] for these results that the duration of the antibiotic treatment can be determined.
Finally, her left wrist arterial line site should be carefully monitored, and if any further skin breakdown, pain, etc.
