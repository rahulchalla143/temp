The patient was initiated intubated at [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital and he had left pneumothorax.
A chest tube was placed on the left side.
He also had left rib fracture, left humeral shaft fracture and a left subarachnoid hemorrhage and left open radioulnar fracture, and left subclavian line was placed at the outside hospital.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's vital signs were temperature 96.5, heartrate 125, blood pressure 124/60, and the patient was on a ventilator.
His left upper extremity has shoulder bruises and open forearm fractures, but he has palpable radial pulse.
The patient was taken to the computerized tomography unit to obtain computerized tomography scan of the head which showed right frontal contusion, left subdural hemorrhage and left orbital fracture and fourth rib fracture, right axillary sinus fracture, basilar skull fracture and petrous bone fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room, an emergent right chest tube was placed and central line was then placed.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and ICP monitor was placed by Neurosurgery for monitoring his intracranial pressure and the patient was given intravenous antibiotics for his open fracture and Vascular Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery were also consulted.
Orthopedic after seeing the patient decided to take the patient to the Operating Room for incision and drainage and open reduction and internal fixation of his left ulnar fracture.
The patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] to the Operating Room on [**2200-11-8**] and underwent the incision and drainage and open reduction and internal fixation of his left forearm fractures.
The patient remained intubated and was placed on SMV and the patient was initially placed on Dopamine drip and Levophed drip to maintain his blood pressure.
On postoperative day #1 the patient was put on Vancomycin, Ceptaz and Clindamycin.
Vancomycin was for his open skull fracture and Ceptaz was perioperatively for his facial fractures.
Oromaxillofacial Surgery was consulted for his facial fractures, which they saw the patient for and recommended no operative repair and recommended Clindamycin for ten days for his maxillary facial fracture.
Neurosurgery was following the patient subsequently for his intracranial ICP pressures.
On postoperative day #3 Propofol was weaned off and the patient was placed on SMV ventilation, plus pressure support and appeared to be oxygenating okay.
The patient was continued on Dilantin from Neurosurgery.
Attempts were made to try to wean the patient off of the ventilator.
On [**11-11**], the patient was taken by the orthopedic surgeon to the Operating Room and underwent a left tibial plateau fracture repair and open reduction and internal fixation of the left tibial plateau fracture.
Due to the patient's multiple lower extremity traumas and injuries and due to the patient's heparin bleed the patient is not able to receive Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and an inferior vena cava filter was then placed.
On [**11-13**], the patient underwent another head computerized tomography scan which showed no change in terms of his intracranial bleed or hemorrhage and ICP drain was then subsequently discontinued by Neurosurgery.
The patient was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon and his left shoulder, due to his multiple fractures, and he underwent a left shoulder hemiarthroplasty on [**2200-11-14**], by the orthopedic surgeon.
The patient tolerated the procedure well postoperatively and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
The patient was put on pressure support ventilation and seemed to be tolerating the pressure support ventilation.
Following the extubation, his chest tube was discontinued.
However, it was reported over the next several days the patient remained tenuous in terms of respiratory condition and he has a lot of secretions that require frequent suctioning and the patient's mental status deteriorated.
On [**2200-11-18**], the patient had finished a ten day course of Vancomycin and a ten day course of Clindamycin for neurosurgery and oromaxillofacial fractures and the patient's antibiotics were discontinued, and on [**2200-11-18**], the patient apparently spiked a fever to 101.4.
The patient has a lot of secretions, requiring frequent suctioning.
The patient's Dilantin was discontinued, as he finished a course of 13 days of Dilantin per Neurosurgery.
The patient was started on Lasix for diuresis, as he appeared to be edematous and his PT was high.
On [**11-22**], due to his recent spike, his antibiotic coverage was broadened to Zosyn, Vancomycin and Gentamicin and the patient appeared to defervesce with the new antibiotic coverage, and the patient's incision was clean, dry and intact.
The patient had a feeding tube placed by Interventional Radiology and the patient was started on broadly advanced to O2V of breast pallor at 60 cc/hr.
At the same time Neurosurgery agreed with heparin subcutaneously for the patient and the patient was placed on the heparin subcutaneously and inferior vena cava filter was removed on [**2200-11-23**] and the patient had bilateral lower extremity ultrasound which showed no deep vein thromboses, prior to the inferior vena cava filter extraction.
The patient was placed on Lovenox 30 subcutaneously b.i.d.
for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
and Captopril was added for better blood pressure control.
The neurologist saw the patient and recommended a spinal tap and computerized tomography scan with intravenous contrast to further evaluate to rule out cerebrovascular accident and rule out the meningitis, given the patient's history of open skull fracture.
They agreed that coagulase negative Staphylococcus most likely could be a contaminate of the lumbar puncture and they do not believe the patient's lumbar tap was indicative of a meningitis.
They recommended to continue 14 days of Zosyn and Vancomycin for the complete treatment of his respiratory-associated pneumonia.
His secretion at the same time was beginning to decrease.
The patient was tolerating tube feeds at 60 cc/hr.
Prior to discharge, the patient was afebrile, vital signs stable, chest clear, abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, and the patient has a feeding tube placed and was tolerating tube feed as goal, tolerating at 60 cc/hr.
The patient still required chest physical therapy and frequent pulmonary toileting and frequent suctioning, although was much improved compared to before.
Splint was noted over his left forearm and he had a knee brace over his left knee.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  .................. 60 cc/hr and Captopril 6.25 p.o.
t.i.d., Lovenox 30 subcutaneously b.i.d., Paxil, Lopressor 50 p.o.
t.i.d., Albuterol nebulizers prn, Sodium chloride tablets two tablets b.i.d.
4 hour chest physical therapy and incentive spirometer.
and the patient is to work with physical therapy for range of motion for his right shoulder and his elbow.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to be followed up with Orthopedic Surgery in one week and follow up with Trauma Service in approximately two weeks.
and see if he can use a more permanent feeding access such as a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
The patient underwent a swallow evaluation prior to discharge, however, due to the patient's inability to cooperate fully it was felt that it is far better to continue on with feeding tube for two weeks prior to arranging for a more permanent access.
to sustain himself.
