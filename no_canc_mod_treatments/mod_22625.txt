Continue octreotide gtt, PPI gtt, antibiotics.
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Please avoid NG suction - Please add on Carafate, continue PPI - Please f/u Hct closely and tranfusion as needed - Proceed with Angio to localize the bleeding source.
Had traumatic foley placement with GU bleed, now resolved.
While at [**Hospital1 8**] he was transfused 8 units of PRBC's and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] it was thought that he was likely bleeding from his varices, and initially another endoscopy was deferred given his recent banding.
He was then sent for a TIPS procedure that failed, and overnight the first night he required multiple transfusions of packed red cells, platelets and FFP to maintain hemodynamic stability.
After the procedure [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was placed, with some slowing of the bleeding.
The patient also had coagulopathy [**3-8**] to cirrhosis, requiring multiple units of platelets and FFP.
Initially received 10mg valium on arrival to unit, but was intubated for airway protection shortly after arrival to the ICU.
After intubation he did not receive any further benzo's and his sedation was held after 4 days in hopes that his mental status would improve.
With his liver disease after his bleeding had stabilized he was restarted on lactulose and rifaximin due to concern that encephalopathy could be contributing to his decreased mental status.
This was discontinued on [**7-6**], however the patient on [**7-9**] pulled out his dobhoff tube and desaturated to 88%, and was re-started on vancomycin/zosyn for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Restarted on Vanc/Zosyn overnight and bolused 750cc.
# GUB: The patient had a GU bleed [**3-8**] to traumatic Foley placement, requiring 6units pRBCs.
Pt finished an 8d course of Vanc/Zosyn for VAP; he was restarted on Abx [**7-3**] with concern for hypotension.
He was also started on Cipro for SBP PPx.
The patient was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for 8d course.
Then continued on Cipro for SBP PPx.
He was given Rifaximin and Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy with good effect.
# Altered mental status: Likely [**3-8**] to hepatic encephalopathy - without significant improvement with Lactulose and Rifaximin.

On admission, code status was reversed and patient intubated for EGD/flex sig.
Patient was started on PPI IV BID, octreotide as well as antimicrobials (cipro/flagyl/micafungin).
