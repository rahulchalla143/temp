[**12-30**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39868**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a PMH signficant for CAD s/p [**Known lastname 7792**] in [**2-21**] with cardiac catheterization x2 and PTCA in [**2123**], HTN, [**Hospital 39871**] transferred from OSH for chest pain with ECG changes.
These symptoms lasted for approximately 30 minutes until EMS arrived and symptoms were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Overnight, he continued to have chest pain that was requiring additional doses of SL nitroglycerin, so he was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and transferred to OSH CCU.

He had persistent lateral ST depressions at OSH, although he has been cardiac biomarker negative, given ECG and persistent chest pain when off nitroglycerin gtt, concerning for ACS.
He was plavix loaded and started on ASA, statin, beta blocker, integrillin gtt, lovenox, and nitro gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU to await cardiothoracic surgery.
He was taken to CT surgery the morning of [**2138-12-30**] where he had coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary to left anterior deceding artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior diagonal artery.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition.
He continued to progress and his Intra aortic ballon pump was removed on POD1.
He experienced some paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin.
His medications were titrated, activity progressed and on POD 5 he was discharged home with visiting nurses.
