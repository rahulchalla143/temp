Incidentally noted is an apparent 'ostomy tube in the right central abdomen.
[**1-1**] CXR PA/LAT: In comparison to the previous radiograph from [**2200-12-31**], there is further progression of bilateral parenchymal consolidations.
# Multifocal pneumonia:  Initially, due to concern for respiratory distress and fever, Pt was assessed by CT scan for pharyngeal abscess, which was negative.
Pt received Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin in the ED as well as solumedrol and stablized from a respiratory standpoint.
Vancomycin was discontinued in the setting of 72 hours of negative blood cultures.
With continued fevers, Clindamycin was added given concern for the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
This concern was raised in the setting of a multilobular process combined with the fact that Pt has been taking multiple sedating medications at relatively large doses.
Pt defervesced following the addition of clindamycin with decreased cough and improved SaO2, including the maintanence of SaO2 in the 90's during ambulation on [**2201-1-2**].
Pt was discharged in stable condition and was instructed to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for likely community acquired pneumonia.
He was made aware of the fact that there was concern for the possibility of an aspiration event secondary to over-sedation, but deferred psychiatric consultation on numerous occasions as he prefers to have his medications managed by his outside psychiatrist.
Pt was otherwise maintained on his home doses of psychiatric medications during this hospitalization.
Nortriptyline 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime).
Alprazolam 1 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day).
Diazepam 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Sertraline 100 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Quetiapine 100 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime).
Clindamycin HCl 150 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) for 11 days days.
Levofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q24H (every 24 hours) for 11 days.
Following a brief stay in the intensive care unit your fever defervesced and you stabilized from a respiratory standpoint on intravenous antibiotics.
Psychiatric consultation was offered on multiple occasions, but you insisted upon continuing your care with you outside provider.
Please continue to take all medications as recommended (including 11 days of antibiotics after discharge as well as your home psychiatric medications).
Please call your psychiatrist following discharge to touch bases regarding your medication regimen and to discuss any ongoing mental health issues.
