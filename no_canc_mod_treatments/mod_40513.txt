Admission Date:  [**2190-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-1-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / pentamidine isethionate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Angiogram RIJ line placement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 58 yo M with hx of HIV who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for initial presentation of COPD exacerbation and who then developed a massive GI bleed.
Per OSH DC summary, he was admitted on [**2-18**] for a COPD exacerbation.
COPD improved on nebs, IV steroids and IV antibiotics.
Within 2-3 days of admission, patient developed a GI bleed, which started as a combination of melena and hematochezia.
Colonoscopy was defered because GI was concerned about not being able to visualize anything given bleeding.
Patient subsequently went into hypovolemic and hemorrhagic shock and was transferred to the ICU where he received continuous blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation.
He remained persistently hypotensive and continued to bleed so he was started on pressors on [**2-23**].
Per DC summary, on the day of transfer GI decided to do a colonoscopy despite the persistent bleeding.
IR was reconsulted to consider angiographic embolization but was not comfortable performing this procedure.
He had received a total of ~14 units of packed red cells across his admission.
He was noted to still be sleepy from sedation for his scope (done at 4pm on day of transfer).
He was intubated for respiratory distress, and received 6 U PRBC, 4 U plts, and 4 U FFP during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
He was diuresed with Lasix IV and responded well.
He has not received blood transfusion since [**96**] hours prior to transfer to the floor.
He has been transfused a total of 11 units pRBCs since admission to [**Hospital1 18**].. HCT increased from 32-> 39, and has remained stable.
Surgery has requested to maintain hct >30, plts >100, fibrinogen >100 (ICU has been doing plts >50).
Difficult to interpret in setting of acute illness, can re-evaluate as outpatient.

A curvilinear sliver of gas projecting above the left hemidiaphragm likely represents an artifact due to superimposition of bowel loops, rather than free air.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with ectatic left common iliac artery and right common iliac pseudoaneurysm and thrombosed left internal iliac aneurysm with distal retrograde filling.
Stable findings include abdominal aorta atherosclerotic disease, celiac stenosis, R CIA pseudoaneurysm, thrombosed left internal iliac aneurysm.
Foley cath in place, with bulb in the bladder.
# Gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient developed massive LGIB at OSH, requiring large volume RBC transfusions.
However, attempt to [**Hospital1 92434**] and embolize was not successful.
General surgery was following, but did not require emergent surgery.
Because patient was on liquid diet, he was on liquid Emtricitabine.
Per outside records, patient patient was on dapsone 15mg daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], though this dose sounds too low.
During this admission, G6PD was checked and was normal, thus restarted on Dapsone 100mg qd.
As outpatient, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN at his ID physician's office, he was on Dapsone 50mg daily which is below recommended ppx dose.
When Dapsone 100mg qd was started, Tbili trended up, peaking at 9.5.
Discussed with patient monthly inhaled pentamadine vs. atovaquone, and decided to do pentamadine.
On discharge, patient was started on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Also, continued home HAART: truvada, retonavir 100mg qd, atazanavir 300 mg PO qd.
Patient was intubated shortly after arrival in ICU for airway protection in setting of massive bleeding, hypotension, and tachycardia.
Unclear why he had pulmonary edema, probably because of fluid overload given massive transfusions.
As patient was started on high dose steroids at OSH for COPD exacerbation, he was discharged on 2 week predisone taper.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to GI bleed as has resolved with appropriate transfusions.
Off pressors and maintaining his pressures several days into the admission.
Patient was started on steroids for COPD exacerbation on [**2-18**] .
