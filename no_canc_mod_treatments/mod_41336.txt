Course was also complicated by altered mental status attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and anemia requiring transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was ultimately discharged to rehab and followed up in clinic, where he was informed that he is a poor transplant candidate due to continued etoh abuse and malnourishment.
Because he get's his care at [**Hospital1 18**], he was transferred here.

Concern for acalculous cholecystitis given T bili uptrended with RUQ U/S [**8-22**] showing diffuse gallbladder wall thickening with sludge.
Pt with prolonged ICU stay and critical illness putting at high risk for acalculous cholecystitis, but percutaneous drainage too high risk in this pt per IR attending.
Pt put on Zosyn [**8-24**] and completed 7d course with some improvement in WBC count and bili though not normalized.
Unlikely worsening pneumonia as patient appropriately treated (grew MRSA, completed 14d course of vancomycin with good troughs), ruled out for c.diff, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacteremia.
Pt completed 7d course of Zosyn on [**8-30**].
Pt with persistence of mild leukocytosis with WBC count of 15 on day of discharge but in setting of downtrending bili we were reassured of improvement with coure of zosyn for acalculous cholecystitis.
Patient failed albumin challenge Hospital day 5 showed increasing urine output, underwent diuretic challenge with 200mg IV lasix followed by 12.5mg 25% albumin, put out 270cc/8hrs (0.49cc/kg/hr).
HD started on [**2133-8-18**] for volume control, patient continued on MWF schedule.
Pt continued on HD with fluid removal as needed.
A post pyloric feeding tube was placed for feeding and a OG tube was placed for stomach decompression (dc'd on [**8-20**]).
He was started on HD on [**8-18**] for volume control.
Repeat paracentesis was not consistent with SBP.
Percutaneous drainage was not performed as interventional radiology felt risk of death was too high.
Antibiotics were broadened to include Zosyn per above.
Aspirin and coumadin were held due to GI bleed.
IVC filter placed [**8-10**].
Pt will be unlikely to resume anticoagulation in the setting of GIB.
Pt will need to continue speech therapy and may need video swallow in the future to further advance his diet.
He was started on vancomycin on [**8-16**] and completed 14d course.
# UGIB: does not have h/o of gastric varices.
Patient required 2u pRBCs and was maintained briefly placed on Levophed, blood pressure improved and pressors were discontinued.
Intubated for airway control due to GI bleed, lucid hospital day 4 s/p extubation, oriented to place, stated desire to be full code.
Patient placed on rectal lactulose while remaining NPO, transitioned to oral lactulose hospital day 5 but having increased encephalopathy.
Continued on lactulose on floor with no ongoing asterixis.
# Lower extremity DVT: Patient has history of bilateral lower extremity DVTs (started on warfarin on [**7-10**]).
Warfarin was held on admission in the setting of his GI bleed.
IVC filter placed on [**8-10**].
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased from 232 on [**8-7**] to 39 on [**8-17**].
Was exposed to heparin in [**Month (only) 205**] and may have been exposed during HD at the beginning of admission.
Fibrinogen was not decreased significantly.
Was sedated for intubation, therefore did not require CIWA scale for withdrawal.
Transitional Issues: # Full Code # Pt requiring daily neutraphos for hypophosphatemia.
# Pt will cont HD M, W, F # Pt will need to continue TFs, PT, OT, and speech and swallow.
# Studies pending at time of discharge: PTH, peritoneal fluid acid fast culture from [**8-8**] # F/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in liver clinic and with transplant surgery re: permanent HD access.
# Pt will be discharged off anticoagulation in the setting of recent GIB.
Unlikely to be good candidate for anticoagulation in the future because of GIB risk.
