The patient was thus taken to the OR on [**12-25**] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy with enterotomy and lysis of adhesions.
She also had a CVL placed in the OR.
She received perioperative antibiotics and stress dose steroids postoperatively.
Varices were banded on day of discharge and she was started on sucralfate for 10 days.
Acute Renal Failure    While on surgical service, the patient was also noted to have an increase in her creatinine from 1.3 to 2.2; this was thought secondary to large fluid losses from her JP drain in her abdomen; she was started on replacements 1/2 cc/cc with improvement in her creatinine to 1.2 on [**1-1**].
She had a PICC placed on [**1-2**] and was started on TPN.
She was given albumin 62.5g on [**1-19**] and bicarb and blood on [**1-20**] for volume rescusitation.
The bicarb has improved her acid-base status and lactulose was stopped to slow down the diarrhea.
Infectious disease was consulted; the patient was started on zosyn for the Klebsiella and [**Month/Year (2) 29565**] for the [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
The zosyn was eventually changed to cefepime on [**1-9**] given the sensitivities.
Her home gabapentin and amitriptyline were held given their potential muscarinic effects on peristalsis.
The patient had been having low-grade fevers in the setting of steroids but no mental status changes at the time.
She was continued on antibiotics for two week course after JP pulled to complete [**2111-2-1**].
The patient's abdominal exam gradually improved, her NGT was discontinued on [**1-8**], and she was started on a regular diet given that she was passing gas and having bowel movements.
That said, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers throughout even though she was still on steroids (tapered to her home dose from admission) and multiple antibiotics.
Because of her improved exam, decreased output from her JP and the thought that her fluid status could be better managed with the drain out, her JP drain was removed.
NG tube was pulled out on [**1-17**] and put back in [**1-18**] and patient was treated with lactulose with stool outputs of a liter per day.
Patient had paracentesis [**1-19**] with reduction in white cells but persistent bacterial peritonitis and gram negative rods on gram stain.
Patient had been on cefepime for klebsiella and [**Month/Day (4) 29565**] for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] since her initial tap.
She completed 2 week course (after JP pulled) with change of antibiotics to Meropenem (then ertapenem at discharge for once daily dosing) and Caspo.
She was loaded with fosphenytoin and continued on fosphenytoin with daily monitoring of levels.
Flagyl was discontinued and Cefeoime changed to [**Last Name (un) **].
When her mental status remained altered after being on therapeutic dilantin, she was started on Keppra in addition to Dilantin.
She was started on a regular diet and started working with physical therapy and was discharged to home with services.
