Upon arrival to the ED VS: 98.2 59 140/53 17 100%RA, transcutaneous pacer pads were placed on patient.
During observation in ED patient bradyed down to the 40's, then had about 10 second pause with syncope which ended with junctional beat then sinus took over in the 50's.
Half a milligram of atropine was given with HR increasing only to the 60's.
Initial Glu 100, but 50 on repeat for which she recieved IV D50% 50cc.
Given concern for her renal functions and no reversible defects on MIBI she was medically managed with ASA 325mg, [**Year (4 digits) **] 300, atorvastatin 80 and metoprolol tartrate PO.
On this admission was also noted to be hypertensive to the 200's and was started on amlodipine which she had been taking in the evenings intermitently only if her SBP's > 130.

There is mucosal thickening of the frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses.
CCU team to evaluate the benefits and risks of RCA rotational atherectomy and stenting given echocardiographic and hemodynamic evidence of RV failure, but heavily calcified and diffusely diseased RCA.
Deployed a 2.5 x 18 mm Integriti stent and postdilated to 3.0 mm.
Assessment & Recommendations 1.ASA 81 mg PO QD indefinitely 2.
She was started on dopamine with good response.
Cefepime was discontinued when urine culture returned with staph and not GNR.
Lactate 3.1 on [**9-27**], likely due to hypoperfusion with low blood pressures, and eventually normalized below 2 on repeat measurements.
Hemodynamically, pt required pressor support on Hospital Day 8, pt remained on levophed gtt with labile SBPs ranging from 90s to 150s intermittently.
On [**2184-10-3**] vanc and zosyn were discontinued as blood cultures were no growth to date, and ID consulting team also recommended discontinuing antibiotics.
Patient was on lasix gtt to decrease preload for cardiogenic shock and this was discontinued when CVP goal of [**10-8**] was reached.
Patient was weaned from pressors on [**10-5**] and remained off pressors for remainder of hospital course.
# Mental status changes: Patient with intermittant episodes of unresponsiveness associated with hypotension, concerning for seizure vs hypoperfusion.
The first of these occurred following dose of Phenergan and was associated with muscle rigidity, attributed to medication reaction.
The patient was electively intubated to preform procedures and get imaging.
She remained intubated for some time given on pressors and going to cath lab (see below).
# Anuric Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Urine output decreased to <10cc/hr on second day of admission.
Cath study on [**10-3**] did not show impressive stenosis of renal arteries and no interventions were done.
Urine lytes were consistent with ATN and urine eosinophils were negative and thus made interstitial nephritis related to cephalosporins (history of allergy) less likely.
Per renal recs home Epo was restarted, low phose diet, nephrocaps, and sevelameer 800mg TID with meals started on [**10-12**].
Renal was following and tunneled HD line was placed on [**10-13**].
Patient underwent dialysis initiation once transferred to the floor and will undergo MWF dialysis once discharged.
Metoprolol initially held due to bradycardia, hypotension, pauses.
Patient was restarted on increased dose of metoprolol on [**10-7**].
Low dose ativan was used to control nausea given reactions to other medications as above.
Tube feeds were initiated on [**10-2**] but rate could not be advanced given high residual volume due to gastroparesis.
A post-pyloric tube was placed on [**10-5**] and tube feeds were resumed.
The patient continued to recieve tube feeds until she pulled out tube on [**10-8**].
She resumed oral feeding on [**10-9**].
Initially with IV lasix bolus.
She was then started on torsemide and metolazone with good response.
Diuretics were stopped on [**10-11**] secondary to low BPs and dry volume status.
Isordil was started for afterload reduction.
Additionally patient on Epo at home, restarted on [**10-13**].
Transitional issues: # Dialysis follow-up # Cardiology follow-up # Renal follow-up # Patient's goal hematcrit should be >30% given her NSTEMI during this admission.

You were admitted with fainting spells.
However, your hospital course was complicated by a heart attack which resulted in organ damage and required you to be supported by a breathing machine and medications to improve your blood pressure.
A stent was place in the site of the heart blockage.
You improved once dialysis was started and you were discharged to rehab.
