She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
These were initially felt to be the result of hypoperfuion and she was treated with IV fluid boluses and continuous IV fluids to help support her BP and was kept in flat bed rest.
On [**2184-8-2**] the patient was transferred to the stroke step down unit and although she was initially very anxious and having multiple of these transient episodes, these settled and she was started on citalopram for anxiety.

She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
Patient was treated with a HISS and BP was allowed to autoregulate and initially the goal was to keep the BP elevated to prevent hypoperfusion.
These were initially felt to be the result of hypoperfuion and she was treated with IV fluid boluses and continuous IV fluids to help support her BP and was kept in flat bed rest and salt tablets were also trialled.
Latterly, it was discovered that she had these episodes regardless of BP or position and were anxiety related and these interventions were stopped.
