Patient received chest compressions and was bagged- EMS arrived and AED inticated sinus tach at 140 with no pulses appreciated.
The patient got 800cc NS and SBP increased to 80 and HR decreased to 80s with positive carotid pulses.
On arrival in the ER, she was noted to be in sinus tach- and hypotensive (BP not recorded) and received an additional 2L NS with SBP inc to 100-110- then decreased to 90 systolic.
Dopamine was started and the patient continued to be tachycardic, pressors were changed to neosynephrine.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o F with h/o HTN, Wegner's granulomatosis, IgA nephropathy, ESRD on HD who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-6**] s/p PEA cardiac arrest  1.
Cardiac arrest: The patient was resuscitated in the field and initially required pressors in order to keep her MAP>60.
She was started on dopamine that was later changed to neosynephrine and finally maintained on Levophed.
Her cardiace enzymes were cycled and the results are as follows  [**10-6**] CK 151  CK-MB 12  Troponin  1.33       CK 250  CK-MB 16  Troponin  1.45       CK 198  CK-MB 11  Troponin  1.05       CK 200            Troponin  0.97  Cardiology was consulted and followed the patient during her hospital stay.
In lieu of doing a cardiac cath here at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient will be transferred for further managment to the [**Hospital1 112**] where they are more familiar with her case.
Hypotension: The patient was agressively resuscitated and had no further episodes of hypotension after being weaned off the levophed.
Intubated in the field.
She received HD on [**10-8**], and after a diuresis of several liters of fluid her fluid balance and respiratory status improved.
She received dialysis prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] on Sunday [**10-10**].
