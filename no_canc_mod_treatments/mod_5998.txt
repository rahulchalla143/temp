The Neurology staff was consulted and felt the picture was consistent with multiple septic brain emboli, and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
In view of the decreased level of consciousness, the patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation of the hematoma without intraoperative complications on [**2169-5-22**].
On [**5-23**], the patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed a bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis abscess with embolic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.
Discussed the aortic valve root replacement with Cardiothoracic Surgery; and unless the patient was able to be heparinized and put on bypass, the surgery would become extremely risky.
The patient also had an akinetic apex, and portions of the septal and anterior wall were also akinetic with vegetation on each valve.
The patient will most likely require an aortic valve replacement, and that will be discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery.
The patient was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin.
On [**2169-5-26**], the patient continued to be intubated and sedated, but he opened his eyes.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding valve replacement.
Due to the high risk of anticoagulating the patient for this procedure, it was felt that the risk was too high to anticoagulate the patient to take him for these valve replacements.
For the patient's condition, the patient had an emergent transesophageal echocardiogram for worsening blood pressure control and temperatures to 103.9.
