dictated summary of [**Hospital 228**] hospital course covering period [**2167-9-11**] to [**2167-9-21**] for history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, medications on admission, initial physical examination and early hospital course.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was also started on total parenteral nutrition.
Hepatic/transplant:  The patient was started on an immunosuppression regimen of CellCept, Cyclosporin and Prednisone in the postoperative period and she was also on Rapamycin briefly.
Optimal Cyclosporin dosing was still to be determined on the day of discharge, but it was expected with continue to monitoring Cyclosporin levels following discharge.
The patient is to be discharged on Cyclosporin dose of 175 mg b.i.d.
The patient was not treated with antibiotics specifically targeting this incision and dry gauze dressing was used to cover the draining area prn.
The patient's post surgical abdominal pain was managed with Percocet one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain with good relief.
This was confirmed by a calorie count and the decision was made to initiate cycled tube feedings on postoperative day number eight with Mepro.
Preference was given to a low potassium formula given the patient's hyperkalemia during that period.
The patient's appetite remained marginal on the day of discharge and continued tube feeding as likely to be needed in the short term.
Infectious disease:  The patient's stool tested positive for C-difficile on her day of admission and [**2167-9-11**] and the patient was started on treatment for this infection.
The decision was made to keep the patient on prophylaxis against this infection following surgery to complete a fourteen day course.
Out of concern about the ability of her gut to adequately absorb, the patient was double covered with po Vancomycin and intravenous Flagyl.
C-difficile toxin performed on postoperative day number ten were negative.
The patient's intravenous Flagyl was discontinued and po Vancomycin continued to postoperative day number fourteen.
The patient was also on standard post transplant prophylactic antibiotics.
Valcyte, Bactrim and Fluconazole.
Hematology:  The patient required platelet transfusion on postop day number three and seven, but by the time of discharge her platelet count was increasing.
The patient required transfusions for decreases in hematocrit on postop day number fourteen and seventeen.
Endocrine:  The patient's blood glucose levels were controlled with insulin on a sliding scale.
Her insulin requirements were noted to be increasing on postoperative day number thirteen through fourteen.
Her sliding scale coverage was increased and the [**Hospital **] Clinic consult team was asked to see her.. Their recommendations included placing the patient on six units of NPH at breakfast and dinner and continued the use of sliding scale insulin.
It is believed that the patient's current high blood glucose may be attributable to some of her immunosuppressive medications and may resolve in two to three months.
The patient was started on a minimal dose of Synthroid at 0.125 mg q.d.
to be discontinued if this medication is deemed unnecessary.
It is anticipated that she will continue to receive physical therapy following discharge.
Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient was noted to be hypokalemic with serum potassium in the 5 to 7 range from postoperative day number eight through fifteen, requiring use of Kayexalate twice during that period, and administration of Lasix with the duel purpose of treating hyperkalemia and assisting in diuresis of the patient.
The etiology for the hyperkalemia was unclear, although it was believed that the patient's ongoing treatment with Fluconazole, Cyclosporin and Vancomycin were contributing factors.
The patient was also started on 800 mg of magnesium by mouth twice a day when her magnesium levels were noted to be trending downward.
Neurological:  The patient was at times noted to be anxious and emotionally labile by staff (intermittent crying episodes, expressions of frustration and difficulty coping).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  CellCept 1 gram b.i.d., prednisone 15 mg po q.d., Neural 175 mg b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Protonix 40 mg b.i.d., Bactrim double strength one tablet q.d., Fluconazole 400 mg q.d., Valcyte 450 mg b.i.d., magnesium oxide 800 mg b.i.d., Seraquel 25 mg q.h.s., Percocet 5 mg one to two tabs po q 4 to 6 hours prn, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., NPH insulin 9 units subQ at breakfast and 6 units subQ at dinner as well as sliding scale insulin.
The patient needs to be linked up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], a psychiatrist for complete neuro/psych evaluation following discharge.
