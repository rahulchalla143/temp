Admission Date:  [**2198-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Aterial line placement Left internal jugular central venous line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 80664**] is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, DM, pneumonia who is transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] for evaluation of hepatopulmonary syndrome.
Admitted to the OSH on [**3-5**] with shortness of breath, he was initially treated with Levaquin and Cetriaxone along with steroids for COPD as this was felt to be most consistent with a COPD exacerbation.
Given CT findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, thoracic surgery was consulted and on [**3-14**] a bronchoscopy with washings, RVATS RUL lung biopsy was performed.
He was not intubated at this time.
Worsening was felt to be due to CHF and hebwas diuresed with IV lasix.

[**2198-3-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube that has its tip at the top of the clavicles, approximately 7 cm above the carina.
Opacification persists in the left mid and lower lung zones.
Heterogeneous attenuation, could be due to air trapping.
Coronary artery, aortic annulus, and aortic valve calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.
[**2198-3-30**] Shunt study - IMPRESSION: Study is consistent with the presence of a right-to-left shunt.
[**2198-3-31**] CXR - FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above carina and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.
ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet at least 6 cm from the carina, 2 cm above optimal placement.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
ET tube, nasogastric tube and left central and right PIC catheters in standard placements.
[**2198-4-1**] CXR - Sequence of pulmonary abnormalities on chest radiographs since [**3-28**], suggests the development of pneumonia, particularly in left lower lobe, followed by evidence of volume overload and most recently worsening generalized pulmonary opacification which could be due to a combination of edema and hemorrhage, showing particular worsening over the past five hours.
ET tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular and right PIC line ends in standard placements.
The patient also had a LLL infiltrate on his admission CXR and was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for HAP following arrival for the duration of his MICU course.
PE was also considered in the differential, however, heparin was held given concern for HIT.
Following intubation, O2 sats >90% were achieved by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.
MAPs improved with platelets and FFP infusion, suggesting that shunting was playing a significant role.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive and died shortly thereafter despite aggressive support with pressors and maximum ventilatory support.
Hypotension: The patient initially required levophed for blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats following admission and intubation.
Levophed was eventually weaned off and the patient did not require any pressors for a few days.
Despite aggressive resuscitation with fluids and 3 pressors (levophed, vasopressin, and neosynephrine) the patient remained hypotensive.
He received 2 platelet transfusions prior to an abdominal paracentesis.
Aggressive platelet replacement was begun and continued over the next couple of days.
They recommended continued platelet transfusion with ABO-matched platelets.
The patient was already on steroids for COPD and hematology felt that ITP was unlikely.
On [**3-30**] vancomycin was stopped, on [**3-31**] zosyn was stopped, and on [**3-31**] his PPI was changed to ranitidine in the event that the patient had thrombocytopenia as a result of a drug reaction.
Given the patient's altered mental status, he was treated with lactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient also underwent a diagnostic paracentesis without evidence of SBP.
Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status was most likely multifactorial with hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, and infection all contributing.
Treatment was directed at these primary causes.
He remained negative at [**Hospital1 18**] (x 2) and treatment for C. Diff was held.
He was started on a steroid taper there and continued on a steroid taper following his transfer.
He continued to receive bronchodilators while intubated.
