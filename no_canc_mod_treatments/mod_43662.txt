The patient was begun on IV Levaquin, was given Tylenol PR as well as sublingual nitroglycerin, Solu-Medrol and breathing treatments, nitropaste and was begun on a cardizem drip for rate control.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medical Floor, vital signs were 98.1, blood pressure was 112/50, heart rate is 80, Respiratory rate is 18, 92% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Electrolytes: Sodium 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 102, bicarb 28, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1, glucose 96, CK was 62 with troponin of less than 0.3, digoxin level was 1.2.
Infectious disease:  The patient was initially started in the hospital on Levaquin IV.
Vancomycin was added to this regimen on [**2124-3-15**] for further coverage of the enterococcus.
Both the urine culture and the blood cultures from [**3-14**] and 5th grew out enterococcus which was resistant to Levaquin, therefore, due to the fact that the patient is allergic to penicillin, he was unable to be started on ampicillin and vancomycin was the drug of choice.
He was continued on vancomycin throughout his stay.
The patient had a PIC line placed due to the fact that he would need long term antibiotic therapy.
Both studies were negative for any vegetation and, therefore, the patient will be discharged on a total of 3 week course of vancomycin IV.
All episodes were well controlled with nitroglycerin sublingual and no further electrocardiogram changes were identified.
After his weight was well controlled with the Diltiazem drip, the patient was just restarted on his Verapamil and continued on that for the remainder of the day.
His calcium channel blocker aspirin and Coumadin were also continued.
The Coumadin was given based on the goal INR being 1.8 to 2.2.
He was continued on Lasix and Aldactone throughout his stay.
He was continued on his protime pump inhibitor as well as his bowel regimen.
Initially, they suggested transurethral resection of prostate in conjunction with suprapubic catheter placement for benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Since the patient became bacteremic, it was decided that he would follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] in urology as an outpatient for further management of this issue.
Heme:  The patient was transfused on two occasions with one unit of packed red blood cells in order to optimize his hematocrit at a level greater than 30.
The patient's level of anticoagulation was monitored throughout his stay with the use of INR.
He was continued on his Coumadin 5 mg q. day to keep goal INR equal to 1.8 to 2.2.
This is a middle of the road level of anticoagulation balancing the need for anticoagulation based on his history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve with his history of chronic gastrointestinal bleed secondary to small bowel AVM.
Endocrine: Type II diabetes mellitus, the patient was continued on Avandia and glipizide as well as the regular insulin sliding scale throughout his stay.
Furthermore, the patient was continued on Fentanyl patch for pain secondary to vertebral compression fractures.
Tubes, lines and drains:  Again, the patient has a PIC line in place for long term antibiotics and he also has an indwelling Foley catheter.
The catheter was changed in the MICU prior to his transfer to the floor.
