She was intubated for decreasing O2 saturations.
She was eventually weaned from sedation and the ventilator.
She was also placed on CIWA protocol because of EtOH associated with her fall; there were no signs of delirium tremors noted and she was eventually transferred to the regular nursing unit.
Spine surgery was consulted because of her spine fractures; her injuries were nonoperative.
Also because of her rib fractures her O2 sats have been in low 90's requiring supplemental oxygen; as her pain decreases she should be able to be weaned from the oxygen.
