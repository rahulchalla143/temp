Admission Date:  [**2155-7-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-7-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2079-2-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old Russian-speaking female with a history of CAD, status post CABG in [**2152-12-4**] with graft of LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2, saphenous vein graft to right PDA.
Follow-up catheterization in [**3-5**] showed diffuse, severe three vessel disease, almost totally occluded saphenous vein graft to PDA.
The patient then underwent right coronary artery PTCA with stent placement.
She denied any severe or sustained episodes of chest pain, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope.
She was referred for coronary catheterization and renal angiography on [**2155-7-4**].
She was admitted on [**2155-7-3**] for precatheterization hydration and Mucomyst therapy.
We felt that renal angiography was warranted secondary to her marked hypertension despite medical management with multiple medications in order to evaluate for possible renal artery stenosis.
She was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Catheterization showed LAD occluded proximally, left circumflex with nondominant vessel with previous stent patent with diffuse in-stent restenosis with competitive flow distally filling the saphenous vein graft.
RCA was a dominant vessel with previous proximal stents patent.
Saphenous vein graft to RCA occluded proximally.
Saphenous vein grafts to OM1/OM2 patent.
On [**2155-7-5**], she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells along with Lasix.
The patient was given morphine sulfate for pain control which resulted in a drop of her systolic blood pressure from 130s to 90s.
Vascular Surgery was consulted who recommended an ultrasound.
CAD, status post non-Q wave MI in 03/00, status post stent to OM2, status post CABG in [**2152-12-4**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1/OM2, SVG to right PDA.
Repeat catheterization in [**3-5**] with diffuse and severe disease, almost totally occluded saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Status post right coronary PTCA with stent placement.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral popliteal bypass in [**1-4**].

Insulin 70/30 16 units q.a.m.
Serum chemistries with potassium 3.7, BUN 26, creatinine 1.8, patient's baseline creatinine 1.1 to 1.3.
Coronary catheterization on [**2155-7-4**] (native three vessel disease), left main with no significant obstructive disease, LAD subtotally occluded in midvessel and filled distally via LIMA to LAD, left circumflex 30% narrowing proximally, OM2 with diffuse 70% proximal disease, competitive flow from SVG to OM1/OM2 distally, OM3 70% diffuse disease beyond which had a competitive flow from saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2.
Saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2 widely patent, saphenous vein graft to right PDA stump occluded, LIMA to LAD patent, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 4, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure 7.
For her ischemia, plan was made to continue aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., beta blockade with metoprolol 75 mg p.o.
b.i.d., and Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Initially, the patient's other outpatient hypertensives including ACE inhibitor, nitrates, calcium channel blockers were held secondary to the concern for hemodynamic instability in light of her hematoma formation status post catheterization.
She maintained stable blood pressures for the first several days of her hospital course and, thereafter, demonstrated elevated blood pressures.
Therefore, she was started on a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, nitrate, diuretic for blood pressure control.
At the time of discharge, she was maintaining blood pressures in the ranges of 150s-180s/60s-80s on metoprolol 125 p.o.
b.i.d., Captopril 100 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Amlodipine 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.
q.d., hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA STATUS POST CATHETERIZATION: Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained.
She required multiple transfusions to maintain hematocrit values greater than 30.
As she was felt to be unstable, and the pseudoaneurysm contributing to this blood loss, she underwent surgical repair of her right femoral hematoma and pseudoaneurysm on [**2155-7-8**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
Vascular Surgery continued to follow her status post repair with wound checks and general wound care.
She did require additional blood transfusions status post surgical repair to maintain hematocrit values greater than 30.
Per Vascular Surgery, the patient had two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains in place status post her surgical repair.
Vascular Surgery wanted these left in place until they stopped draining.
At the time of this dictation, drains were still in place, Vascular Surgery still following the patient for wound care and Kefzol antibiotic therapy was started for new onset erythema around the right groin incisional sites.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE STATUS POST CORONARY CATHETERIZATION:  On admission to the CCU, the patient's creatinine was evaluated to a value of 1.8, baseline creatinines ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 per the medical record review.
Prior to her catheterization, she received Mucomyst and aggressive IV fluid hydration therapy.
Therefore, the patient's outpatient diuretic doses were held and she was volume resuscitated with IV fluids and multiple blood transfusions.
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  Status post catheterization, Metformin was held.
The patient was continued on her outpatient dose of insulin 70/30 16 units q.a.m.
fingerstick blood glucose testing and covered with regular insulin sliding scale.
Fingerstick blood glucose testing on the Avandia and insulin 70/30 16 units q.a.m.
ACTIVITY:  Status post surgical repair of the patient's right groin hematoma, she was kept on bed rest for several days per Vascular Surgery recommendation.
She was evaluated by Physical Therapy who felt that she was a candidate for inpatient rehabilitation after discharge from this hospital.
She will require additional physical therapy to increase her functional status, gait, and mobility and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility.
Insulin 70/30 subcutaneously 16 units q.a.m.
Lipitor 10 mg one p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg one p.o.
