Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-10-23**] Right below knee amputation Intubation and mechanical ventilation Placement of left radial arterial line Direct Current Cardioversion  History of Present Illness: 65M with multiple medical problems s/p L SFA to AT bypass on [**7-24**] that failed and thrombectomy of the graft at that time, which was also unsuccessful, requiring multiple toe amputations and most recently a left BKA now presenting from nursing home Academy Manor with worsening ischemia and non-healing wounds on the RLE.
Apparently he was being treated with Vancomycin 750 q36hrs for his wound infections, but that was most recently switched to Linezolid as wound cultures came back with Vanc resistent enterococcus, as well as Morganella Morganii sp and Klebsiella.
He is recently s/p cardiac cath [**6-/2197**] with DES to Left circumflex, and POBA to D1 #.
Statin induced immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy - on Cellcept and prednisone, history of weakness requiring intubation s/p treatment with IVIG as well as Rituxan.

Path: Right lower extremity; below-the-knee amputation (A-J): Cutaneous ulceration, acute inflammation and necrosis.
EEG: ([**11-22**]): This is an abnormal video EEG study due to periodic generalized sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance at 1-1.5 Hz frequency.
([**11-16**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG study because of initial continuous periodic epileptiform discharges at 1.5-2 Hz consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
These abated after treatment with intravenous phenobarbital.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30048**] is a 65 year old man, with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p remote L BKA, and statin-induced immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, who presented on [**10-18**], with a right LE ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.
He was started on IV linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and underwent right BKA on [**10-23**].
His course has since been complicated by a. fib with RVR s/p DCCVx1, hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**10-27**], prompting intubation and pressor support, as well as status epilepticus.
Post-operatively, in the PACU, the patient had hypotension 96/40, with minimal oozing from wound; the patient recieved fluids and was transfused packed red cells, eventually started on Neo drip, with stabilization of BP, and was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 VICU with Neo drip.
Over the next day, the patient's blood pressure was stable, and the Neo drip was weaned off.
He was also started Hydromorphone IV for breakthrough pain.
The pt received direct cardioversion x 1, and converted to NSR.
He received IV amiodarone load x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.
He was also started on heparin gtt, which was transitioned to oral comadin.
The pt was on 2L NC with O2sat 99%, although he was noted to be oliguric (180cc/24hr).
On [**10-27**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite albumin and fluid boluses.
He was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ABG was drawn (7.05/81/43 @ 4AM); he was re-started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).
Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin gtt stopped.
He has been off antibiotics since [**2197-10-24**].
exacerbation from being cellcept on admission to the vascular service), narcotic medications as well as aspiration (given known muscle weakness).
PE was thought to be less likely, given the pt's therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt.
After admission to the MICU, the pt was treated with steroids and re-started on Cellcept (1000mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Sedating medications were avoided.
Despite these efforts, he was unable to be weaned off of the ventilator and ultimately the decision was made for CMO and the patient was extubated.
# Hypotension - The patient had several episodes of hypotension while admitted, including post-operatively, in the setting of A.fib w. RVR, after diuresis, and while being treated with AEDs for status epilepticus (see below).
He had no evidence of frank sepsis (lactate 0.7 and stable, leukocytosis improved initially without antibiotics, LFTs WNL, afebrile), although his right LE showed erythema and warmth c/w cellulitis as well as purulent drainage from the surgical wound.
During his MICU stay, the patient was treated with Vanc and Cefepime (plan for 3 week course, ending on [**2197-11-24**] and [**2197-11-21**], respectively).
The pt's most prolonged period of hypotension occurred in the setting of AED titration (with Keppra, Dilantin, and Phenobarb).
He had to be maintained on Levophed while these drugs were initiated and titrated.
He was also started on stress-dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr), given concern for hypoadrenalism [**12-19**] chronic steroid use.
Hydrocort was weaned and patient was weaned from pressor support, however intermittently reguired pressor support throughout MICU course.
Pressors were removed after patient made CMO.
Per Neurology's recommendations, Keppra, then Dilantin and, lastly, Phenobarbital were started.
Patient continued to be monitored during MICU course on continuous EEG video monitoring.
He was cont'd on Vanc/Cefepime, stress dose steroids, and weaned off of pressors.
However prior to permanent HD line placement the patient was made CMO given very poor prognosis and likely anoxic brain injury and unlikely return of meaningful mental status.
Patient eventually underwent dialysis however given very poor prognosis permanent HD line was not placed and patient made CMO.
Vascular surgery followed the patient and he was continued on aspirin and plavix.
# Atrial fibrillation - After transfer to the MICU, his rate controlled with amiodarone 200mg Qd s/p amiodarone loading (IV loading, then 400mg x 7 days) and metoprolol 12.5mg TID.
# Systolic CHF: Held diuresis now given hypotension s/p diuresis with lasix on [**11-2**].
Eventually CVVH was started and patient was bridged to HD as above.
