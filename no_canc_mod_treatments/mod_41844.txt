The patient was ultimately intubated for his COPD flare as he developed hypoxic respiratory failure and admitted to the MICU.
While in the micu, he was treated with prednisone for COPD flare and extubated the day before admission at which time severe lower extremity weakness was noted.
He underwent urgent spine imaging with both CT and MRI, which were concerning for epidural abscess, diskitis, osteomyelitis and collapse of T9 with cord compression with edema from T8-T11.
Patient started on vancomycin/Zosyn prior to transfer.

man with Stage IV COPD CAD s/p CABG, CHF admitted to OSH with COPD flare, his course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure and lower extremity paralysis with cord compression and paraspinal abscess now POD12 s/p surgical debridement and fusion, course complicated by transient episodes of complete AV block, poor systolic function, respiratory failure x 2 requiring intubation, and hypotension requiring pressors.
Active Issues  #)Respiratory failure: Per OSH, pt had COPD exacerbation leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubation and uneventful extubation.
Required ipratopium and saline nebs.
However, he began having respiratory distress and poor blood gases necessitating transfer back to the MICU, where he was intubated and put on pressure support.
He became hypotensive and tachycardic in this setting, likely b/c he was put on pressure support b/c of concern for an ARDS picture.
He was able to have sedation reduced the 3rd day of his intubation ([**6-2**]).
He passed this trial and was able to be weaned down to 4L NC over the next few days w/o having acute respiratory distress.
Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated for goal sat >90%.
Also has baseline orthostatic hypotension for which he was on fludrocortisone prior to admission.
During his initial MICU stay, he required IVF and pressor support and was successfully weaned off after he was restarted on fludrocortisone at an increased dose of daily instead of every other day.
However, he again became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support ventilation and an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**].
He maxed out on levophed and was placed on phenylephrine as well.
When his ventilator settings were changed to CMV, he was able to be weaned off levophed althoug he remained on phenylephrine even after his MAP titration floor was changed to <55.
He was able to be weaned off phenylephrine after extubation and was transitioned to PO midodrine for blood pressure support.
# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s/p debridement and fusion: Pt presented with cord compression and lower extremity flaccid paralysis [**12-26**] epidural abscess and osteomyelitis.
After surgical debridement [**5-23**], he was empirically covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone and flagyl.
ID on board and advised to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks since the tissue grew Strep viridans but after sensitivities returned changed the antibiotic to ceftriaxone.
Antibiotics should continue until [**2155-7-10**].
#[**Hospital 7792**]: In the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to the MICU on [**5-31**], he was found to have elevated troponins for which he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA 325 for [**Month/Day (4) 7792**].
His troponins trended down [**6-1**], so heparin gtt was discontinued.
He was started on clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily as well in this setting after being cleared by ortho to do so.
He has follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13310**] on [**7-7**], at this appointment anticoagulation for LV aneurysm should be considered but was deferred during hospitalization given comorbidities and recent surgery.
#Complete AV Block / Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome: Pt had 2 episodes of bradycardia with complete AV block which required atropine and pressors to break during initial MICU stay.
Per cardiology and EP, a pacemaker is likely to be required after his acute osteomyelitis has resolved and antibiotics course completed.
Given continued concern for possible cardiac vegetations or complication such as abscess, a TEE was performed [**6-13**], which revealed no cardiac vegetations or clinically significant valvular disease.
Cr on discharge 1.9  #Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was not on anticoagulation prior to admission and given setting of recent surgery was not started while in MICU.
Seroquel 25 mg x 2 was given without benefit.
He received Haldol 1mg IM, which improved without significant increase in QTC.
On the 2nd MICU admission, he was started on seroquel 25 mg TID to help address his agitation.
He did require haldol 6 mg IV during his second MICU stay due to acute agitation.
On discharge he was confused but not agitated and continued on seroquel 25 mg TID.
Santyl (collagenase) enzymatic debridement was started to help address this.
Chronic Issues  #Pulmonary HTN: Stable, not on medications for this and was continued on supplmental O2.
Lasix was originally held in the setting of hypotension, but this was restarted since Mr. [**Known lastname **] was several liters positive during the hospitalization.
His metoprolol was held throughout his hospitalization given his complete heart block.
He was discharged on lasix 80 mg in AM and 40 mg in PM which was his home regimen, but volume status should be reassessed and dose may be increased if patient gains more than 3 lbs in one day or concern for hypervolemia.
His ASA and simvastatin were increased to ASA 325 and atorvastatin 80 mg for [**Hospital1 7792**].
He was continued on an ISS as an outpatient.
Transitional Issues - reassess need for antipsychotics, mental status may be improving and may not have long-term need - assess volume status daily and daily weights, consider increasing lasix dose if weight increasing or appears hypervolemic - consider pacemaker placement for heart block and anticoagulation for both paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and LV aneurysm at cardiology followup visit - Continue ceftriaxone 2 gm daily until [**2155-7-10**] and weekly CBC/diff and ESR/CRP to be faxed to infectious disease nurses at [**Hospital1 69**] #Full code as per HCP, nephew, [**Name (NI) 449**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 976**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 111744**].
