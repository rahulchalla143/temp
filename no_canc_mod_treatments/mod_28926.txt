Admission Date:  [**2137-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Anterior ST segment myocardial infarction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary artery catheterization and angioplasty of left anterior descending artery to the right coronary artery Intraaortic Balloon Pump support Swan-Ganz catheterization  Catherization results: .
Successful placement of an 8 French 40 cc IABP via the RFA.
Cardiogenic shock with placement of intra-aortic balloon assist device.
The patient received sublingual nitroglycerin X3 with no alleviation of chest pain.
A nitroglycerin drip was then started and brought the patient some relief with 2/10 chest pain.
A PTCA was performed to the left anterior descemding artery to the right coronary (10% residual stenosis).
A stent was not placed due to low residual flow.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient received Lasix 40mg IV and 300mg bolus of Plavix.
Integrillin, ASA, and Lipitor were also started.

CBC [**2137-6-14**] 06:25AM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-4.20* Hgb-12.4* Hct-37.3* MCV-89 MCH-29.5 MCHC-33.2 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-198 [**2137-6-9**] 02:18PM BLOOD WBC-15.3* RBC-4.87 Hgb-14.4 Hct-42.5 MCV-87 MCH-29.6 MCHC-33.9 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-199  Brief Hospital Course: 83M s/p STEMI of LAD and RCA territory, loss of D1 [**1-2**] embolization, transferred to CCU for optimization of hemodynamics in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
* Pump: Given cardiac index of 1.3 in cath lab, IABP was placed for optimization of systolic and diastolic pressures.
On IABP, cardiac index improved to 1.7, and although patient diuresed successfully with 40mg IV Lasix, nesiritide gtt was started to further improve hemodynamics.
On hospital day two, cardiac index improved to 2.3 on nesiritide and IABP, and both were discontinued on hospital day three as patient continued to do improve in function with excellent diuresis on lasix alone (PAP 43/21).
Lisinopril was initiated for afterload reduction, and at the time of discharge, was uptitrated to 7.5mg QD.
Patient was instructed to return for echocardiogram in one month following discharge.
Digoxin was continued for additional rate control and to also further improve inotropy as outpatient.
Despite poor ejection fraction, patient was considered extremely poor candidate for anticoagulation given history of subdural hematoma.
Patient did require one dose of IV metoprolol for stable Afib with RVR to improve rate control.
* STEMI: Given patient's late presentation (infarct may have begun as early was 3 days before presentation), flow in LAD and RCA despite PTCA were extremely poor, making stent placement impossible.
Patient was started on medical management regimen of ASA 325, Plavix 75, Atovastatin 80, with Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization.
Patient tolerated these medications without evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other site of bleeding.
To improve rate control post MI, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] was initiated.
To improve afterload reduction, patient was started on lisinopril as above and titrated to 7.5mg QD.
However, given the fact that this was in the setting of indwelling foley, patient was initiated on bactrim for treatment with an intent to complete a 7 day course as an outpatient.
* Dehydration: Patient was initially diuresed aggressively given cardiogenic shock, however, near the time of discharge, patient had mild bump in creatinine (chronic renal insufficiency Cr 1.1-1.2) to 1.5, and urine lytes revealed prerenal (UOsm [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63454**] mg/dL UCreat 86 mg/dL USodium 15 mEq/L).
At the time of discharge, patient continued to have mild ambulatory desaturations and exhaustion after minimal exertion, and was therefore referred to short term inpatient rehabilitation.
