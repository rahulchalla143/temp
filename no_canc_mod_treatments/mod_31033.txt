At [**Hospital1 **], she was noted to have a left psoas abscess and this was discussed with the surgery interventional radiology team who felt that medical management with antibiotics was suggested for the psoas abscess.
The patient, during this hospitalization, was encouraged to drink fluids and she also received some IV fluids, given an initial urine sodium of less than 1 suggesting a prerenal component of the renal function.
Renal services also felt, since the patient had been on gentamicin previously, approximately five days prior to the increase in creatinine, it was felt that part of the renal function may have been related to gentamicin toxicity.
Also, it was felt that the vancomycin or rifampin which the patient had been on may have been causing a component of the renal function.
Vancomycin was re-dosed in this patient, given the change in her renal function, was dosed renally.
The patient had complained of some weakness and lightheadedness and was, thus, transfused a unit of packed red blood cells for relief of symptoms.
Given the patient's changing renal function, the Infectious Disease service was reconsulted to evaluate for her antibiotic treatments and resolution of the left psoas abscess.
The patient also had repeat blood cultures drawn and the patient's catheter tip from the central line was sent.
The ID service recommended continuing the patient's vancomycin, but discontinued the vancomycin.
The patient had resolution of the white blood cells seen previously on her cerebrospinal fluid at the outside hospital.
