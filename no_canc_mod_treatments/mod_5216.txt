Admission Date:  [**2136-3-28**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2103-7-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38403**] is a 32-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy (viral versus idiopathic) and ventricular arrhythmia who was admitted to the hospital because of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing; then subsequently transferred to Coronary Care Unit for congestive heart failure.
Since that time he has done well with medical therapy.
He had been stable status post his automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement until this month when he was admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on [**3-21**] after his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fired several times over the course of several days.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3-23**] for an electrophysiology study which showed multiple fossae of ventricular tachycardia which were not able to be mapped and ablated because he tolerated this study poorly and required cardioversion.
He was transferred to the C-MED Service and over the next several days received sotalol, amiodarone, and a lidocaine drip with good results.
His lidocaine was subsequently discontinued and replaced with mexiletine with poor results.
Therefore, his sotalol, amiodarone, and mexiletine were discontinued, and the patient was started just on quinidine with good results.
He was also started on Coumadin for a poor ejection fraction.
A right femoral Swan-Ganz catheter was placed under fluoroscopic guidance in the Coronary Care Unit on [**4-3**] with pressures similar to the results from the [**4-2**] right heart cardiac catheterization.
Automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement in [**2136-1-10**].
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from C-MED were aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Coumadin 3 mg p.o.
(held for Swan-Ganz catheter placement), Coreg 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zestril 30 mg p.o.
q.d., quinidine gluconate 324 mg p.o.
q.8h., Lasix 80 mg intravenously b.i.d., K-Dur 20 mEq p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o.
q.d., Celexa 10 mg p.o.
He was continued on his regimen of Coreg, Zestril, and Lasix which he had been getting on the floor.
A milrinone drip was started with subsequent increase in cardiac output and a decrease in his pulmonary artery and wedge pressures.
Therefore, the milrinone was discontinued, and the strategy of therapy was changed to maximizing the diuresis and afterload reduction.
Anticoagulation for a poor ejection fraction which had been started on the floor had been held for the Swan-Ganz catheter placement but was restarted with a heparin drip and Coumadin in the unit.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient with frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia, status post multiple antiarrhythmic regimens on the floor; finally controlled well quinidine.
However, after milrinone was initiated, the patient had recurrent supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia necessitating the cessation of milrinone drip (as detailed above).
He was continued on quinidine gluconate 324 mg q.8h.
A Psychiatry consultation was obtained who recommended adding Ativan as well as continuation of Celexa.
