The patient was started on Prednisone 20 mg three times a day for a question of sarcoid and defervesced given the granulomatous infiltrate in the liver that was noted.
The patient had a total of ten units of platelets, two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma during that admission and the patient was discharged on [**11-1**], but re-presented on [**11-2**] with increasing shortness of breath and fever to 104.0 F.  At the outside hospital, the patient was started on Zosyn, Diflucan, and Vancomycin for empiric treatment and the patient also had significant hypotension and dopamine was started prior to the transfer of the patient to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further work-up.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**] and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was hypotensive and immediately continued on the dopamine drip and continued to be febrile.
The patient also had a worsening acidosis with an arterial blood gases of 7.30, pCO2 of 29, pO2 of 90, and an elevation of lactate to 3.0, and given the worsening acidosis and patient's tachypneic appearance, the patient was subsequently intubated for compensation of his acidosis.
Prednisone 20 three times a day.
Protonix 40 q. day.
Zyprexa 15 q. day.
Paxil 30 q. day.
Lexapro 10 q. day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs with heart rate of 124; blood pressure 94/42; respiratory rate of 30; oxygen saturation 93% on four liters nasal cannula and a weight of 91 kilograms.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent for a hematocrit of 26.9, white blood cell count of 3.4, platelets of 36, INR of 1.6, fibrinogen 400, total bilirubin 15.7, albumin at 2.5, calcium of 6.6, lactate of 3.0.
The patient was initially ventilated and was unable to correct despite maximum ventilatory support.
The patient was started on a sodium bicarbonate drip on hospital day two for a bicarbonate of 9.
The bicarbonate drip was continued and the Renal Team was consulted for further management of this patient.
The patient was transfused with blood products to support a hematocrit greater than 30 and INR less than 1.5, and platelets greater than 50 given his continued bleeding during this hospital stay.
The patient initially during the first two hospital days, required pressor support with Levophed and was able to wean with improvement of his hemodynamics.
Elaborate work-up is currently pending and the patient was initiated on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Meropenem, doxycycline, Levaquin, and Caspofungin for empirical broad coverage.
Hematology/Oncology was also consulted in the management of this patient and there was initial consideration of disseminated sarcoid and the patient was initially placed on a maximum dose of steroids on hospital day one and two without significant improvement of his clinical symptoms and it was thus thought that this was less likely to be sarcoid and the corticosteroids were decreased.
The patient is currently being maintained with maximum support of his hemodynamics.
Empirical treatment of tumor lysis with allopurinol was initiated.
HYPOCALCEMIA:  The patient upon initiation of CVVH, had a significant drop in his calcium, and a calcium drip was initiated during this administration for improvement.
The patient, upon initiation of CVVH with citrate exchange on hospital day three, precipitated severe tetany, hypotension, for which a calcium drip was started.
The patient's calcium was repleted with a drip as well as total parenteral nutrition with improvement of his calcium on the day of this dictation.
The patient continued to bleed from the nose and we were transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma.
ENT was consulted for epistaxis and recommended supportive care only.
The patient was getting hemodialysis with bicarbonate exchange as well as calcium drip.
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition on hospital day four with calcium supplementation.
