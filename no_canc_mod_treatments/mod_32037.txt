The patient  was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and ceftazidime, given fluid resucitation, and taken emergently to the operating room for extensive debridement.
He had a VAC dressing placed in his wound.
On [**5-3**] Infectious Disease was consulted for help with antibiotics management; his antibiotic coverage was expanded to include coverage for anaerobes with flagyl.
He was also started on norvasc for improvement blood pressure control, as he was noted to be quite hypertensive throughout his stay.
He was also started on a sliding scale for improved wound healing as surveillance blood sugars were elevated.
His Foley catheter was removed.
On [**5-4**] his VAC was changed, and he had a PICC placed for IV antibiotics.
Unfortunately, in the setting of his infection, the patient experienced a gout flare of the R knee; he was given colchicine and indomethicin (gently, given his renal failure) with symptomatic improvement.
They initially recommended that he go home with a sliding scale, but then given that he was without signs of infection and his creatinine was stable, he was started on metformin and then discharged home on that with follow-up, and with prescriptions for insulin sliding scale per further management by this primary care doctor.
After seven days of IV antibiotics the patient was changed to a PO regimen of levofloxacin and flagyl with the aid of infectious disease.
His PICC line was discontinued.
