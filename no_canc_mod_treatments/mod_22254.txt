As for interventions, patient was given vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed urosepsis.
She was given 10 mg vitamin K for the elevated INR.
She was started on norepinephrine and intubated for airway protection given concern of altered mental status and aspiration on CT scan.
Vitals at time of admission are BP 123/67, HR 62, RR 16, sat 100% on assist control ventilation, FiO2 100%, Vt 450 with PEEP of 5 and RR 20.

The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain, worsening mental status, found to be hypothermic and hypotensive in ED, initially intubated on pressors and treated empirically for urosepsis/aspiration pneumonia.
She had a 6 day course of cefepime and Flagyl.
Abx were stopped when pt removed her PICC and not restarted due to change in goals of care.
Patient underwent CTAP in ED that showed severe atherosclerotic disease in the celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] although no definite complete occlusion.
Trauma surgery was consulted initially for concern of bowel ischemia.
However, given the above CT findings, they felt that surgical intervention was not indicated.
The patient's lactate improved with treatment of her infections, anemia, and hypovolemia.
# Respiratory status: she was intubated in the emergency room for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status and evidence of aspiration on CT.
The EKGs were reviewed by the cardiology fellow, who recommended trending the troponin and no intervention.
Pt was tx with vitamin K. GI was consulted, but since no more bleeding occurred the pt was not scoped.
Her acute renal failure was likely prerenal, it corrected with IVF and tx of UTI.
Her sodium then rose again once her IVF were stopped in the setting of becoming comfort measures and the pt removed her PICC line.
# Vertebral compression fractures: CTAP at admission showed new T7 vertebral body compression fracture and progression of L2 vertebral body fracture.
# Goals of care: On [**9-18**] a family meeting with daughter and grandson was held with an interpreter.
The goals were changed to DNR/DNI with comfort measures.
