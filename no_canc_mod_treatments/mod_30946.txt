Per husband, for the past few weeks patient has been having increasing dyspnea without releif of albuterol inhaler.
Of note, patient has changed medications recently, stoping torsemide 40mg qd and metoprolol 50mg qd, although per husband, patient states that this is not like her normal heart failure.
Pt was given methylprednisolone 125mg IV, ipratropium, albuterol, azithromycin 500mg IV.
- patient was placed on nonrebreather --> weaned to NC6L --> felt was retaining CO2, so started on non-invasive ventilation --> satting 94%, but patient did not tolerate, then intubation with pressures in the 50/70s.
Patient got 1500cc of NS in the ED.
-2x18s, RIJ placed, started on dopamine  Etomidate + succinylcholine, uncomplicated intubation --> SBP 70s.
Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.

A dual-lead AICD projects over the left chest wall with lead tips extending into the right atrium and right ventricle as well as the tips extending along the epicardium at the level of the left atrium.
Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is seen with its tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.
There has also been placement of an orogastric tube with its tip coiled in the left upper abdomen.
IMPRESSION: ET and OG tubes positioned appropriately.
[**3-26**] CXR - LINE PLACEMENT FINDINGS: AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained.
The endotracheal tube is again seen positioned approximately 3 cm above the carina.
An NG tube is coiled in the left upper abdomen.
A right IJ central venous catheter tip resides in the distal superior vena cava.
Since [**2132-3-30**], the patient has been extubated and an orogastric tube removed.
Brief Hospital Course: ======================= BRIEF PATIENT SUMMARY ======================= 64yo F with a history of COPD and sCHF with admitted for several days progressive dyspnea who required intubation on arrival in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ICU stay for COPD flare, then a CCU stay for management of decompensated sCHF; at time of discharge she was breathing comfortably on room air after aggressive diuresis.
Received combivent q4hrs standing 6-8 puffs with albuterol q2h PRN + Prednisone 40mg PO x4 days for a total steroid course of 5 days (final dose [**3-30**]) & azithromycin 500mg PO for a five day total course (final dose 2/26).
This occurred after two doses of carvedilol were held due to borderline low blood pressures in the 90s/40s.
Her mental status progressively worsened and she required intubation for airway protection.
On exam and CXR there appeared to be florid intrapulmonary volume overload, and the etiology of her decompensation was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of tachycardia and poor diastolic cardiac function.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then transferred to the CCU where she was briefly maintained on pressors for post-anesthesia hypotension (complicated by falsely low non-invasive blood pressures, when arterial access was obtained blood pressures were 20mmHg higher than non-invasive estimates).
A lasix drip was re-started at 5cc/hr.
On lasix, carvedilol, lisinopril and digoxin at home.
Required lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis following episode of flash pulmonary edema (discussed above).
Discharged on 60 lasix [**Hospital1 **].
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Cr elevated to 1.8 max; trended down to 1.2-1.3 w/fluid resuscitation, then up again w/diuresis on lasix gtt.
# DYSLIPIDEMIA on simvastatin 80 mg daily at home, changed to pravastatin 80mg.
Thigh cuff pressures correlate better to A-line pressures.
Medications on Admission: -Digoxin 0.125 mg daily -albuterol sulfate -flovent -furosemide 40 mg twice a day -lisinopril 5 mg daily -carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] -simvastatin 80 mg daily -aspirin 81 mg daily.

You went straight to the ICU and were temporarily on a ventilatory for intensive treatment of a combination of a COPD exacerbation and heart failure/fluid retention.
You received steroids, nebulizers, antibiotics, and intravenous diuretics.
By the time you returned to the cardiology service on [**3-31**] you were breathing comfortably without supplemental oxygen or intravenous medications.
We made the following changes to your medications: INCREASED LASIX TO 60 MG (three 20-mg tabs) TWICE DAILY INCREASED CARVEDILOL TO 25 MG TWICE DAILY STOPPED SIMVASTATIN STARTED PRAVASTATIN 80 MG (four 20-mg tabs) DAILY  See below for a list of danger signs that should prompt you to seek urgent medical attention.
