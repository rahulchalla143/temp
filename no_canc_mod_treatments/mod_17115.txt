intubated for airway protection.
In the ICU, he was treated for aspiration pneumonia.
His sedation was weaned and, although slower than expected, his mental status cleared and he was successfully extubated.
His stridor was unresponsive to steroids and racemic epinephrine and he was reintubated (without e/o soft tissue edema per anesthesia) for airway protection.
While intubated it was found that there was no air leak even w/ the cuff down, of note, however, a larger ETT was placed (8.0) for second intubation and it was thought that perhaps the large tube size was preventing air leak rather than true airway edema.
He received racemic epi and solumedrol x1 and his respiratory rate decreased; in this setting his stridor improved.
Pt was transferred on [**2181-1-4**] from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for OR-Rigid bronch, Flex bronch, dilatation (13.2cm), Tumor debridement (granulation tissue) and rigid forceps.

had no clear evidence of respiratory failure and no clear reason for needed airway protection upon intubation at OSH.
By report, he was apparently agitated and was intubated in this setting in order to reduce his dislocated right shoulder.
Per OSH report, intubation was not traumatic.
He was intubated w/ a slightly larger tube (8.0) and was without air leak w/ balloon down suggesting airway edema.
He was started on dexamethasone without clear improvement of edema (still no air leak).
Dexamethasone was continued x 48 hours.
It was thought that perhaps he would not develop an air leak if ET tube was large enough in his airway compared to original tube even if edema was not present.
ICU team evaluated him on the floor and he was transferred to the unit for further studies.
CT neck was obtained which showed severe tracheal stenosis and interventional pulmonology was then consulted.
When mental status cleared, he was able to repsond subjectively regarding pain and denied cervical soft tissue pain, so his c-spine was cleared and collar removed.
# Altered mental status:  Patient remained somnolent and largely unresponsive for nearly 24 hours following wean of fentanyl and propofol and appears to be very sensitive to these medications.
He does have baseline dementia per his daughter's report in the setting of his NPH, but peri sedation, he was much less responsive than his baseline.
Narcotics and other sedating medications were avoided and his mental status began to clear following extubation and wean from sedation.
By hx, he had emesis x1 at OSH prior to intubation so there was concern for possible aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on Levo/flagyl and fever and white count resolved.
Trace protein on admission UA, but negative for protein on subsequent UA.
# CRI:  Basline creatinine from PCP records reveals creatinine of 1.5-1.7.
# Hyperglycemia:  Throughout his stay, he had borderline blood sugars which became  markedly elevated while on steroids (for stridor) into the 180s.
He was placed on HISS and HgbA1C was found to be 6.5.
# Hypernatremia:  Sodium began to climb as his tube feeds had been held for extubation (he had not been getting free water flushes via his OG tube while previously intubated).
