Plan: Admit to Neurology ICU  Neuro: neuro checks, avoid sedation CV: goal MAP<135, on labetolol drip.
She likely lives at a higher mean BP than average, so would also be careful about not running  her pressures too low (goal SBP>110) with concern about compromising cerebral perfusion RESP: monitor sats, pt stable FEN/GI: PO ad lib, protonix ENDO: insulin sliding scale to maximize blood glucose control ID: would send blood cultures x3 to r/o endocarditis, pan culture if spikes.
TOX: urine and serum tox screens, particularly to evaluate for drugs causing hypertension  Pt weaned off of antihypertensive drips overnight of HD #1 and was transferred to the floor on [**10-15**] in stable condition.
She was started on PO lopressor on transfer.
She was begun on bactrim for a mild UTI.
