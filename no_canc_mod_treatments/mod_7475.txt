S/p intubation and extubation.
Pt awoke on the morning of admission with CP, SOB, called EMS who found pt to be in VT. Pt subsequently lost pulse, was given lidocaine 100mg bolus, and was transferred to [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
There he persisted in VT, received amiodarone 300mg bolus, was started on amio drip, intubated for airway protection, had 2 cardioversions, had subsequent PEA, received epi, atropine, also received CaCl, bicarb, D50, insulin, kayexalate for empiric tx of hyperkalemia.
Notably no dialysis during that hospitalization, planned for outpt dialysis.
[**Location (un) 620**] ED attempted a subclavian on left but couldn't threat wire, L femoral line placed instead (has hx right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft).

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 33905**] is a 72 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD who presented with VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest with prolonged resuscitation (CPR > 45min), intubated for airway protection, whose course was complicated by anoxic brain injury.
The patient was treated with cardioversion, initially started on lidocaine, then started on amiodarone to prevent further episodes of VT.
The patient briefly went into atrial fibrillation (although he had no documented history of this in the past), but remained in NSR throughout the remainder of his hospital course, with only occasional APBs and PVCs on telemetry.
BP was maintained with a levophed drip, which was slowly weaned as tolerated.
Volume management was maintained via hemodialysis.
3) CAD w/3 vessel disease:The patient was maintained on ASA and statin given his history of CAD.
But because PE could not be ruled out (as contrast could not be administered through the pt's IV site and the patient?????
?s family did not want to place a central line with a larger lumen for this purpose), patient was started on a heparin drip.
The patient remained intubated for airway protection throughout his hospital stay.
Ventilator settings were weaned as tolerated to FiO2 of 50%.
Subsequent CXR findings (Above) showed evidence of a LLL infiltrate and + sputum stain of GPC on [**6-22**], and the patient was empirically treated for a PNA with vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl.
On hospital day 2 neurology recommended that levo/flagyl be discontinued as these meds could decrease the seizure threshold (see below), and ceftriaxone was started instead.
4) Anoxic brain injury: On hospital day 2, the patient was observed to have twitching of his eyelids and chin.
The patient was started on dilantin and phenobarbitol and was placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
6) FEN: On hospital day 2 tube feeds were started without complication.
7) Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin gtt initially for suspected PE, and was maintained on heparin drip for atrial fibrillation.
Pt also received a PPI, and bowel meds prn for prophylaxis.
?s daughter and health care proxy decided to remove the ventilator and proceed with comfort level of care.
