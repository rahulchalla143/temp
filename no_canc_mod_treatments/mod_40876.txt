A 5Fx5cm pancreatic stent was placed to facilitate the cannulation of CBD.
Given cholangitis, small amount of contrast was injected with opacification of CBD only.
Given the elevated INR, sphincterotomy was deferred.
A 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] pancreatic stent was placed successfully in the CBD.
The PD stent was removed with a snare.
A guidewire was placed into the biliary duct through the stent.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Two stones and debris were extracted successfully using a balloon.
Given her extensive medical history/co-morbidities which included end stage renal disease in conjunction with congestive heart failure, she was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring of her fluid status and further management of her biliary disease.
She was begun on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn prophylactically - dosed for dialysis - and kept NPO.
She was immediately transfused 2 units of FFP and given 5 of Vitamin K+ in an attempt to normalize her elevated INR (9.5 on admission).
The patient was stabilized on antibiotics overnight, and was scheduled for ERCP the following morning.
However at that time her INR remained elevated at 5.6 and she required another 4 units of FFP while on dialysis, in addition to 10 of Vitamin K+ in order to normalize her to an INR of 1.6.
However, due to the patient's elevated INR, no sphincterotomy or stone removal was performed.
Frank pus was noted to be draining from the common bile duct, and post-ERCP it was recommended that the patient remain on IV Zosyn for at least a week.
On hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to ERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and bilirubin continued an upward trend.
As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.
The patient again tolerated the procedure well, and without complications.
As WBC count was not elevated, the patient was initially treated with oral Flagyl alone.
However following two days of increasing numbers of bowel movements despite antibiotics, treatment was upgraded to oral Vancomycin and IV Flagyl.
The patient was stabilized on this regimen with a gradual down-trend in her serum bilirubin levels and a decrease in her diarrhea.
The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin 500mg q24hrs (replaced IV Zosyn) to complete a total of 14 days antibiotics.
As her diarrhea had demonstrated significant improvement and her WBC count remained within normal limits, IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin were discontinued and she was discharged with PO Flagyl 500mg q8hrs.
She will follow-up with her PCP for titration of her Coumadin which had been held for the entirety of her hospital stay.
INR prior to discharge was 1.5  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Known lastname **] in clinic during the week following discharge and re-evaluation of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
