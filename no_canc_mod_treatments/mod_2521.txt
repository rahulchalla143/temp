Nephroureteral stent terminating in the urinary bladder on the left side.
PICC:  IMPRESSION: Left PICC line tip in the upper right atrium, withdrawal by 3 cm recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neuro ICU as she was intubated for airway protection at OSH after receiving multiple benzodiazipines and fosphenytoin load.
ID was consulted and she was started on vanco/ceftriaxone/flagyl (antibx started on [**2197-12-11**]).
She eventually underwent brain biopsy/aspiration of this lesion on [**2197-12-19**] after repeat MRI showed ENLARGING mass; 6cc of pus was drained and sent for cultures/path.
ID recommended discontinuation of the vanco, conversion to PO flagyl, and continuation of IV ceftriaxone for another 6 weeks.
The source of the infection is still not clear, but we suspect it may have come from her renal stones and ureteral stent (foreign body).
UTI was treated with antibiotics as above.
She was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, and required 2 u pRBCs for dropping hct at the beginning of her hospitalization.
Given her family history of early colon cancer, she should have a screening colonscopy at as outpatient.
Started on oral iron replacement.
For her seizure, she was maintained on dilantin.
She was also maintained on decadron for brain edema.
She will be discharged on dilantin and a decadron taper.
