She was put on Keflex PO for 2 days without improvement.
She denied any localizing symptoms, but did endorse anorexia for 5 days.
She was treated initially with doxy/levaquin prior to culture, then with Cefepime which was switched to Imipenem.
On the second day of hospitalization, she developed acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and transfer to the ICU.
She required pressors in the ICU and was extubated 6 days prior to transfer.
She did not require further pressors.
She was found to be confused without focal neurologic deficits and was seen by Neurology who felt supportive care with MRI and possible EEG after stabilization would be indicated.
She had loose stools and a negative C. Diff x1; however, she was empirically started on PO vancomycin.
And finally, she was found to have swelling in her left arm after infiltration of an IV and was found to have a DVT of L cephalic vein.
Given thrombocytopenia, a HIT Ab was drawn which was equivocal and IgM APLA was positive, she was started on an Argatroban drip.

LINE PLACEMENT [**2131-5-5**]    IMPRESSION: PICC line at right SVC/RA junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old woman with PMH significant for HTN, DM type II, PVD, CAD, [**Hospital 9215**] transferred from OSH for continued management of hypertension, resolving sepsis, [**Last Name (un) **], afib with RVR and diarrhea.
Pt had been off of pressors and had been extubated for several days prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient was continued on cefepime for pseudomonal coverage and has completed 13/14 days of IV Cefepime by the time of discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] to acute rehab.
Due to the fact that her course of antibiotics was nearing completion by the time culture data was available, it was decided to complete the entire coures on Cefepime.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure Pt noted to have episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Pt found to have acute decompensated [**Hospital 9215**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-7**] which responded well to Lasix 40 iv x 1.
Pt was subsequently started on oral lasix which was uptitated to Lasix 60 mg po BID by the time of discharge, due to ongoing pulmonary bibasilar rales and mild oxygen requirement.
The lasix dose will need to be titrated on an ongoing basis, and her weight should be followed, as she is incontent of urine.
C. Diff negative x1 but started empirically on PO vanco at [**Hospital1 1562**] and Flexiseal was placed.
Repeat C.diff was negative at [**Hospital1 18**], so metronidazole and oral vancomycin were discontinued.
ACE inhibitor was held for acute kidney injury, and remains held at this time.
If her blood pressure is too low to tolerate an additional blood pressure medication at that time, consider discontinuation of clonidine.
She is being anticoagulated for DVT with heparin gtt bridge to warfarin, but it is not clear if she had documented atrial fibrillation prior to this admission.
Warfarin dosing: pt has been given warfarin 5 mg po q 1600 [**Date range (1) 83456**].
Please see results section for corresponding INR values for past several days.
The patient was given multiple hypotonic fluid infusions to bring her serum [Na+] down.
Patient was on argatroban from tranfer from [**Hospital1 1562**].
Argatroban was discontinued upon arrival, and the patient was restarted on heparin gttinstead.
# Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2: Fingersticks were checked and glucose was controlled with insulin sliding scale.
Pt was started on Lantus 8 units q HS on [**5-9**], and will need further titration as needed.
On lopressor, lasix, amlodipine, catapres and lisinopril at home.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], lopressor was held given reported digoxin toxicity with junctional bradycardia.
Lisinopril was held given [**Last Name (un) **].
Her clonidine and amlodipine were continued, and she was started on carvedilol.
She was started on warfarin, and INR at time of transfer to rehab was 1.9.
She should continue heparin gtt until INR is [**1-17**] x at least 48 hours.
# Digoxin toxicity: Pt reportedly had digoxin toxicity at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital prior to transfer.
Creatinine continued to improve throughout the hospitalization, and was 1.6 at the time of dishcarge.
