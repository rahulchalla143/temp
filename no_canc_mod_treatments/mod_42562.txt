Increased LV filling pressure moderate LV diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Respiratory distress: Received vancomycin and cefepime in the ER, but these were held as she had no WBC elevation, fever, or cough to suggest pneumonia.
She initially was hypercarbic and required BiPAP in the ICU, although was quickly weaned.
Rapid improvement was noted with IV furosemide.
However, she redeveloped respiratory distress with SBP of 205, and was again treated with BiPAP and IV furosemide with good response.
She subsequently was stable on nasal cannula and transitioned to PO furosemide 20mg daily.
She was also continued on her outpatient tiotropium and fluticasone for COPD.
2) Hypertension: She was initially treated with her home medications and prn hydralazine.
Her hydralazine was changed from q12 to q6, nifedipine held for low HR, and lisinopril started and increased to 10mg daily.
She may need further uptitration of these meds as an outpatient.
3) UTI: Treated empirically with a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for a floridly positive UA and history of sensitive E coli.
Her home meds were continued with the hydralazine change and new ACE-I as noted above.
5) ARF: Baseline creatinine ~1.0-1.2.
Anion gap as low as 1 was unusual in setting of minimally low albumin, normal Ca Mg Phos, although further workup was deferred based on goals of care discussion below.
