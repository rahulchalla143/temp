He showed some signs of depression and was started (and maintained) on Paxil his pain through the admission was controlled with morphine, fentanyl, Percocet Patient develop tremors in his arms and head, for which neurology consult was obtained and felt that it is an essential tremor, which does not need any treatment at this time Now: patient is alert, oriented to self and place, does not have pain, does not require any sedation, still has tremor  Cardiovascular: through out patient admission he remained in atrial fibrillation, with heart rate 80-100, controlled with Lopressor, blood pressure stable, His repeated echocardiogram showed stable EF of 55%, mild CHF and mild left ventricular outflow obstruction.
[**6-22**] - patient developed LUE DVT associated with catheter, catheter was removed  Respiratory: patient had BiPAP requiring sleep apnea at the base line.
By the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] he had prolong intubation course, with a few attempts for extubation which failed, eventually requiring tracheostomy (performed at the OSH).
He had persistent pleural effusion  left more then right, requiring tube thoracostomy, pleurocentesis, thoracic surgery consult.
As patient condition improved, although he still has small bilateral pleural effusions, they are stable and do not require other interventions.
Had a few bouts of ventilator associated and aspiration pneumonia with proteus, klebsiella, Xanthomonas, yeast which are now controlled (please see ID section), had a number of bronchoscopy for evaluation and diagnosis.
Patient has been evaluated by speech and swallow service a few times, however failed attempts to Passy-Mur valve placement Now: patient is stable on CPAP, bilateral rhonchi and wheezing.
Tracheostomy tube has positional leak (not influencing his resp condition).
receiving recruitment breaths q6hours.
growing GNR from sputum culture, treated with meropenem  Gastrointestinal: after admission patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with cyst gastrostomy, G, J and cholecystostomy tube placement, please see operative note for details.
Patient tolerated procedure well, with prompt return of bowel function.
His tube feedings were started through jejunostomy tube.
His cholecystostomy tube was repositioned by OR.
On [**7-14**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an rising WBC to 16.8, continued low-grade fevers, rigors, and tachycardic into 140s in atrial fibrillation with systolic BP dropping as low as 70.
Because the cholecystostomy tube had not drained throughout the day, a T-tube study was performed to evaluate the position of the cholecystostomy tube.
This study showed contrast extravasation from the indwelling cholecystostomy tube near its insertion.
where a cholecystectomy, abdominal washout, replacement of the G-tube, left tube thoracostomy, and liver biopsy were all performed.
On [**7-15**], given his rising Tbili to 4.9, an ERCP was performed and a biliary stent was successfully placed in the common bile duct.
follow up ERCP and EGD showed satisfactory position of the biliary drain [**2207-9-14**] patient again developed increase of the G-tube output with feculent looking material, evidence of aspiration with succus from the ET tube suctioned,respiratory distress, septic physiology.
Patient g-tube was pulled back to the area of the cyst, which seem to control patient's output.
[**10-9**] - patient developed increased G tube output, he underwent g-tube study which showed well formed tract between colon and stomach(former area of pancreatic cyst, now almost completely obliterated) and g-tube advance too far into the colon.
the tube was pulled back which mildly decrease its output.
J tube in place.
Now: patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, j tube in place, tolerating tube feeds, G-tube in place output [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34966**] cc/day intermittently guac positive, no drainage around the tube.
There was a suspicion of portal hypertension, causing persistent ascites (s/p paracentesis x3), however portal vein pressure studies showed normal pressures.
The conclusions of the team were that it was due partially due to supplemental nutrition, partially due to patient's severe medical problems.
his liver enzymes normalized, patient is stable and does not require further interventions  Renal/Urology: through out patient admission, patient renal function remained stable, Patient required multiple doses of Lasix and Diamox to help with perioperative diuresis and heart failure.
He does remain very sensitive to dehydration with prompt decrease in urine output as well and increase in BUN.
He had problems with phimosis requiring urology consult for Foley placement.
Endocrine: patient has been maintained on NPH insulin in addition to regular insulin sliding scale.
No active concerns or issues  Hematology: patient has anemia of chronic disease, as well as procedure associated anemia, requiring multiple blood transfusions.
He is maintained on epoetin, iron and folate supplements.
No evidence of coagulopathy  ID: Patient had a few episodes of septic etiology, associated with pneumonia as well as an episode of cholecystostomy tube dislodgement.
His antibiotic regiment was tailored to sensitivities, and he was on different occasion has been treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl, Unasyn, Bactrim, fluconazole, meropenem, Kefzol.
awaiting sensitivities  Nutrition/FEN:  patient arrived here on TPN, was switched to Tube feedings through feeding jejunostomy.
His nutritional profile showed signs of malnutrition with albumin in 2.4-2.6 range.
He also had multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hyperchloremia which normalized with switching to Respalor.
he does respond to free water boluses though J-tube Now: patient is on Respalor 2/3 strength @110 cc/hr, receiving 124 of protein and 2600 kcal per day.
