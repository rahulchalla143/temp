Successful balloon angioplasty of distal in-stent restenosis.
Employment of investigational PROXIS proximal embolic protection.
Low density foci in both kidneys, with very limited evaluation using this technique.
Native RCA stents were patent.
This necessitated initiation of milrinone for ionotropic therapy, nitroglycerine and IV lasix for elevated filling pressures and pulmonary edema as well as insertion of IABP to unload the left ventricle.
Successful placement of 3.5 x 18 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent in SVG-OM2 as well as balloon inflation of the native OM2 using a 2.0 mm balloon.
Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in SVG-OM2.
Successful balloon angioplasty of native OM2 distal to touchdown.

He was taken for catheterization for NSTEMI, found to have severe pulmonary hypertension, and an occluded saphenous vein graft to OM2 that was successfully stented with a cypher drug eluding stent.
This necessitated initiation of milrinone for ionotropic therapy, nitroglycerine and IV lasix for elevated filling pressures and pulmonary edema as well as insertion of IABP to unload the left ventricle.
A swan ganz catheter was also placed at that time.
He was continued on ASA, plavix and atorvastatin.
Tried to slowly wean Milrinone drip down based on CI.
Hydralazine was introduced into his regimen to help decrease afterload and patient was diuresed.
Patient was continued on milrinone drip and digoxin was introduced into his regimen.
Captopril was also introduced into his regimen to help decrease afterload.
Patient was finally weaned off milrinone on [**2114-7-23**] when CI 2.1-2.7 and swan ganz catheter was removed.
A beta blocker was started prior to discharge.
Of note, while in the hospital a transplant work-up was intiated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] because of the need for frequent coronary intervention.
Was started on an IABP and milrinone for ionotropy and afterload reduction.
Milrinone and IABP were weaned off as described above.
Heparin and coumadin were started b/c pt was found to have LV hypokinesis and EF 20-30 % by echo and this was worrisome for clot formation.
He was discharged home on enalapril, lasix, digoxin, metoprolol and coumadin.
Rhythm - Remained with an a-sensed, Vpaced rhythm and an AICD in place.
INR was elevated to 4.6 on [**7-20**] and was reversed with vitamin K.  However, the team did not want the INR below 2 while the patient was on IABP.
Hemoptysis resolved over the course of admission and hct was stable.
Creatinine trended down during the admission and patient was continued on his ACEI and lasix.
FEN: Diet was a heart healthy low sodium diet and repleted electrolytes PRN to keep Mg>2 and K>4 .
