Liver disease:  The patient was clearly in decompensated liver disease and had radiographic evidence of hepatoma as a complication of end-stage cirrhotic liver.
The Liver Service was consulted for help with management with this patient.
They recommended lactulose and ursodiol as well as albumin postparacentesis.
They continued to follow the patient, and given the patient's extremely high bilirubin and mental status which was not improving with daily lactulose 3x a day as well as evidence of a severe coagulopathy, they recommended comfort measures only.
In addition, as the patient remained on the floor with supportive measures, it was also approached with the brother whether or not comfort measures should be taken for this patient including removal of the nasogastric tube.
The nasogastric tube was pulled and only Morphine and Artificial Tears remained on the patient's medication record for comfort only.
The patient passed away shortly after making him comfort measures only.
