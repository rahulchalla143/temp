Intrapartum course was notable for adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, fetal tachycardia, and failure to progress during labor.
An IV was placed and phenobarbital given, with eventual cessation of the seizure after 10-15 minutes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY STATUS: Shortly after admission, the infant did require low-flow nasal cannula oxygen due to mild desaturations, thought to be due to mild hypoventilation following the seizures and phenobarbital therapy.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION: The infant was initially maintained on IVF following admission, but by day of life 2, with stable overall status, was begun on ad lib feeding of Isomil (family request).
At the time of discharge, she is feeding well on an ad lib schedule with normal urine and stool output.
Of note, blood chemistries including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous, and blood glucose were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and these were all normal.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initial liver function tests were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and were mildly elevated with values of:  ALT 419, AST 390, alkaline phosphatase 120, bilirubin 4.1/0.2.
Follow-up LFTs were improved on [**2181-5-25**] with values of ALT 386, AST 229, alkaline phosphatase 114, and bilirubin 6.2/0.3.
She has not received any blood product transfusion during her NICU stay.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: She was started on ampicillin and gentamicin and acyclovir at the time of admission for concerns of sepsis risk factors and etiology of seizure activity.
Her cerebral spinal fluid was sent for herpes PCR which was also negative.
Her acyclovir was then discontinued on [**2181-5-26**] and her antibiotics were discontinued on [**2181-5-25**].
NEUROLOGIC: On admission, [**Doctor First Name **] was given a total of 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital, and then begun on maintenance therapy of 5 mg/kg/day.
An extensive evaluation for the etiology of the seizures was performed in consultation with the Neurology service from [**Hospital3 1810**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Also sent and pending at discharge are urine organic acids, CSF amino and organic acids, and CSF lactate and pyruvate.
Her medication is phenobarbital 14 mg p.o.
She received her hepatitis B vaccine on [**2181-5-26**].
Tests pending at discharge include urine organic acids, repeat serum amino acids, and CSF amino and organic acids and CSF lactate and pyruvate.
