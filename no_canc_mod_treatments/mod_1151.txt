Abdomen: Soft, non-tender and non-distended.
She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for pneumonia (gram + cocci in sputum) in addition to Flagyl for history of C dif.
Levo was later changed to ciprofloxacin when pseudomonas was isolated in her sputum; similarly vancomycin was switched to nafcillin when the GPC isolated was speciated as MSSA.
Albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids were given for COPD exacerbation.
Her worsening respiratory acidosis required intubation on the second hospital day.
She remained intubated for approx three days, at which time she was extubated to BiPAP without complication.
She was transferred to the floor with stable oxygen saturations and respiratory status on oxygen by nasal cannula ...  # Atrial fibrillation / supraventricular tachycardia She was noted to have irregular rate tachycardia to 160s two days after extubation.
She was started on IV Lopressor and converted back into sinus.
Due to hypotension, metoprolol was stopped ...  # Pneumothorax This was a complication of placing a left IJ as the patient abruptly sat partway up during procedure.
A pigtail catheter was placed by interventional pulmonary service with good decompression.
When CXR showed resolution of pneumothorax, the chest tube was placed to water seal.
# History of C dificile While she was treated with cipro and nafcillin as above, she was also treated with IV Flagyl for history of C dif.
The Flagyl should be continued for two weeks after stopping cipro/nafcillin (on [**6-19**]).

We continued her home aspirin and statin.
# History of congestive heart failure As above, her home statin and aspirin were continued.
