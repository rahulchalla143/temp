Patient started on heparin gtt and transitioned to Coumadin.
Coumadin was stopped and restarted this week.
Last INR documented in OSH records is INR 4 on [**2-12**] and Coumadin held again.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Junctional bradycardia on nodal agents, tachyarrhythmia off, s/p pacemaker Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - per Dr.[**Name (NI) 8996**] notes, she had declined warfarin and was supposed to be taking an aspirin daily, although it's not clear that this was the case.
-Coordination: reaches for obj on left with no tremor.
IMPRESSION: Large hemorrhagic transformation on a prior ischemic area involving the left MCA vascular territory, associated with vasogenic edema, effacement of the sulci, and midline shifting as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo RH female with ho HTN, DMII, Afib  recently admitted to Stroke Service at [**Hospital1 18**] for left MCA infarct and started on Coumadin now presents with large ICH in infarction site.
1) Left MCA hemorrhagic transformation- Likely etiology was supratherapeutic levels of coumadin at outside hospital, reported by son to have [**Name (NI) 62023**] as high as [**5-12**].
She was continued on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
2) Lower extremity cellulitis and Enterococcus bacteremia: She completed her 4-week course of ampicillin and gentamicin on [**2-21**] and her PICC Line should be discontinued.
She was hypertensive and hyperglycemic so her antihypertensives (Lisinopril initially 20 but decreased to 10 due to BP dip, Metoprolol 37.5 TID, Lasix 40) and Metformin were restarted.
We recommend that she be restarted on her Coumadin 14 days after the hemorrhage which occurred [**2-14**], without Heparin bridge, but this should be done at conservative doses and with frequent INR monitoring.
She is also on Hep 5000 U SC TID for DVT prophylaxis while not anticoagulated.
