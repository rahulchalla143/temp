ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-14**]  2:33:46 PM Atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with left bundle-branch block pattern.
The patient's dyspnea improved on an non-rebreather mask.
Given his volume overloaded status, the patient underwent urgent hemodialysis with marked improvement on exam as well as his oxygen requirements.
He was discharged home with a plan for home VNA/PT/OT services as well as home oxygen.
The patient was previously scheduled for pacemaker placement with AV nodal ablation prior to his admission.
Given the patient's CHF symptoms, however, it was felt that the patient would benefit from undergoing the procedure earlier than planned.
The patient's home Coumadin regimen was held to prepare for the procedure and the patient underwent the ablation and pacer implantation without complications on [**7-13**].
Amiodarone was discontinued.
According to the patient, he was not taking anti-hypertensives at home due to significant drug side effects.
He was initially started on a Nitro drip for blood pressure control, but this was discontinued following dialysis, which resolved his volume status issues and returned the patient to a normotensive state 130's/50's.
# ESRD on HD:  The patient initially underwent several rounds of dialysis within the first 3 days of admission after which he resumed his normal 3 day per week hemodialysis schedule.
The patient was maintained on his home doses of phoslo, sevelemar, and nephrocaps.
He was noted to have a mild leukocytosis with neutrophil predominate.
