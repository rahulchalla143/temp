She was intubated for airway protection but vomited just prior to intubation so was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for concern of an aspiration pneumonia.

[**9-18**] CXR: The endotracheal tube is close to the carina main stem should be retracted.
A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.
[**9-18**] Abdominal U/S: Shrunken echogenic nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
[**9-19**] Abd XR: NG tube is in fundus of stomach.
Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach, displacing the left upper quadrant, perhaps by splenomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year old woman with HCV cirrhosis admitted for obtundation and intubated for airway protection.
The patient was intubated for airway protection and she was treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
Her mental status improved with lactulose treatment.
Ciprofloxacin was started for SBP prophylaxis in the context of ascites fluid with total protein <1 as well as GI bleed.
# Intubation: At the time of admission, the patient was intubated for airway protection.
However, there was no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and the patient remained afebrile and with a normal WBC count, so antibiotics were not continued.
Haptoglobin was low, but this is difficult to interpret in ESLD.
LDH remained high/normal, so this was considered an indication that hemolysis was less likely.
Hematocrit remained stable until the time of discharge and no further transfusion was required.
# Anemia: Likely secondary to blood loss from GI bleed/ooze and likely at least partly dilutional due to IV hydration.
Pantoprazole, lactulose, nadolol, lasix, and spironolactone were all continued.
A large volume paracentesis was done, with 4.4L of ascites removed.
She was unable to receive albumin after the procedure, again because her IV access had been lost.
Ciprofloxacin was started for SBP prophylaxis as the total protein was <1 in peritoneal fluid.
She underwent EGD with 3 bands placed to esophageal varices.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] discussed with the patient that she is not a candidate to transplant for various reasons, including likely lack of followup as she plans to return to the [**Country 13622**] Republic.
# ARF: The patient's creatinine was mildly increased at 1.4 on admission.
Creatinine improved with fluids and did not worsen again during this hospital course.
Urine output did not initially improve as much as the BP and creatinine did with fluids, but eventually it did recover as well, particularly after transfusions of PRBC were given (as above), which helped to replete intravascular volume status.
# Diarrhea: The patient had stable diarrhea that was most likely secondary to use of lactulose to treat and prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient received one transfusion of platelets prior to EGD.
