Admission Date:  [**2120-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-12-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors / Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 54-year-old woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation, COPD on home CPAP with multiple hospital admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA, panhypopituitarism, pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF, ASD with shunting presented with weakness and was found to be hypoxic.
Was given atropine with reportedly no response.
She was started on dopamine 10 mg/hr and intubated fiberoptically.
Got 2L of NS, vanco 1gm, pip-tazo 4.5 gm, solumedrol 125 mg.   Past Medical History: 1)Obstructive Sleep Apnea on home CPAP, 16cm H20 2)Obesity Hypoventilation - Multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure; PFT's  consistent with a restrictive defect - PFTs: FVC 39%, FEV1 37%, FEV1/FVC 96%, TLC 59%, DLCO reduced 3)ASD with right-left shunt (12% shunt fraction documented in nuclear study from [**2116-3-30**]) 4)Pulmonary artery hypertension: Echo in [**10/2118**] demonstrated a  TR gradient of 33mmHg ??????
followed by [**Location (un) 4507**] 5)Hypertension 6)Pan-hypopituitarism with partially empty sella on desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone ??????
The endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.
Nasogastric tube courses towards the stomach but the tip is not seen.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
She was maintained on a 100% NRB and CPAP while in the ED.
Due to desaturation to 76% with respiratory rate = of 33 and findings of hypercarbia to pCO2 76, the patient was intubated by fiberoptic bronchoscope.
She received vancomycin, zosyn for a possible pulmonary infiltrate and pulse dose solumedrol out of concern for a COPD exacerbation.
UA was noteworthy only for some blood in the setting of foley placement and blood and urine cultures were sent and without significant growth.
The patient had received 2L NS and diuretics were held in the setting of hypotension (see below).
The most likely explanation (as described in a note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] for her decompensation was hypoxemia prior to admission causing worsening pulmonary hypertension and RV pressure increase causing interventricular septal deviation and compromised LV function.
Due to the profound, life-threatening and recurrent nature of [**Last Name **] problem she was evaluated by thoracic surgery team for consideration of surgical tracheostomy.
The patient was scheduled for short-term outpatient pulm follow-up for further evaluation of her problems and for further consideration on the utility of a trach.
The patient received atropine and was transiently on a dopamine drip while in the ED.
Out of concern for pulmonary or other source of sepsis, the patient received doses of vancomycin and zosyn though these treatments were not continued after the first 2 days of hospitalization.
Another possibility and most likely is that the patient lives in a preload dependent state that was compromised by BiPAP treatment causing underfilling and significant decline in cardiac output.
There are no signs that this was due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency though the patient did transiently receive treatment for both of these potential etiologies.
The patient was discharged back on her home meds except clonidine and valsartan which were held throughout the hospitalization.
The patient maintained good blood pressure control off of these agents.
She was told to discuss restarting these medications with her primary care doctor.
She did not have signs of obvious volume overload and improved with holding diuretics and volume rescucitation for unclear reasons.
Prior to discharge, the patient was restarted on maintenance diuretic dosing.
This rapidly improved to 1.4 with optimization of the patient's fluid status.
UA was noteworthy for RBC's in the setting of foley placement.
The patient continued on treatment for panhypopituitarism with steroids (initially stress dose, then maintenance), levothyroxine and desmopressin.
