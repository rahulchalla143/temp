[**Name (NI) **] has a history of colitis (deemed ulcerative colitis), diagnosed in [**2146-1-12**] after having bout of diarrhea at that time, per report, diagnosed by colonoscopy (see below in PMH).
At that time, was treated with prednisone with improvment in symptoms.
This required NGT placement and rectal tube placement.
The patient was started on solumedrol, questran, and made NPO and started on TPN.
Stool studies for c diff have been negative multiple times, but he was also started on IV flagyl.
His symptoms improved with these measures and the NGT/rectal tube per report had a lot of drainage, and after a couple of days he had his NGT and rectal tube removed.
Past Medical History: - Colitis, ?UC, diagnosed in [**1-18**] with colonoscopy (by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40066**]) after presenting with diarrhea.
Following colonoscopy in [**1-18**], pt was treated with prednisone at that time with improvement of symptoms.
- Non-small cell lung cancer s/p left upper lobe lobectomy in [**10-19**], clean margins - CAD s/p MI and LAD stent in 10/97 at [**Hospital1 2025**] - Hypothyroid - Tobacco use - Possible history of pancreatitis - H/o prostate ca s/p removal (?)
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 96.5, HR 77, BP 112/78, RR 22, O2 96% RA General - Patient is an ill appearing man, no acute distress ENT - moist mucous membranes CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g Lungs - CTA b/l Abd - slightly distended, soft, midline scar noted (per patient from prostate removal for prostate ca), non-tender to palpation, hyperactive bowel sounds Ext - 3+ lower extremity edema, doughy texture   Pertinent Results: OSH labs: Na 137, K 4.2, Cl 110, CO2 20, Ca 7.7, Phos 3.2, TG 116, Mg 2.3, BUN 37, Cr 0.7 WBC 10.4, Hct 29.4, Plt 335 Somatostatin 18 TTG IgG 1.4, tissue trans 0.7 Gastrin 52 .
Findings consistent with ulcerative colitis, of indeterminate chronicity.
Sub-millimeter hypodensities in the liver, too small to accurately characterize.
In this patient with history of prostate cancer, correlation with bone scan would be recommended in the absence of prior study to establish stability.
Sclerotic and lucent lesions in the vertebral bodies in this patient with history of prostate cancer, correlation with bone scan is recommended for further followup.
Colonoscopy [**11-25**]: DIAGNOSIS: Rectum: Chronic active colitis with ulceration; no granulomas or dysplasia are identified.
================== [**2146-11-27**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
Continued followup recommended to assess for interval changes.
Opacification in the left lower lung could be atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 74 year old man with history of CAD, NSCLC, who presents with evidence of chronic diarrhea/colitis, transferred from outside hospital after worsening of symptoms after lobectomy (for NSCLC).
Colitis/Diarrhea: On transfer here, patient was initially maintained on solumedrol (for ?ulcerative colitis flare), IV flagyl (for ?c diff colitis, ruled out by c.diff toxin x3 negative), and GI was consulted and involved throughout his hospital course.
He therefore underwent a sigmoidoscopy for further evaluation that demonstrated very friable erythematous mucosa consistent with colitis.
He continued on bowel rest and IV solumedrol until [**2146-12-1**], when repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy showed worsened friable mucosa and colitis.
Cyclosprine was initiated at that time at 1.5mg/kg/day divided in two doses and then discontinued and steroids were decreased.
At that time the patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and we discussed the difficulty of resusitating him and necessity of pressors and large volume transfusion.
ARDS/Hypoxia: Pt had increasing O2 requirement and on HD 3 required transfer to ICU.
On [**12-8**] the patient had a witnessed aspiration and required intubation on [**12-10**] for tachypnea.
The patient was managed with IV antibiotics, but the patient's poor pulmonary status persisted.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was started on caspofungin for treatment of his fungal infection.
The patient was started on coumadin but this was discontinued in the setting of his continued GI blood loss.
Once stable, he was started on heparin, but noted to have low platelet count and transitioned to argatroban for possible HIT.
Pt was started on wound care, turn q2, nutrition, on vitamin C and zinc TPN at 75cc/hr.
Hypothyroid: continue synthroid  6.
Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction: During the hospital course he was kept on ASA 81 and beta-blocker when he tolerated it.
The GI team was consulted and felt that the patient required immediate surgical intervention.
The surgery team evaluated the patient and found that the patient was too unstable and ill to undergo surgical intervention.
