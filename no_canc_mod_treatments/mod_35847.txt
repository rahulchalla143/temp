At baseline, the patient has moderate amount of yellow sputum and is on 2.5 L oxygen via home NC with typical oxygen saturations ranging from 95-96%.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were: Temperature of 101.6F, HR 80, SBP 130s, and oxygen saturations were in the low 90's on 4L NC and remained in low 90s with higher rates on non-rebreather mask.
She was given nebulizer treatments with little effect.
IV Vancomycin and Levofloxacin were also initiated in the emergency room soon after her arrival.
Fortunately, she did not require intubation but she was started on non-invasive ventilation.
She was mostly normotensive with a few drops of SBP into the high 80s but she did not require any pressors.
Urine legionella testing was sent off as well and she was continued on her Levofloxacin coverage at time of her transfer to the general medical floor until urine legionella results returned.
Vancomycin was discontinued at time of transfer out of MICU.
While in the MICU she also underwent daily chest PT and received ongoing nebulizer treatments.
Upon arrival to the general medical floor she had been successfully weaned down to 4-5L on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation levels of 93%-95%.
She was continued on her usual Coumadin therapy for her atrial fibrillation and tricuspid valve replacement but she had to hold her Coumadin for a few evenings due to a high INR.

At time of her transfer out of the MICU she had been waened to 4-5L on nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s.
She progressed steadily and her shortness of breath improved throughout her hospital course with ongoing antibiotics and resolution of her PNA and additional albuterol nebulizers and chest PT.
Her ipatropium regimen was changed to tiotropium and advair was continued.
By time of discharge she was back at her baseline of 2.5 L nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the high 90s.
Per records, her last recorded sputum had grown out GNR (non-pseudomonas) sensitive to Ceftazidime, Levofloxacin, Meropenem, and Zosyn.
Given these sensitivity patterns and her significant underlying lung pathology with bronchiectasis she was continued on Levofloxacin initally for coverage for atypicals/Legionalla PNA but once urine legionella returned negative the levofloxacin was discontinued.
She was continued on broad coverage with Doripenem and switched to Meropenem just prior to discharge.
A PICC line was placed and home services were arranged to help Mrs. [**Known lastname **] administer her antibiotics as an outpatient until [**2137-10-28**] when she will complete a full 14 days of antibiotics.
She continued her chest PT and spirometry at the bedside and she was given daily mucinex, nebulizers alongside her antibiotics and her cough and phlegm production gradually improved.
She was continued on her Albuterol Nebs, Advair, and Mucinex twice daily.
The patient was encouraged to continue her home inhalers, and ongoing chest PT as an outpatient as she is predisposed to PNAs from her baseline bronchiectasis.
During her hospital course she was continued on Furosemide at 20mg dose with eventual taper to her home dose of 10mg daily.
She was also continued on Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily and Spironolactone daily.
# Atrial fibrillation: She was placed on continuous telemetry monitoring and several EKGs were assessed as well.
Anticoagulation was continued with Coumadin with her INR goal kept at 2.0 because of her extensive bronchiectasis.
Coumadin dose was held for a few days due to a brief period of time while her INR was supratherapeutic but it was restarted prior to discharge with instructions for her home services nurses to draw her blood on Wednesday [**10-23**] and have her  INR/PT levels sent to the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at [**Company 191**] in order to make sure her Coumadin level was within a proper range.
# Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her usual daily dose of 20mg Simvastatin for her hypercholesterolemia management.
She was maintained on her usual home Citalopram 20 mg daily and Lorazepam 1.0 mg QHS as needed.
# Prophylaxis Issues: She was continued on Coumadin for anticoagulation which also provided DVT prevention as well, protonix was given for GI protection and Senna and Colace to promote stool regularity.
