There was evidence of ataxia and dysmetria on finger-to-nose bilaterally, but heel-knee-shin was intact bilaterally.
A drop in her hemaglobin and hematocrit was believed to be due to hemodilution, given IV fluid resuscitation and the drop in counts of all cellular elements toward her baseline values on previous admissions; there was no evidence of bleeding.
In addition, keppra was started so that the patient could transition to keppra monotherapy once at a therapeutic dose: i.e., once Keppra has been at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for two days, dilantin may be tapered off by 100 mg per day (see discharge instructions).
If Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] is too sedating, this may be lowered to 1250 [**Hospital1 **] or 1000 [**Hospital1 **].
The patient should remain on anti-epileptic medication for at least 1 year given the occurrence of her seizures off dilantin.
She remained stable on her new regimen with no complications and was discharged to rehab.
