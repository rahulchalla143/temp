HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post intubation on [**2188-4-4**] and coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital6 256**] with hypoxia and hypercarbia requiring intubation, as well as hypotension requiring pressors.
The patient presented several times this year to the Emergency Department for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, only once requiring intubation ([**4-5**]).
The patient usually responds well to steroids, antibiotics and bronchodilators.
On the night prior to admission, the patient became very short of breath without relief from his albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
EMS arrived on the scene and his O2 saturation was 70%.
In the Emergency Department, his O2 saturation was 84% on nonrebreather with respiratory rate equal to 44.
Patient was given albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers treatment, as well as Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenous times one, Fentanyl, and 750 cc of normal saline intravenously in the Emergency Department.
His electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block which was intermittently seen on prior electrocardiograms during his [**2188-4-4**] admission.
Coronary artery disease - ejection fraction equal to 55% in [**2188-4-4**], 1+ mitral regurgitation, hypokinetic basal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall on stress echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization showed 40% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending, 40% occlusion of the mid circumflex, 20% occlusion of the left main with a normal proximal left anterior descending and normal septal branches.
Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
Levoxyl 125 mcg q.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Folate 1 mg po q.d.
Paxil 20 mg po q.d.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes edema.
Oxygen saturation was 100% on assist control with FIO2 of 60%, total volume 600 and rate of 12.
The patient rapidly responded to positive pressure ventilation and PEEP, however, remaining tachycardiac while maintaining stable blood pressure after being weaned from all pressors.
He was found to be prerenal as per FeNA calculation 0.11% and the patient received D5 normal saline at 150 cc an hour for a low urine output on [**9-24**], which is about 20 cc per hour throughout the day.
The patient was begun on a prednisone taper at 60 mg q.d.
He received intravenous steroids while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was transitioned to prednisone when transferred to the regular medicine floor.
The patient was begun on Singulair 10 mg po q.d.
His MDI regimen was restarted with Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Flovent 4 puffs b.i.d., Atrovent 4 puffs q.i.d.
and albuterol only 1-2 puffs q.
The patient should not use albuterol nebulizers as he gets anginal symptoms and tachycardic secondary to those nebulizers and likely becomes ischemic due to demand.
The patient's lipid profile looks good, therefore, there is no need to start a statin for his cholesterol level.
The patient continued on his aspirin.
Possibly consider beginning a calcium channel blocker as an outpatient, as the patient's blood pressure tolerates.
The patient has never been on a cardiac regimen at all, so possibly consider Cardiology Consult as an outpatient.
Endocrine:  The patient was begun on a regular insulin sliding scale due to the steroid taper.
The patient will be discharged on Levoxyl 100 mcg po q.d.
The patient had been taking Paxil 20 mg po q.d.
The patient was restarted on Paxil during his stay.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d.
for a ten day course for treatment of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation/bronchitis.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
Singulair 10 mg one tablet po q.d.
