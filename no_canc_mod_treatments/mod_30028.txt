Percutaneous Gastric Jeujonstomy Tube Placement   History of Present Illness: Patient is difficult to obtain history from and therefore most was obtained from chart, partner, and [**Name (NI) **] notes.
He received ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
The shaking was thought to be due to fever and rigor and not seizure activity.
Patient treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir empirically while the cultures were pending, but those were stopped.
Patient denied HA, vision changes, nausea, chest pain, shorntess of breath, abdominal pain.

Laboratory Results: [**2155-8-22**] 04:31a Source: Line-PICC Sodium 133 Chloride 103 BUN  18 Glucose 83   AGap=13 Potassium 4.3 HCO3 21 Crt 1.8 Ca: 9.9 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.2  Source: Line-PICC  WBC 4.1  Hemoglobin 8.5 Platelets 131 HCT  24.5   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old man with HIV/AIDs (CD4 count 34) who presented to the emergency room with fevers and change in mental status, with imaging and microbiology results most consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis.
He was started on intravenous Bactrim in the MICU but was switched to oral Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine once nasogastric tube was placed due to concern over rising creatinine and worsening renal function.
Throughout the hospital stay, the patient pulled out his nastrogastric tube several times and would spit up or vomit medications; therefore, treatment was changed from oral Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine to IV Bactrim several times depending on his renal function and ability to tolerate oral intake.
Consistent therapy was initiated [**2155-8-15**] with IV Bactrim, with stable creatinine, and was switched to PO Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine, with leucovorin calcium, on [**2155-8-21**] once GJ-tube was placed.
The patient is now on day 8 of consistent treatment for toxoplasmosis, and should complete a total of 14 days.
A repeat image of his brain after completing treatment for toxoplasmosis will be helpful to futher evaluate this, and has been scheduled for [**2155-9-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] in the Clinical Center of the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] at 7am in the basement.
The imaging showed new lesions, however it was felt that this was not yet a failure of treatment for his toxoplasmosis, given he had not consistently been getting medications.
Seizure prophylaxis was continued with Keppra.
The patient was started on IV ambisome, but therapy was switched to Fluconazole after the patient's renal function worsened.
The patient remained on Fluconazole throughout the hospital stay, and should continue until advised to stop by infectious disease doctors an [**Name5 (PTitle) **] outpatient.
These medications were stopped partway through the hospital course because of increasing creatinine and inability to administer PO medications consistently ([**1-10**] patient refusal or vomiting).
* His creatinine should be monitored closely, every one to two days, now that his HAART medications have been restarted.
Patient also has been receiving [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis weekly on Wednesdays with azithromycin 1200 mg. .
Blood pressure Patient was continued on medications for his hypertension, and has been titrated up to 100mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], now that he can reliably get PO medications.
He may need further titration of his medication or additional [**Doctor Last Name 360**], such as amlodipine.
He was kept on a sliding scale of insulin, however may need a baseline insulin or additional [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as he restarts his tube feeds.
Another option would be to decrease the rate of his tube feeds to stimulate hunger, although patient denies feeling hungry all of the time.
A gastric-jeujonostomy tube was placed on [**2155-8-20**], and tube feeds were initiated, working up to a goal of 95mL/hr with Replete with fiber, full strength, and he was at 75mL/hr at time of discharge, going up by 10mL/hr every 6 hours as tolerated.
Reglan and a PPI was continued to assist with reflux, bowel motility and any nausea.
For the GJ tube site, intraventional radiology recommended changing dressing daily.
Vascular Access: PICC line was left in for ease of daily lab draws.
Medications on Admission: (Per last discharge, patient did not know medications and per family had not been taking them.)
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID  (2 times a day).
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QAM.

You should continue to take all of your medications as prescribed in order to treat the infection, as well as your underlying medical conditions and other illnesses.
During your stay, you had difficulty eating enough and taking your medications, so a tube was placed to assist with getting you medications and nutrition.
