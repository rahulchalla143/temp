The patient is s/p surgical wound washout today for drainage from the incision site (see full details below).
He came out of surgery at 7:30 pm.

He has had no further seizures since the Rickham catheter was removed by Neurosurgery on [**2175-9-30**] (see below).
EEG [**9-9**] showed 20 pushbutton events of turning to the left which had EEG correlate of a rhythmic sharp activity seen in the right frontal area.
He was initially started on rufinamide; however, the patient had multiple seizures after discontinuing EEG monitoring so the rufinadmide was discontinued.
He was then started on Depakote again with continued seizures.
MRI head was read as "stable left extraaxial fluid collection", but the team was concerned that his left frontal cyst had slightly enlarged and may have been causing pressure on his parenchyma.
Neurosurgery was consulted and took him stereotactic cyst ventriculostomy and [**Last Name (un) **] catheter placement on [**2175-9-14**].
He was readmitted to Neurosurgery [**Date range (1) 110890**] with purulent drainage and erythema at the surgical incision.

He was then admitted to the Neurosurgery service for a wound exploration/wash out.
He was taken to he recovery room and suffered [**3-26**] seizures witnessed by sister in law.
They recommended a change from Ativan 1mg QID to 1mg Q4hrs.
He remained seizure free for the next 48-hours and resumed his home dose of ativan 1mg q6h as well as his keppra and lamictal.
He was followed closely by the infectious disease team and his antibiotics were tailored after his wound cultures grew staph aureus that were resistant to oxacillin.

He will also require weekly CBC with differential, BUN, Creatine, and vanco trough (goal 15-20).
