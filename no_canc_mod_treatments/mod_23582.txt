Also takes prednisone at home and got 60mg in the ED for ?COPD exacerbation.
Continued on vanco for osotemyelitis and home vent settings for night/day.
# R Olecranon Osteomyelitis: Increased vancomycin dose initially due to low trough, then switched to daptomycin after consultation with ID as clinically no improvement.

The risks of removing the picc were high as the patient has difficult iv access and requires a long course of iv antibiotics.
