Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient completed a course of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
While in the ICU she developed hematemesis, which was felt to be due to anticoagulation and her underlying pneumonia.
While awaiting these results patient was started empirically on Flagyl with no change in her stool output.
Her diarrhea slowed but did not resolve during her hospitalization, and was thought to be secondary to antibiotic associated diarrhea as well as cessation of narcotic pain medications (see below).
Her daughters claimed she had several bottles of pain medications at home from different providers, but did not volunteer the names of those providers.
In discussion with the patient's PCP further collaboration of medication misuse was unable to be confirmed, but given these concerns and the patient's initial presentation of being found down for several hours, her long-acting pain medications were stopped and Oxycodone was begun.
The patient became very upset when told by her daughters that she was addicted to drugs and needed to attend Rehab, and that her pain medication use was contributing to the dissolution of one daughter's marriage; she then insisted on stopping her narcotic medications entirely.
Ongoing discussion regarding pain management will need to be continued in the outpatient setting.
