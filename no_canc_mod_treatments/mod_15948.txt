Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the vascular service and continued on vancomycin and Zosyn.
Patient's Coumadin was held and he was given vitamin K and started on a heparin drip.
On [**7-9**], the decision was made the the patient's right leg was not salvageable due to critical ischemia, and he underwent a right below-knee amputation with excision of his prior [**Month/Year (2) **].
The stump, thigh, and groin incisions were left open and packed, due to tissue and blood cultures positive for MRSA, and a JP drain was placed.
Patient received 1 u pRBCs for an HCT of 26.6, with increase to 28.0.
The heparin drip was discontinued.
Due to patient's prior cardiac history, including a bypass and MI, serial troponins and EKGs (showing non-specific ST-T abnormalities) were obtained.
On [**7-10**] home cellcept was restarted and antihypertensives were reintroduced.
patient received 1 unit of pRBCs for an HCT of 25.9 with increase to 29.4.
Cardiology was consulted and felt troponin elevation was due to demand ischemia.
Home diltiazem was stopped and replaced with metoprolol.
Since [**7-14**] sodium has ranged between 129 to 132, with institution of fluid restriction to 1 L and holding of home chlorthalidone.
Patient was evaluated by infectious disease for his bloodstream infection, with recommendations for 6 weeks of intravenous vancomycin.
Patient worked with physical therapy since his amputation.
His ACE-I and lasix were stopped.
Gentle IV fluids were re-instated.
Tacrolimus level was elevated to 12 and with renal tx recommendations, dosing was decreased.
Zosyn was added empirically to his antibiotic regimen.
Likely due to this second hypotensive insult, his transplant kidney stopped working.
He was started on CVVHD and gradually transitioned to intermittent HD.
His left upper extremity fistula was difficult to access because it was too deep, so a right IJ tunneled dialysis line was placed by IR.
A VAC dressing was applied to his open thigh wound and eventually transitioned to wet to dry dressings.
Gastroenterology was consulted after he had several episodes of guaiac positive stools  Cdif was sent on multiple occasions but always returned negative.
Psychiatry was consulted for his depressed affect and he was started on citalopram.
Nutrition became an issue, as his appetite was decreased due to depression and he could not tolerate tube feeding via a dobhoff.
He was started on Marinol and his PO intake improved.
He worked with physical therapy and it was determined that he needed acute rehab.
He will remain on Vancomycin untill follow-up with ID.
