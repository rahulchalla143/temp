Patient also has a history of esophageal varices and variceal bleeds and is s/p band ligation therapy most recently on [**2161-1-1**].
Patient is currently being treated with an [**7-30**] week course of vancomycin and levofloxacin, and continued diuresis on lasix and aldactone as an outpatient.
She had a large volume paracentesis on [**2161-2-25**] with removal of 4.5L, which reportedly helped ameliorate her abdominal discomfort.
She was found to have worsening pleural effusion, and underwent a left thoracentesis on [**2161-3-4**] that provided significant improval in her symptoms.
Discussion regarding possible chest tube placement with pleurodiesis was initiated at the OSH, and deferred to our further management here.

Left-sided PICC line appears to be in unchanged position with the tip in the lower SVC.
lead placement Nonspecific ST segment elevation in leads l, aVL, V5-V6 with ST segment depression in leads V1-V2 - clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing, sinus tachycardia present .
Ankle Plain Film Right ankle: Three views, shows mild soft tissue swelling about the ankle.
Thigh MRI [**3-11**] TECHNIQUE: T1, inversion recovery and pre- and post-gadolinium T1 fat sat sequences were performed in multiple planes.
MRI [**3-12**] TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained including axial in- and out-of-phase, axial and coronal HASTE, 2D time-of-flight and 3D VIBE pre-, during, and post-gadolinium enhancement with subtractions in each phase.
There is a small pericardial effusion with possible pericardial enhancement post-gadolinium administration.
3D reconstructions were helpful in the delineation of anatomy and pathology.
Small pericardial effusion with pericardial enhancement post-gadolinium administration.
Pleural Fluid Cytology and Flow Cytometry FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, and CD antigens 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 20, 23, and 45.
The liver is nodular and heterogeneous in echotexture and significantly decreased in size consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis.
Spot marked in left flank for bedside paracentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 yo woman with cirrhosis [**1-22**] to sarcoidosis complicated by esophageal varices and a failed TIPS procedure attempted in in [**12-26**] who presents from an OSH for evaluation of worsening pleural effusions (s/p L thoracentesis on [**3-4**] at OSH).
*  Pleural Effusion (presented w/ CP, tachycardia, & SOB)--likely hepatic hydrothorax [**1-22**] to cirrhosis and ascites (requires therapeutic paracentesis every week).
No h/o heart failure (most recent echo in [**1-26**] shows normal LV function), cardiac enzymes negative X 3, Pt is s/p Right-sided thoracentesis on [**3-9**] in which 1.5 L of fluid was taken off--she was repleted with 12 g of albumin following her procedure.
However, has been on long-term chronic diuretic therapy which increases the concentration of LDH in peritoneum.
Pleuredesis may not be effective in this patient due to the frequent recurrence of effusion.
Patient eventually underwent pleurodesis+pleural bx which has stopped the fluid from re-accumulating.
After fluid resusitation (albumin and rbcs given), pressures were better (PCWP 16, CVP 13, PAP 32/20).
Has been on chronic iv Vancomycin and Levofloxacin since [**11-24**] and is closely followed by ID.
Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-1-13**] to [**2161-2-6**] for elective TIPS placement due to esophageal varices.
ID recommends long-term Vanc and Levo, and plans to do repeat MRIs periodically.
During long [**2161-1-13**] to [**2161-2-6**] hospital course, would typically get progressively short of breath as abdominal ascites reaccumulated, and generally needed a large volume paracentesis about once a week, when more than 3 L was removed, became hypotensive despite pre procedure Albumin, requiring short ICU stays.
Recurrent exudative pleural effusions, also small-mod pericardial effusion, ?hepatic hydrothorax vs. other process.
Got pleuroscopy with pleural bx and pleurodesis [**2161-3-20**].
Holding off on diuretics due to dehydration.
Not a candidate for drainage since effusion is stable on repeated echo, ?cardiac sarcoid.
No steroids for now.
No further W/U needed, but need aggressive pulm toilet and rehab.
Card: fluid restriction Pulm: W/U for other serositis [**3-30**] ECHO: small pericardial effusion [**3-30**] US: mod ascites [**3-31**] card MRI: pending Plan: Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further options about liver transplantation, esophageal banding and sbp prophylaxis, since last abdominal ultrasound showed re-accumulating ascites.
