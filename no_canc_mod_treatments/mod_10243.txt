He denies any recent use of NSAIDs and has been taking his Coumadin normally, without changing any doses.
He denies any hematemesis, BRBPR, chest tightness/discomfort during these episodes.
When he arrived at [**Location (un) 620**], his INR was measured at 5.6, for which he was given Vit K 10mg PO x 1 and 2 units FFP.
Patient has been taking his [**Location (un) **], coumadin, and plavix at home and still has his biliary drain in place from the placement in [**Month (only) 404**].
His hospital course was c/b the need to return to the OR for re-exploration of his chest for bleeding after increased chest tube output was noted with a L sided pleural effusion and increased O2 requirement.
Since he was deemed a poor surgical candidate, PTC was placed and he completed a 10-day course of Cipro/Flagyl.
The etiology was thought to be cardioembolic and he was started on lifelong anticoagulation with coumadin.
He was most recently admitted on [**2144-12-30**] with right upper quadrant pain, with management of acute cholecystitis once again with placement of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, resulting in removal of purulent bile.
He was treated with augmentin for 2 weeks.
This was immediately proceeded by an ERCP in [**2144-6-25**] with stent placement for suspected cholangitis.
Protonix gtt was started.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p right coronary artery stent x2 ([**10-3**], [**3-4**]) and s/p elective CABG on [**2144-4-21**] (LIMA-> LAD), c/b re-exploration required for bleeding - h/o stroke - h/o acute cholecystitis s/p perc chole placement on [**2144-5-12**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Asbestos exposure - Chronic back pain - Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (untreated)   Social History: He lives with his wife.
Pt at risk due to [**First Name3 (LF) **], plavix and coumadin.
INR was supratheraputic at [**Location (un) 620**] and reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells, and his hematocrit responded appropriately.
The patient was started on a PPI drip, but then changed to PPI iv BID.
The patient's triple anticoagulation of aspirin, Coumadin, and Plavix was held, but metoprolol was restarted once blood pressures were likely to remain stable.
# Percutaneous biliary drain: placed [**2144-12-31**] with good drainage, and patient is without pain.
Aspirin and Plavix were held during the admission.
He was therefore discharged only on aspirin with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11302**].
# CVA hx: On lifelong coumadin [**1-27**] likely cardioembolic etiology of CVA in past.
Residual right-sided "pins/needles" sensation and mild weakness with decreased functional ability.
Held coumadin for EGD, and reversed with FFP and vit K. Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding need for lifelong coumadin, given that his cardioembolic CVA was in the setting of off-pump CABG.
It was decided that he would not need coumadin, given the risk-benefit profile, and he was thus discharged without coumadin.
He will follow-up with stroke neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management.
He was continued on home [**Last Name (STitle) **] and spiriva, with albuterol nebs PRN.
# Recurrent cholecystitis: Prior to hospitalization, there have the discussions about elective cholecystectomy given pt anticoagulation.
We contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery during this admission for possible cholecystectomy given that pt is off of anticoagulation.
