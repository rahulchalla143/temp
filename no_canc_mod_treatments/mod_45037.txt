Briefly, this is a 60 year old female with a complex past medical history including hepatitis C, status post liver transplant times two with last transplant complicated by hepatic artery stenosis, status post stent, respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy and multiple transfers to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for secretion management, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus Type 2, hypertension and chronic anasarca.
Amoxicillin was added to her medication regimen out of concern for sinusitis.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was continued on a regimen of deep suctioning and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
She did well with this regimen and was deemed stable for transfer back to the medicine floor [**2190-5-4**] in the evening.
Please see the rest of this dictation from this admission for specific details concerning her past medical history, social history, medications prior to admission and family history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination upon transfer, vital signs showed temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 152/84, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 99% on 70% oxygen via tracheostomy collar.
A nasogastric tube was in place with thick secretions around her nares.
Neck was remarkable for a tracheostomy as well as a tracheostomy collar delivering oxygen.
She was continued on an aggressive regimen of pulmonary toilet with chest physical therapy and suctioning to prevent recurrent plugging.
She received oxygen via tracheostomy collar with it weaned down to oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
She received Lasix 40 mg p.o.
She received scheduled Mucomyst and Albuterol nebulizer treatments q.
6 hours with metered dose inhalers as needed for shortness of breath and wheezing.
She underwent a bedside bronchoscopy on [**2190-5-5**] which demonstrated copious thick viscous secretions with purulent appearance.
Ultimately a plan must be developed between the Liver Staff, Pulmonary Service, and Otorhinolaryngology Service regarding the best way to manage the patient's colonization with Pseudomonas and Klebsiella as well as means of diminishing her mechanical aspiration and recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
Status post liver transplant - The patient was continued on Aspirin and Plavix status post hepatic artery stent to maintain patency of stent.
As questioned, this was related to her immunosuppressive therapy, however, to rule out thrombosis, she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated patency of the portal vein, hepatic vessels and the previously placed hepatic artery stent as well as normal flow.
She was continued on Tacrolimus and Imuran, the dose was adjusted appropriately based on levels.
She completed a three day course of Amoxicillin and Aspirin for sinusitis.
She was continued on Vitamin C and Zinc for increased wound healing.
It is felt to be likely osmotic in nature as all culture data was negative and the patient demonstrated a dramatic decrease in her level of diarrhea after discontinuation of her tube feeds.
Therefore she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition as well as Cholestyramine.
Hypertension - The patient was continued on Lisinopril and Norvasc titrated for blood pressure control.
Diabetes mellitus 2 - She was continued on regular insulin sliding scale with q.i.d.
Additional events regarding the [**Hospital 1325**] hospital course, discharge events, diagnoses, medications and follow up plans will be dictated as a separate addendum to this report.
