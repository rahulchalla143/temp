Arterial line placement.
A non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed a non-obstructing renal calculus, b/l perinephric stranding, mild colonic transmural thickening in the rectum and sigmoid and a ventral hernia without obstruction.
He received ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin.
His ceftriaxone was stopped and he was started on vancomycin.
Because of the backpain and concern for ETOH withdrawal he was given serax, morphine and percocet.
At some point prior to transfer the patient had a right femoral groin line placed, was started on fluids wide open, a bicarb drip with 3 amps of bicarb, vasopressin at 0.2 units/minute, levophed at 5 mcgs, neosynephrine at 200 mcgs and propolfol at 200 mcgs.
His vent settings were TV 700, RR 20, FIO2 60%.
He was given additional propofol and the RR decreased to the teens and HR came down to the low 100s.

However, on the night that he died he became hemodynamically unstable, possibly in the setting of new infectious/ischemic process, requiring administration of vasopressors.
Suspicion of an intra-abdominal source as the primary cause of his rapid deterioration and eventual death was high.
