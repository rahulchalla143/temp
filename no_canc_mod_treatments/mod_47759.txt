Name:  [**Known lastname 16986**],[**Known firstname 13025**]                Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 16987**]  Admission Date:  [**2182-4-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-8-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Penicillins / Protamine / Quinidine Sulfate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 161**] Addendum: ***PLEASE NOTE, DUE TO A COMPUTING ERROR, THIS DISCHARGE SUMMARY WAS FILED PRIOR TO ITS COMPLETION.
CT left shoulder:  Limited examination due to lack of IV contrast.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 yo woman with history of mitral valve repair (x3) on coumadin, tricuspid valave annuloplasty ring, atrial fibrillation, and recent cat scratch who presented with 4 days of melena and a hematocrit of 10.8, as well as INR of >88.
GI bleed: In the ER the patient received FFP x 2 as well as PRBCs x 2.
She was initially admitted to the ICU, where she was given vitamin K, FFP, and 7 units of PRBCs in total.
Her INR was reversed with vitamin K, and her hematocrit remained stable.
She had one day of low O2 saturations (high 80s) and required brief intubation, during which time she had an endoscopy, which found gastritis, an ulcer in the cardia, and an erosion in the stomach body, neither of which were actively bleeding and both of which were felt to be likely causes of her GI bleed and anemia.
She was seen by our pharmacist while in house for a very extensive discussion of her coumadin use, other medication use, and diet, which were unrevealing with respect to her sudden INR elevation.
The patient's coumadin was initially held, she was given FFP as above, and after reversal of her INR with vitamin K, she was restarted on coumadin after her INR fell below 2.5.
She was given heparin IV to bridge her when she fell below 2.5 given her high risk of thrombus to her mechanical valve.
Before discharge the patient was on coumadin 3mg po qhs and remained stable at INR of about 2.7 for several days.
She received a tetanus vaccine as an inpatient.
She was found to grow [**4-16**] blood cultures bottles of pasteurella and was treated with ceftriaxone.
As the patient also appeared to have mental status changes in the MICU, she was started on meningitis doses.
It is believed unlikely that she had pasteurella meningitis at this time.
She worked with physical therapy to mobilize her arms and the edema appeared to respond somewhat to this.
Given hte absence of meningitis (presumed), endocarditis, and osteomyolitis, the patient was switched to PO levofloxacin on the last day of hospitalization, to finish a total of three weeks of treatment, which is scheduled to end on [**2182-5-17**].
Her digoxin was discontinued during this admission, as it is a relatively poor rate-controlling [**Doctor Last Name 932**], and she was maintained on norpace and beta blocker as tolerated by her blood pressure.
She is on coumadin, as stated above, for anticoagulation and stroke risk reduction.
Mechanical mitral valve: As stated above the patient is anticoagulated on coumadin with goal 2.5-3.5 for her valve.
She comes in on chronic diuretic therapy for lower extremity edema, yet does not have heart failure by echo.
When her diuretics were held during this hospitalization she indeed did develop pitting edema bilaterally.
