You were found to have a bacterial infection in your blood and were started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
You then became septic, had low blood pressure, and were transferred briefly to the ICU, where you were given fluids and started on high-dose steroids.
Your dialysis line was also pulled because it may have been the cause of your infection.
Your symptoms resolved after you had a new dialysis catheter placed and were dialyzed.
You were initially treated with meropenem, but this was switched to ceftazidime with hemodialysis to avoid putting another line and potential source of infection.
Although you had a potential drug reaction to a cephalosporin causing neutropenia, our infectious disease experts felt that treatment with ceftazidime was the preferred option due to your brief treatment course of 2 weeks, no need of another line, and no renal toxicity (as with gentamicin).
We have made the following changes to your medications: -START ceftazidime 2g/2g/3g with hemodialysis until [**11-20**].
-INCREASE sevelamer to 1600mg three times daily with meals Please continue to take your other medications as previously prescribed.
