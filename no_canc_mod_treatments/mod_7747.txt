HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who developed a cough five days prior to admission.
She was started on antibiotics one day prior to admission secondary to being short of breath.
CK checked at that time was 3000, MB was 60, troponin was 2.6.
Cardiac output improved on dopamine although the patient developed ATN and shock liver with AST in the 10,000 range.
On [**2107-1-18**], the patient was transitioned to Milrinone and Levophed but was tachy to the 140s and hypotensive.
The patient was cardioverted on amiodarone but the amiodarone drip was discontinued secondary to liver failure.
The patient was switched back to Levophed and Dopamine and then titrated off Dopamine.
Throughout this course, the patient has been on broad antibiotics for a questionable sepsis.
Significant for coronary artery disease status post    coronary artery bypass graft in [**2102**].
Status post mitral valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve.
Lasix 20 q day.
Protonix 40 twice a day.
Lopressor 25 three times a day.
Lisinopril 5 q day.
Pravachol 80 q day.
LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital on [**1-13**] showed right atrial pressure of 16, left ventricular end diastolic of 21; pulmonary artery pressures 51/33; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 34.
Left circumflex with mild disease; right coronary artery with proximal total occlusion; saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending were patent.
The patient was    started on aspirin and started on a statin when her liver    function tests improved.
Managed with broad spectrum    antibiotics for a two week course.
The    patient needed anti-arrhythmic loading but limited by    hepatic toxicity and blood pressures, so therefore the    patient was started on digoxin.
The patient was weaned off Levophed but    exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose    questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic    dysfunction.
Blood pressure stabilized and the patient    was able to be started on low dose ACE inhibitor and beta    blocker.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin,    Levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad coverage empirically    times two weeks on the antibiotics which were renally    dosed.
NUTRITION:  Once bowel function returned, the patient was    started on tube feeds to assist her catabolic state.
She received a two week course of antibiotics with    ceftazidine for E. coli pneumonia.
The patient was restarted on    subcutaneous heparin and platelets remained stable    throughout the remainder of her hospital course.
Sedative    medications (Versed and Fentanyl) were discontinued for 96    hours without significance starting on [**1-26**].
Since many of these medications are hepatically    metabolized and renally cleared, it was thought that the    patient was not clearing these medications quickly.
The    patient was started on Dilantin with thoughts that there    may have been seizure activity; however, this did not seem    to make acute improvements in mental status.
DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was given a Regular    insulin sliding scale.
To continue aspirin and    Pletal.
Congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic    dysfunction.
Intubation and extubation.
Miconazole powder, one application three times a day.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Spironolactone 25 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Insulin sliding scale.
