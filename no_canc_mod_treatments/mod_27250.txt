She was given a total 3.5 L normal saline in [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 18**], and was started on peripheral dopamine in the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
Her lisinopril, furosemide, and metoprolol were all held.
There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency with cortisol stimulation testing.
Her blood pressure stabilized to the 90s systolic without dopamine and she was transferred to the floor.
Her metoprolol was restarted before leaving the MICU, but was discontinued again on the floor because her SBPs were intermittently in the high 80s-90s.
The pain was mildly relieved by 3 of her husband's expired sublingual nitroglycerine tabs.
On arrival to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she was given oxygen which improved her symptoms.
Her chest pain resolved without further intervention and had no complaints of chest pain throughout her admission.
We continued her home aspirin and statin.
She had not been taking furosemide or HCTZ since STEMI in 09/[**2112**].
On arrival lisinopril and metoprolol were held.
After her blood pressure stabilized in the MICU, she was re-started on metoprolol, but her BPs were intermittently in the 80s, so metoprolol was discontinued again.
