You were in the ICU overnight and given several liters of IV fluids and IV antibiotics.
You were then transfered to the medicine floor where you did well until your antibiotics were changed.
We then completed your course of IV antibiotics and started you on oral antibiotics.
You were doing well and your blood pressure and temperature stayed normal.
We took out your foley and returned to your home regimen of straight catheterizations.
You also started requiring some oxygen through your nasal canula.
In the future you may need further testing of your lungs, but for now your respiratory status is stable.
When you go home, make sure to complete your course of antibiotics at home.
Also continue using the cream for yeast infection in your groin.
