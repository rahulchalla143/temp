Brief Hospital Course: 69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**]; during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF.
# ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA Admitted from HD w/atrial tachycardia, a chronic intermittent issues.
Attempts to increase beta-blockade beyond Toprol 75mg PO QD were limited by BP.
For the R femoral AVF, vascular surgery consult service evaluated her daily and recommended conservative management vascular surgery f/u in 4 weeks.
