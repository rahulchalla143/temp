[**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt with h/o 6 MIs in past s/p TPA but never stented.
On HD #3, [**2187-6-6**], he had an anterior STEMI, peak CK 680.
Cath showed 3VD and s/p stents x 2 to LAD.
Likely correlation between d/cing heparin and this event?
Heparin was continued after catheterization (goal 60-80) as well as Integrilin for 18 hours post-cath.
We continues ASA, Plavix, and Statin (changed from pravastatin to 80 atorvastatin).

Pt has been on this regimen for years.
We initially held his nitrate and diltiazem because systolic BP was in 80s.
Put on heparin gtt, but d/cd night of STEMI, with subtherapeutic INR.
Pt was started on Coumadin 10 mg qhs; was on heparin gtt (goal 60-80) which was d/ced [**6-10**] when INR 3.6.
Had supratheraputic INR on day of discharge, so will decrease coumadin to 2.5 X 2 days, then restart 5mg daily.
