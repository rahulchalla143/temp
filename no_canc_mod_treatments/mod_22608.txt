On the day of admission ([**10-20**]) she was transfered to the [**Hospital1 **] ED for poor PO intake and dehydration as she was noted to be eating only 5-10% of her meals.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was treated with IVF, Zosyn, and tube feeds.
1) Sepsis: On admisssion to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was initially thought to have urosepsis but her urine culture failed to grow bacteria (AFB still pending) and blood cultures have been negative.
She was started on Zosyn but this was stopped 11/17 per ID reccs as there is no source.
Her blood pressure was maintained with IVF, tube feeds, and free water flushes through her feeding tube.
2) Pott's Disease: Her TB meds were initially held on admission due to her elevated LFTs.
Her levofloxacin, streptomycin, and ethambutol were restarted on [**10-24**].
Given that NG tibe was removed prior to discharge, and HCP did not want PEG tube or other artificial means of feeding, decision made to stop medications for Pott's Disease.
Patient's chemistries should be checked Q1Week (or 2 times a week if abnormal), and IVF should be given to correct hypernatremia should it develop.
Patient may need intermittent IVF to correct hypernatremia.
