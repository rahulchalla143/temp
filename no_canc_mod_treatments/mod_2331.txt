runs of NSVT per ED nursing note), heparin gtt, and integrillin.
Dopamine and Levophed were started and sBP increased to the 110's.
MM moist with tube in place.
Due to decompensated CHF, an intra-aortic baloon pump was inserted.
Shortly following insertion and intubation, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
The patient was sent to the CCU intubated, on dopamine and levophed for hemodynamic support.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right inguinal pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula   Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with CAD, CHF EF 30%, recent COPD exacerbation, diarrhea, F/C, H. pylori infxn who p/w SOB, cath without evidence of acute disease who developed subsequent hypotension, leukocytosis, and coffee-ground emesis.
BP meds were held initially while pt was intubated on pressors, but then after extubation ACEi and Diltiazem were restarted and titrated up to achieve good BP control.
Pt was weaned off of pressors and then diuresed with IV Lasix.
The pt had good UOP and a successful diuresis.
Spironolactone was also started.
Pt had been on prednisone x 12 days from his previous hospitalization.
He was given dexamethasone 4mg IV q8 for 24 hours, then this was tapered down to prednisone 20 mg po qd.
A pressure dressing was placed and a repeat U/S showed that the pseudoaneurysm had resolved and no injection was needed.
COPD - continue nebs standing and inhalers.
Continue prednisone 20 mg po qd until pt is clinically improved - pt will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for taper after COPD is clinically more improved.
Renal: Pt had ARF on CRI at [**Hospital3 5365**] thought to be [**2-13**] diuresis too quickly.
Cr did bump slightly to 2.2 here after diuresis but on d/c was trending down.
Sputum and stool samples came back negative, but CXR indicated a probable PNA and pt was covered empirically with Levo and Flagyl x 10 days to cover for possible aspiration as well as typical pneumonia.
Pt has been H.pylori positive and will require EGD/colonoscopy as outpt before beginning triple therapy for H.pylori 6.
Plts fell slightly but then after heparin SC was stopped it remained stable.
Endo: Pt had BG's in the 300's throughout his hospitalization, which was likely due to steroid use, and sliding scale insulin was increased to accomodate this.
Pt will continue insulin sliding scale along with his prior dose of glyburide while at rehab and then once prednisone is tapered Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may determine if pt needs to be on insulin injections long term.
