Admission Date:  [**2179-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-3-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old man with multiple medical problems including cirrhosis secondary to Amiodarone, aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]), atrial fibrillation, and pleural effusions who presents with a general feeling of malaise, weakness and shortness of breath.
He has noted dyspnea on exertion for several weeks, worse over the past week.
Of note, the patient was recently started on Digoxin in [**Month (only) 958**] for rapid atrial fibrillation.
Aortic valve replacement in [**2166**] for aortic stenosis; 4.
Status post right hip replacement.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Dilantin 200 mg b.i.d., 100 mg q.h.s., Aldactone 25 mg q.d., Lasix 40 mg q.d., Glyburide 10 q.
AM, 5 q. PM, Metformin 500 b.i.d., Lexapro 15 q.d., Allopurinol 100 q.d., Protonix 40 q.d., Propranolol 30 b.i.d., Iron 325 q.d., Coumadin 10.5/10, Diltiazem extended release 240 q.d., Digoxin 0.25 q.d.
Tthe first was bradycardia, likely secondary to medication toxicity, predominantly Digoxin.
The patient had both his Propranolol, Diltiazem and Digoxin withheld on admission, and had a cardiology consult on the second day of admission.
This was attempted, however, within several hours the patient went back into atrial fibrillation, and so he was rate-controlled with medication over the rest of his admission.
He was initially just kept on the Propranolol which was later changed over to Metoprolol.
Unfortunately he went back into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, so he was maintained on both Metoprolol and high levels of Diltiazem with success.
The [**Last Name **] problem was congestive heart failure, occurring after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.
He was initially diuresed with minimal success, and was then changed to a Nitroglycerin drip and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed both left and right heart failure.
At the time of dictation, however, he is not requiring any further diuretics and he is on 2 liters O2.
He was given gentle Vitamin K and started on heparin while he was subtherapeutic towards the end of his admission.
After multiple procedures, the patient was restarted on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.
Once he was off Coumadin, he was taken for thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance.
The liver service recommended increasing his diuretics and ultimately a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure.
The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure which was initially uncomplicated, as they were able to effectively reduce his portal pressures.
As mentioned above the patient developed complications from this procedure including acute renal failure and congestive heart failure that were managed initially in the Intensive Care Unit and then later on the floor.
While on balance, it was felt the potential benefit was to reduce the risk of having a lethal variceal bleed, the family understood that one consequence and complication of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure was encephalopathy.
He was treated with Lactulose around the clock as well as lactulose enemas with minimal effect.
The patient in the past has expressed a wish not to have diarrhea if at all possible (see below), but was treated with Lactulose prn.
The patient was empirically started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
Code status - The patient over the course of his admission slowly and steadily worsened in terms of his mental status from various medical complications.
The patient had expressed a very clear wish to his family that he not go on a ventilator or have cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if it would only improve his quality of life.
In addition, the patient's family was adamant that he stay on the Coumadin prophylaxis for prosthetic valve, their belief being that removing the Coumadin, and risking thrombosis, was too active a mechanism of demise.
