Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, central line, art line, dialysis  History of Present Illness: 31 year old male with ESRD secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis, recent admission from [**8-30**] - [**2161-10-7**] for aortic valve MSSA endocarditis/abscess presumed secondary to HD line infection, course complicated by post-operative aortic root abscess requiring homograft/redo AVR, and bilateral subclavian DVTs for which he is on coumadin, who presented to the ED this a.m. complaining of 3 days of shortness of breath, and 1 day of severe chest pain with inspiration.
He was placed on a NRB with O2 sat in the low 90s, however he continued to be tachypneic, with severe pleuritic chest pain.
He was started on BIPAP, which he did not tolerate, despite a trial of ativan to help relax him.
After intubation, he seemed to be quite dysynchronous with the ventilator, requiring fentanyl, versed, and propofol to achieve synchrony.
He was given vancomycin 1 gram, ceftriaxone 1 gram, and azithromycin 500 mg all x 1. .
He was seen by renal who plan to do hemodialysis urgently.

Post-op course complicated by aortic root abscess requiring re-do AVR/homograft on [**2161-9-29**].
Completed 6 week course of nafcillin on [**2161-11-12**].
# Bilateral subclavian vein thromboses on US in [**9-23**] # PFO, with left to right shunt across interatrial septum at rest, seen on TTE [**2161-9-29**].
Left subclavian HD line with small amount of purulent drainage around the opening, overlying skin erythematous.
31 year old male with ESRD secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis, recent aortic valve MSSA endocarditis/abscess presumed secondary to HD line infection, course complicated by post-operative aortic root abscess requiring homograft, and bilateral subclavian DVTs for which he is on coumadin, who presented to the ED this a.m. with dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, found to have hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral lobar pneumonia, and sepsis in the setting of recently positive blood culture at dialysis.
After self extubation, he was maintained on supplemental O2 by NC, and over the rest of his hospital course, he had stable and improving lung function.
He did experience transient desaturation and tachypnea during his stay on the floor but this was secondary to volume overload due to receiving several units of blood prior to undergoing dialysis.
# MSSA Septicemia: [**6-23**] blood culture bottles from [**12-5**], [**12-7**] positive, with HD catheter tip positive as well.
- On nafcillin 2gm IV Q4h since [**12-9**] (planned for 6 week course) and completed gentamicin 35 mg IV Q48H through [**12-12**].

Femoral cath was pulled [**2161-12-15**] after tunnelled cath was placed in the RSC.
# Anticoagulation: Currently on a heparin gtt bridge to coumadin with INR goal of [**2-20**] for bioprosthetic AVR and subclavian clots.
He was urged to follow up as an outpatient with his primary care physician to have his INR checked and his coumadin adjusted accordingly.
# Pancreatitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] began having abdominal pain on HD 2 and was noted to have an amylase of 308, lipase of 250.

He has had a recent abd CT which also commented on a duct at the upper limit of normal.
As for the cause of his pancreatitis, he did briefly get propofol which can precipitate pancreatitis, but the cause is currently unknown.
# Subclavian DVTs: heparin gtt to coumadin as above.
# Hypertension: The patient was gradually restarted on home antihypertensives.
