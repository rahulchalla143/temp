From that time he has been in his usual state of health until presenting today with a sudden squeezing sensation in his chest starting approximately 2 PM on the day of admission which was relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
The patient returned approximately six hours later at which time he took another Nitroglycerin tablet and called EMS to bring him to the Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, he was given Atrovent nebulizers, oxygen and sublingual Nitroglycerin times two.
He was started on a heparin drip.
He was placed on a nonrebreather mask and given 0.5 mg of Atropine with good response.
He was diuresed with Lasix for symptoms of heart failure.
He was then admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.
Atenolol 50 mg q. day.
Lisinopril 5 mg q. day.
Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg t.i.d.
Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile at 97.3 F.  Blood pressure was 116/65, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 22 and he was saturating at 94% on six liters by nasal cannula.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, his right eye was obviously status post traumatic injury.
His blood pressure was controlled with an IV Nitroglycerin drip and he was started on low dose Captopril.
His beta blocker was held because of his bradycardia.
A right radial approach was undertaken.
Prior to discharge the patient walked in the [**Doctor Last Name **] with Physical Therapy and found that his heart rate elevated to 140.
Because of that, he was continued on his Atenolol.
Because of his preserved ejection fraction, it was felt that he did not require afterload reduction to the degree that he had prior to admission.
His Isordil was discontinued, but he was continued on his 5 mg of Lisinopril.
He was also continued on daily aspirin of 325 mg and Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.
Upon arrival to the CCU, his initial O2 sat was 78% which came up to the mid to high 80s on five to six liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
After mild diuresis and Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers, his O2 saturation increased to 91% on five liters which is his baseline.
He was continued on his Combivent inhaler and received Albuterol and Atrovent nebs p.r.n.
Upon admission it was felt that perhaps he was having an acute flare of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was given Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department 100 mg.
Prednisone at 80 mg and then tapered which will continue after discharge.
HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit on admission was 51.9 and felt likely to be due to chronic hypoxemia and compensation for that.
Upon presentation to the Emergency Department, he was started on a heparin drip.
ENDOCRINE:  While on steroids for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was covered with an insulin sliding scale.
Atenolol 15 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Prednisone 40 mg on [**10-29**] mg on [**10-30**] and [**10-31**], 10 mg on [**11-1**] and [**2177-11-2**] then discontinue.
