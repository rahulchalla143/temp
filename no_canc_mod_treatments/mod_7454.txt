She is status post Billroth type II gastrotomy with subsequently multiple abdominal surgeries, including a Roux-en-Y for biliary drainage.
These surgical interventions were all the consequence for initial peptic ulcer disease treatment.
She was recently discharged on [**2101-9-13**], from [**Hospital6 1760**] for nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers, and bacteremia for which she is currently still under treatment.
She was originally scheduled for a revision of her Roux-en-Y by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2101-9-23**].
Peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II, Roux-en-Y to common bile duct, times two revisions of gastrojejunostomy secondary to anastomotic stenosis, status post microperforation leading to abdominal abscess, status post EGD and small bowel follow through which showed short Roux limb with reflux into the stomach and stenosis in the efferent limb.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 10 mg q.d., Dilaudid 8 mg q.3-4 hours p.r.n., Ativan, Protonix 40 mg q.d., ............... 1 g q.i.d., Compazine 10 mg q.d., Vitamin D 50,000 U every Friday, Fentanyl patch 225 mcg q.72 hours, continued Zosyn 4.5 g q.4 hours for bacteremia.
Therefore, she was brought to the Operating Room on [**9-23**] for a scheduled revision of her Roux-en-Y procedure.
Given the patient's history of her problems with biliary vomiting, inability to tolerate food intake since her gastric operations, and her multiple surgical procedures, and the most recent endoscopy showed that there was a finding of segment in the Roux of only 8 or 9 cm long which probably led to significant reflux problems, she was then scheduled to have takedown of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy of recreation of another Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with feeding tube placed in the jejunum.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
She was covered with intravenous antibiotics of Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Ciprofloxacin.
Her stay in the SICU was essentially noneventful where she remained on tube feeds and TPN.
Her drainage tubes provided adequate wound drainage.
Therefore, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Surgical Service was consulted, and based on their consultation, she was continued with close monitoring of her nutrition status, and her TPN and tube feeds were also adjusted according to her nutrition needs.
She was placed on a prolonged time of patient-controlled anesthesia with Dilaudid, and on the day prior to discharge, she was placed on her preadmission regimen of Dilaudid by mouth with 8 mm every 3-4 hours as needed which appears to provide enough coverage for her pain issue.
She is planned to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility where her nutritional status can be closely monitored and her wound care can be adequately provided.
The plan is to continue her tube feeds and possibly continue TPN on an outpatient basis.
