Because your hypoxia was so severe, you were intubated (a tube was placed down into your lungs to help you breath) and moved to the intensive care unit.
After looking at your chest X-ray, it was decided that the reason that you had become short of breath and had the respiratory failure was because of increased fluid in your lungs.
