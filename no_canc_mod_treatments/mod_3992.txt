Successful PTCA/stent of right renal artery with a 6.0 x 18mm Racer stent .
--- Pt was initially only given ASA 81 mg PO as therapy in light of her capsular hemorrhage post-renal atery stenting.
She was eventually started back on clopidogrel 75 mg PO qd once the bleeding ceased.
Because of her volume overload in the setting of oliguric renal failure, she eventually required dialysis.
She underwent two sessions of dialysis, and subsequently responded to well diuresis with furosemide and metolazone.
Pt was started on daily diuretic therapy since she seemed to consistently develop LE edema & basilar crackles on lung exam when not recieving diuretics.
Then changed to labetalol drip before converting to PO labetalol and being transfered to the floor.
After trying numerous combinations the following meds seemed to control her pressure adequately: labetolol, hydralazine, nifedipine, and clonidine (initially PO then patch).
Of note, pt's oral clonidine was tapered during the transition to the clonidine patch; however, she should be monitored for rebound hypertension as the taper has just been completed.
A tunneled catheter was placed for dialysis, which was performed twice with good effect.
-Pt's potassium was noted to be rising following cath (from 3.3 to 5.1 over two days).
Has improved to 4.7 on loop diuretic.
## ID: Pt was diagnosed with a foley catheter-associated UTI and treated with 10-day course of ceftriaxone 1 g IV qd because she has a levofloxacin allergy.
## DM:  Pt was on NPH 7 qAM/7 qPM along with RISS.
Since she had been requiring an additional 8units of insulin on top of her NPH at 7qAM/7qPM, we increased her NPH to 14 qAM / 7 qPM upon discharge.
Her glyburide was held given her renal failure.
Overtime, her Hct improved, and the sub-capsular hematoma was found to be stable on repeat imaging.
We started her on Zoloft 50mg/day [**2112-8-17**].
## Activity: pt worked with physical therapy on a few occasions during hospitalization.
She will benefit from wound care and improved ambulation.
