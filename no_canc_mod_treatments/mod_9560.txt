Admission Date:  [**2101-6-3**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2040-5-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old male with a past medical history significant for throat cancer, status post surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a history of minor aspiration events, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2101-5-29**], status post a mild choking episode while eating while in [**State 48158**] with cough, hypoxia, shortness of breath.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] ICU on [**2101-6-3**], and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Originally, he was on Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.
He also received Vancomycin for a seven day course.
Clindamycin was discontinued and he was on Levofloxacin and Flagyl upon transfer to the floor.
His arterial line grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus and the line was discontinued.
He failed video swallow study on [**2101-6-13**], and since then has been NPO with a nasogastric tube in place.
Throat cancer, status post resection with reconstruction surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy approximately two years ago, currently in remission.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy removal in [**2100-10-29**].
Famotidine 20 mg twice a day intravenously.
Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Iron 325 mg three times a day.
Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
Intravenous Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily.
Flagyl intravenous 500 mg q8hours.
Tube feeds via the nasogastric tube.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.9, heart rate 83 to 100, blood pressure 107 to 125 over 54 to 60, respiratory rate 17 to 23, oxygen saturation 93 to 97% on four to five liters oxygen via nasal cannula.
OG tube in place.
Past medical history is significant for throat cancer, status post resection/reconstructive surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy in remission, history of minor aspirations, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sciatica, malaria which recurs annually (former Green Beret).
He was doing well on Levaquin and Flagyl.
He was intubated on [**2101-6-3**], upon admission and extubated on [**2101-6-12**], with a slow wean from the ventilator secondary to his severe underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Antibiotics were changed around though he was finally placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Drug reaction was considered given the peripheral eosinophilia and malaria was also considered but parasite smear was negative.
While on the floor, he was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.
He remained afebrile and he was using an incentive spirometer at the bedside.
He remained NPO with an OG tube for medications with a plan to be reevaluated by speech and swallow service on Friday, [**2101-6-17**].
ENT was consulted and they recommended as well to either place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding and that he was at severe risk for aspiration, to NPO.
They also recommended an outpatient barium swallow to rule out esophageal mass or obstruction.
At this point, the conversation about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was brought up with he patient and his girlfriend.
[**Name (NI) **] was reluctant to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed since he had already experienced this in the past, however, since it was unsafe for him to take any food by mouth, he agreed to go ahead with a temporary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
The procedure is planned for [**2101-6-20**].
For his pneumonia, he will continue on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to complete a four week course, i.e., [**2101-7-7**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - He was continued on Flovent, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.
The differential diagnosis included a drug reaction, however, he only had a rash for three to four days and it resolved while on Levofloxacin and Flagyl (vasculitis).
Infectious disease was following the patient and they felt that the slow response to the antibiotics and the high grade eosinophilia despite withdrawal of beta lactam prompted consideration of atypical pathogens, example, strongyloides-related pneumonia, coccidioides (which can cause eosinophilia and cavities), histoplasmosis or just refractory pneumonia with superimposed eosinophilia from occult parasitic infestation, example strongyloides.
They felt that this would resolve in time and there was no treatment to be implemented at this time.
They felt it required no special treatment though did not object to daily low dose Aspirin.
Lines - He had a right PICC line that was placed on [**2101-6-10**].
Physical therapy - He was evaluated by physical therapy throughout his stay and was ambulating with oxygen, however, was desaturating down to the 80s on four liters of oxygen with ambulation.
Therefore, they recommend that he be discharged home with home physical therapy, outpatient pulmonary physical therapy as well as oxygen to use at home.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement on either [**2101-6-20**], or [**2101-6-21**].
Nutrition recommended that after his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube is placed he be started on bolus feedings with full strength Ultracal to start on four cans per day on day one and then gradually advance to a goal of eight cans per day.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  His discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum by the next intern who picks up this patient though I do know that he will be going home on Levofloxacin and Flagyl until [**2101-7-7**].
Severe aspiration pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation for approximately ten days.
