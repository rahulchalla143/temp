HOSPITAL COURSE:  66-year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation pacemaker in [**9-/2192**], hypertension, mitral regurgitation, also nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, presented with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, status post catheterization, now notable for increased filling pressures which had improved with Nipride and milrinone.
For her pump the filling pressures improved with Nipride and milrinone and was continued.
Her home regimen which was Enalapril and metoprolol and Lasix was also continued.
The patient's plan in terms of her pump was filling pressures improved with Nipride and milrinone and has been weaned off Nipride and decreased milrinone since midnight since the admission, so this is day 2 and she was continued to lower her dose of milrinone drip and plan was to switch her eventually to her home regimen of Enalapril, metoprolol and Lasix.
EP was consulted and plan was to get outpatient myocardial oxygen ventilation rate and exercise tolerance test in two to four weeks after discharge with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after the myocardial oxygen ventilation rate.
So the day before discharge the patient was weaned off the drips by now and tolerating the Enalapril, Lasix and metoprolol and losartan which was added on to her regimen.
In terms of her EP, she continued with atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation.
Continue with heparin and Coumadin for anticoagulation and for evaluation of biventricular pacer, she will need outpatient myocardial oxygen ventilation rate/exercise tolerance test after discharge in two to four weeks and to continue as discussed earlier with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and then follow up results with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was on her Enalapril, Lasix, metoprolol.
Her losartan was held for then and was to be added as tolerated and her atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation as discussed earlier.
If increased more than two pounds, please call PCP about Lasix dose.
