Admission Date:  [**2178-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-10-28**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**] Chief Complaint: intubated and sedated  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2178-10-22**] Pelvic angio and coling of right inferior vesical artery   History of Present Illness: Pt is an 86yo Caucasian female transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital s/p fall from standing with her walker.
Right subclavian central venous catheter courses into the neck through the right internal jugular vein.
NG tube side hole at the level of the GE junction and should be advanced.
Right subclavian central venous catheter tip coursing into the right internal jugular vein and into the neck.
She was intubated but responsive and able to move all 4 extremities and a cervical collar was in place.
She was transferred to the Trauma ICU for further management.
Following stabilization of her hemodynamics with blood and fluid, she was taken to Interventional Radiology where she underwent an angiogram and embolization of the right inferior vesicular artery.
Following the procedure she returned to the ICU where she was weaned and extubated.
Her cervical collar was removed as her C spine was cleared and her neurologic status was stable.
The neurologist felt that her confusion and slowness of speech may be due to mild ischemia from her fall in light of her low hematocrit.
She developed some expiratory wheezes on exam which cleared with Albuterol nebulizers.
She had some degree of dysphagia and soft foods and thin liquids were recommended as well as strict aspiration precautions.
She will be transferred to rehab today for further physical therapy to increase her mobility and hopefully she can return home independently as before her fall.
