No evidence of chest pain, and shortness of breath was substantially better after treatment with Bumex.
Status post a right carotid endarterectomy.
Wellbutrin 100 mg p.o.
Mavik 4 mg p.o.
Pravachol 40 mg p.o.
Labetalol 200 mg p.o.
Reminyl 8 mg p.o.
Sotalol 160 mg p.o.
However, the patient developed acute shortness of breath, elevated BNT, and Persantine thallium demonstrated mixed inferolateral defect with corresponding cardiac catheterization revealing 60% to 70% left main disease, left anterior descending artery with 80% disease, with an ejection fraction in the high 40% range.
Given these findings, the patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service, and the patient was successfully screened for coronary artery bypass graft.
On [**2183-6-9**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft times five (with left internal mammary artery to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal to left anterior descending artery).
The patient maintained good oxygen saturations on 3 liters nasal cannula and maintained good urine output after weaning off of pressors.
By postoperative day two, the patient again required a moderate amount of Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, and the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation to which the patient was initiated on an amiodarone drip.
At this time, beta blockers were also increased, and the chest tube was also removed.
At this time, the patient's amiodarone was discontinued as the patient maintained a sinus rhythm, and sotalol was re-initiated.
Given the history of the patient's intermittent atrial fibrillation, the patient was initiated on heparin for anticoagulation, and Coumadin was also administered.
By postoperative day seven, heparin anticoagulation was therapeutic and the dosing of labetalol and sotalol were staggered to reduce any provocation of orthostasis.
This event was evaluated and was determined to be probable to the administration of both sotalol and labetalol.
twice per day, and the staggering regimen of Lopressor was maintained.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass graft (with left internal mammary artery to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal to left anterior descending artery).
