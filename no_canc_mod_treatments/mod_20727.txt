In rehabilitation, he developed a urinary tract infection in his indwelling catheter and was put on levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q.24h.
He was evaluated at the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department for evaluation and replacement of the catheter for indwelling Foley catheter.
These were attributed to oxycodone and Dilaudid by the family, and after they were discontinued the confusion resolved.
MEDICATIONS IN THE HOSPITAL: 1.
Candesartan 32 mg by mouth once per day (which was changed to Losartan 50 mg by mouth once per day at the [**Hospital1 1444**]).
Tylenol as needed.
Coumadin 3 mg by mouth every day.
He was breathing loudly through an open mouth, and his eyes were not closed.
Coordination, sensation, and gait were difficult to assess due to his mental status.
He did have a nasogastric tube placed on [**3-28**], and this was verified in placement with abdomen.
There was a chest x-ray documenting satisfactory placement of the endotracheal tube.
PULMONARY STATUS:  As mentioned above in the previous paragraph, the patient was intubated primarily for difficulty protecting his airway and difficulty with secretions with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
However, he remained in the Intensive Care Unit for close chest physical therapy with deep suctioning as needed.
After extension discussions with the family regarding the prognosis of his dysarthria and dysphagia, it was determined that even though the patient had a living will saying that he did not want a feeding tube or a tracheostomy to keep him alive that the prospects for recovery were significant and that a feeding tube could be placed; according to what his family felt his wishes were regarding temporary feeding.
At this time, there are plans for Monday placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
At this time, there are no plans for any tracheostomy tube placement for better access for secretions.
The patient's hematocrit remained fairly stable, but he was given one unit of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit after the transfusion was approximately 32.
He was continued on heparin after the Coumadin was allowed to drift downward in preparation for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for both his urinary tract infection and a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He remained febrile, and mainly the issues were with secretion management.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  His nutritional needs were met with a nasogastric tube and tube feeds.
