Last Monday (3 days PTA), her son found some 5 year old Mestinon in the cabinet, and said it wasn't brown or clumpy so he crushed a 60 mg tablet to give to his mother.
On Monday, she did get slight improvement in her dysarthria and ptosis after receiving the Mestinon.
On exam, she had ptosis, dysphagia for liquids and choked with 1 oz of water, and fatigable proximal muscle weakness.

She received albuterol and atrovent nebs.
She was started on mestinon 60 mg q4h with a good clinical response.
While this was thought to be partially dilutional, there was concern for hemolysis as her LDH was elevated (291) and haptoglobin had decreased to 68 from 125 and her direct Coombs test was positive.
She received one unit of PRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable between 27-30 for the three days prior to discharge.
Given our concern, we would recommend should the patient require further IVIG treatments in the future, her HCT should be watched closely and it should be ensured that anti-A titers of future IVIG batches should be < 1:8.
She was followed by physical therapy and speech and swallow services during her hospitalization and will be discharged home with VNA to monitor her CBC.
In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**], patient will discharged on her mestinon as well as prednisone 10 mg, increasing to 20 mg in one week.

Continue your medications as prescribed and please continue frequent blood draws to monitor your hematocrit as this had been low at the time of discharge.
Please continue blood draws as directed below.
If your eye does not improve in the next 2-3 days please discuss this with your PCP or you may benefit from opthomological evaluation.
