She received crystalloid and colloid resuscitation intraoperatively and was taken to the CVIC in critical condition, intubated and sedated.
Family was notified of the critical nature of her clinical state, and she was managed over the next 24 hours with warming blankets, aggressive fluid resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy with blood products, and correction of her profound metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate.
She was in multi organ system failure postoperatively and though she was initially hemodynamically stable, she ultimately required pressors to maintain a perfusing blood pressure and she was anuric.
Additionally she began to demonstrate signs of abdominal distention and DIC, and a general surgery consultation was obtained to evaluate the need for exploratory laparotomy given the concern for bowel ischemia.
A family meeting was held and the possibilities for her care were discussed, including return to the operating room for abdominal exploration, CVVHD, non-operative management, and comfort measures.
