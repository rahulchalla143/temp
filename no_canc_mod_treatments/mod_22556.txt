He used his inhalers (Advair and Combivent), without relief.
He does not have oxygen at home.
Follow up chest CT in 6 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure that these changes resolve.
Brief Hospital Course:    Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 7173**] is a 76 year-old male with a history of severe COPD requiring intubation, trach and multiple hospitalizations in the past.
He was given albuterol and atrovent nebs in the ambulance without improvment.
He received levofloxacin and IV steroids for COPD exacerbation.
Vancomycin was added for MRSA coverage, given history of hospitalizations at VA with MRSA.
He was weaned and extubated on [**2185-4-14**] and transferred to the floor [**2185-4-15**].
Once extubated, levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued.
He was on scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments every 4-6 hours and he continued to use his home Advair inhaler.
He was switched from IV steroids to 60mg of prednisone.
He was diuresed with 10 mg of furosemide to improve his pulmonary status.
)LLL PNA: This continued to show radiographic and symptomatic improvement on levofloxacin (10 day course) .
Vancomycin was stopped after four days as it use was not supported by cultures.
This latter approach included scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebs (hope to eventually transitioned to MDI's), a twice daily fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler, and a prednisone taper.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7183**] unfortunately responded relatively slowly to this treatment, following a gradual waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course of both symptoms and oxygen saturations.
Given his slow improvement and low oxygen sats there was some concern for a PE and a CTA was obtained.In addition, patient received fluids in the MICU, and chest x-ray at that time was consistent with heart failure, however patient diuresed well on his own with improvement.
His prednisone was increased back to 40 mg qd given his persistent hypoxemia and will need a slow taper.
He also had inverted T-waves and ST-depression laterally that similarly improved with his symptoms.
To help alleviate this in the acute period, he was started on clonazepam 0.25mg twice daily with good effect.
6) C. diff- Upon transfer to floor, patient had some diarrhea and tested positive for c. diff, this was treated with flagyl for a 14 day course.
