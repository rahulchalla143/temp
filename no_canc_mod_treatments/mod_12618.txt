Post cardiac catheterization, Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.
In summary, the patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a later date following a complete workup including carotid dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.
The patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his surgery during his preoperative testing.
At that time he was seen by the electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.
He did rule in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac arrest.
A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.
The following morning, [**12-27**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, please see the operation report for full details.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He had a propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.
He remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean arterial pressure greater than 70.
He remained intubated throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.
At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse marginal 1 lesion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
He was weaned from his ventilator and ultimately extubated.
On postoperative day #4 the patient was transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
His activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical therapy and the nursing staff.
He continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10 he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator placement.
