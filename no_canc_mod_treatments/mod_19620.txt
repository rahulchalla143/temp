Assessment:Pt is a 80 y/o M with COPD/emphysema here with increased hypoxia postop secondary to aspiration PNA s/p Achilles tendon surgery.
Given interval change of LLL opacities on CXRs from [**6-8**] to [**6-15**], and decreased BS/egophony on physical exam, and increased oxygen requirements, hypoxia is likely attributed to an aspiration PNA s/p surgery, also possibly involving sedation from perioperative opiages.
