Admission Date:  [**2151-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-5-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Mevacor / Pravachol / Bactrim / Adhesive Tape / Linezolid / Clindamycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3129**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension/Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: This is a 71 year old male with history of renal transplant in [**2145**] on prednisone recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], now being admitted for persistent low-grade fevers after dialysis accompanied by hemodynamic changes including hypotension and RVR.
He had previously been on dialysis before his transplant in [**2145**] for about 6 months but has not been on dialysis since then until about 3 weeks ago.
Past Medical History: # Atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion [**2147**] # Atrial flutter s/p ablation [**2144**] with resultant atrial fibrillation - on coumadin # CAD s/p MI x2, CABG [**2138**] # Chronic systolic CHF # DM2 c/b neuropathy on insulin ([**Name (NI) **] pt) # ESRD [**1-3**] autoimmune glomerulonephritis s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2145**] c/b delayed graft rejection, CRI.
On HD TThS # Pseudogout # R adrenal lesion (stable) # Depression # h/o pulmonary nocardiosis [**2143**] # h/o bladder CA s/p surgery, BCG treatment [**2136**] # h/o GI bleed on heparin # h/o L1 compression fracture ([**2-6**])  Social History: Married and lives with his wife, daughter and grand-daughter.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Atrophied renal transplant is noted in the right lower quadrant, with a surgical clip within the upper pole.
Density at gastric fundus could represent luminal contents although soft tissue mass cannot be excluded; UGI examination or EGD could be obtained for further characterization.
Soft tissue ulceration extending to 1 mm of cortex of lat malleolus suspicious for osteomyelitis.
Peroneal tenosynovitis  3. remote injury of tibio-talar ligament 4. subchondral signal changes in talar-navicular joint related to neuropathy.
Although initial etiology was unclear, likely was related to a MRSA bacteremia with 2/2 blood cx bottles on [**12-28**] positive.
Abx were started - vanco, cipro and zosyn.
He received Vancomycin IV per HD protocol starting [**2152-1-2**].
[**Month/Day/Year **] consulted for wound care / debridement.
It was decided that debridement of the joint would be difficult for the patient to tolerate given his multiple medical problems and thus he was continued on at least 6 weeks of vancomycin IV with [**Month/Day/Year **] work weekly to be followed by infectious disease for improvement in the osteomyelitis.
The zosyn and cipro were discontinued given the source of the patient's fevers was likely the ankle wound.
He defervesed and remained normo-tensive after the antibiotics were discontinued and continued to be stable prior to discharge.
He does remain on aspiration precautions, although per speech and swallow he can tolerate thin liquids, regular solids, and whole medications with supervision including chin tuck.
Differential includes obstructive cholestasis, acalculous cholecystitis, hemolysis, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pulm process.
Hemolysis [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unremarkable.
Was on metoprolol but then had bursts of RVR into the 120s.
Was transitioned to a dilt gtt on [**1-2**] when IV metoprolol wasn't helping.
Receiving HD via fistula, renal team following.
Continued Calcium Acetate TID.
Of note, patient is on chronic steroid dose of prednisone 5 mg daily after failing a wean after having a failed kidney transplant.
Initially thought hypotension may have been adrenal insufficiency so received one dose of high dose steroids, but then with further workup thought likely infection as outlined above.
He will continue HD three times per week on discharge.
# PPx: Systemically anticoagulated with coumadin - his inr has been below goal and he has thus been maintained on Hep SC with coumadin daily.
When the INR is >2 the heparin can be stopped.
bowel regimen prn  # Access: PICC line was placed and then d/c'd prior to discharge.
