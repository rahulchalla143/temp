She had lost apporximately 1300 cc of vblood duriing the procedure and received 2 untis of PRBC post op.
She was then transferred to medicine for management of her hypoxia, SOB, and hyponatremia.
Denied any fevers, chills, N/V, chest pain.
Past Medical History: HTN DM Obesity Arthritis OSA- on Bipap GERD Neuropathy  Social History: lives alone, pet hamster, no tob/etoh/ivdu  Family History: No history of early cardiac death, HF.

Trop <0.01 times three then increased to 0.03 then 0.02 TSH 3.8 CPK peaked to 2500 after surgery around POD 5 was 253  CT Abd/Pelvis [**2101-2-2**]: 1.
During the surgery she lost 1300 cc of blood per the TSICU admit note.
She was given two untis of blood and fluids as well post operatively.
She continued to be tachypneic with hypoxia requiring oxygen via nasa canula.
Plan was for CTA however unfortunately patient lost IV access and therefore was only able to get nonconstrast chest CT.  We then got a D-dimer which was elevated as expected, but decided to go ahead and start the patient on heparin IV for possible PE.
A central line was placed by the procedure service.
Thus we also gave patient some lasix which she responded to well.
Her CPK's were elavated initially but this was in the setting of the surgery and MB's were not done.
Lasix IV was continued with goal of -1 liter per day.
On IV lasix she diuresed several liters.
After diuresing her several liters the lasix was switched to PO.
When she was felt to be compensated BB was added for rate control and CHF management.
CPK was elevated after surgery but this was likely secondary to the surgery itself, no MB or troponin was done.
Fluid restriction was liberalized to 1500cc per day by d/c.
She will need f/u to assess for need for continued fluid restriction.
# [**Name (NI) 16359**]  Pt was started on RISS and continued on her home regimen of metformin.
On transfer to medicine metformin was stopped secondary for concern of development of side effects ie lactic acidosis.
For added control pt was started on glargine qhs.
When she had become more stable she was switched back to her home regimen of metformin; metformin was held for 2 days prior to d/c in the setting of CT dye load, but should be restarted on [**2101-2-15**].
After the surgery Hct dropped to 26 and she was subsequently transfused two units.
# Back [**Name (NI) 16360**] Pt underwent successful fusion and laminectomy of L3-L5.
Her pain after the surgery was controlled by PCApump but this lead to mental status changes.
As her other medical problems resolved we restarted percocet for pain control along with lidoderm patch to facilitate ambulation.
