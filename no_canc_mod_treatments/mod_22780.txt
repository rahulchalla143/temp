Abdominal pain is not radiating and not relieved with a bowel movement.
Also taking bentyl as recommended by her gastroenterologist which has not helped.
Her fecal transplant was in [**2158-7-5**] and helped significantly per her report.
She was given 3L of NS with improvement in SBP to 110s, HR 130s.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Sleep apnea not on bipap 15.
FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY ([**2159-6-29**]): -Mucosa: Diffuse erythema and congestion were noted in the rectum, sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**] and descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
Diffuse continuous ulceration, friability, erythema, congestion, hemorrhages and pseudomembrane with contact bleeding were noted in the transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
Ulceration, friability, erythema, congestion, hemorrhages and pseudomembrane in the transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**] compatible with Severe colitis (biopsy).
[**Month/Day/Year **] BIOPSIES: pathology pending on discharge  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 87472**] is a 56 yo woman with h/o recurrent C. diff s/p fecal transplant ([**7-/2158**]), IBS and GERD who presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain and sinus tachycardia found to have severe C diff pancolitis.
In the MICU, patient was started on high-dose Vanco 500mg PO q6 hrs and Flagyl 500mg IV q8 hrs in light of her severe recurrent C diff.
She required high doses of IV narcotis for pain control, and received aggressive IV fluid due to severe diarrhea and resultant tachycardia.
On the floor, she had ongoing pain requiring frequent narcotics and was still having 8 stools per day.
ID was consulted regarding possibility of starting Fidoxamycin, felt this was not indicated on inpatient basis as Fidoxamycin has not been studied in this specific population so no evidence it would help.
She will complete one-month course of Vanco 125mg PO q6 hrs, and then complete long slow Vanco taper as directed by her outpatient GI Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1356**].
She continued IV Flagyl as well per GI recs, on discharge switched to PO Flagyl.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] will determine whether to continue Flagyl at her upcoming follow-up appointment.
Much of this was likely dilutional from the large amount of IV fluids she received.
To rule out possibility of co-existing infectious, inflammatory or ischemic colitis, flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**6-29**].
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA: In the MICU, patient was tachycardic to >150 secondary to hypovolemia, pain and anxiety, improved to 140s with IVF and lorazepam PRN.
Her sister and boyfriend admitted at that time that patient typically drinks 4-6 beers/day most days of week, so she was started on CIWA scale.
She required both Haldol and CIWA with benzodiazepines.
Social work consult was obtained to further explore this issue, patient declined any further support or counseling for the question of alcohol abuse.
She was started on thiamine, multivitamin and folate during hospitalization and on discharge.
Gradually improved with autodiuresis, compression stockings and leg elevation and had completely resolved by discharge.
#GERD: continued home omeprazole and ranitidine per Dr.[**Name (NI) 60978**] recs.
#RA: initially held home meloxican [**3-8**] [**Last Name (un) **], restarted before discharge.
Held home amphetamine-dextroamphetamine during hospitalization, restarted on discharge.
