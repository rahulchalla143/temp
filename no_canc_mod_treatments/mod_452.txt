The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.
ICU Course: # s/p left hip replacement:  Patient tolerated the procedure well per Ortho although he did have significant blood loss and fluid shifts.
He had a RIJ placed in the OR the postition of which was confirmed on presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He received ancef for 24 hours after the procedure.
He was cautiously weaned from the vent and from Propofol given his prior history of difficulty with extubation and altered mental status.
The JP drains contained serosanginous fluid, and on POD1 the patient was started on enoxaparin 40mg Sc daily.
Pain management was an issue given the patient's underlying hepatic dysfunction.
It was decided that in place of a lumbosacral block, the patient's Dilaudid PCA would be increased to dose to .24/6m and his long-acting oxycontin PO 10 mg Q6H.
# EtOH Cirrhosis - Blood transfusions and insult of surgery would contribute to higher likelihood of post-op hepatic encephalopathy.
Lactulose was started after the patient was extubated.
Continued with azathioprine when taking POs.
# HTN - Initially held lisinopril for now pending fluid shifts and post op hypotension.
Medicine consult for co-management  Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#2.
The patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.
The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was voiding independently thereafter.
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage.
The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen.
