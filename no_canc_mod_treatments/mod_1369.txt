Nasogastric tube in high position with tip above the gastroesophageal junction and advancement suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: 71M with dilated cardiomyopathy with SOB admitted with cardiogenic shock and intubated for respiratory distress, s/p BIV-ICD placement .
Patient required supportive therapy with milrinone and agressive diuresis.
Patient was weaned off ventilator and with ongoing diuresis, able to maintain adequate oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen.
Milrinone was also weaned off and patient was able to tolerate re-initiation of cardiac medications.
Because of significant MR/TR and known dismotility, patient underwent [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD placement which he tolerated very well.
Patient however was kept on aspirin on which he will be discharged.
Patient has not been on a statin and this was not started as inpatient.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely secondary to medication error (patient continued taking lisinopril after this was discontinued by PCP) and decreased forward flow from worsening failure.
This resolved however and creatinine returned to baseline at time of discharge, suggesting this was mostly due to renal hypoperfusion from worsening failure.
# FEN: Patient tolerated a cardiac diet.
