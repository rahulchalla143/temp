The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2157-4-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a coronary artery bypass graft x3, left internal mammary artery to ramus, saphenous vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to PL.
The patient as transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on nitroglycerin, milrinone and liquefied infusions.
The patient initially had a low cardiac index which responded to volume resuscitation and increasing the milrinone infusion.
The patient was continued on a propofol infusion through the first postoperative day due to patient tenuous respiratory status.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's propofol was weaned to off at which time the Levophed infusion was discontinued as patient's blood pressure increased and the patient was subsequently placed on nitroprusside infusion to maintain her systolic blood pressure less than 130.
On postoperative day #3, the milrinone was weaned to off with a continued adequate cardiac output and index.
The patient continued on nitroprusside infusion for blood pressure control.
The patient had been started back on Plavix for her previous carotid endarterectomies and patient had improving respiratory status and was able to decrease the ventilatory support, however the patient continued to have decreased neurologic function and a neurology consult was obtained and a head CT scan was obtained.
The patient was started on enteral nutrition on postoperative day #4.
The patient had a sputum culture sent for increasing tracheal secretions which subsequently are positive for Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and ceftazidine for double coverage of the Pseudomonas.
On postoperative day #4, the patient was started on Lopressor for control of hypertension, as well as placed on Isordil.
It was felt by the neurology service that due to the patient's early improvement in the first week, substantial recovery over the next few weeks to months was possible and it was decided that the patient would undergo tracheostomy and PEG placement and would be evaluated for neurologic rehabilitation.
On [**2157-5-9**], the patient underwent placement of tracheostomy percutaneously by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
After the tracheostomy placement, the patient as noted on chest x-ray to again have a whiteout of the left side and underwent bronchoscopy for large amounts of bloody secretions.
On postoperative day #11, the patient underwent a psychiatry consultation.
As the patient has a history of anxiety, it was thought that the patient has a combination of delirium and dementia complicated by encephalopathy and it was recommended to continue the present management.
On postoperative day #12, neurology evaluated the patient and felt that she would continue to improve over the next several weeks and recommended once the patient was in a rehabilitation facility she could benefit from a dopamine agonist such as bromocriptine 2.5 mg q day and slowly titrate over several weeks to about 20 mg per day.
The patient's ventilator had been weaned down to pressure support ventilation which she has tolerated well.
The patient is on the ventilator via tracheostomy.
Pressure support ventilation 50% FIO2, PEEP of 5, pressure support of 12.
PEG tube is in place without erythema or drainage.
The patient is tolerating tube feeds ProMod with fiber at 55 cc an hour.

The patient is to receive tube feeds ProMod with fiber at 55 cc an hour via PEG tube.
The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
