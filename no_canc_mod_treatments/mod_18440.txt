He was given Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1, [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg, Heparin, Aggrastat, and [**First Name3 (LF) **] 300 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath and intervention.
His vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86, 98% 2LNC .
The patient had Bare metal stent of diagonal graft with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, but negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p CABG x 2 ([**2160**], [**2177**]) (SVG jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex and LIMA-LAD) # CHF with EF 20% s/p ICD/PPM placement ([**8-31**]) # Diabetes  Social History: Patient has never been a smoker and drinks ETOH only occasionally.
Post intervention shows resolution of ST elevations .
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2189-11-26**] demonstrated: Coronary Angiography: Codominant LMCA: LAD: 100% origin LCX: 100% proximal RCA: 100% proximal SVG- jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex widely patent, vein to diagonal with 99% mid stenosis LIMA-LAD: atretic and not clear if used as conduit .
Interventional details: Bare metal stenting of diagonal graft with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent postdilated to 4.5 mm with good result.
Some slow flow after intevetnio which improved with IC vasodilators.
Distal protection with Filterwire used for predilation but was not able to be used during stenting because of technical problems.
There is moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction including hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall and basal septum and basal anterior walls as well as akinesis of the more distal segments of the inferior wall, septum and anterior wall.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Patient is post-median sternotomy and CABG.
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Anucleate squames, histiocytes, casts and numerous red blood cells.
Brief Hospital Course: As noted in HPI pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath and intervention.
His vitals at transfer were BP 112/65, HR 86, 98% 2LNC.
The patient had Bare metal stent of diagonal graft with 4.0 by 18 Vision stent.
Pt was weaned off the dopamine drip in less than 24 hrs after arriving to the CCU since he after only a few hrs had impovement of CI quickly to >2.
BB was held and dopamine drip started briefly for a few hrs.
Pt has a very tenuous volume status and had several episodes of hypotension during the diuresis and uptitration of BB on the floor after having been transferred to the floor on HOD#4.
Diuresis for the ccute on Chronic systolic heart failure was done with IV lasix on top of his home dose of 40mg po lasix.
However, given the low EF the team thought warfarin therapy would be indicated, and was initiated on [**11-30**] with 5mg daily.
In addition, pt was kept on heparin sq while INR was subtherpeutic for DVT prophylaxis, but when INR >2, this can be discontinued.
For his anterolateral [**Name (NI) **] pt was continued on aggrastat for 18hrs post-intervention, and continued on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin.
Since pt was started on warfarin pt was felt to be a increased bleeding risk; the plan was therefore to keep [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] 75 for a total minimum of [**3-1**] weeks, then discontinue, low dose [**Date Range **] 81mg in order to minimize adverse bleeding events.
Statin was continued.
His home insulin regiment was uptirated to achieve better BS contorl in hospital (NPH 6/Humulog 10 [**Hospital1 **] and cover with ISS).
Pt was seen by PT and ambulated on own for 150ft prior to d/c without supplemental O2 and without symptoms.
Anucleate squames, histiocytes, casts and numerous red blood cells."
