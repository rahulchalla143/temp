Admission Date:  [**2155-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-9-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Tetracyclines / Plaquenil / Chloroquine / Sulfonamides / Floxin / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Fever, hypotension.
A new Hickman line was placed 3 weeks ago after [**Last Name (un) **] line became infected and she is s/p 14d vanco course for Micococcus.
Hickman line insertion (for Flolan) was on [**2155-4-29**] and PICC line (for Vanco) insertion was on [**2155-4-28**].
She comes in with 2 days sweats, chills, as well as tenderness, warmth and drainage from line.
She was apparently scheduled for a dental procedure tomorrow for ?
Exam: crusting and purulence at site.
In the ED: Her initial vitals were 98.1 103 145/82 12 94RA, she was started on Vancomycin but developed itching and rash, benadryl given, -> continued vanco at slower rate -> got worse -> stopped.
This is strange since she finished off a 14 day course of Vancomycin dating from her recent visit.

#) Sepsis: Most likely due to Hickman line infection.
She was in the ICU for sepsis for a few days where she received several liters of fluids, pressors which were quickly weaned, high dose antibiotics and stress dose steroids.
She was subsequently transferred to the floor when off pressors x 48 hours.
She was treated with Gentamycin/Linezolid since [**5-24**] until [**5-26**] when Daptomycin replaced Linezolod (see "Headache" section below) and then on [**5-27**] we switched Gentamycin to Levofloxacin to prevent Gentamycin induced toxicity.
All of the antibiotic regimens were per ID recs.
She had a midline placed [**5-28**] for 8 more days of home antibiotics (per ID) to end [**6-6**] and she had her Hickman replaced by surgery without event on [**5-29**].
Based on this, and concersations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (pulmonology) we will continue Flolan at home for now via her Hickman.
We continued steroid taper for a few days after stress dose steroids.
#) Migraine HA: Patient was off amytriptilline for migraine prophylaxis while on Linezolid (due to increased risk of Seratonin syndrome).
We temporized with Toradol, and Dilaudid PRN and eventually switched from Linezolid to Daptomycin per ID so we could resume Amytriptilline which we did a few days prior to discharge.
Coumadin was held for procedures/line placements and she remained off Heparin products without event.
We resumed Coumadin on day of discharge which she is on for line patentcy.
