History of Present Illness: 66yoM with significant CAD s/p CABG ([**2125**]), DES to SVG-D1/OM x2 ([**2135**], [**2138**]) who presents with chest pain.The patient has a significant cardiac history with CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1/OM, SVT-PDA) and DES to ostial SVG-D1/OM, proximal SVG-D1/OM, PCI with DES to ostial SVG-D1/OM and DES to proximal SVG-D1/OM.
He has been on Plavix 75 mg daily and full dose Aspirin.
However, on Tuesday, 10 days prior to presentation, the patient underwent a lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteral stent and foley bag and his Plavix was held.
He is currently 10 days off Plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware.
He presented to a fire station where they gave him full dose aspirin and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended Heparin gtt, Plavix load, and Nitro gtt titrated to pain.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.
Past Medical History: - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - Diabetes - CABG:  [**2125**] (SVG to D1/OM, SVG to PDA, LIMA to LAD) - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  DES to proximal SVG-D1/OM graft in [**2135**], DES to ostial SVG-D1-OM [**7-/2139**] - Kidney stones s/p lithotripsy [**11/2140**] - Current torn ACL - GERD - s/p Appendectomy - Basal cell ca - s/p Hernia repair  Social History: -Tobacco history:  No prior history of smoking.
Foley bag in place with dark red urine.
Dynamic ST depressions in inferior and precordial leads, more pronounced with increasing HR on seria EKGs in the ED.
The SVG-PDA graft was patent to the RCA, but had a 90% retrograde stenosis to the PLSA/PLB.
Patent LIMA-LAD graft with progression of native distal LAD disease.
Patent SVG-PDA graft with progression of disease in the ostium of the PDA that fills retrograde into the PLSA and posterolateral branches.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 66yoM with significant CAD s/p CABG ([**2125**]), DES to SVG-D1/OM x2 ([**2135**], [**2138**]) who presents with chest pain and dynamic EKG changes, found to have SVG graft, PDA, LAD stenosis needing intervention.
# Chest Pain/CORONARIES:  Patient with CABG and DES to SVG-D1/OM x2 most recently in [**2138**] now presenting with chest pain and dynamic EKG changes in the inferior and precordial leads.
The patient's symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing Plavix 10 days ago for a lithotripsy.
He was on a Heparin gtt and was plavix loaded, and his chest pain was controlled on a Nitro gtt prior to cardiac catheterization.
Integrillin gtt and Morphine IV prn were started prior to catheterization for recurrent chest pain refractory to up-titration of Nitro gtt.
He was recommended for CABG-redo and was continued on Heparin gtt and Integrillin gtt post-cath with the plan of continuing through until CABG-redo.
Plavix was discontinued at that time.
The patient had an acute drop in his platelets (described below) and Integrillin gtt was discontinued.
Heparin gtt was discontinued but 5-H risk score for HIT was low and HIT Ab was negative.
Integrillin drip was stopped at 2pm on [**12-15**] and he has been given a total of 3 units of platelets.
However, Heparin gtt was discontinued in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patient has been chest pain free.
In the setting of thrombocytopenia, he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheter and recent lithotrypsy procedure, which was switched to a 3-way foley on CBI.
His hct has down-trended and he received a total of 1 unit PRBC on [**12-16**].
He was also given several platelet transfusions for the thrombocytopenia.
The anticipated platelet recovery with integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia is 4 hours to 5 days, and the patient's platelets slowly up-trended and by [**12-19**] he was in the 100s.
# Urine analysis:  Patient with large blood, significant leukocytes, protein on UA likely [**1-26**] recent lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.
Foley leg bag in place, dark red urine in setting of Plavix, Heparin gtt, ASA 325.
Patient had significant bleeding from around the foley and it was replaced with a 3-way foley catheter on CBI.
Urology planned to remove ureteral stent and foley and following CABG.
Repeat UA suspicious for UTI, started Cipro [**12-15**].
The patient was treated with Cipro 250 mg x7 days for complicated cysistits in male with recent urologic procedure.
(d1=[**12-15**])  On [**12-15**] Mr.[**Known lastname 1007**] was taken to the operating room and underwent Redo sternotomy/ Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (reverse saphenous vein grafts to the second branch of the posterior left ventricular branch, obtuse marginal artery, and left anterior descending artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
CROSSCLAMP TIME:65 minutes.PUMP TIME:  99 minutes.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated.
All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis initiated.
As discussed with Urology, the foley catheter was discontinued per csurg protocol.
The following morning he failed to void and the foley was reinserted.
A second void trial was done on POD#4 and he voided.
