It was thought that it was due to tracheobronchomalacia, which is a narrowing of your airways.
You were placed on bipap and diuresed with lasix.
You were transferred to the cardiology service where you had a catheterization to evaluate you aortic valve and your coronary arteries.
There were no major finds to suggest a specific cause for your flash pulmonary edema, and surgery would not be a good idea at this time.
The pulmonologists will see you in two weeks to do a flexible bronchoscopy and evaluate your airways.
Until then, continue on your medicines and spent time working on your strength at rehab.
Please return to the hospital with any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fevers, chills or any other worries.
