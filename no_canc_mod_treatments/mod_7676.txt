He complains only of irritation of the right eye at the moment.
He initially refused any central line, but was willing to accept peripheral pressors, so he was started on norepinephrine.
When that was maximized and his [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure had still not much recovered, discussion was initiated and he accepted the placement of a right IJ, at which point a second pressor, phenylephrine, was added.
He continued to require both pressors in order to achieve an adequate [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure.
