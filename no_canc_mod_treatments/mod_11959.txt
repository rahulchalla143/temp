She was initially monitored q6h with pulses which remained [**9-14**] although she required continuous IVF for maintain SBP in the 100's and HR remained 100-110.
Repeat TTE showed enlarging effusion with continued early tamponade so she was taken to the cath lab for percardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
She was monitored overnight in the CCU with only 20cc of drain output after pericardiocentesis so drain was pulled the next morning after repeat TTE showed no recurrence of effusion.
Asthma- We continued to treat atrovent nebs only due to tachycardia but reverted back to her outpatient regimen on discharge.
We put her on her outpt oral hypoglycemic regimen upon discharge.
[**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt had a history of HTN but was not on any antihypertensives as an outpatient but we did not initiate any antihypertensive therapy given the pericardial effusion and risk of hypotension.
