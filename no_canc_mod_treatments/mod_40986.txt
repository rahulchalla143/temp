He was then loaded with fosphenytoin for 2 more GTC's.
At the OSH he had a CT head and torso and was intubated for airway protection.
He received ceftriaxone, vacomycin and decadron and transferred here for further management.

Secretions in the distal trachea and plugging small left lower lobe airways with mild subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to aspiration in this patient with a mildly distended, fluid-filled esophagus 3.
After breaking his seizures with ativan and a phenytoin load, he was intubated for airway protection.
Thus, he was broadly covered with IV antibiotics and acyclovir and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a higher level of care.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and received a lumbar puncture to investigate for possible CNS infections as being a cause for his new onset seizures.
The LP was unrevealing, and once all of his cultures and PCRs returned back negative, his antibiotics were discontinued.
At this time, he was continued on scheduled dilantin by IV and his levels were maintained in a therapeutic level.
During the first two nights of his ICU stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] did demonstrate quite a bit of agitation requiring high doses of ativan and antipsychotics to keep him calm.
He had even self extubated in spite of bilateral wrist restraints and had to be emergently reintubated.
Ultimately, his propofol was switched to precedex and he was safely extubated to NC on [**2143-11-4**].
On repeat laboratory testing, we observed a new elevation in his liver function tests (particularly AST/ALT) which was initially thought to be secondary to dilantin toxicity.
Ultimately, his transaminitis subsided without manipulation and he was continued on dilantin.
We discovered that he had at least one seizure before and had been initiated on keppra therapy which he had discontinued because of side effects (severe headaches?).
He was also restarted on his other home medications.
We had several conversations with his sisters who we educated about the importance of him remaining on antiepileptic medications.
He had received broad spectrum antibiotics earlier and out of concern for an antibiotic associated diarrhea, we sent for C diff toxin on his stool which returned negative.
Ultimately, Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] was able to verbalize his understanding of his condition and the importance of taking an antiepileptic medication.
We switched his dilantin from TID to QHS dosing and his sister was also informed about the change.
