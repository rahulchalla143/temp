She was initially treated for an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her course was notable, however, for an elevation in her creatinine, which runs at baseline in the 3 to 3.5 range to as high as 5.
She was seen by a nephrologist there and her shortness of breath was determined to be of possible cardiac origin and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2181-5-30**] for cardiac catheterization after having undergone a stress test, which was markedly positive.
She is status post a right nephrectomy.
She is status post tubal ligation, status post tonsillectomy.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Coumadin, Zocor, Diltiazem, Raloxifene.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL TO [**Hospital1 **]:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Evista, Miacalcin nasal spray, Protonix 40 mg po q day, Cardia 240 mg q day, Cardia 240 mg q day, Plavix 75 mg q.d., Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Prednisone 20 mg q.d., Isordil 20 mg t.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
It was his recommendation to stop the Plavix at that time in preparation for anticipated coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
The patient was ultimately taken to the Operating Room on [**2181-6-11**] where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein to the obtuse marginal and a saphenous vein to the posterior descending coronary artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the Operating Room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone and nitroglycerin intravenous drips.
Ultimately Nipride and nitroglycerin intravenous drips were started on the day of surgery due to the continued hypertension.
The patient was placed on stress dose hydrocortisone due to her chronic Prednisone usage for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Postoperative day one the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilator and extubated.
The patient remained on nitroglycerin for continued hypertension.
On postoperative day two was transitioned to oral antihypertensive medications and on postoperative day three remained on a small dose of intravenous nitroglycerin drip.
She was reinitiated on her Plavix due to her carotid artery disease and was transferred to the surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's epicardial pacing wires were discontinued.
Her beta blockers were increased.
She was begun on cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy.
The patient continued to progress well, although she was slow to wean off supplemental oxygen due to some hypoxia.
She was being maintained on aspirin and Plavix due to her peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease and on the [**6-17**] postoperative day six a urology consultation was obtained.
It was their recommendation to continue the aspirin and the Plavix and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] as an outpatient for possible cystoscopy and CT scan or an MRI.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days and required increasing of her oral antihypertensive medications and today on postoperative day eight is stable and ready to be discharged home.
