At OSH, pt underwent cardiac catheterization [**2160-2-6**] where during injection of dye into native vessels, experienced [**9-5**] CP and severe HTN, relieved with nitro and IV lopressor.
A coated stent was placed but the vessel was thrombosed.
Past Medical History: htn hypercholesterolemia gerd cad- s/p cabg, stents, 3 vessel disease chronic renal insufficiency s/p appy s/p inguinal repair 100% carotid stenosis left (by pt report) s/p cea right carotid  Social History: +tobacco- has tried numerous times to quit but never successful.
Selective limited vein graft angiography of sapehenous vein graft to an obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery  revealed a degenerated, thrombotic lesion of 80% in the mid graft and a proximal 60-70% stenosis partially within a stented segment in the proximal portion of the graft.
Unsuccessful PTCA and stenting in the SVG-->OM with 3.5 Cypher DES complicated by no-reflow phenomenon that failed to resolve despite thrombectomy and intracoronary vasodilators, and peforation treated with a 3.5 covered stent in the proximal segment of the graft.
Vein graft peforation treated with covered stent.
Intr-aortic balloon pump support.
The mediastinum again demonstrates evidence of prior median sternotomy and CABG with indwelling coronary stents.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, left much greater than right.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cardiac: A. CAD with AMI: Pt w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and RCA) in [**2148**] and multiple PCI who p/w exertional angina, + stress test for cardiac cathetherization.
A coated stent was placed but the vessel was thrombosed.
IABP was placed for support and d/c'd on [**2160-2-8**] and heparin gtt turned off.
He had repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2-15**] which was unchanged and no intervention was done.
His CAD was medically managed with aspirin, Plavix (for at least one year), metoprolol, lisinopril, simvastatin.
His anginal pain was medically optimized with imdur 120, metoprolol to 100 tid, and lisinopril 2.5mg.
Pump: Had IABP placed during cath (but for coronary art perfusion, not afterload reduction).
Had episodes of hypotension on [**2-9**] in setting of incresed medications which were decreased.
He was pretreated with Mucomyst for all contrast exposures.
# Tobacco abuse: Counsel on smoking cessation ----------------- PCP to follow up: 1) pleural effusion cultures 2) repeat CT scan in [**7-4**] weeks for resolution of opacities, monitor lymph notde.
