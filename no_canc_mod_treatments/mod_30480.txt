[**2168-12-12**] 04:00AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-4.7*# Mg-2.5  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 y/o woman with steroid dependent asthma currently on prednisone taper who presented to outpatient gastroenterology today for a colonoscopy to work up a past GI bleed.
Notably, she had not been given her prednisone doses for the past two days despite her order for a slow taper.
She received her Lantus 22 units on the night prior to admission, but was then NPO/tube feeds held for her colonoscopy.
Her fingersticks fluctuated in the ER between 52 and 160, however since arrival on the floor she had no fingersticks below the 80s and on the day of discharge had fingersticks in the 200s after we had held her lantus the night prior.
We restarted her tube feeds on arrival to the floor.
She should be covered with her insulin slide scale throughout the day on the day of discharge, anticipating that she will likely run higher than usual, and should be given her pm lanstus dose of 22 units tonight.
Please do not give the patient her full dose of lantus if her tube feeds will be held in the future (consider halving dose).
This is likely in setting of her completing a bowel prep and not taking tube feeds on the day prior to admission, and may also reflect adrenal insufficiency in the setting of a sudden d/c of her prednisone, which was intended to be slowly tapered.
The patient responded to fluid boluses in the ICU and has had stable BP since arrival on the floor.
We restarted her prednisone at her home dose of 10mg po qday and she should continue this dose until [**10-14**], at which time she may decrease to 5mg po qday as directed.
Colonoscopy to be scheduled again as an outpatient with the patient's gastoenterologist to evaluate.
Please be sure to cut her lantus dose by about half when she has tube feeds held for this procedure and confirm this with her gastroenterologist prior to the procedure.
Asthma/COPD: Teh patient was continued on her outpt steroids and inhalers and had no problems while in house.
