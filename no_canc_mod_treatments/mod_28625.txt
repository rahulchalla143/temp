Her head CT demonstrated a possible new parietal hypodensity that was of uncertain significance but may represent a new intracerebral process.
She was treated lorazepam 0.5 mg IV x1, and transferred to the medical ICU for EEG and airway monitoring.
On discharge, she was maintained on Keppra 1000mg qhs and 500mg per HD protocol as well as Dilantin 175mg tid.
Of note, head CT was repeated given the ?of new parietal hypodensity as above.
Did not make any changes to medications as cannot anticoagulate and she is already on plavix.
She did not have a leukocytosis, but did have neutrophil predominance.
She was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient dialyzed prior to MICU transfer with removal of 3L of fluid.
She was continued on vanc/cefepime for HCAP.
At the time of her episode of pulmonary edema with desaturation, systolics rose to the 200s, and this was unresponsive to ultrafiltration of 3L in dialysis.
In the ICU, she was continue on her home medications of Lisinopril 40mg q24h, Lopressor 50mg TID, and amlodipine 5mg.
She was also started on hydralazine 75mg PO tid.
Despite these chages, she continued to be hypertensive, so she underwent dialysis to remove volume.
We continued her sevelamer for phso-binding.

While you were here, you had evidence for a pneumonia, and were treated with intravenous antibiotics.
We started you on medication to control your seizures and they worked well.
You are already on optimal medical therapy for stroke prevention so we did not change any of these.
You were continued on hemodialysis while you were here, and it is important that you continue to go to dialysis as an outpatient.
