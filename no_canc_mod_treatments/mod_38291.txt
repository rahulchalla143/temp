His operative course was complicated by a difficult Foley insertion for which the GU service was called and performed a cystoscopy for Foley placement (see operative note for details).
Post-operatively he was admitted to the ICU on Epi, Levo and propofol drips.
He was intubated and sedated.
Within 24 hours, sedation was weaned off and he awoke neurologically intact and was weaned from the vent and extubated without difficulty.
His pressors and inotropes were d/c'd and on post-op day one he was started on beta blocker and diuretics and received Coumadin for prosthetic AVR.
Also on post-op day one he was found to have a right groin pseudoaneurysm and was given a thrombin injection.
His temporary pacing wires and chest tubes were removed per protocol.
Infectious disease was consulted for gm + cocci in aortic valve tissue in OR and he was treated with Daptomycin due to vanco allergy.
A PICC line was placed on [**7-7**] and he will receive at least 4 weeks of Daptomycin.
Further antibiotics recommendations will be made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9461**] in [**Hospital **] clinic.
On post-op day three he developed post-op afib/flutter and was started on oral amiodarone and his Lopressor was discontinued per his Atrius cardiologist (and with Dr.[**Name (NI) 9379**] approval).
Amiodarone was discontinued, external pacing pads were placed and he was transferred to the CVICU for closer monitoring.
A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed via right IJ and EP was consulted for possible permanent pacemaker placement if heart rhythm didn't improve.
Coumadin was stopped and Heparin started for anticoagulation pending possible need for pacemaker.
Following the procedure he was brought back to the CVICU where he remained for one day for observation and on the following day he was transferred back to the step-down floor for further care.
Coumadin was restarted and titrated for goal INR for mechanical aortic valve of 2.5-3.
EP recommended restarting beta-blockers, as well as reinstitution of Amiodarone and/or Cardioversion when he follows up with his own Cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] mentioned earlier, his Daptomycin will be continued at least 4 weeks and will be managed by ID.
Finally, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will make recommendation during outpatient visit whether to restart amiodarone or perform cardioversion.
