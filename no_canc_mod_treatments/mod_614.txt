NH staff had also noted decreased alertness today prior to her seizure activity and hypoglycemia.
In review of her med list, she was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin and inhaled tobramycin on [**7-10**] (planned for 2 wk course); abx were changed from levaquin/vanco when sputum grew cipro resistant klebsiella (sensitive to ceftriaxone).
Course was c/b probable VAP and she is s/p tracheostomy recannulation during last hospitalization as well as s/p PEG placement as she had been having increasing dysphagia at home.

ANCA neg [**Doctor First Name **] neg dsDNA neg   Brief Hospital Course: # Fever:  Febrile to 101.6 in ED where she received IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin without clear infiltrate on CXR but has extensive h/o aspiration pneumonia and was recently treated for VAP for which she completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin prior to d/c on [**7-4**].
In discussion w/ RN at [**Hospital1 **], she had been spiking temperatures there since [**7-8**] at which time she was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.
Levaquin was reportedly discontinued on [**7-10**] when her sputum was found to be growing klebsiella resistant to ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Thus she was started on ceftriaxone and tobramycin neb at that time.
She was started on vanco/zosyn for ?LLL pna here but then these were stopped given negative infectious workup and no significant LLL infiltrate on repeat CXR.
Sputum grew Klebsiella pneumonia on [**7-19**] which was sensitive to Zosyn and she was treated with a full course of zosyn.
She should continue treatment until [**8-25**].
She was started on amikacin and should continue until [**8-28**].
Amikacin dosing switched to 750mg q24 dosed at 4pm on day of discharge.
She should have amikacin levels draw just prior to administration of third dose (on [**8-16**]).
She had diarrhea of unclear etiology - it may have been due to tube feedings and she was given banana flakes to good effect.
She should continue flagyl for another 7 days (until [**8-21**]) or until B-toxin is negative.
Patient grew MRSA in sputum which was initially treated with vancomycin then linezolid as there was concern for drug-fever with vancomycin.
Linezolid then stopped because of eosinophilia (see below).
She had a UTI with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] which was treated with voriconazole.
Vancomycin was thought to be causing a drug fever as above given that she was febrile to 106F.
Overall antibiotic regimen included: vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6958**]; [**7-28**] - [**8-6**] zosyn [**Date range (1) 6959**]; [**Date range (1) 6960**]; [**8-2**] - [**8-4**] meropenem 1g IV q8h [**8-4**] - [**8-18**] (planned) amikacin [**8-8**] - [**8-21**] (planned) Flagyl [**7-14**] - [**7-16**]; [**8-2**] - [**8-21**] (planned) fluconazole [**7-16**] - [**7-19**] Vori 200 PO BID [**8-4**] - [**8-8**] cipro [**7-28**]- [**7-28**] CTX [**7-13**] - [**7-13**] Bactrim [**7-17**] - [**7-21**] Linezolid [**8-8**] - [**8-11**] .
# Seizure:  Reportedly no h/o seizures previously despite having been maintained on depakote (presumably started post CVA).
On [**7-21**] depakote changed to keppra because it may be contributing to fevers.
Initially euglycemia maintained on insulin drip.
Once patient tolerating consistent tube feeds, she was transitioned to glargine (currently 24 units) and QID insulin sliding scale.
Interventional pulmonology performed bronchoscopy which showed that the trach was in good position but did show largyngeal inflammation suggestive of GE reflux.
#Aggitation she has been receiving standing clonazepam for aggitation/anxiety and occasional ativan IV with good effect.
# Hyperthyroidism:  free t4 3.9 on admission, hyperthyroidism treated with PTU, free t4 normalized to 1.4.
# HTN:  antihypertensives initially held for hypotension and ARF.
Metoprolol restarted at low doses and blood pressure began to increase in the week before discharge.
She was started on captopril and metoprolol increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Outpatient regimen was metoprolol 175mg PO bid, lisinopril 20mg daily, and Lasix 40 mg daily.
These medications should be restarted slowly at rehab to control hypertension.
Ophthalmology consulted who felt this was unlikely to be a corneal ulcer but that there may be some abrasion for which they recommended erythromycin ophthalmic ointment.
linezolid and erythromycin ophthalmic ointment stopped and eosinophilia began trending down.
# ?DVT: given cool extremities with decreased pulses noted [**7-25**] but doppler U/S was negative on two occassions.
# FEN:  Tube feed continued, electrolytes repleted as needed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a low blood sugar, seizures, and fevers.
You low blood sugars were likely due fevers and to changes in your tube feeding regimen and resolved with steady tube feed intake and close monitoring of your blood sugars.
We believe the fevers were due to infections in your lungs with two bacteria and in your urine with yeast.
These were treated with antibiotics and antifungals.
You should continue the antibioitics as indicated below.
