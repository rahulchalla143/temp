History of Present Illness: Patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent, systolic congestive heart failure, and stage 4 chronic renal insufficiency who was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after presenting to the emergency room after cardiac arrest.
He was intubated in the field and lidocaine drip was started.
A right internal juglar central venous line was placed.
He was hypotensive with a systolic pressure in the 70's, and dopamine 5mcg/kg/min was started.

If there is concern for ligamentous injury, MRI is recommended.
[**2105-5-16**] Renal Ultrasound: RENAL SON[**Name (NI) **]: The right kidney measures 10.4 cm.
The left kidney measures 11.0 cm.
Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm, probably due to subpulmonic right effusion, but right lateral decubitus chest radiograph may be considered for confirmation if warranted clinically.
Right PICC line has been withdrawn, and now terminates in the superior right axillary region lateral to the right second rib.
It is difficult to exclude an acute ischemic event but the monomorphic ventricular tachycarida on rhythm strip and known history of coronary artery disease was suggestive of a scar-mediated arrhythmic sudden cardiac death.
Paralytics were used only for induction of the cooling, and he appeared comfortable on sedation for the 24 hours of cooling.
His C-spine was cleared and his hard collar was removed.
He was started on intravenous amiodarone at that time and transitioned to an oral regimen.
Based on his presentation, low ejection fraction, and event noted on telemetry, decision was made to place a defibrillator (ICD) to protect against any further events.
He will complete a short course of prophylatic antibiotics and follow up in device clinic in one week, as well as in one month to check the device.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Vancomycin and Zosyn) given concerns over possible pneumonia based on imaging studies and hypotension.
Initially he was diuresed, however appeared euvolemic during the remainder of his stay without need for further diuresis.
He completed a course of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, with sputum cultures ultimately demonstrating stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
His home medications of metoprolol (although at a lower dose) and aspirin were continued.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on chronic anticoagulation for this.
His coumadin was initially held given a supratherapeutic INR.
He was given vitamin K for an increasing INR while undergoing cooling protocol.
He was kept on a heparin drip during his stay while decisions were being made regarding placement of a defibrillator or other interventions.
After his defibrillator was placed, he was re-started on his home doses of coumadin (2.5 mg all days except 5 mg on Tuesday).
Rate control was acheived by metoprolol 25 mg twice a day (decreased from home dose of 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He will then resume his usual INR checks per his primary provdier.
# Hypotension: Patient initially presented with hypotension after his arrest and required pressor support.
He was kept on a dopamine drip, started in the emergency room, until he was able to be weaned 1-2 days later.
He was treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia as well.
His home medication of metoprolol was re-started and his blood pressure was at goal at time of discharge.
He was initially diuresed prior to extubation, as he had received a large amount of intravenous fluids while in the emergency room.
Given the increasing size of the right pleural effusion upon discharge, he will likely need diuresis soon; however, the administration of diuretics must be delicately balanced with his renal insufficiency until his renal function returns to baseline (Creatinine ~3).
A VNA was also arranged to go to his home and measure daily oxygen saturations and weights.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was treated with lantus and a humalog sliding scale.
He will need continued titration of his regimen on an outpatient basis.
* Patient will need basic electrolyte panel, including BUN and creatinine, checked on Tuesday [**5-26**], to be followed by his outpatient nephrologist.
He was given one unit of packed red blood cells during his stay to help replete volume and improve his hematocrit.
# Disposition: Physical therapy and occupational therapy both felt patient was safe for discharge home, where he could continue to work towards returning to his baseline with home physical therapy.

Please continue to work with physical therapy and ambulate frequently, at least several times a day to maintain your strength.
A few medication changes have been made: - Torsemide has been stopped.
This medication has been stopped due to your renal function being worse than your baseline.
As you renal function recovers, it will be important to restart this medication after discussing this with your physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is important to understand that this medication helps rid your body of excess fluid due to chronic systolic congestive heart failure, or decreased pumping ability of your heart.
- Rouvastatin has been stopped, this can likely be re-started at follow up once your liver function tests are checked.
- Metoprolol has been decreased to 25 mg twice a day.
- Glargine (also called Lantus) has been decreased to 12 units daily.
- Potassium (Klor-con powder) has been stopped due to your worsened renal failure.
- Continue Keflex antibiotics as prescribed to complete a 3 day course after your pacemaker was placed.
The device clinic will call you for an appointment; you will also need to follow up in one month to have your device checked at that time.
