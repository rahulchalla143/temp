Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the operating Room on [**2164-5-1**] where she underwent redo sternotomy, and aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.
She was left intubated and sedated overnight.
She required packed red blood cells for a postoperative anemia.
She initially experienced intermittent hypertension which responded well to Nicardipine drip.
Warfarin was resumed for atrial fibrillation but held after one dose due to supratherapeutic INR.
Over several days, beta blockade and Diltiazem were titrated accordingly with much improved blood pressure and rate control.
INR gradually improved, and low dose Warfarin was resumed.
She continued to progress and physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.
She will be advised to take Coumadin 0.5mg on [**2164-5-10**], and INR will be followed every other day until a steady therapeutic INR is achieved.
