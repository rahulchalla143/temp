Mother is a 33 year-old G3 P now two mother with prenatal screens, blood type B positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, GBS unknown.
Transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation/management of respiratory distress, extreme prematurity.
Cardiovascular:  Initially baby boy [**Name (NI) 406**] required Dopamine to maintain goal mean arterial blood pressures of 25 to 30.
His max Dopamine requirement was 27.
He was given normal saline bolus times three.
On day of life five he was noted to have clinical symptoms and signs consistent with a PDA and he was treated with Indomethacin.
This was both managed with the ventilator, but he was also started on caffeine on day of life seven.
He is currently on 8 mg per kilogram per day of caffeine and his apnea and bradycardic spells remained well controlled.
Respiratory: As stated above the patient was intubated in the delivery room and was treated with Surfactant replacement therapy.
His ventilator settings weaned over the first few days of his hospital course, but subsequently setting have increased.
He was given several doses of Lasix around two weeks of age with a good response and was subsequently started on Diuril on day of life 21.
On day of life 26 he was having frequent episodes of poor air entry and was subsequently started on Combivent MDIs.
The glottis was somewhat swollen and a 3.0 ET tube was unable to be advanced and so he remains intubated with a 2.5 ET tube.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: the patient was initially started on total fluids of 120 cc per kilogram per day.
He was initially maintained on intravenous fluids, prn lipids.
UVC was discontinued around a week of age, UAC was discontinued around four days of life.
The patient did have a PICC until he advanced to full enteral feeds and this then this was discontinued.
When he was approximately a day out from his treatment for PDA, he was started on enteral feeds.
Infectious disease: The patient was empirically started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
These antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours since the blood cultures remained sterile.
At that point baby boy [**Name (NI) 406**] was recultured and Ampicillin and Gentamycin were restarted.
The blood culture remained sterile, but given maternal history baby boy [**Name (NI) 406**] was treated for an additional ten days of antibiotics.
He was treated with phototherapy for physiologic hyperbilirubinemia that peaked at 3.8.
Most recent hematocrit was 30 on day of life 23 for which the patient was given his fourth blood transfusion.
Endocrinology was consulted and recommended that Synthroid at 10 micrograms per kilogram per day once daily should be started.
