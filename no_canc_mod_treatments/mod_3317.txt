In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall, and apex.
He was placed on ampicillin for enterococcal endocarditis.
CT surgery was consulted, but given only mild-moderate AR, no surgery was recommended.
He was started on Ampicillin with surveillance blood cultures, and ID following.
TTE showed a large aortic valve vegetation, with EF 40-45%.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and recommended no intervention.
Per CT surgery, no intervention given AR not severe.
Per ID, gentamicin was added, dosed after dialysis.
Cardiology and cardiac surgery were notified, as patient was clinically improving there were no changes to the plan.
He should be continued on ampicillin and gentamicin at least until [**2166-7-5**] when he follows up in [**Hospital **] clinic, with further course to be decided by them.
He should continue to have a chem 7, CBC and LFT panel done weekly, with results faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in the infectious disease department at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11959**].
Renal was consulted, and given volume overload, pt had temporary line placed for HD.
He was started on nephrocaps and sevelamer.
He had a line holiday given bacteremia as discussed above, on [**2166-7-18**] a tunneled HD line was placed.
Metoprolol was increased in the ICU for improved rate control.
Cardiology followed the pt and did not feel anything other than supportive treatment was appropriate.
He was started on Imdur 30mg daily, with SL nitroglycerin on a PRN basis.
He improves with ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers.
When he continues to be dypsneic, SL nitroglycerin can be used, especially in the setting of anginal symptoms.
Other times, especially if he is anxious, 1mg of IV morphine can remove some of the work of breathing and make him more comfortable.
Hematology was consulted, and workup was initiated on the medicine floors with HIV negative, UPEP negative.
He was started on Mirtazapine & Seroquel and moved from the ICU to the general medicine floor with drastic improvement in his symptoms.

Your aortic heart valve became infected from the infection in your blood and you need a long course of antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) to clear the infection, which were started while you were in the intensive care unit.
Since your bone marrow was also injured you needed blood transfusions.
Dialysis was used to remove the fluid and we gave you nebulizers, nitroglycerin, and morphine to help your breathing.
You also had episodes of chest pain that were relieved with nitroglycerin and your ECG showed changes that were consistent with your known heart disease and the extra demand on your heart from the infection.
Medications started while in the hospital include: Ampicillin (antibiotic) Gentamicin (antibiotic) Morphine (breathing) Albuterol (breathing) Ipratropium (breathing) Mirtazipine (appetite stimulant) Quetiapine (to help with sleep - you should be able to stop when you leave the hospital) Sevelamer (kidney) Nephrocaps (kidney) .
Medications we stopped in the hospital: Ranexa Calcium carbonate Percocet Zofran .
Medication we changed while in the hospital: Imdur was decreased (for blood pressure and chest pain) Metoprolol was increased (for heartrate control) Take atorvastatin instead of rosuvastatin for cholesterol .
