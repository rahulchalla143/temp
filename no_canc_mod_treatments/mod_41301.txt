This is not a pattern of obstruction, but of ileus and requires careful attention for the possible contribution of ischemia.
Further evaluation is recommended with multi-phasic CT or abdominal MRI to confirm the suspicion of portal vein thrombosis 3.

# Seizure: On [**6-26**] patient was witnessed to fall by roommate with associated convulsions and bowel incontinence.
Placed on octreotide gtt with transition to nadolol upon discharge.
Attempt was made to clear the patient with PO lactulose however this produced no effect.
The encephalopathy was managed with PR lactulose initially with some clearing of mental status.
Eventually when ileus resolved was switched to PO lactulose with good effect and had stable normal mental status upon discharge.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved after albumin resuscitation.
Renal was consulted and felt that [**Last Name (un) **] was pre-renal in etiology given FEurea 12.39%.
He was started on IVF/albumin and diuretics were held, with improvement in Cr back to baseline.
From scans it was unclear whether this was a true thrombosis so anticoagulation was deferred in setting of GIB.
On this admission, complicated by encephalopathy and GIB, ascites not an issue after restarting home diuretics.
