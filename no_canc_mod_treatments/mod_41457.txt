HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male, with a history of extensive CAD status post multiple interventions, CHF with an EF of 20%, status post ICD placement, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who presented with pneumonia and non-ST elevation MI at [**Hospital3 **], diagnosed on transfer from [**12-29**], and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
At approximately 5:00 pm on [**12-29**], he had an episode of hypertension, SBP in the 200s, a heart rate of 140s with shortness of breath and satting 80% on [**2-4**] liters of oxygen, treated with Nitropaste, 10 mg IV metoprolol, lasix 40 IV, and morphine with improvement.
Then again on [**12-30**] in the morning had shortness of breath and was treated with morphine x 4 mg, Nitropaste and IV lasix.
The patient also reports having had a light cold, mild cough, and rhinorrhea for 2 days.
Status post ICD placement secondary to syncope and V-tach in setting of an MI.
Amiodarone 200 mg q pm.
Insulin 70/30 sliding scale.
Lasix 40 mg po q am, 20 mg po q pm.
Metoprolol 50 mg po bid.
Isordil 20 mg po bid.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po qd.
Folate 1 mg po qd.
Allopurinol 150 mg po qd.
Plavix 75 mg po qd.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: 1.
Heparin drip.
Metoprolol 75 mg po bid.
Lasix 40 mg IV bid.
Zocor 60 mg po qd.
Amiodarone 200 mg po qd.
Folate 1 mg po qd.
Plavix 75 mg po qd.
Oropharynx erythematous.
The patient was maintained on IV heparin, metoprolol, aspirin, isosorbide.
Given his acute renal failure, ACE inhibitor was held, and the patient was not maintained on a IIB/III inhibitor.
The patient was delayed catheterization until his creatinine decreased, given the risks of nephrotoxicity, and on [**2126-1-5**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed disease in his mid-LAD, and he received a PTCA to the mid-LAD.
The patient got 20 of IV lasix with little effect, and started on an Natrecor drip with lasix 40 IV, and diuresed approximately 1,900 cc to a PAD of 23.
Supplemental oxygen requirement was weaned in conjunction with diuresis, but likely in large part due to percutaneous coronary flow restoration.
The patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2127-1-5**] with improvement of his diuresis, and Natrecor was continued.
The patient was again maintained on aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor was held pending improvement of his acute renal failure prior to discharge.
The patient was maintained on Isordil, metoprolol, Natrecor and lasix drip.
Natrecor was DC'd on the day prior to admission, and was started on a PO lasix regimen of 40-20 q am and q pm.
RHYTHM:  The patient was maintained on telemetry without any events during this hospitalization.
The patient is status post AICD placement.
We continued his amiodarone during this hospitalization stay.
The patient's creatinine continued to trend down with further diuresis and improvement of renovascular flow, to a discharge creatinine of 2.1.
However, while being maintained on Natrecor, his creatinine bumped again to 2.3 up to 2.5, which was likely thought to be due to overaggressive diuresis, and we decreased his lasix dose at that time.
ACE inhibitor was still held off.
Continued with regular insulin sliding scale and his current regimen.
The patient was evaluated by the ENT service on [**2127-1-4**] who felt that the patient likely had exudative oropharynx, and the patient was treated with Hurricaine spray as needed for tenderness.
The patient was maintained on a treatment of nystatin and fluconazole x 7 days with marked improvement.
5) PNEUMONIA:  The patient was initially transferred with Tequin, and was subsequently changed over to Levaquin with renal dosing, for a total 10-day course of Levaquin with marked improvement.
Metoprolol 50 mg po bid.
Isordil 20 mg po bid.
Amiodarone 200 mg po d. 4.
Aspirin 325 mg po qd.
Plavix 75 mg po qd.
Simvastatin 60 mg po qd.
