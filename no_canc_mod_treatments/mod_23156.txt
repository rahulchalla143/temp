Her hematocrit was also followed and she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.
During her ICU stay the Vascular and Neurosurgery services were consulted as her CTA of the neck was concerning for a right vertebral dissection vs. atherosclerotic changes.
She was briefly placed on heparin however at discharge she will be placed on aspirin and Plavix and will have a repeat CTA of the neck in 2 weeks.
At that time further recommendations for anticoagulation will be given.
Her blood sugars were out of control on admission requiring an insulin drip for the first 3 days however she was transitioned to part of her pre admission Levemir dose and this has gradually been adjusted to attempt to keep her sugars between 60 and 120.
Due to her multiple issues a PICC line was placed for medications and phlebotomy however this may be for the short term.
Her foley catheter is scheduled to be removed at midnight tonight.
Following transfer to the Trauma floor she was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy as she was quite limited in her ability to move with her multiple fractures and orthotics.
She will require acute rehabilitation with the hopes of maintaining her independence at home.
