Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo F with hx of esophageal dysmotility (secondary to radiation therapy to neck indicated for thyroid cancer) who is s/p aspiration event on evening on admission.
She has also not had any swallowing rehab or therapy since her radiation treatment in [**2182**].
She had tried numerous outpatient therapies, including peppermint but without success.
Pt was reevaluated by speech and swallow therapy after her ICU stay and had severe evidence of aspiration.
Pt was made strict NPO as it was not safe for her to continue eating at that time.
Therefore, a family meeting was held on [**7-19**] with patient's son's, including [**Location (un) **] the HCP, niece, palliative care, speech and swallow therapy and the chaplain.
S+S worked with the patient in order to offer dietary options that may prove less choking/aspiration and her diet was modified to a soft solid, thin liquid diet.
If a significant choking/aspiration episode were to occur, the goals of care are again comfort oriented and pt should be given IV morphine or IV ativan prn choking or dyspnea according to her wishes.
Pt has made it very clear on several occasionals that she would not want aggressive measures, "tubes and wires", would not want to be a "burden" and desires to eat while acknowledging the risks associated with it.
In addition, she also is clear that in the event of an aspiration/hypoxic/choking episode she would want to be made comfortable and not have aggressive measures taken.
## Hypoxia, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis- The patient was acutely hypoxic and required a non-rebreather initially on coming from the emergency room.
There was also a marked leukocytosis and left shift, and therefore the patient was placed on IV levofloxacin for pneumonia and completed a 7 day course.
The patient's blood gas initially showed hypoxia and hypercarbia, and an a-line was placed for close monitoring of gas exchange.
The patient was placed on heliox with subsequent improvement in her respiratory status as the racemic epinephrine did not work.
Expiratory stridor continued during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, but she continued to sat well with 1-2L NC and was not in respiratory distress.
This resolved with fluid challenges and on day of call out from MICU had trended down to 0.9 and remained normal.
