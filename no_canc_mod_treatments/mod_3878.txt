HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease with a history of inferior wall myocardial infarction in [**2093**] status post CABG in [**2093**] and a redo CABG in [**2111**], who is admitted on [**2124-7-17**] for three days of persistent epigastric discomfort.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of proximal saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of his distal LIMA.
Stent was placed on the proximal region of his saphenous vein graft with no evidence of residual stenosis and result in TIMI III flow.
The patient was started on Integrilin and milrinone and transferred to the CCU.
LIMA to D1, saphenous vein graft to LAD, saphenous vein graft to RCA, status post redo CABG in [**2111**].
Peripheral vascular disease status post CABG [**2124-6-13**] with left renal stent placed for renal artery stenosis.
[**2124-6-14**] bilateral iliac stents placed.
Aspirin 81 q day.
Lipitor 10 q day.

Potassium chloride 10 q day.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 76-year-old male with coronary artery disease now with elevated troponins and occlusion of his saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, status post stent placement with no evidence of residual stenosis.
The patient was started on milrinone drip for afterload reduction and fluid status was monitored.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was continued on the milrinone drip for afterload reduction with the understanding that mitral regurgitation may decrease and improve perfusion.
The patient was continued on his aspirin and Plavix.
Therefore, drip was titrated down and the patient was started on captopril 6.25 tid.
Patient also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a drop in his hematocrit from 25.8 corrected to 31.6.
He received 100 mg of IV Lasix for diuresis as well as continued on captopril for afterload reduction.
Patient was initially on a high O2 requirement requiring a nonrebreather face mask, however, patient was diuresed and afterload reduced, patient's O2 requirement decreased and eventually the patient was 100% on room air.
The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm, however, due to his current ischemia and dilated left atrium, the patient was started on Coumadin to prevent thrombus formation.
The patient was not started on antibiotics, but was given trial of Pyridium for symptomatic relief.
Patient will not be started on antibiotics unless urine culture is positive.
Repeat echocardiogram showed dilated left atrium with diameter of 5.7 cm.
Cardiovascular: A. Coronary artery disease and status post PCI with saphenous vein graft to his RCA.
The patient is at increased risk for atrial fibrillation given LA size and ischemia.
The patient will be continued on warfarin and continued on ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
C. Rhythm:  As stated before, the patient will be continued on his Coumadin for risk of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and will be sent home with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor on discharge.
Podagra was relieved with colchicine 0.6 mg prn.
Patient has had diagnosis of gout in the past, and has been treated successfully with Indocin, however, at the time of treatment, the patient's kidney function was not at baseline, therefore nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories cannot be initiated.
The patient has been successful with colchicine treatment.
The patient was given a prescription for Pyridium for his dysuria, symptomatic relief noted.
The patient was started on Lasix 40 q day and will be sent home on this medication as patient is likely to have dietary indiscretion as an outpatient.
Patient is not likely to require home services.

Coumadin 5 mg po q day.
