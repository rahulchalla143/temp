Admission Date:  [**2196-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-9-8**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**] Chief Complaint: 86M with [**First Name3 (LF) 57714**], SOB, chest discomfort.
Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was identified and punctured with 21-gauge needle after administration of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
The PICC line was trimmed to this length and advanced over a 4.5-French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 38-cm PICC line into the right basilic vein extending with the tip in the SVC.

Thin liquid, Nectar-thick liquid, pureed consistency barium, and one quarter ground cookie coated with barium were administered.
Pt was also noted to have premature spillover with both thin liquids to the level of the pyriform sinuses and to the valleculae with nectar thick liquids.
No nasal regurgitation was appreciated during this study, but velar elevation was still mildly reduced.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Pt had penetration of both thin and nectar thick liquids before and during the swallow from premature spillover.
Pt also had trace to mild amounts of aspiration with both thin and nectar thick liquids during and after the swallow.
The chin tuck and repeat swallows did not reduce the penetration/aspiration or reduce the amount of pharyngeal residue.
Pt has less residue with thin liquids, and was noted to have slightly less aspiration after the swallow with thin liquids.
If pt has 1:1 supervision during theraputic feeding trials to cue him to cough and swallow again immediately after the swallow, he can clear the aspirate material.
Given his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57714**] over time with increased aspiration, pt is not appropriate to take full meals by mouth and is only appropriate for small amounts during structured therapy sessions.
Once d/c'd to rehab, pt can begin trials of thin liquids and pureed consistency solids only with a speech- language pathologist.
When pt is d/c'd to rehab, pt may begin PO trials of thin      liquids and pureed consistency solids with speech therapy      only.

He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on Neo and Propofol in stable condition.
He had complete silent aspiration of liquids and solids and did not have sensation of his posterior pharynx.
A Dobhoff tube was placed and the patient was placed on tube feedings.
He was transferred to the floor on POD#2 and he had a repeat swallow evaluation on POD#4 which showed improvement, but the patient still needs tube feedings and can only have limited ice chips.
He needs aggressive swallowing therapy and this should improve.
His epicardial pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#4 and he was discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#7.
