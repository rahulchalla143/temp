The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable coronary artery bypass grafting.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Nitroglycerin p.r.n., Imdur 30 mg p.o.
On [**2140-12-14**], she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with the left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal with a sequential graft to the OM.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass times of 61 min and a cross-clamp time of 51 min.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm on epinephrine, Nitroglycerin and Propofol drips with two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires and two mediastinal and one left lower chest tube.
On the postoperative night, Propofol and anesthesia were reversed, and she was weaned and extubated without difficulty.
Also throughout the operative night, her epinephrine drip was weaned off, and had to go on and off her Nitroglycerin and Nipride drip for blood pressure control.
Her chest tubes did remain in place, and she was A-paced at 80 beats per minute.
She continued on her preoperative Insulin doses with good blood glucose control.
At that point, carotid ultrasounds were recommended to rule out any further carotid stenosis, and Plavix was recommended, in addition to Aspirin for antiplatelet therapy.
She is therefore encouraged to work with Physical Therapy, and her narcotics and any other sedating medications were discontinued because there was thought to be some component of encephalopathy that was causing her lethargy.
She was accepted at rehabilitation and will be discharged on [**12-22**] to rehabilitation.
