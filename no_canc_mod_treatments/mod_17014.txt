She also had a fever at home (no exact measurement).
She also reported myalgias and decreased PO intake.

An endobronchial obstructing lesion cannot be excluded on these radiographs.
If patient has referable symptoms to abdominal pathology I would reevaluate with routine abdominal radiographs.
Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the upper SVC.
She became hypotensive, requiring transient pressors and a total of 13 liters net volume resuscitation.
Culture data including EBV, CMV, and TB were consistently negative, even after bronchoscopy.
She completed a ten day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but was also on vancomycin.
By chest x-ray, her consolidation resolved quickly after 5 days (post-bronchoscopy for cultures), suggesting increased secretions were a major component of her pulmonary dysfunction.
She had a prolonged intubation ([**Date range (1) **]) with hypoxia during spontaneous breathing trials for many days.
She was extubated on [**9-18**] with steadily decreasing secretions and O2 requirements.
She was treated by aggressive volume resuscitation and lasix to achieve UO > 100cc/hr.
# Atrial fibrillation The patient's MICU course was also complicated by atrial fibrillation for 3-4 days not properly rate controlled on metoprolol or diltiazem.
She was therefore begun on an amiodarone drip, leading to documented conversion on [**9-10**], after which the drip was D/Ced.
In discussions with the cardiology consult service, it was felt that the transient risk factor for atrial fibrillation (septic shock) had resolved and that long-term anticoagulation would not be warranted.
She improved rapidly with hospital PT, however, and was felt safe for discharge with home PT services to aid her recovery.
# Hypertension Her blood pressure was titrated with IV beta-blocker in the MICU and switched oiver to PO beta-blocker once the patient was taking good POs.
Pt discharged on stable regimen of metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with BPs in the 120s -130s except before morning meds.
# DM2 Pt was on humalog sliding scale during the majority of this admission.
She was restarted on Metformin before discharge, and had FSBG in the 100s without humalog support.
#Hyperlipidemia Crestor was held durign this admission out of concern for potentially exacerbating rhabdomyolysis.
# Nasal congestion Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] complained of nasal congestion post-intubation, which was initially treated with Afrin x 3 days.

Your course was complicated by severe breathing difficutly requiring a breathing machine to temporarily support your breathing.
As this resolved as you recovered, no direct therapy was started for this heartbeat.
