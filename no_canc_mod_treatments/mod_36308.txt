Integrillin was continued for 18 hours after catheterization.
Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were restarted on HD#1.
RLE cyanosis observed after catheterization was reduced after removal of venous sheath and did not recur during inpatient course; right sided LENIs revealed no evidence of DVT and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Pt had transient chest pain for 1 day following the procedure, but pain was not associated with ischemic EKG changes.
The patient underwent placement of a 3.0 x 18mm Cypher DES on [**2-11**], this time targeting the second occlusion in the distal RCA.
He continued on ASA/high-dose statin/metoprolol/ACE-I/plavix.
The patient was told to continue the plavix for 3 months post-cath.
There were multiple wall motion abnormalities, including: inferolateral, mid-distal anterioseptal, and distal anterior akinesis; and inferior hypokinesis.
The patient was continued on lisinopril and metoprolol to improve long-term outcomes related to systolic dysfunction.
Cyanosis s/p cath  As mentioned above, the RLE cyanosis post-cath#1 was considered to be due to venous insufficiency.
Depression/anxiety: On prozac and ritalin.
Ritalin was held during hospital course given risk of beta adrenergic stimulation.
The patient was advised not to take Ritalin until consulting his outpatient cardiologist, given this risk.
