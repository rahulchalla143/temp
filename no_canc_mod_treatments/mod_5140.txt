On [**2164-1-26**], she had an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular hypertrophy, inferior basal hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 55%, mild mitral stenosis and mitral valve orifice of 2 by 2 cm, moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45 and an aortic valve of .9 cm by 2 cm and [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
The right coronary artery stents were patent.

She tolerated the procedure well.
She transferred to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit with mean arterial pressure of 65, CP of 12, being A-V paced and on Neosynephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
