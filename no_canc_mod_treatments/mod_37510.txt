The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2174-5-24**] with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (while on Sotalol, beta blocker, and ICD) associated with syncope while sitting in his chair at home.
Device interrogation revealed an episode of VT that was initially treated unsuccessfully with pacing and required 1 shock of 30 joules.
The patient's Sotalol was increased, with beta blocker continued, and his Coumadin was stopped in preparation for VT ablation.
During the procedure two different ventricular tachycardias were induced which degenerated into ventricular fibrilliation and shocked, and both foci were radio frequency ablated.
The procedure was done under general anesthesia,  and he recieved 2.5 L fluids.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

The current study demonstrates moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette in a patient after median sternotomy and CABG.
# Hypotension- The patient had systolic blood pressures in the 90's (while he was on Dopamine drip) which is lower than baseline on presentation to the CCU.
A   potential cause could have been general anesthesia he tolerated the procedure underlying poor baseline systolic function secondary to systolic congestive heart failure.
We held home eplerenone, isosorbide, lisinopril, torsemide, and oxycodone overnight pending resolution of blood pressures.
He wa weaned off his dopamine drip and tolerated well with increase in systolic blood pressure to 100-110. .
S/p catheter ablation with RFA of 2 foci.
Will continue home sotalol and metoprolol as adjunctive therapy.
#Atrial fibrillation/ LV thrombus-Stopped coumadin for case.
- We gave lovenox 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **].
and started warfarin home dose as well fr anticoagulation.
#HTN- Continued home medications .
#Hyperlipidemia-Continued home medications .
LIMA to LAD with minor luminal irregularities.Y graft with SVG from the aorta to first OM and diagonal was aneurismal proximal.
#CHF-Continued home medications, but held Eplerenone,Torsemide, and Isosorbide,   for now because patient is hypotensive .

You underwent a procedure to get rid of the 2 origins on your heart of this abnormal heart beat.
You tolerated this procedure well.
We made a few changes to the medications you were taking before coming to the hospital.
We added:  Enoxaparin Sodium 30 mg SC twice per day (for 10 days).
We discontinued the following two medications because of the concern of lowering your blood pressure too much:  Eplerenone, Torsemide and Isosorbide.
You should discuss these three medications with your primary care doctor, about potentially restarting them at a later date.
