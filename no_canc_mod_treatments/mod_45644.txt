Also, a culture performed on a rectal tube on [**9-13**], showed positive rods and a heavy growth of Bacteroides.
For that reason, the patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics including Piperacillin, tazobactam, and Fluconazole.
On [**9-14**], the patient was examined and it was found that the patient's wound had dehisced and, on [**9-14**], the patient was taken back to the Operating Room where a fascial wound debridement was performed as well as a ventral hernia repair with mesh.
The patient required two units packed red blood cells transfusion at that time.
After the surgery, the patient was started on Physical Therapy as well as re-introduced to clear liquids.
On [**9-22**], the patient began to bleed profusely out of his abdominal wound and was taken again to the Operating Room where an incision and drainage of an abdominal wall hematoma was performed as well as oversewing of a bleeding abdominal wall vessel.
The ileostomy as well was explored at that time.
The patient again needed a number of units of packed red blood cells.
He completed his course of antibiotics and remained free of signs of infection.
It is now [**10-3**], and with discharge imminent, we are looking to placing the patient in a rehabilitation facility for strengthening as well as ostomy care and continued dressing changes.
The patient now only requires about [**4-26**] of a single Kerlix to pack his right abdominal wound, which appears to be granulating nicely and is free of pus or other signs of infection.
