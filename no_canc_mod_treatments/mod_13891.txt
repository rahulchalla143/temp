Past Medical History: *chronic kidney disease Stage IV-V, not on HD [s/p RUE fistula placement [**8-14**]; Nephrologist [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59393**] @ [**Hospital1 4494**]] *coronary artery disease *hypertension *GERD *Pulmonary fibrosis *rheumatoid arthritis: on MTX and prednisone *h/o PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**] [**2127**] *hypothroidism *depression and anxiety *breast cancer s/p L mastectomy *osteoarthritis *s/p bilateral total knee replacements *chronic pain syndrome *macular degeneration   Social History: Lives at [**Hospital6 **] home.
Ext: +palpable thrill on Right forearm over AV fistula.
Suggestion of biapical traction bronchiectasis.
# Altered Mental Status: Multifactorial etiology, including uremia, severe metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia and UTI.
Resolved during ICU course as underlying causes were addressed: acidosis was corrected with bicarbonate infusion, volume repleted, diuretics held, UTI treated.
Acute worsening was most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of high doses of diuretics and UTI.
Note patient was on a 1200ml fluid restriction at the nursing home, which we did not continue here as her sodium level was within normal limits.
Patient has AV fistula as she may require dialysis in the future, though unclear if mature yet.
Lasix was finally restarted on [**3-17**], at a decreased dose of 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
Creatinine remained stable at 2.7 on these diuretic doses.
Plastic Surgery and Wound Care teams followed closely for superficial skin tears on left forearm and right leg.
Please see wound care recommendations of plastic surgery in the page 1 and page 2 of dc plan.
Started on cefepime with ID approval on [**3-14**], completed 7 day course via PICC line.
PICC line in left arm was removed on day of discharge.
Iron supplementation was therefore discontinued.
Methylmalonic acid was elevated suggesting that pt may in fact be vitamin b12 deficient.
She should have a homocysteine level checked as outpatient, and if elevated, consider vitamin b12 and folate repletion.

# HTN: continued antihypertensives but held diuretics until [**3-17**]; see above  # Rheumatoid Arthritis: continued home meds, including low dose prednisone  # Depression and Anxiety: continued paxil, trazodone, clonazepam PRN  # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine, TSH WNL  # GERD: continued PPI  # FEN: renal, cardiac diet  # PPx: heparin SubQ  # FULL CODE but would not want sustained intubation  # Communication: regularly with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 30207**] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 59394**]  # Physical therapy: Physical therapists saw patient  required max assist to get out of bed to chair.
