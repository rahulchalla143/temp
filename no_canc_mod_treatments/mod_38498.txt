Significant short-interal enlargement of the right parieto-occipital parenchymal hemorrhage, with internal blood/fluid levels, likely related to previous anticoagulation, with possible contribution of CAA.
# Neuro: we held her aspirin and coumadin given the hemorrhage, with plan to restart the Aspirin only on [**2-17**] (7 days after her ICH).
However, on repeat imaging her bleed stabilized by her first night here after she had received FFP and factor 9. .
Digoxin was listed on her home medications on transfer, however per discussion with her cardiologist this had been stopped on [**1-15**], so was not continued.
# Endo: we continued pt's synthroid and put her on an ISS to maintain euglycemia.
