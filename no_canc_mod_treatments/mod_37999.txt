Permanent pace-maker was placed without complication.
Atropine (0.5 mg IV) was given and dopamine started with no further pauses, but a subsequent bradycardic episode to 40s BPMs.
Atropine was again given (1 mg IV), however on this occasion she was sleeping and it was unclear whether this bradycardia was symptomatic.
On the following day, a permanent pacemaker was placed (please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 17720**] note for further specification of this device and settings).
Lovenox was  Syncope   Attributed to bradycardia or sinus pause.
After pacer placement and restoration of good ventricular rates, Ms. [**Known lastname 91893**] blood pressure remained within the normal range (80s to 130s).
These all may require up-titration after discharge.
Deep Venous Thrombosis   Course of Lovenox was to be stopped in [**Month (only) 404**] this year and was not.
Therefore this medication was stopped prior to pacer placement and not restarted.
Statin was continued and atenolol continued at half the pre-admission dose.
Endometrial cancer   Treated with XRT and hysterectomy.
Non-active and no related investigations or treatment during the admission.
