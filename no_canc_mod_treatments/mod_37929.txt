BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Pending):    BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Pending):  Brief Hospital Course: 79F with PVD, afib, CHF, COPD, GERD on chronic prednisone 10mg daily (for COPD) and neuropathy transferred here from NEBH [**10-4**] for RLE angiogram, which revealed significant PVD.
She was transferred to the ICU on [**10-8**] for management of presumed sepsis.
She was initially managed with cefepime and vancomycin, but cefepime was stopped due to concern for allergy.
She was switched to meropenem and vancomycin (vancomycin was stopped [**10-11**]).
She did not undergo bronchoscopy in accordance with her wishes (she also had a recent bronch [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for RUL opacity in [**Month (only) 205**], s/p bronchoscopy which revealed "diffuse mucus, cytology negative for malignancy" and also reportedly included fungal debris.
Her hypotension was managed with fluids in the ICU, and she was transferred back to the cardiology service.
She was seen by the Pulmonary team and recommended for a 4 week course of antibiotics (can be changed to Augmentin PO as outpatient) as well as the Infectious disease team for concern of fungal pneumonia.
# Sepsis: She had fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.
She was treated empirically with cefepime --> meropenem and vancomycin for concern of post-obstructive pneumonia.
Resolved in the ICU with fluids, often occured after gentle diuresis for pulmonary edema.
Alternatively, MICU team thought this was [**3-16**] to cefepime and changed to meropenem.
Seems to be much improved now and stable though auscultation and CXR still suggest congestion - holding IV fluids for now, will consider duresis if resp status worsens.
- O2 with Sat goal 90-93% - continue levalbuterol nebs.
- continue prednisone at 10mg daily for now, needs taper - continue fluticasone-solumedrol diskus - ?
need for bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of chronic steroids.
In this patient on chronic steroids with bil UL infiltrates, there is concern for pulmonary fungal infection, ABPA, or histoplasmosis.
# A.fib: Rate controlled on metoprolol and digoxin.
Coumadin held intermittently in house for possible procedures, was briefly maintained on hep gtt.
# PVD: Wound care in house.
- Continued topical hydrocortisone cream (needs to be stopped as outpatient).
# Vitamin D deficiency: Continued supplementation.
Recommend followup imaging: unenhanced CT chest six to eight weeks following the initiation of antibiotic therapy to document resolution (ie, one month from discharge).
- Prednisone should be tapered as an outpatient by primary care doctor after finishing antibiotic course.
- Needs to finish antibiotics for a 4 week course.
Needs 2 more weeks (13 days), ends on Augmentin [**2130-11-3**] (prescribed).
- She needs to stop hydrocortisone topical cream as an outpatient, please ensure she has done this.
- Required a great deal of magnesium in house.
She may need follow up with an allergist/immunologist if this is positive for Asp skin testing.
Will not treat with increased prednisone at this time as no results, but may need increase in prednisone as outpatient if concerned for APBA.

Since your chest x-ray showed a possible pneumonia, we treated you with antibiotics and transferred you to the ICU for a brief amount of time but you were able to be transferred to the floor.
We still do think that you have a bacterial pneumonia, called "post-obstructive pneumonia," for which you should continue to take antibiotics (treatment duration per d/c summary).
