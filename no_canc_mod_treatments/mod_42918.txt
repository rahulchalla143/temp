Of note the patient was recently changed from verapamil 120 mg daily (started two months ago) to diltiazem 120 mg daily due to increased dyspnea.
She was found to have an oxygen saturation of 45% in with solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1 as well as stacked albuterol/atrovent nebs.
Saturations quickly improved to 93-94% on 6L NC with nebs.
She was then treated with lasix 60 mg IV X 1 after CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema.
She was noted to drop her oxygen saturations to 86% on 4 L NC when nebs were completed.
At the time of transfer, her oxygen saturations were 89-91% on 3 L NC (home oxygen).
She denies dysuria, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, hematuria, or increased LE edema.

# Shortness of breath / acute on chronic CHF: The patient requires 3L O2 at home to maintain O2 sats 88-92% and desats with ambulation at baseline.
She required additional supplemental O2 on presentation to the ED.
She was initially admitted to the MICU and while there improved clinically with nebulized bronchodilators and diuresis with IV lasix.
She was transfered to the general medical floor on [**12-11**] and had a good diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.7 on admission and initially felt to be related to poor forward flow in setting of initiation of diltiazem and/or CHF exacerbation.
The patient had not taken any extra naproxen, but did report decreased PO intake prior to admission.
Lisinopril and naproxen were held while her creatinine remained elevated.
# Hypernatremia: On admisison the patient reported one episode of diarrhea after taking laxatives during the week prior, but otherwise no good explanation for hypernatremia.
She has continued her usual lasix prescription as directed by her physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved during MICU stay with IV and PO lasix boluses.
# Hypertension: The patient remained normotensive with SBP 100s-130s despite holding of both her lisinopril (due acute renal insufficiency) and her diltiazem (due to CHF exacerbation).
