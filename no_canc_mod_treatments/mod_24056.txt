female with OSA/COPD (on home O2 with BIPAP at night), schizophrenia, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF 40% presents with dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory distress > CHF flare.
According to her primary physician and her daughter, she has been extremely non-compliant with BIPAP and home medications.
Baseline CO2 elevated (~70s-80s) per records from [**Hospital3 **].
She was initially placed on a CPAP mask with bimodal settings in the ER, but upon arrival to the MICU  she was unresponsive to deep sternal rub and as she was Do-not-intubate code status, she was placed on AC setting through the CPAP full face mask.
She was able to wean to nasal cannula after ~14 hours with pCO2 in the high 70s.
She was then placed on Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) mode through the CPAP mask with pressures of 18 and had tidal volumes of ~450 with a rate set at 22.
Over the next 2 days she was able to be weaned to BiPAP at night only (using her home nasal BIPAP mask) and it was decided that we would not check blood gases unless she had a change in mental status and would not prematurely start BiPAP (prior to the evening) unless her pH was <7.3.
She was initially given duonebs q1 hour, then q2 hours, then weaned to q4 hours.
She was also empirically treated with 125 solumedrol x 2 days, then prednisone taper.
She was also treated empirically with levaquin 500 x 7 days.
She was diuresed 2 liters per day for a length of stay (-) 6 L with IV lasix boluses.
As she was initially hypertensive, she was started on a Nitro drip with good blood pressure control.
This was weaned off on HD #2.
Toprol 50, digoxin, ACE-I were restarted but limited at times by bradycardia.
Positive pressure to reduce afterload was used at night (as above).
