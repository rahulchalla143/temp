She was recently diagnosed with stenosis of the left CFA with blunted graft velocities.
Endarterectomy with graft revision with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was planned after resolution of her groin infections.
Past Medical History: HTN / CVA x2 ([**2096**]) / DM / depression / PVD / eczema / L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2103**])/ L CEA [**2097**] / bilateral carotid stents / L TKR / choly / Left Lower Extremity Angiography w/ iliac stent placement / left common femoral artery angioplasty ([**2111**])   Social History: Smoker.
The patient is post bilateral total knee arthroplasties, with no evidence of hardware loosening or failure.
A femoropopliteal (above-knee) bypass is again seen, with unchanged moderate narrowing at the common femoral takeoff (3A:91), but demonstrating wide patency otherwise.
Three-vessel runoff is demonstrated (3A:293), however, there is marked attenuation of the left anterior tibial artery in comparison to the prior CT examination (3A:345), and diminutive flow is seen at the dorsalis pedis.
Right three-vessel runoff is again seen, with mild irregular attenuation of the posterior tibial artery.

The endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the carina.
The NG tube is in adequate position.
She was placed on a heparin gtt and brought to the Endovascular Hybrid room for left groin cut down and possible intervention.
Her vessels were heavily calcified and intervening was thought to be unsafe and so the case was aborted.
She was later transferred to the floor with the heparin drip continued.
Shw was given 20 of IV lasix as well as transfused 2 Units PRBC's for a Hct of 22.8.
Ultimately she received an additional 3 units of packed cells.
We offered the pt amputation as an option for her dry gangrene, she refused.
She refused most care and intervention and a psych consult was obtained for competancy.
A meeting was held with the pt and her husband and it was determined that she was able to make appropriate decisions for her own care.
