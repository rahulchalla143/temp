Admission Date:  [**2101-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: melanotic stool  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation central venous line placement arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 60517**] is a 66 y.o.
Male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, ascites, ?cirrhosis, Grade I varicies, pulmonary sarcoidosis, s/p recent hospitalization for melena requiring PRBC transfusion presents for a TIPs evaluation.
Given that he was just started on Iron supplements he decided not to come into the hospital immediately, however after he noted some epigastric pain on Satruday as well as a low grade temp his wife decided to take him to the hospital.
He was noted to be hypotensive at the time in the 60s (usual SBP is 90s), his Hct was 27.8 (his prior Hct baseline is 27) and he was given IVF and transfused 2 units.
His bleeding was treated with Argon plasma coagulation, and was thought to be non-hemodynamically significant rectifiable only by liver transplant or TIPs procedure.
His upper endoscopy on [**2101-7-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for screening purposes during a hospitalization for abdominal pain.
His Nadolol was discontinued but then restarted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] given the portal hypertensive gastropathy.
After this finding Cardiology were consulted an pt was felt to be at high risk for bleeding given his gastropathy and the need for antiplatelet therapy during catherization.

On admission, his stool was noted to be guaiac positive, however he was not actively stooling due to administration of immodium prior to drive from [**Location (un) 3844**].
IV PPI was started and nadolol was continued on admission.
Patient was started on bowel regimen.
Nadolol was discontinued on day 6 of admission due to heart rate in the low 60's so as to not mask tachycardia in setting of possible bleed.
Abdominal pain was also noted to be associated with nausea and emesis, tube feeds were held with some resolution.
Tube feeds were re-started slowly and titrated to goal over many days, with intermittent discontinuation due to nausea.
On day 9 of admission, paracentesis was repeated which was positive for SBP with neutrophil count of ~1700 when corrected for blood from traumatic introduction of needle.
Paracentesis was positive for SBP (~1700 neutrophils) and patient was started on Ceftriaxone.
Antibiotic coverage was changed to Cefepime and Vancomycin (Vancomycin added due to finding on CXR in LLL).
Patient showed imrpovement with change of antibiotics with resulting decrease in white blood cell count.
IV Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Repeat paracentesis showed increased neutrophils in ascitic fluid and antibiotic coverage was changed to meropenem.
He had a repeat diagnostic paracentesis in the MICU on [**2101-9-3**], which was again positive for SBP despite coverage with vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro/flagyl.
Acute Renal Failure - Patient admitted with creatinine of 1.8, elevated from baseline ~1.4 on previous admission.
Patient did not respond to albumin challenge.
Due to tube feed hold [**1-10**] nausea and emesis, patient was placed on maintenance fluids while not recieving feeds.
With worsening renal function to 2.4, patient was given NS boluses and additional fluids which he responded to.
He was maintained on octreotide and midodrine, as well as daily albumin.
He was intubated on arrival.
He was found to have a large consolidation and started on vanco/flagyl, in addition he was maintained on meropenem and cipro as above.
Therapeutic paracentesis was attempted on [**9-3**] to improve respiratory status, but only a liter could be taken off.
Family opted not to repeat paracentesis given overall deteriorating clinical picture.
Patiently was previously considered for TIPS procedure at [**Hospital1 18**] about 1 month prior to admission, but this was not done due to cardiac risk factors.
Cardiology was re-consulted during this admission and determined that the risk of cardiac intervention was higher than with the TIPS, so cleared patient for TIPS and to deal with any cardiac complication as they arise.
Additionally, the prospect of possible transplant had been discussed previously with the patient and family, however due to his decreased ejection fraction (>45%), he is not a candidate for transplant at [**Hospital1 18**].
At family's request, patient was to be referred to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location 14660**] for evaluation for possible CABG-liver transplant upon discharge.
Before patient was able to receive TIPS procedure he was sent to the ICU for respiratory failure after possible aspiration event.
# History of NSTEMI/EF 45% - Patient with history of NSTEMI during prior hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**] with resultant EF 45%.
He was also noted to have a continued significant GIB with falling HCT requiring multiple transfusions of blood products and plasma.
Patient was broadly covered with Vancomycin, Meropenum, Cipro and Flagyl.
Echo was performed which showed wall motion abnormalities in the corresponding territory suggesting significant myocardial ischemia; however, given comorbid illness and active GIB, patient was not candidate for intervention or anti-coagulation.
Patient also began to develop atrial fibrillation with runs of rapid ventricular response, causing further demand ischemia which was treated with metoprolol PRN for rate control.
A second therapeutic / diagnostic paracentesis was performed demonstrating continued SBP despite broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Patient continued to deteriorate with multi-organ system failure and no progression with aggressive therapeutic interventions by ICU team.
The patient was extubated and all medical therapy was withdrawn.
The patient was started on a morphine drip.
