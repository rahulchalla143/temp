SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: A left subclavian large-bore dual-lumen catheter reaches the high atrium.
Cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, and bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left), have not changed significantly since the prior exam.
RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained from the patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the left arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
Using palpatory technique and after injection of 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, the AV fistula was accessed with a 21 gauge needle pointing towards the venous outflow.
A 0.018 guide wire was placed.
The needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
The micropuncture sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French vascular sheath over a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire.
A roadmap venogram was obtained, and a 6 mm balloon was advanced over the wire up to the level of the narrowings, and several balloon dilations were performed at dilations up to 15 ATM.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Partial angiographic improvement after angioplasty with 7 and 6 mm balloons.
He was started on a PPI.
He received HD on first 2 days of admission given extensive volume overload and then resumed on his regular outpatient schedule.
An AV fistulogram was done which showed stenosis at the venous anastomosis and angioplasty was done x4 with partial resolution.
ASA was initially held given GI bleed but resumed on hospital day #4.
Patient was continued on his statin and labetolol.
Of note, his Amlodipine, Isosorbide and Lisinopril were held during hospitalization given his normal BP and use of cocaine prior to admission.
He was restarted on his Lisinopril on the day of discharge given his slightly elevated BP.
His Amlodipine and Isosorbide were held upon discharge.
#DM: Patient continued his home insulin regimen.
He has poor follow up, however, with the outpatient appointments made for him on prior hospitalizations.
Patient was seen by psychiatry during his stay for agitation and delirium  which occured during his initial ICU stay.
THe patient received Seroquel for his agitation.
