The patient was started on IV heparin and then became apneic and hypotensive in the emergency room.
This required intubation and administration of dopamine.
All of these stopped with the initiation of intra-aortic balloon pump.
The initial impression was to try to close this with a clam shell procedure which is going to offer her best chances of stabilizing a hemodynamics given that she became to be very hypotensive.
She was started on aspirin, Plavix and maintained on IV heparin.
She was also started on Lipitor.
Initially, we could not start a beta-blocker given her complete heart block and hypotension.
This volume overload was gradually improved with gentle diuresis and sometimes with autodiuresis.
Once the condition improved, she was started on Captopril which she tolerated a small dose.
The balloon pump was stopped and had no significant effect on her hemodynamics.
She required pressors for about 10 consecutive days, but eventually was able to be weaned off completely and maintained good blood pressure.
Because of this, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
She received a 14 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl with marked improvement in her symptoms.
Both local lines were stopped and she received a 14 day course of IV vancomycin.
She required initiation of IV insulin drip and this was continued for at least 4 days.
Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for protection.
She had a very prolonged and complicated course including inability to wean over a week, pneumonia and fluid overload.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had some episodes of bleeding from the oropharyngeal tract, but this is believed more to be due to injury from the TE and intubation rather than any gastrointestinal bleed.
Plavix 75 p.o.
Aspirin 325 p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
