She was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] at 5:40 p.m., where her HR was in the 130's, BP was 200/100, and she was documented in one note as awake and following commands, and in another as staring and not very responsive.
She was given 2 mg of Ativan at that time, 500 mg of Dilantin, and then intubated for airway protection.
She received etomidate and succinylcholine for the intubation.
The propofol was held during transport so that we could obtain an unsedated examination here.
She ambulates with a walker due to balance problems.
She was initially on Dilantin, then added Neurontin in [**2171**]; then taken off Neurontin and started Keppra in [**2173**]; then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with 2 breakthrough seizures in the setting of a missed dilantin dose in [**2174**], at which point her Keppra was increased; her last hospitalization = last significant seizure was in [**5-19**], when she was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 882**], and her Keppra dose was increased, as was Dilantin.
Per her daughter, the current plan is to slowly wean off the Keppra, due to inefficacy, and continue the Topamax and Dilantin.
