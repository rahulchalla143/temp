This could be a mix of pneumonia, aspiration and hemorrhage.
The lesions have already been investigated with MRI and bone scan and were negative on bone scan.
Left midline catheter now terminates at the junction of the axillary and subclavian veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o F with history of Granulomatosis with polyangitis complicated by tracheobronchial disease presenting to the ICU following post procedural intubation with course complicated by sepsis, serratia post-obstructive pneumonia.
She went back to the OR for repeat rigid bronchoscopy no stent placed, but had therapeutic aspiration of secretions and debridement of scar tissue with recannalisation of left upper and lower lobe segments.
Patient was weened off of ventilator and transfered to the floor on [**10-8**].
She will finish a 14d antibiotic course with levofloxacin and flagyl.
# Hypotension: Pt developed hypotension periprocedurally initially thought to be secondary to propofol but this persisted despite switching to fentanyl and versed for sedation.
She required pressor support with neosynephrine and then levophed initially and she received fluid resuccitation.
She received stress dose steroids and her blood pressures improved with weaning off of pressors.
Patient initially treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn started on [**10-5**], subsequently Zosyn alone.
BP normalized after antibiotics and stress dose steroids and WBC trended down.
On [**10-11**] patient started on PO Levofloxacin and Flagyl and will complete 14 day course on [**10-20**].
She was continued on her home prednisone 15mg daily, advair, ipratropium, albuterol and prophylaxis with atovaquone.
# Orolabial HSV:  started acyclovir for suspected HSV infetion of tounge.
# Bradycardia: she had initial tachycardia when she arrived from home for her IP procedure.
#Lower extremity edema: no hx CHF with EF [**2174**] 60-65%, mild pulmonary artery HTN Lasix held in MICU and restarted on the floor.
# s/p Breast cancer treated with mastectomy, right lympadenectomy and chemotherapy in [**2143**].
PENDING TESTS ON DISCHARGE: -ESR AND CRP  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -followup with rheum to decide further immunosuppression due to recurrent airway closure from granulation tissue from wegeners -completion of anitbiotics levaquin and flagyl [**10-20**] -acyclovir for 5d ending [**10-17**] -aggressive nebs and incentive spirometry.
