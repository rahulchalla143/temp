Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 101787**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the Emergency Room and based on exam and xray had an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and surgery was recommended emergently.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2113-9-15**] and underwent repair of a strangulated right inguinal hernia with ileocolectomy and lysis of adhesions.
he tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
He remained intubated and sedated.
Soon thereafter he developed elevated bladder pressures, a decreasing hematocrit and some hypotension requiring bedside exploratory laparotomy with resection of some necrotic small bowel with subsequent discontinuity.
He was resuscitated with IV fluids and blood and his lowest hematocrit was 24.
He also developed a left pneumothorax following central line placement requiring chest tube placement with complete re-expansion of the lung.
On [**2113-9-17**] he was taken back to the Operating Room for a washout, enteroenterostomy and delayed primary closure.
He tolerated that procedure well and again returned to the ICU in stable condition.
He remained intubated for 3 additional days and eventually was successfully extubated on [**2113-9-20**].
He needs cueing and help at this point with feeding and will gladly take protein supplements.
On [**2113-9-25**] his hematocrit was 23.6 and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service and found to be very deconditioned and in need of a short term rehab prior to his return home.
