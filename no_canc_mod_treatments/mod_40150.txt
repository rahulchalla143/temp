An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.
The NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant with its tip just beyond the GE junction.

Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo M h/o AF (not on anticoagulation), HTN, HL, DM2, CKD from chronic nephrolithiasis p/w confusion, speech arrest, and convulsive seizure of unclear etiology.
He was sedated and intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Out of concern for seizure as the etiology, he was loaded with Keppra and placed on EEG for another 24 hours.
The phenytoin is slowly being tapered off and the patient is being continued on Keppra 1 g po bid.
He was started on warfarin and bridged with a heparin infusion.
He was on aspirin but not on anticoagulation prior to this event.
Throughout the rest of his stay the patient was restarted on his home medications but continued to have episodes of RVR.
His diltiazem was increased to 90mg po qid and metoprolol was increased to 25mg po bid.
Digoxin 0.125mg po daily was continued as well.
EP was consulted and recommended that the digoxin be stopped as they did not feel it was helping.
The metoprolol can be increased to tid if needed.
His home medication allopurinol had been held while he was in the ICU but restarted at transfer.
Given the large amount of pain the patient was in, we gave him IV steroids x 1 followed by a po prednisone taper.
[] Hyperglycemia - While on the steroids for his gout flare, his blood sugars have been high.
Please continue him on an insulin sliding scale until the prednisone taper is over.
After this we restarted his previous dose of lisinopril per his PCP, 10mg po daily.

These seizures were coming from the left side of your brain and imaging shows that you had a stroke days to weeks prior on the left side of your brain as well.
-Your seizures were controlled with the help of an anti-seizure medicine.
Please continue to take one of these medicines, Keppra 1 g by mouth twice a day.
- We have you on a blood thinner, warfarin (coumadin) to decrease the chances of stroke since you have atrial fibrillation.
We consulted the cardiology team, who recommended stop digoxin and continuing on diltiazem and metoprolol at this time.
They do not currently feel that you would benefit from any other intervention at this time.
Given the amount of pain you were in, we treated you with steroids to decrease the inflammation.
Please continue to prednisone taper we have placed you on as written (50mg x2days, 40mg x2days, 20mg x2days, 10mg x2 days, and then stop).
You should start taking colchicine 0.6 mg by mouth every other day after finishing this taper to prevent recurrent attacks.
Please continue taking allopurinol 100mg by mouth daily.
For the long term, you need to be consistently on allopurinol and your dose should be titrated as an outpatient to reach a uric acid level <6.
We have asked that you be monitored with a insulin sliding scale while you are on steroids.
