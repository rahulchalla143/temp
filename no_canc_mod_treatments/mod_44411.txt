Extinction and Neglect: unable to assess  History of the Present Illness: This is a 51yo M with a history of multiple medical problems notable for bilateral orichiectomy for left testicular seminoma, EtOH and tobacco abuse, HOCM s/p septal ablation x 2, s/p AICD placement, L5-S1 disc herniation and spontaneous pneumothorax s/p partial lung resection who was in his USOH this evening until about 1AM on [**2177-2-24**].
He was placed on his side and in minutes his tonic stiffening stopped.
Minutes later, they started again and then once again stopped after providing IV lorazepam.
He was brought back to the trauma room where he was endotracheally intubated and began to receive a dilantin load.
Unfortunately, the combination of propofol and dilantin dropped his blood pressures significantly but were fluid responsive.
Only a routine EEG was done and this showed no interictal epileptiform discharges.
He has since had one more routine EEG which returned as normal.

An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.
An esophageal catheter is in place with tip within the stomach and side port at or just beyond the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction.
A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is in standard position.
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
In the interval, the patient has received a new right central venous access line.
TRACING #1  Read by:	[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] S.  	Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 94	160	136	380/439	59	-85	52  Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo man with a history of multiple medical problems including bilateral orchiectomy for L testicular seminoma, longstanding EtOH and tobacco abuse, HOCM s/p septal ablation x2, s/p AICD placement and subsequent replacement, L5-S1 disc herniation and spontaneous pneumothorax s/p partial lung resection and in addition multiple neurological symptoms felt to be functional in origin who presented with slurred speech and right facial droop found to have had seemingly 5-6x GTC "seizures" with reasonably retained consciousness in between and was intubated for airway protection in the ED and transferred to the ICU.
His course was complicated by low BP's likely secondary to phenytoin/propofol/lorazepam/fentanyl/midazolam received, so he was started on levo in the ED and this was not continued in the ICU.
He was initially treated with keppra and this was latterly stopped on discharge.
These possible seizures may have been related to the patient tapering his alcohol use although given his long history of functional presentations and functional examination post extubation raises the possibility of non-epileptic events.
His weakness improved and he was discharged home on [**2177-2-26**] with home PT and neurology follow-up.
He had 2 more en route then 2 more seizures in the ED an these were treated with total 4mg IV lorazepam.
Given several possible seizures during assessment by neurology, including the last in the CT scanner he was therefore intubated in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He was transiently hypotensive likely due to a combination of phenytoin load, lorazepam which along with propofol dropped his BP significantly to the low 80's.
He was switched to fentanyl/midazolam sedation and given hypotension and posible seizures was treated with broad spectrum IV antibiotics in the ED in addition to brief treatment with levo which was stopped on arrival to the ICU.
He was started on keppra given possible seizures and was placed on LTM to evaluate for possible seizure activity.
EEG initially showed encephalopathy while the patient was intubated and sedated, but once sedation was weaned, there was no noted seizure activity from [**Date range (1) 21759**]/[**2177**].
He was rapidly able to be extubated on [**2177-2-24**] and post-exubation examination revealed a functional right hemiparesis with right hemisensory disturbance and mental state examination as intact.
He was placed on a CIWA scale for possible withdrawal given long alcohol abuse history and alcohol level 255 on presentation.
Patient was also started folate and thiamine repletion.
He remained stable on the floor other than persistent right sided functional sensory-motor examination.
These possible seizures may have been related to the patient tapering his alcohol use although given a completely normal EEG LTM and functional examination raised the possibility of non-epileptic events.
# Cardiovascular: Given transient hypotension in the ICU, his home hypertensives were initially held but restarted on discharge.
We continued aspirin in house.
# Endo: Patient was commenced on an ISS to maintain euglycemia.
Hemoglobin A1C and lipids were at goal and this was stopped.
# Infectious disease: Pt was noted to be hypotensive in the ED, likely from many sedating medications given.
He was initially started on vanc/zozyn in the ED given concern for an infectious process given hypotension and new onset seizures.
We started folate and thiamine and patient was discharged on this.

You were started on an anti-seizure medication called keppra and were monitored with EEG (brain wave study) continuously.
You were assessed by physical therapy and deemed to benefit from home PT.
