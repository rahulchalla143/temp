Admission Date:  [**2119-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-8-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Found down, altered mental status, SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion of R IJ line [**2119-5-7**].
Insertion of L radial arterial line [**2119-5-7**].
Blood and urine cx were obtained and patient was given levaquin/CFTX for fever without a clear source of infection.
She then became hypotensive to SBPs of 60 despite 3-4L NS resuscitation and required levophed at 0.15 via a RIJ.
In the MICU patient continued to meet criteria for SIRS (T102.5 HR 120-140 MAP 104 on levo, RR 26 98% on CPAP and CXR was concerning for atypical or viral pneumonia.
On [**2119-5-8**] patient was weaned off pressors, HR decreased with metoprolol.
Patient was weaned off CPAP with the help of nebs, lasix diuresis, and methyprednisone.
Patient's clinical response to stress steroids raised suspicion for adrenal insufficiency [**1-11**] acute illness or chronic disease.
She was continued on dexamethasone on transfer to the floor so that AM cortisol could be measured should she remain hypotensive when steroids were stopped.
Her CK also trended down on IVF (5000-->2969-->941-->559).
Tachycardia of unknown etiology, admitted [**3-19**] and started on beta-blocker, ECG with sinus tachycardia 6.
CBC on treatment for C diff: [**2119-5-16**] 08:35PM BLOOD WBC-14.3* RBC-3.78* Hgb-10.9* Hct-33.2* MCV-88 MCH-28.9 MCHC-32.9 RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-146*# [**2119-5-17**] 07:30AM BLOOD WBC-12.5* RBC-3.58* Hgb-10.1* Hct-31.3* MCV-88 MCH-28.1 MCHC-32.1 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-354#  Brief Hospital Course: 83 year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, diastolic heart failure found down [**2119-5-7**] with altered mental status, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxia, hypotensive most likely [**1-11**] acute parainfluenza on chronic lung disease and heart failure.
Patient was transferred by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**], admitted to the MICU for CPAP and pressor support for two days, stabilized and transferred to the floor on [**2119-5-10**].
Patient developed leukocytosis [**Date range (1) 22666**] and was found to be C diff positive [**2119-5-15**] and received appropriate treatment with vanc/flagyl.
So patient was empirically treated with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
By HD#2, pt had acute episode of SOB treated with diuresis, nebulizer treatment, methylprednisolone, and CPAP.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and Zosyn and discontinued ceftriaxone.
Pt was persistently hypotensive, meeting SIRS criteria, with fever spikes on antibiotics and was placed on levophed for blood pressure support.
Parainfluenza swab came back positive on HD#3 and all antibiotics were discontinued.
Levophed switched to dopamine, which was initally  weaned off on HD2 but had to be restarted HD#3 due to a similar SOB episode as patient received IVF hydration before CT scan.
She returned from CT with diffuse wheezing and was given nebulizers, diuresis, and methylprednisolone for refractory wheezing.
Cortisol level checked on [**5-7**] but inaccurate given previous steroid administration.
Patient was hemodynamically stable and off pressors [**2119-5-9**] - [**2119-5-10**] on 2g Q6H dexamethasone.
Patient's oxygen demands were weaned with the assistance of combined nebs, gentle Lasix diuresis and steroids.
She was weaned to 2L NC [**2119-5-10**] and transferred to the floor on room air [**2119-5-11**].
Given her improving clinical appearance she was given a trial off steroids on the floor [**2119-5-11**], which she tolerated well so steroids were discontinued.
#) Clinical adrenal insufficiency: Patient's clinical response to steroids in the ICU initially raised concerns for adrenal insufficiency.
She was switched to dexamethasone 2 mg PO q8h hrs before transfer to the floor on HD3 so that [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test could be performed.
Patient was trialed off steroids on HD4, however and SBP remained >100 until patient developed hypotension with C diff infection [**2119-5-15**].
However, if patient develops hypotension in the future, she may require outpatient work-up of the pituitary-adrenal axis with cosyntropin stimulation testing.
Patient was started on flagyl and PO vanc given concern of resistant infection in the context of recent ICU stay.
She will complete a total of 10 days of PO vanco and flagyl on discharge.
#) Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient with history of diastolic heart failure, on lasix and metoprolol at home.
CXR showed evidence of mild pulmonary edema in the presence of fluid administration.
Held diuresis and metoprolol initially given concern for sepsis, with PRN Lasix for clinical signs of pulmonary edema.
Metoprolol was restarted and patient's heart rate remained between 80-100.
Lasix can likely be resumed in the future as tolerated and once she clears C.diff infection.
Provided initially with continuous fluid and checked TID electrolytes with appropriate down trend in CPK.
Lasix was provided PRN in presence of continuous fluid administration.
She was placed on keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] by HD#2, with direction to continue keppra until follow up in neurology clinic in 1 month with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
#) Long term care plan: Patient formerly lived independently; however she was having some difficulty completing her ADLs including toileting, ambulating and eating.
She was placed on keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] by HD#2, with direction to continue keppra until follow up in neurology clinic in 1 month with Dr  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Since there is no cure for parainfluenza, we provided support for you in the intensive care unit with fluids and IV medications to keep your blood pressure up and inhaled medications and oxygen while you recovered.
We treated you appropriately with antibiotics and watched to make sure you recovered well in the hospital.
We also added two antibiotics - vancomycin and flagyl and a medication called levetiracetam (Keppra).
You will take 125mg of vancomycin by mouth four times a day, 500mg of flagyl by mouth three times a day for a total of 10 days.
You will take 500 mg of levetiracetam by mouth twice a day until you meet with your neurologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9580**] for follow up on [**2119-6-13**].
