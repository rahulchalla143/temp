Post cardiac catheterization he presented to the CCU with acute onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure and was intubated on assist control ventilation.
He was diuresed with IV Lasix initially and he was successfully extubated without complications on hospital day 2.
Post-extubation, there were no further respiratory issues and Lasix was eventually discontinued.
He was continued on Plavix 75mg PO daily, 325mg daily aspirin and started on high dose 80mg of atorvastatin daily.
He was kept on Integrillin drip for 18 hours.
Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] was advised that he would need to continue Clopidogrel for at least one month and aspirin for life.
He is aware of the risks of repeat cardiac events and/or stroke  if he fails to adhere to this regimen and he was advised to be compliant with his medications after discharge.
He was started on ACEI and BB to limit further remodeling and control his HR.
To manage  his mural thrombus, he was started on a heparin drip and then bridged to Coumadin 2.5 mg qhs and his INR was 2.7 on [**2108-11-1**].
He has failed anticoagulation in the past due to medication non-compliance.
Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] has a history of pulmonary embolisms and DVTs per records and he had an IVC filter placed in [**2105**].
He was initially started on heparin drip and later bridged to Warfarin 2.5mg qhs which he continued for the rest of his hospitalization.
He had severe constipation which was probably exacerbated by his methadone regimen and multiple psychiatric medications.
He was started on a bowel regimen with Dulcolax, Senna, Colace and then lactulose was added and patient began to have regular daily bowel movements and his mild abdominal distension and nausea improved thereafter for the remainder of his hospital stay.
A central line was placed and 2U PRBCs transfused to which he responded appropriately with a hematocrit bump to 30.
He was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and tapered to daily 40mg PO dose.
GI service would like to perform upper endoscopy, but as he is no longer actively bleeding there is no indication for an urgent inpatient procedure and GI felt that patient could follow up at a later date as an outpatient for an elective EGD.
We attempted to work with an ACEI and BB given comorbidity of CAD keeping in mind that he has very difficult to control HTN at baseline and may require additional medications.
Ultimately, blood pressure was well controlled with a triple regimen of 5mg daily Lisinopril, Clonidine patch and 25mg PO BID Metoprolol.
.. # COPD:  We continued the patient' home ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed while he was hospitalized.
.. # Right LE DVT: Identified on [**2108-10-27**] after patient complained of right groin pain and right leg became swollen.
Vascular surgery consult done and thrombectomy or other procedure was deemed not needed as circulation appears intact, there is no evidence for compartment syndrome and swelling is slowly resolved.
Coumadin has been continued and pt will need to continue this indefinitely.
Pt will also need a hematology consult in the future to assess for clotting derangements once DVT is resolved.
The patient's compliance with his INR checks at [**Company 191**] and the importance of taking his daily Warfarin to prevent strokes and additional clots or complications was stressed and reinforced on multiple occasions.
.. # DEPRESSION / ANXIETY:  Stable; we continued his home duloxetine, clonazepam, and quetiapine initially and Psychiatry was consulted for additional input during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay and the patient's Seroquel was increased to 200mg qhs dosing alongside 50mg [**Hospital1 **] prn Seroquel regimen as well.
The patient continued to have some hypotension and Seroquel was discontinued.
He had his duloxetine gradually uptitrated and his symptoms were well controlled at time of discharge.
A search was initiated to help place Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] in a short term housing/rehabilitation/partial shelter  setting given his multiple medical comorbidities and his social situation which is complicated by his polysubstance abuse history and intermittent homelessness.
#PROPHYLAXIS: DVT prophylaxis was with heparin SQ, then switched to heparin drip after the finding of apical thrombus on TTE and patient ultimately bridged to Coumadin.
GI prophylaxis with PPI [**Hospital1 **] initially given concern over potential GI bleed.
He was kept on a cardiac, heart-healthy diet.
