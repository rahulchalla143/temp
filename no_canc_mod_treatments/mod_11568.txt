male with remote h/o MI, htn, pvd, s/p AAA repair and aortobypass in [**2163**] p/w acute onset of sob and hemoptysis at an OSH one day prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
He reported throat tightness and half a glass of hemoptysis - thin watery but red vs blood tinged mucous which began after taking his medications.
In the ED at OSH, afebrile but hypoxic sating 74% on NRB with RR = 38.
He was started on bipap with improvement in his O2 sat.
He was started on a nitro gtt with good effect.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI in [**2143**] s/p aortobifemoral bypass in [**2163**] anxiety disorder HTN AAA s/p repair in [**2172**] Asbestosis- worked in construction cutting marble COPD diagnosed 2 years ago after "breathing tests" and started on spiriva and advair.
H/o GIB 4 years ago s/p EGD and started on protonix.
His hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Hemoptysis and SOB and alveolar infiltrates: Because his hypoxia 74% on NRB during initial presentation on [**2175-2-16**], he was initially admitted to the MICU, and improved rapidly with Bipap.
He was called to the floor on [**2175-2-19**] after clinical stabilization and O2 sat 96% on 2L by the time he reached the floor.
Our thinking is a combination of CHF/cardiac ischemia, CAP and was worsened by his heparin gtt.
Levoquin was started for his pneumonia on [**2175-2-16**] and needs to be continued for a 14 day course (day 1 [**2175-2-16**]).
Pulmonary was consulted at the MICU, and no urgent need for bronch given decreased hemoptysis and overall clinical stability.
Initially he was put on heparin gtt, but was quickly d/c'ed due to thrombocytopenia.
ASA was also initially d/c'ed at the MICU aafter TCP, and was resumed on [**2175-2-19**] after his platelets stabilized for cardiac protection.
cardiology was consulted and recommended no urgent indication for cath given medical comorbidities, and continue medical management with lopressor, ACEI, aldactone, Imdur and statin.
Patient has no clear signs of fluid overload upon admission and his O2 sat has remained stable on 3-4L NC dramatically improved from 74% on NRB at the OSH.
We continue lopressor and titrate up to HR = 60 and SBP = 110.
4 Rhythym: Bigeminy at OSH.
We kept his K >4.0 and Mg >2.0; continued lopressor for rate control  5 HTN: continued b-b/ACEI/Imdur/aldactone; well controlled at the time of discharge.
We d/c'ed heparin (no heparin products); send HIT antibody (pending) at the time of dishcarge.
Initially hold ASA and PPI, H2 blocker in the MICU.
His platelets remained stable on the floor, and baby ASA and PPI were restarted on [**2-19**] and [**2-20**], respectively.
7 COPD/asbestosis: continued spiriva and advair; alb nebs prn  8 PVD: ASA initially held in the unit after pt developed TCP, and baby ASA was restarted once platelet was stable on the floor  9 AAA: stable  10 macrocytic anemia: ho of GI bleed, but pt was guiac negative; folate and vit B12 was nl; DIC panel negative; he was initially on protonix, but briefly d/c'ed for 1 day due to TCP in the MICU, and we resumed his protonix once he was called out to the floor and his platelets and hct remained stable.
diet as tolerated; Speech and swallow evaluation cleared pt for thin liquids and regular solids.
