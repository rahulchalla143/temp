However, he was found to have significant aortic insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was discharged home on [**2149-11-6**], without diuretic and he was scheduled to undergo aortic valve replacement on [**11-17**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times five in [**2140**].
Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.8-0.9.
The patient also has a history of multiple falls with rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past, question if this is related to his alcohol intake.
He is status post radical prostatectomy in [**2145**].
He is status post rectal polypectomy.
ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg po q day, Zoloft 50 mg po q day, carvedilol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **], Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**11-16**], the patient received a dental consult and he was cleared by the Dental Service to undergo an aortic valve replacement.
On [**11-17**], the patient went to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**], where he underwent an aortic endarterectomy as well as an aortic valve replacement with a #20 3.0 mm [**Location (un) **] valve.
Postoperatively the patient was transported from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on IV milrinone.
The patient was on propofol; however, had increasing agitation, was placed on dexmedetomidine for sedation at that time.
He was weaned from the mechanical ventilator and extubated in the evening on postoperative day one.
The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3.0 on Levophed and milrinone drip.
The milrinone was discontinued on the evening of postoperative day one.
The patient was started on nitroprusside due to hypertension and oral Captopril was added.
The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest tube drainage from his pleural tube, of serosanguinous fluid so that was left in for another couple of days.
The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and Ativan due to increasing confusion and agitation.
He required soft restraints for patient safety.
The patient wound up being oversedated due to his severe agitation, requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromise.
He could also have decreased clearance of all the sedating medicines which he received for previous agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.
The patient was not given amiodarone at that time because he has a history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver function due to his alcohol history.
The patient was converted to normal sinus rhythm; however, had intermittent pauses without appropriate capture of the pacemaker via his epicardial wires.
He continued to have copious endotracheal tube secretions with his re-intubation.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have Enterobacter and he was started on levofloxacin at that time.
He was restarted on Haldol and Ativan.
Pulmonary toilet was continued, aggressive diuresis was continued, and tube feeds were resumed.
The patient was continued on tube feeds via nasogastric tube.
Tube feeds were continued at that time.
The patient progressed throughout the day with increasing agitation, attempting to discontinue IV lines, arterial catheter, as well as his nasogastric tube, and a one-to-one sitter was obtained at that time.
Due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status, he was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued.
The patient's epicardial pacing wires were discontinued on [**2149-12-3**].
He was seen here by the Electrophysiology service and it was decided upon that the patient would be transferred to [**Hospital6 3872**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], who would plan to take him for electrophysiology study at [**Hospital6 3873**] and questionable automatic implantable cardioverter - defibrillator placement as indicated.
On [**12-4**], the patient was reassessed by the speech therapist and it was their recommendation at that time that he was stable, that his swallowing had improved significantly, that he could continue with supervised feedings only and it was their recommendation to continue tube feeds until he was able to take an adequate oral intake.
The patient's tube feeds have been on hold; however, he does continue with the nasogastric tube in place.
