Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates within the SVC.
Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution.
As far as one can tell with the patient in this position, there is no appreciable distention of the GI tract, with the exception of the stomach which is fluid filled, despite a nasogastric tube in place.
[**2201-3-19**] IVC filter placement:  [**2201-3-19**] CT torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
ET tube, right internal jugular lines in standard placements, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Given his history of multiple past pulmonary infections he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
His hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring multiple vasopressors, oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload requiring CVVH, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, ileus, and anemia with CT scan showing internal adductor muscle bleed.
Regarding his DVT, given his bleeding and evidence of coagulopathy he underwent a temporary IVC filter placement by interventional radiology.
Multiple services were consulted including the infectious disease team regarding management of his pulmonary infection, the renal service for management of oliguric renal failure, and rheumatology given his Wegener's disease.
