The patient required re-do sternotomy for removal of the wire, which was done on [**9-11**].
A MV vegetation was seen on TEE done intraoperatively.
The patient will have antibiotics for 6 weeks and then consideration for MVR.
He was initially treated with pacemaker removal with the EP service, but unfortunately, the atrial lead was friable and broke off and was lodged in the chest.
He required re-do sternotomy by the cardiac surgeons for removal of the lead.
His wounds from the sternotomy and the pacemaker extraction remained clean, dry and intact with no erythema throughout his hospitalization.
ID was consulted and the patient was treated with Vancomycin, which was transitioned to Cefazolin, and Gentamicin and Rifampin for synergy.
He did have nightly fevers in the 2 weeks subsequent to his surgery despite blood cultures remaining negative and treatment with the antibiotics.
The cardiac surgeons, ID and orthopedic surgeons all discussed the possibility of incision and drainage but the fluid collection was thought to be small and not a source of infection.
The patient did have some wound-associated discomfort but refused opioid medication due to his history of heroin abuse.
He preferred to use tramadol throughout the hospitalization.
He may need MVR and replacement of the pacemaker in the future after he completes the antibiotics.
We opted not to treat with anti-motility agents given that no clear cause of diarrhea was identified.
He may benefit from pro-biotic treatment.
It peaked at 2.0 which we attributed to gentamycin toxicity in setting of contrast dye-induced nephropathy.
His gentamycin was stopped, and his lasix, losartan and spironolactone were held.
Lasix, losartan, and spironolactone should be resumed once his Cr <1.5.
He was maintained on a BB (switched from home atenolol to metoprolol).
His lasix was held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].

You were treated with antibiotics and you also had your pacemaker removed.
You required a surgery to get the pacemaker out.
One of the antibiotics caused kidney dysfunction but this was stable at the time of discharge and we expect it to get better quickly.
Please note the changes to your medications: - START Cefazolin 2g IV q8h for 6 weeks starting [**Date range (3) 96669**] - START Rifampin 300mg po q8h for 6 weeks starting [**Date range (3) 96669**] - STOP Atenolol - START Rosuvastatin - START Losartan - START Metoprolol - START Spironolactone - DECREASE Lasix from 40mg every morning and 20mg every evening to 20mg in the morning and the evening - INCREASE tramadol 50mg, you may take this every 4 hours as needed for pain.
