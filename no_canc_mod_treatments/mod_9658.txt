HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The 1,060 gm product of a 28 [**2-12**] week gestation, baby girl [**Known lastname 8389**], [**Name2 (NI) 37336**] #1 was born to a in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization, pregnancy was notable for advanced preterm labor and breech presentation prompting cesarean section.
Treated with betamethasone, magnesium sulfate, indomethacin and nifedipine, the mother experienced rupture of membranes on the day of delivery and this prompted the delivery.
negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR non reactive, and group B strep status unknown.
The delivery was by cesarean section.
Respiratory:  Intubated with a 3.0 endotracheal tube shortly after admission to the newborn Intensive Care Unit, [**Known lastname **] received a dose of Survanta in the NICU at [**Hospital1 346**] prior to transfer.
Initially on conventional mechanical ventilation, [**Known lastname **] developed a pulmonary hemorrhage on day of life #2 prompting treatment for a patent ductus arteriosus.
She was switched back to conventional ventilation on day of life #5 and was then extubated to continue with positive airway pressure on day of life #7.
[**Known lastname **] was able to tolerate nasal cannula oxygen by day of life #12 and finally room air by day of life #65.
She was briefly reintubated for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on day of life #54, but weaned quickly back to nasal cannula oxygen.
Caffeine was started on day of life #6 for apnea of prematurity and was subsequently discontinued on day of life #45.
Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname **] required Dopamine on day of life #1 for blood pressure support (maximum dose 6.5 mcg/kg/minute).
The Dopamine was discontinued on day of life #2.
She was treated with one course of Indomethacin for presumed patent ductus arteriosus on day of life #2 in the setting of a pulmonary hemorrhage.
Trophic feeds were started on day of life #8 and advanced to full volume feeds by day of life #18.
Zantac and Reglan were started on day of life #83, given concerns for gastroesophageal reflux.
Upper GI series was done on [**11-23**] in preparation for a G tube placement.
She is currently tolerating feeds of 28 calorie Enfamil AR at a volume of 150 cc/kilo/day with po feedings given as tolerated during the day and continuous feedings given at night.
Gastrointestinal:  Phototherapy was started on day of life #2 and advanced to triple phototherapy with a peak bilirubin of 10.4 on day of life #6.
Phototherapy was discontinued on [**9-4**] with a rebound bilirubin of 2.8 on [**9-7**].
Hematology:  Having received multiple red blood cell transfusions in the first week of life as well as FFP in the setting of a pulmonary hemorrhage, [**Known lastname **] was last transfused with packed red blood cells on day of life #54, given a hematocrit of 24% and a reticulocyte count at that time of 7.4.
Infectious Disease:  [**Known lastname **] received 48 hours of antibiotics following delivery due to sepsis risk factors.
She received three doses of Ancef prophylactically following her shunt placement on [**9-9**].
More recently the newborn was started on a 7 day course of Vancomycin for a cellulitis at her G tube site.
For increased ventricular dilatation, she received serial lumbar punctures.
When this strategy was no longer successful, a left sided frontal subgaleal shunt was placed on [**2111-9-9**].
As a result, she received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on day of life #54 ([**10-14**]) at [**Hospital3 1810**].
A follow-up is recommended in six months from that study.
The infant is stable in room air and tolerating full volume feedings with a stable temperature and open crib.
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Feedings will be continued as above with Enfamil AR at 20 kilocalories per oz at a volume of 150 cc per kilo per day with po feedings taken during the day as tolerated.
The child has received two doses of hepatitis B vaccine as well as first dose of DTAP, HIB, IPV and Prevnar.
[**Known lastname **] also received her first dose of Synagis on [**12-3**].
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Iron supplementation and dark [**Last Name (un) **] syrup with one tsp in her 4 oz of formula being given po or pg [**Hospital1 **].
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for those infants who meet any of the following three criteria: 1) Born at less than 32 weeks gestation; 2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plan for DayCare during RSV season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Status post patent ductus arteriosus.
Status post subgaleal shunt placement on [**9-9**].
Status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on [**10-14**].
