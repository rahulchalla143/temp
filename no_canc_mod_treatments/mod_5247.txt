She was admitted on [**2197-10-16**] after undergoing cerebral and renal angiograms for evaluation of a right internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm and further evaluation of diagnosis fibromuscular dysplasia.
She was taken emergently to MRI and then to interventional radiology, where a right internal carotid stent was placed and intra-arterial TPA was administered.
Coordination tests for rapid-alternating movements and finger-to-nose finger are limited by weakness on the left, but, otherwise, without dysmetria.
On examination, she was found to have a right Horner partial left hemianopsia; right B1 hypesthesia and left foot numbness.
She was started on Heparin and Coumadin.
When she had been seen in the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic on [**2197-10-5**], the patient had been doing well and had been taken off Coumadin and started on Aspirin and Verapamil.
This prompted the course of events as described above.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following her transfer to the floor, she was restarted on Coumadin and kept on Heparin.
The Heparin was monitored with PTPs for protocol.
For pain control she was started on OxyContin and Topamax.
For breakthrough pain, despite OxyContin and Topamax, she was also started on Vicodin p.r.n., which controlled her pain fairly well.
The left facial droop and left hand weakness improved and left deltoid biceps and triceps were all strong.
The INR was very difficult to bring up and only increased to very slowly despite dose of 5 mg of Coumadin every day.
This was increased for a one time dose of 10 and then continued on a dose 7.6 per day.
The patient does report that when she had previously been on Coumadin the dose would be very unpredictable and that oftentimes she would require increases in dose to maintain a reasonable level.
Ocean nasal spray, one to three sprays each nostril q.1h.
Topamax 75 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Verapamil 240 mg p.o.q.d., long acting.
