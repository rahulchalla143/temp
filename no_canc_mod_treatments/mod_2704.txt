He noted a fascicular and papular rash on his bilateral hands, including his palms and trunk and extremities.
About 1 wk prior, he was started on bactrim by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for ulcer on both feet.
Of note, he was on bactrim for heel ulcer.
He required hypotensive and required IVF.
He was started on diflucan and acyclovir and CTX.
(of note,  he had been given lasix as outpt meds.).
(total 3 dosages of 40 IV lasix given on [**8-31**]).
Prednisone was also started for presumed exfoliate dermatitis.
Renal was also consulted and felt that the rash is likely from bactrim and sulfa related allergy.
and recommended IVF hydration.
Central line was inserted and CVP was 16 w/ BNP 1020.
Pt was started on ceftaz 1 q8 and cipro 400 IV and 1 dose of 1gm vanco given empirically.
He was also started on hydrocort 100 q8 on [**9-1**] AM.
Of note pt was recently admitted to the vascular [**Doctor First Name **] service for L>R ulcer and was planned to have f/u surgery pending cardiac evaluation.
CAD- s/p CABG x 3 in [**2158**] at [**Hospital1 112**], last cath [**6-28**] with 80% stenosis in SVG to OM1 s/p stent placement 2.
Aortic stenosis- moderate by [**4-29**] TTE 3.
CKD- by report, baseline Cr 1.2, h/o ARF with IV contrast 4.
PVD- b/l ischemic heel ulcers, s/p R foot partial amputation  6.
Peripheral neuropathy 9. bilateral carotid stenosis, s/p R CEA [**2161**] 10.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on ADMISSION: Vitals- p 109 BP 106/44 O2 90% RR 14 AC TV 450 FI O2 100% RR 14 PEEP 5 PIP 34 General-  NAD, intubated, sedated, generalized exfoliate dermatitis HEENT- PERRL, OP clear w/ dry MMM Neck- Supple, flat JVD Pulm- diffuse crackles and rhonchi CV-  RRR, S1 and S2, no m/r/g Abd-  soft, NT, ND +BS Extrem- cool to touch, poor distal pulses Neuro-  sedated  Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2166-9-3**] hemodynamically stable, but with ARDS for further management.
He elected to be DNR/DNI on [**9-16**] after extubation, and on [**9-24**] goals of care where changed to comfort measures only.
His respiratory mechanics gradually improved with gentle diuresis with lasix gtt + diamox, and pt was extubated [**9-15**], and transitioned to his home BiPaP with PS 14/8.
He also remained grossly volume overloaded, and was tolerating only gentle diuresis (~500-1000cc fluid removal daily), given his severe aortic stenosis and preload dependence.
Pt gradually improved, tolerating trial of high flow face mask ventilation, with O2 sats 95-100% on 8-15LPM.
central line and left a-line were removed earlier that day.
SBPS remained elevated, and pt was already being treated with a second course of vanco/zosyn, which was continued.
# CV: pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2158**], last Cath [**6-28**].
Aspirin dose decreased to 81 mg po qdaily, and held pending restarting oral feeding.
b) pump-last ECHO showed decreased EF from [**4-29**] w/ 1+ MR and AS, now with EF 30-40% and mod-severe AS-attempting diuresis with diamox and lasix although on this hospitlization, diureses was complicated by pt's preload dependence.
He continued to remain volume overloaded on [**9-22**], and diuresis was also complicated by ?sepsis physiology.
c) rhythmn: had episode of aflutter on admission, digoxin loaded but not continued.
# DM2 with complications - pt initially treated with insulin gtt which was weaned and transitioned to sliding scale coverage with good fsbs.
as this is the case, will continue wound care, but will not workup further for osteomyelitis.
#ARF- patients creatinine on admission was elevated to approx 2 and had returned to wnl despite continuing to diuresing with lasix to remove fluid exacerbating respiratory failure.
# FEN: s/p extubation pt, evaluation of pt's swallow was attempted, however he was requiring long periods of CPAP which made this difficult.
If pt does not tolerate face mask for significant periods of time, plan was to place NGT and use CPAP on top, despite poor seal.
s&s consulted placed, however they were unable to see pt until after he can tolerate being off of CPAP for significant periods of time, pt was treated with TPN.
# DISPOSITION - on [**9-24**] decision was made to change goals of care to CMO after discussion with pt, and family.
