Admission Date:  [**2107-2-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-9-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Beta-Blockers (Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agts) / IV Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**] Chief Complaint: Cool, pulseless Right foot - R common femoral artery occlusion found on CTA at [**Hospital3 **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2107-2-22**] Right iliofemoral popliteal embolectomy and thrombectomy.
Patent SVG-Diag-OM and SVG-RCA grafts.
As a result, we decided to try to temporize with IV heparin to see if she would stabilize to the point where surgery could be avoided.
She was taken to the OR and underwent Right iliofemoral popliteal embolectomy and thrombectomy.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the CVICU on a heparin gtt in stable condition.
Coumadin was initiated and she remained on heparin until a therapeutic INR was reached.
Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] was monitored closely and was not felt stable for extubation until [**2107-2-24**].
The pt had atrial fibrillation on [**2-24**] which initially resolved with iv lopressor.
She did have several other episodes of afib and was eventually rate controlled with beta blocker.
Given the initial ekg changes, rising troponins and afib, and strong cardiac hx, a cardiology consult was obtained.
They advised continued heparin gtt, aggressive beta blockade, addition of an ace inhibitor, serial ekgs and troponins.
She tolerated the procedure well.
Although initially anticoagulated for her iliofemoral thrombus, it is also indicated given her atrial fibrillation.
She was restarted on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0  On [**2-25**] the bedside nurse noted the pt had difficulty swallowing and a speech/swallow consult was obtained.
They recommended active and passive ROM as tolerated and sling as needed for comfort.
Pt felt she did not need the sling at this time.
She worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate with assistance.
