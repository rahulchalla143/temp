Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with Left inframammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein grafts to diagonal obtuse marginal and posterior left ventricular branch.
Aortic valve replacement with size #23-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve.
His  cardiopulmonary bypass time was 179 minutes with an aortic crossclamp time of 160 minutes.
He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit in stable condition on epinepherine and levophed for invasive monitoring.
On post-operative day six sputum cultures revealed gram negative rods and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
During this period the patient weaned off all pressors and inotropes, he was started on beta blockers once pressors were off and was diuresed toward his preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
He had several brief episodes of post-operative atrial fibrillation that were treated with beta blockers and amiodarone, following which he converted to sinus rhythm.
The patient extubated for a second time on post-operative day seven, following which he stayed in the intensive care unit for aggressive pulmonary hygiene.
He was found to have increased swelling in his left upper extremity so an ultrasound was performed of this extremity and found to be without deep vein thromboses.
By the time of discharge on post-operative day fourteen the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **] in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
