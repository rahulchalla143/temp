Since then, the patient remained for another week in the hospital, mainly for teaching of her tracheostomy care and teaching of a Passy-Muir valve.
At first the patient did not seem to be attaining this new information well, however, with continued teaching as well as involvement of her partner she was able to learn how to sufficiently take care of her trach as well as the contraindications for use of the Passy-Muir valve.

The patient was seen by the ENT team on [**9-11**] for possible decannulation of her trach, however, they decided that it would be best for the patient to keep her trach in place for several more weeks and possibly even change it to a different type of tracheostomy called [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] before decannulation.
