The Foley catheter was changed at the nursing home but did not result in increased urine output.
He also reported one day of fevers, chills and some mild nausea with one episode of vomiting two days prior to admission.
A right internal jugular sepsis catheter was placed and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis protocol monitoring.
At that time, he underwent an open cholecystectomy with a liver biopsy and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring.
He also had a biliary stent placed for residual drainage of infected fluid collection.

The patient was initiated on the sepsis protocol and was placed on Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Flagyl for empiric coverage of most likely urosepsis with the Ceftazidime, especially given the patient's asplenic status and susceptibility to encapsulated organisms.
He was also placed on Flagyl for a question of Clostridium difficile colitis given his history.
He was bolused with normal saline as needed.
The patient was eventually weaned off of Levophed on [**2164-3-17**].
He had an appropriate compensatory respiratory alkalosis; however, he was unable to breathe down his C02 and required intubation on [**2164-3-17**], secondary to labored breathing and acute hypoxemia.
This was thought to be most likely secondary to volume overload, status post aggressive fluid resuscitation.
The patient was quickly weaned off of the ventilator on [**2164-3-17**].
The patient was transferred to the medical team on [**2164-3-18**] and was oxygenating well on nasal cannula.
The urology consult was obtained and after replacing the patient's Foley catheter, 900 cc of dark red urine was drained from the urinary bladder.
He was maintained on Proscar and Flomax per his outpatient regimen.
It was recommended that he follow-up with his urologist for urodynamic study and possible transurethral resection of prostate.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  Given his guaiac positive stool, he was continued on Protonix.
Glucose control:  He was maintained euglycemic on insulin sliding scale.
This was felt to be secondary to post obstructive nephropathy and his creatinine decreased to 1.5 status post drainage of the urinary bladder.
Given the fact that he was extubated off of pressors, maintaining adequate oxygenation on nasal cannula and maintaining adequate blood pressure without the need for frequent bolusing.
Please note that his antibiotic coverage was changed to Levofloxacin and p.o.
Vancomycin for targeted treatment for gram negative rods as well as Clostridium difficile prophylaxis.
