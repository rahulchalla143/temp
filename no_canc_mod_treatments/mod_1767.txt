Peripheral vascular disease status post fem-DP bypass     graft in [**2121-4-12**].
Bilateral hip replacements in [**2112**] and [**2113**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery     bypass graft times four in [**2117**].
Cesarean section.
Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
Electrolytes: Sodium 132, potassium 3.2, chloride 100, CO2 29.1, BUN 44, creatinine 2.8.
She was placed on bed rest with bathroom privileges.
The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions secondary to her low white count of 1.4.
She was begun on Zosyn 2.25 grams q. eight hours, Flagyl 500 q.
12 and Vancomycin 1 gram.
The Hematology/Oncology consultation recommended beginning Epogen of 30,000 units and continue weekly until hematocrit is 30 or greater; start Neupogen 300 mcg subcutaneously q. day and skip if white count is greater than 10,000, restart folic acid 1 mg q. day; transfuse for hematocrit to be maintained between 28 and 30.
Their recommendations were to adequately hydrate and give Mucomyst prior to any radiological interventional diagnostic procedure and to consider starting Prednisone.
Renal also was requested to see the patient and recommended to dose all medications for a creatinine clearance of 15 to 25.
Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and ACE inhibitors at this time.
The patient underwent, on [**2123-1-21**], a left extra-acomic bypass with thrombectomy of the femoral-DP bypass graft of left less saphenous vein, ligation and drainage of an infected pseudo-aneurysm.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition and then was transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring care secondary to coagulopathy and neutropenia.
The patient required two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma postoperatively and interoperatively.
Her extremity examination showed dressings were clean, dry and intact with a palpable graft pulse and a warm foot.
Antibiotics were continued and cultures were monitored and choice narrowed according to culture results.
Ultimate recommendations of Rheumatology were Prednisone course and tapered as they felt that she would be at high risk for use of Colchicine secondary to her bone marrow suppression.
She was begun on steroids with improvement in her clinical symptomatology of her left toe, but as infectious process could not be ruled out, the patient remained on antibiotics.
Incentive spirometry and chest PT was begun.
She also was growing Pseudomonas from her wound and her antibiotics were converted to Ciprofloxacin.
Zosyn was discontinued on [**2123-1-24**], after initiating Ciprofloxacin.
There was continued improvement in her creatinine to show a fall from 3.4 to 2.7 over the next 48 hours after beginning treatment for the urinary tract infection.
The patient required multiple medication adjustments for her systolic and diastolic hypertension.
On postoperative day her blood pressure remained elevated and required adjustments in her Norvasc and was converted to Cardura.
She underwent, on [**2123-2-4**], a left first toe amputation without complications and tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and recommendations were that she would need [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation placement.
The patient will continue on intravenous antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime until seen by him at that time.
