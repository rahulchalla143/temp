The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**6-28**] and was given aggressive fluid resuscitation, and gap and acidosis.
The precipitating factor for her diabetic ketoacidosis was worked up, but no specific factor was determined.
Once called out from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient did not have any pain or discomfort and denied any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor revealed the patient was taking Glargine, Humalog sliding-scale, and had droperidol 0.625 mg intravenously q.4-6h.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories were notable only for a hematocrit of 31.2, potassium of 3, bicarbonate of 31, calcium of 7, phosphate of 2, albumin of 2.7, and a creatine kinase of 29,190.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient with new onset diabetic ketoacidosis and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and had aggressive fluid resuscitation as well as an insulin drip which was eventually changed to subcutaneous insulin.
The patient responded well to this therapy with resolution of her anion gap and her acidosis and was nicely transitioned to a Humalog sliding-scale with q.i.d.
The patient also tolerated the Glargine very well.
At the time of discharge, her anti-insulin antibody, GAD antibody, and islet cell antibody, as well as her hemoglobin A1c were all pending.
The patient was supplemented with potassium; and although not within the normal range, all her electrolytes were expected to improve as she started taking an oral diet, and no further supplements were given.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's discharge medications included) 1.
Glargine 20 units q.h.s.
