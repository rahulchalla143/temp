However the risk is judged to be no greater with thin liquids than nectar thick liquids based on this study.
Suggest advancing the pt to a PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
Continued speech therapy services as necessary in rehab s/p d/c.
Protonix 40 mg twice a day.
Serial hct; transfuse as needed.
Intubated for 2 weeks.
He was started on keppra and increased to clinically therapeutic doses and started on neurotin to avoid liver toxicity and treat his seizures.
The combination of Keppra and neurotin has controlled his seizures.
He received an EGD showing bleeding gastritis and he was treated with an increased dose of Nadolol to 40 mg daily and was transfused 2 Units PRBC's.
He had a prolonged course on the ventilator and had a vasopressor requirement until [**11-24**], after which he was entirely pressor-independent.
Aztreonam was discontinued on [**11-15**].
Levofloxacin was stopped on [**11-22**].
He was treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin for the staph bacteremia.
He was often agitated and dysynchronous with the ventilator and required sedation during his ventilator course.
He was intubated for nearly two weeks.
This resolved with treatment of his sepsis.
However, the decision was made to treat him vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 61748**]).
He was found to have a urinary tract infection, and was treated with ceftriaxone [**Date range (1) 61749**].
Neurology consult felt that this was more likely to be action myoclonus related to his metabolic disturbances rather than epileptic seizures, and initial, routine EEG was normal.
Other extensive neurologic workup, including LP, brain MRI and head CT, was unrevealing.
Following these episodes he was started on levetiracetam 500mg [**Hospital1 **] given concern that they actually represented seizures.
Interictally, left temporal epileptiform discharges were seen, sometimes with reflection over the right as well.
He was treated with levetiracetam, which was gradually increased to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **], and neurontin at 300mg/300mg/600mg.
Levetiracetam and neurontin were titrated up to control the EPC (as above).
During his hospital course, he appreciably improved, with examination prior to discharge notable for strength as follows (R/L): delts 4+/5-, [**Hospital1 **] 5-/5, tri 4+/5, WE 3-/4, FE [**2-14**]+, IP [**3-17**], H [**4-17**], Q [**4-17**], limited movements of R ankle, flexion of L ankle, able to wiggle toes on L but only a small twitch on the R. He will likely benefit greatly from aggressive physical therapy.
He continued rifaximin and lactulose for this.
His cirrhosis is also complicated by grade II varices for which he received Nadolol for bleeding prophylaxis.
He has a small amount of ascites, and underwent a paracentesis to evaluate for SBP on [**11-22**].
On discharge, MELD score was 0. patient will require close monitoring of lactulose administration and ensurance that no dosese are missed.
His Quetiapine was held during his hospital stay since it seemed to make him more sedate.
was re-evaluated by speech and swallow study on [**2130-12-22**] which showed significant improvement and was advanced to thin liquids, still requiring aspiration precautions.
He will require re-evaluation and treatment w/ speech and swallow therapists.
His nadolol was increased to 40 mg daily and he received a transfusion of 2 U PRBC's.
He received wound care for this.
He was also noted to have a R heel blister during his hospital stay & was given heel support for this.
