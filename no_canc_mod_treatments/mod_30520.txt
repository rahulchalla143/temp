Admission Date:  [**2154-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-12-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Back pain, food impaction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy Rigid Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 92-year old female with PMH significiant for HTN, known esophageal diverticulum, and GERD who was brought to the ED by her family after a large [**Holiday **] meal and concern for an episode of food impaction.
She received 2 mg IV morphine and 10 mg IV hydralazine for SBPs in the 200 range.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for scoping but after a prolonged procedure she desaturated and became hypoxic with oxygen saturations in low 80s despite supplemental oxygen.
Therefore she was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the operating room in order to undergo a rigid bronchoscopy/endoscopy to effectively and safely relieve the patient's impaction.
There was some concern for an aspiration event given these findings.
She was gradually weaned off of sedation and given several small 250cc/500cc IVF boluses and her blood pressures recovered.
She refuses to take home BP medications but has allowed IV Hydralazine for SBPs > 180s during this hospital stay.
Otherwise, BP was stable with 150s/60s measures and she denied any cough, chills, chest pains, palpitations, abdominal pain,nausea, emesis or diarrhea.
She was able to speak in full sentences with no distress on 2L NC and no accessory muscle use noticed.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -GERD /Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease -Esophagitis -Esophageal diverticulum (wide neck) s/p food impaction X2 requiring EGDs, [**5-11**] and another one 1-2years ago -Osteoporosis -h/o T11 and T12 compression fractures -Dyslipidemia  Social History: The patient still works as supervisor at City [**Doctor Last Name **].
[**2154-12-6**] THORACIC SPINE XRAY: Interval progression of T11 and T12 compression fractures with 50% loss of height and no gross retropulsion.
Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.
The patient did not tolerate this prolonged procedure well and developed hypoxia and tachypnea.
Therefore, she was sedated and intubated for airway protection and transferred to the operating room for disimpaction via endoscopy/rigid bronchoscopy.
A large food bolus was successfully removed.
Rigid bronchoscopy was complicated by a suspected  aspiration event at left lung as copious amounts of secretions were suctioned.
She remained intubated for several hours post-operatively for ongoing airway protection.
A day later she was successfully weaned and extubated after RSBI 45 in the MICU.
She continued to recuperate well  until the morning of [**2154-12-10**] when she was noted to have worsening shortness of breath with walking and minimal exertion with physical therapy team.
Incentive spirometry was given for atelectasis prevention.
Soon after her food disimpaction procedure/rigid bronchoscopy she developed marked hypotension which was attributed to her propofol sedation.
She was given small IVF boluses of 250cc and 500cc and propofol was weaned off.
She underwent thoracic procedure with rigid bronchoscopy /endoscopy in OR for eventual successful disimpaction.
Upon eventual stabilization and transfer to the medical floor from the ICU she complained of intermittent "burning" at her mid-sternum.
Maalox and low dose Morphine provided relief of her chest pains and suspected dyspepsia /gastric reflux symptoms.
Ranitidine was prescribed at time of discharge for ongoing acid reflux protection.
During her hospital stay, the speech and swallow team evaluated Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and recommended soft solids, thin liquids and advised patient to sit upright >80 degrees during meals.
She received 10 mg IV hydralazine during her recent endoscopy after  systolic pressures rose into the 200s.
She was given several doses of hydralazine as needed for high pressures.
She has known non-compliance with home HTN medications and initially refusing medications on this admission.
She was counseled on the benefits of therapy on several occasions and ultimately agreed to start taking daily Diovan for better blood pressure control.
She was given maintenance 1/2 NS IVFs overnight from [**Date range (1) 12714**] and her sodium improved from 146 to 139 and slowly stabilized.
She will plan to follow-up on her anemia as an outpatient for ongoing workup with her primary care provider.
# Prophylaxis: She was continued on subcutaneous heparin for DVT protection and  continued on daily Protonix for GI protection, with PRN Maalox supplemented for additional breakthrough reflux symptoms.
