Brief Hospital Course: 40M with h/o EtOH abuse and withdrawal now admitted with EtOH/benzodiazepine intoxication and signs of EtOH withdrawal.
EtOH withdrawal: The timing of the patient's last drink was uncertain, but he had signs and symptoms of withdrawal, incuding tachycardia, agitation, and tremors.
On transfer to the ICU, IV hydration was continued, as well as folate, thiamine, and MVI.
A code purple was called, with security and psychiatry arriving to the patient's room to assess his capacity given that he was still in withdrawal and receiving frequent valium doses.
Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's chest xray in the ED was initially read as possible pneumonia, so he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
However, the patient did not have a fever, elevated WBC count, or other evidence of infection, so this was considered to be more likely an aspiration pneumonitis and antibiotics were discontinued.
FEN: The patient was given IV hydration while not taking PO.
Prophylaxis: The patient was on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
