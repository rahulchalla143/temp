We instructed patient multiple times to avoid shellfish and trandolapril or any other ACE-I's.
We wrote him for rx's for prednisone, benadryl and famotidine for 3 days after dispo, and instructed him not to drive or drink alcohol while on benadryl.
Patient will need to be seen by his PCP for BP control (see below) and by an allergist ASAP for allergy testing for shellfish.
He will need to stop taking his trandolapril permanently, and will therefore need another BP medication to control his HTN, but wants to discuss this medication with his PCP and did not want to start any BP medication acutely.
He has an appointment in 2 days with his [**Name8 (MD) 6435**] NP and he will be able to decide on a BP med by then.
# Gout:  We continued pt on current home regimen of allopurinol 100mg PO QD, colchicine 0.6mg PO QD PRN and indomethacin 50mg PO Q8H PRN  # Alcohol Abuse:  Patient drinks 2-3 drinks per night every night for the last 15 years.
We monitored him for withdrawal overnight while he was in the ICU with a CIWA scale, but he did not require any BZDs.
We informed him that it is very dangerous to drink alcohol while taking benadryl as it can make you excessively sleepy.
