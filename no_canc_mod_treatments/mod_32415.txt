He was loaded with dilantin and neurosurgery consultation was obtained, recommending medical management.
He was given levaquin and flagyl for suspected retrocardiac opacity.

Right occipital fracture, refer to CT head report from same date 4.
Endotracheal tube tip in satisfactory position.
Feeding tube side port appears to be in the distal esophagus and should be advanced.
The distal tip of the feeding tube is not visualized.
Impression: Two coins in the lower third of the esophagus (foreign body removal) Ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus Erythema and petechiae in the whole stomach c/w gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 60yo M with PMH of EtOH abuse admitted with fever, multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, course complicated by aspiration pneumonia and SIADH  # Traumatic Head Injury with Intraparenchymal bleed and subdural bleed - pt found s/p seizure per report, had mechanism significant enough for occipital frx.
Evaluated by Neurosurgery with no indication for surgical intervention.
Dilantin was started in house; he had apparently been on Depakote before, and Keppra was considered, however, cost makes dilantin more appropriate.
Stable on regimen of NaCl tabs (3gm tid with meals) and lasix 20mg daily, which has kept serum sodium between 126 and 130 for over a week.
Should have sodium checked at least twice a week; we expect this to resolve as ICH resorbs and brain parenchyma heals.
# Cervical spine injury: Pt w/ negative c-spine CT. MRI obtained to eval for ligamentous injury but not useful due to motion artifact.
# Aspiration pneumonia- Retrocardiac opacity on initial CXR was thought most likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with a full course of antibiotics.
He continues to have silent aspiration secondary to dysphagia; speech and swallow therapist recommended thickened liquids and soft foods, 1:1 assistance with meals, and aspiration precautions (sitting fully upright to eat, chewing carefully, small bites alternating with sips).
# COPD - Reported history of chronic pleural effusions, s/p VATS and decortication, as well, which may explain poor/rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
Continued on spiriva and albuterol.
# Alcohol withdrawal seizures - Unclear seizure history - pt on depakote as outpatient.
EtOH level negative on presentation,  # Atrial Fibrillation - holding ASA as above, will restart per Neurosurgery recs on/after [**10-21**].
