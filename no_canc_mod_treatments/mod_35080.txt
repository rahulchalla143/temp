Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
===========   Brief Hospital Course: [**Date range (1) 77612**] The patient's initial MICU course was complicated by acute GI bleeding, bacteremia, fungemia, and dialysis access complications.
[**2093-5-6**] Her bleeding diatheses was managed with improving nutrition as directed by nutrition consult, and high dose vitamin K SQ for three days.
Her respiratory status decompensated, with increasing oxygen requirement, thought to be due to profound hypotension with even modest ultrafiltration on hemodialysis despite aggressive sodium modelling and dialysis protocol optimization.
The fluid was sent for cytology and culture.
The patient was also significantly deconditioned and in significant pain and often declined physical therapy; her medical regimen was adjusted to include fentanyl transdermal patch for better basal pain control in an effort to increase adherence to a PT regimen.
[**2102-5-14**] The patient was taken off of daptomycin and fluconazole after receiving over 14 days of treatment for both the bacteremia and fungemia.
A family meeting was held and it was decided to pursue a liver biopsy to help determine if further aggressive care would be beneficial in terms of life prolongation.
She was started on zosyn and cipro for empiric coverage.
Her central venous catheters were removed, her antibiotics were discontinued, and her dialysis was stopped.
