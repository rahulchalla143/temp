His pulmonologist also felt there may be a component of diastolic heart failure contributing to his worsening dyspnea, and he was referred for an elective right cardiac cath which was performed earlier today.
He received furosemide 40mg IV once (home dose furosemide 20mg PO daily).
Of note, he had taken Benadryl 75mg PO at home prior to the procedure, and also received Fentanyl 25 mcg while in the the cath lab.
Respiratory therapy [**Name (NI) 653**], and patient transferred to CCU for BiPAP.
He had been started on a nitro gtt in the cath lab after SBPs noted to be elevated to 200s, and after arrival in CCU his nitro gtt was titrated to keep SBP <160.
He was unable to fully answer questions secondary to his lethargic state, and a full review of systems could not be obtained.
However per family report he has been using CPAP consistently at night over past several months, and has also been using for several hours a day.
Of note, patient has hematoma in right neck after failed right IJ placement for procedure; procedure performed through left femoral.

Brief Hospital Course: 67yo male with h/o liver transplant [**2126**], severe OSA, and pulmonary HTN, admitted after elective right cardiac cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling pressures as well as severe pulmonary artery HTN, and who was transferred to CCU in setting of acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.
Respiratory therapy was consulted, and the patient was placed on BiPAP overnight.
He was continued on BiPAP at night when tolerated, but generally he complied with CPAP.
He was noted at times to be hypoxic on O2 sats and was given supplemental oxygen.
Prior to discharge, he was able to ambulate without oxygen (did not meet criteria for long-term O2 therapy on ABG) and his respiratory status had improved following diuresis.
The differential diganosis for the cause of his pulmonary HTN is broad, and includes left heart diastolic failure, severe OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, autoimmune causes, neuromuscular disease, and liver disease.
A TTE was performed on [**2133-7-7**], but given suboptimal image quality, was unable to better characterize pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
A pulmonary consult was called, and the team felt the patient would not be an ideal candidate for a vasodilator challenge at this time, but that the issue could be re-addressed once the patient had undergone diuresis for his diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
The patient was treated for his dCHF with aggressive diuresis (including furosemide drip), and BiPAP/CPAP for his OSA at night.
These elevated pressures are significantly elevated from previous cardiac cath in [**2125**] which showed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and mild/moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Repeat echo this admission again revealed LVEF >55%, RV free wall hypertrophy, and increased LV filling pressures, but could not compare pulmonary artery systolic pressures to previous studies given suboptimal image quality of echo.
His fluid balance was difficult to monitor, as the patient refused a Foley catheter and was frequently incontinent.
He was also started on a beta blocker, to allow for increased filling time.
He was discharged on a regimen that includes metoprolol succinate 150mg PO daily and torsemide 80mg PO daily.
He was not started on an ACE inhibitor in the setting of his liver transplant and impaired renal function.
The patient was encouraged to not take NSAIDs following discharge.
#) Hypertension - Patient hypertensive with SBP in 200s in cath lab, was started on nitro gtt, and had SBP in 170s on arrival to CCU.
He was started on metoprolol and aggressively diuresed, with resultant improvement in his BP.
He was able to be weaned off the nitroglycerin drip within the first day of admission.
Per the liver team, he should not be started on an ACE inhibitor in the community, but he might benefit from the addition of amlodipine if he becomes increasingly hypertensive on his current regimen.
His discharge medications include metoprolol succinate 150mg PO daily and torsemide 80mg PO daily.
He was continued on his home dose of mycophenalate mofetil, as well as prophylactic Bactrim.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Pulmonary hypertension Diastolic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure  SECONDARY: Hypertension Obstructive sleep apnea s/p liver transplant on longterm immunosuppression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You presented on [**2133-7-6**] for an elective right heart catheterization following workup by your pulmonologist, who had found abnormalities on your pulmonary function tests.
Following your catheterization you were admitted to the CCU as you were having difficulty breathing, and you were put on the BiPAP machine to help your breathing.
It was felt that the [**Last Name 16423**] problem leading to your shortness of breath was heart failure causing fluid build-up in the lungs.
We therefore started you on medications to help remove some of the water, called diuretics, and your breathing improved as a result.
You were also drowsy and at times disoriented, and we felt that this was because your oxygen levels were low and your carbon dioxide levels were high.
We regularly tested your oxygen and CO2 levels by taking blood from the artery at the wrist.
You used the CPAP machine and at times the BiPAP machine in order to help your breathing.
The pulmonology and liver transplant teams saw you during this admission, and based on their advice we changed the dose of your cyclosporine.
We started you on a beta-blocker called metoprolol which takes some of the strain off the heart by slowing the heart beat and we changed you from intravenous to an oral diuretic called torsemide.
You were seen by physical therapy and able to walk holding onto a wheelchair, without requiring additional oxygen therapy.
CHANGES TO MEDICATIONS:  1) Your Cyclosporine dose was REDUCED to 100mg ONCE DAILY 2) We STOPPED your diphenhydramine 3) We STARTED metoprolol succinate 150mg once daily 4) We STARTED torsemide 80mg once daily  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 1) You will be seen by Dr[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] as an outpatient in addition to pulmonology follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] ***It is very important that you keep all of your doctor's apointments.
3) You should try and keep to a low salt diet (2g sodium) and a restricted fluid intake of 1.5 liters per day to stop further fluid overload 4) Continue using your CPAP machine 5) You will have physical therapy see you as an outpatient in addition to occupational therapy who will assess you and your home to see if there are any adjustments necessary to make your life easier  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
