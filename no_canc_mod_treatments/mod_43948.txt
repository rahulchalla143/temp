Patient was given metoprolol succinate 50mg po (home dose) for atrial fibrillation with RVR.
General surgery and ERCP services were consulted.
SKIN: Ecchymosis over left femoral distribution, purple in color.
Given high clinical suspicion of cholangitis, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A sphincterotomy was performed.
He was started first on zosyn 4.5 g IV and was transferred to the surgery service.
The patient had a US-guided transhepatic percutaneous cholecystostomy drain placed on [**2145-7-17**].
Antibiotic coverage was changed from zosyn to unasyn.
LFTs were monitored, with continued decline in total bilirubin.
Alkaline phosphatase remained elevated to 170s with increase to 238 on day of discharge, while AST and ALT have peaked in the 60s and 70s.
Interventional radiology has recommended repeating a RUQ US to assess drain location if LFTs become abnormal.
The patient continued to have drainage from his cholecystostomy drain, and his pain resolved.
Cultures of his drainage have grown Streptococcus anginosus and Clostridium perfringens.
He will need to complete a 14-day course of unasyn, starting on [**2145-7-17**], and follow-up with surgery to discuss cholecystectomy.
The oral metoprolol was increased, and he was given IV metoprolol.

The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], with plan made to defer discussion of warfarin or digibatran after hospital discharge per request of the PCP.
# Hyperlipidemia: The patient's home statin was held due to elevations in LFTs and transhepatic cholecystostomy placement, with plan to restart once his LFTs improve.
# Hypertension: The patient's home nifedipine was stopped in the setting a-fib and rate control.
He is now on metoprolol succinate with BP well controlled.
He will need continued BP monitoring.
# Urinary retention: The patient has a history of prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy.

# Hyperlipidemia: The patient's home statin was continued during hospitalization.
Cholecysititis/drain: Monitor percutaneous drain output daily; order LFTs biweekly, and follow-up with surgery.
If LFTs abnormal, IR has suggested repeat RUQ US to assess drain location.

You required a procedure (ERCP) to look for blockage of your gall bladder and placement of a gall bladder drain (cholecystostomy tube).
You were started on intravenous antibiotics.
Your liver and gallbladder are now improving, but you will need surgery at a future date.
You were started on medications to control the heart rate and aspirin to prevent clots from forming in the heart.
Due to the risk of stroke associated with this condition, you will need to discuss being on blood thinners with your doctor.
You initially required a large volume of intravenous fluids, and we have begun removing this extra volume with medications (diuretics).
Your breathing has improved as a result, and you will continue this process during rehabilitation.
A catheter was placed, with plans for removal in 1 week in rehabilitation.
- Simvastatin was stopped for now due to your liver test abnromalities.
- Aspirin was started to prevent stroke from your atrial fibrillation.
- Metoprolol was increased to control your heart rate.
- Nifedipine was stopped as your blood pressure remained normal after treatment for your heart rate.
- Ampicillin-sulbactam was started to treat your infection  Followup Instructions: Please make an appointment with your primary doctor for follow-up care before leaving rehabilitation.
