She reports that she was given a prescription for Augmentin following her bunion surgery and she has taken this medication.
In the Emergency Department the patient underwent nasogastric lavage with bilious return.
She received 4 liters of normal saline for hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 92).
She was also found to be hyperkalemic for which she received Kayexalate 30 gm and Calcium Gluconate as well.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she requires supplemental oxygenation at home.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Status post cholecystectomy on [**2156-8-30**].
Status post bilateral total knee replacement in [**2150**].
Bunion surgery on [**2157-3-29**].
Of note, her husband also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires supplemental oxygenation.

Oxygen saturation was 94 to 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
Heart:  Point of maximal impulse not displaced, regular, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur at base bilaterally, contraction of arms.
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin, amylase and lipase and INR were normal.
Hyperkalemia - On the night of admission, the patient required several additional gm of calcium gluconate, approximately 30 units of regular insulin and several injections of sodium bicarbonate to acutely decrease the potassium.
She also received Kayexalate as well.
She received several boluses of fluids to maintain blood pressure.
Ultimately she required administration of pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
Infectious disease - Given her history of prior surgery, long course of antibiotics and a visit to an outside Emergency Department, the patient was treated with Metronidazole by mouth and intravenously for presumed pseudomembranous colitis.
Subsequent detection of Clostridium difficile A in her stool confirmed infection with the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of this disease.
Ultimately her treatment for Clostridium difficile was switched to Vancomycin per os, per rectum and intravenously.
The patient was unable to tolerate weaning from pressor agents, specifically requiring Dopamine for the duration of her hospital stay to maintain blood pressure.
Similarly the patient could not tolerate higher than 20 mcg/kg/min of this medication as she developed an inferior myocardial infarction when the medication was increased to 37.
Of note, the patient had a left lower lobe consolidation on chest x-ray.
Sputum cultures confirmed that she had pneumonia with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus although she was initially treated with Levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, the intravenous Vancomycin administered as part of the regimen for Clostridium difficile covered for this organism.
She occasionally required increases in her fraction of inspired oxygen.
After discussion with her family a decision was made to withdraw care, specifically discontinuing pressor agents.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she requires supplemental oxygenation at home.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Status post cholecystectomy on [**2156-8-30**].
Status post bilateral total knee replacement in [**2150**].
Bunion surgery on [**2157-3-29**].
