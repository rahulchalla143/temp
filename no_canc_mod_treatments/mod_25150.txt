Past Medical History: s/p TAH/BSO s/p cholecystectomy type 2 DM status-post R fem->ant tibial bypass [**1-18**] complicated by wound infection Anxiety Retinopathy Hypertension Coronary Artery disease GERD ST-elevation MI in [**2-18**] w/ catheterization and stenting of left circumflex Constipation  Social History: The patient lives with her grandson.
[**2165-3-27**] CXR: Patient is status post interval median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery.
An endotracheal tube is present, terminating in the right main bronchus.
Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary artery, right PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm, and mediastinal drains and left-sided chest tube are present.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinetic basal inferior which is also aneurysmal; mid and apical anteroseptal and anterior hypokinetic walls; basal inferoseptal hypokinetic wall.
Evaluation by color flow doppler (vena contracta 4-5mm), pulmonary venous inflow (no systolic reversal or blunting of pulmonary veins of both sides), mitral annulus (30mm), dilated left atrium (4.7cm) and normal sized left ventricle in diastole (5.6 cm), a central regurgitant jet is visualized which is consistent with moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation under anesthesia and with provocative measures like trendelenburg position.
She was continued on lasix and beta-blockade preoperatively but plavix (for her recent lower extremity bypass) was held.
Vascular surgery consultation was obtained given her recent bypass procedure and history of groin infection and she was started on pre-operative antibiotics.
She was taken to the operating room for a CABG x3 on [**2165-3-27**] (please see the operative note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for full details).
She was extubated without complication early in her post-operative course but required re-intubation for respiratory compromise.
She had acute oliguric renal failure post-operatively which improved with hydration and diuretics.
She also had acute atrial fibrillation post-operatively which was treated with amiodarone; she did, however require cardioversion for unstable Afib on post-operative day 6.
She was started empirically on vancomycin and meropenum for leukocytosis post-operatively in the setting of her known groin infection, as per Infectious Disease department recommendations.
Wet to dry dressings were continued to these incisions.
Of note, she developed what appeared to be a sternal wound infection vs partial dehiscence around one week post-operatively and vancomycin was continued.
Betadine occlusive dressings were applied daily to her sternum with improvement.
From a nutritional standpoint, given her prolonged intubation she required some tube feeding post-operatively; eventually she was able to tolerate a regular diet.
After her first re-intubation she was again extubated on post-operative day 6 without complication.
Her coumadin was titrated for her target INR of 2.0-2.5.
A PICC line was placed for her intravenous antibiotics.
Vancomycin and levofloxacin were continued per the infectious disease and vascular surgery service.
She will remain on one additional week of vancomycin and levofloxacin from her date of discharge.
