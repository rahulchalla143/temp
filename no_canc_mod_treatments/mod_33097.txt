Admission Date:  [**2110-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Blurry vision in right eye, vertigo, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiography Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 60 year-old right handed man with a past medical history significant for HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Hospital6 3872**] on [**2110-11-12**] with complaints of transient vision loss, vertigo, and dysarthria who is transferred now for management of possible right vertebral artery dissection.
He is transferred here now on a heparin gtt for further management.
The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp, palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria, nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression, anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.
Normal bilateral carotid and right vertebral arteries with small right vertebral artery as a normal variation.
The source of this occlusion is unclear, though emboli from the occluded left vertebral artery origin is a possibility.
No obvious new infarct is identified, though MR is more sensitive for further evaluation.
Endotracheal tube lies approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.
The OSH had concern for vertebral dissection, and started him on a heparin gtt.
He was initially on a heparin gtt, which was discontinued [**11-15**] after MRI/A and CTA showed no vertebral artery dissection.
At that time he was restarted on ASA 81 mg daily.
HgA1c 5.5%, FLP: Chol 158, TG 136, HDL 44, LDL 87, CEs: CK 73, TropT <0.01, serum tox positive for Tylenol at 6.5, ESR 8, CRP 3.0.
On the morning of [**11-17**], he required urgent evaluation for dizziness, mental status changes, and dysarthria.
He was restarted on the heparin gtt, and transferred to the NeuroICU for frequent neuro checks.
During the procedure, the neurosurgeons were unable to go through the chronically occluded left vertebral artery (and the right vertebral artery goes into PICA), so no catheter based thrombolysis could be performed.
His ASA was discontinued, and he was started on Coumadin 5 mg daily (with heparin gtt bridge).
He was started on Midodrine 5 mg PO bid given his low blood pressure, and this can be weaned in [**3-25**] weeks as tolerated.
His Simvastatin was increased to 80 mg daily.
Medications on Admission: ASA 81 daily, started 3 days PTA Lisinopril-HCTZ 10-12.5 mg daily Simvastatin 20 mg qhs, hadn't taken in the 1 month PTA  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Stroke - right cerebellar vermal infarct, occlusion of the left vertebral artery with progression to occlusion of the basilar artery  SECONDARY: Hypertension alternating with low blood pressure Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: No dysarthria, slight right eye ptosis, visual fields full, smile symmetric, slight right pronator drift, full muscle strength, reflexes brisk but symmetric in the knees and ankles   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with decreased vision in your right eye, dizziness, and nausea.
During this hospitalization, you developed worsening dizziness and drooping of your right face, and it was found that the clot extended to your basilar artery which required you to be transferred to the NeuroICU.
Your blood pressure ran low during this hospitalization, and your home blood pressure medications were held.
You were started on a medication, Midodrine, to keep your blood pressure up, and should continue this for at least 3-4 weeks.
The following changes were made to your medications: Your Aspirin was discontinued, and you were started on Coumadin 5 mg daily.
Your Simvastatin was increased to 80 mg daily.
Your Lisinopril-HCTZ was discontinued because your blood pressure was low during this hospitalization.
You were started on Midodrine 5 mg twice daily to keep your blood pressure up, and this can be weaned in [**3-25**] weeks.
