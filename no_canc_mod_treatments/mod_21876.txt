Proteus [**Name (NI) 11646**]  Pt was continued on ceftriaxone for proteus bacteremia.
The patient will be continued on IV 1g QD ceftriaxone for 4 weeks from [**2100-8-13**] and Vancomycin 750mg QHD for 2more weeks (given history of MRSA OM) for osteomyelitis but duration will be determined by outpatient Podiatry Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and will depend on how wound is heeling.
Vascular was consulted and arteriogram was performed on [**8-17**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and angioplasty was successfully performed on distal graft.
Given the improvement in his distal blood flow it was felt that the L heel osteomyelitis might respond to conservative treatment with abx and wound care.
Rectus sheath hematoma-  During hospital course pt developed rectus sheath hematoma at sight of heparin injections.
Pt's Hct drifted down to 25 so he required several blood transfusions to aim for Hct >30.
The hematoma stabilized so pt was felt stable for d/c with plans to recheck Hct and plts at HD and transfuse to keep Hct>30 and Plts>50.
[**Name (NI) 5964**] Pt was continued on HD MWF.
All medications were renally dosed.
He was continued on Epo at HD.
[**Name (NI) 298**]  Pt was admitted with mental status change that improved with treatment of infection.
Currently holding antiplatelet agents given low plt count.
We have started oxycodone 2.5 mg QID, as well as PRN, which is keeping his pain well-controlled.
He may be switched to longer acting meds once at rehab.
Given his poor prognosis, goals of care were discussed and patient and family agreed to current treatment plan which included antibiotics and transfusions as necessary but avoiding major surgical interventions.
