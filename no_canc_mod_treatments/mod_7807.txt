PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Pancrease and renal transplant in [**2094**], appendectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate times two, right femoral posterior tibial bypass [**2104-12-9**], left femoral popliteal bypass [**2096-5-8**], thrombectomy of right lower extremity graft [**2105-5-9**].
Cataract extraction with lens implants and a right leg wound dehiscence [**2105-6-8**].
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., Imdur 30 mg po q.d., Reglan 5 mg po q.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg po b.i.d., Phos-Lo 1334 mg po t.i.d., Rocaltrol .25 mg po q.d., Hydralazine 12.5 mg t.i.d., Bicitra 30 cc po t.i.d., Prednisone 5 mg po q.d., Pravachol 20 mg po q.d., Rapamune 2 mg po q.d.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50 year-old diabetic, hypertensive male who has a long history of coronary artery disease with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties in the past.
He also has a history of end stage renal disease status post kidney and pancrease transplant in [**2094**] as well as peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting.
On [**2105-5-9**] he was admitted for a VF arrest.
The patient is referred for coronary artery bypass graft, however, he has limited useful conduits due to his lower extremity bypass grafting and his left radial artery has already been used for an AV fistula and is no longer patent.
Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2105-7-23**], which revealed moderate stenoses of the proximal innominate, right subclavian and left subclavian artery with no resting gradient, a patent left internal mammary artery and a peak gradient of 20 mmHg across the left subclavian stenosis with hyperemia.
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal coronary artery on [**2105-7-24**].
The patient was extubate that same day around 10:00 p.m.  Because the premature ventricular contractions continued Amiodarone was started.
Postoperative day one overnight events include transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells, one amp of bicarb and the starting on Amiodarone due to the multiple premature ventricular contractions.
Renal came by and saw the patient postoperative day one at which time they agreed to low dose ace inhibitor given his coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency and they recommended to follow creatinine and potassium closely.
Postoperative day two overnight events included the starting of Captopril for the afterload reduction.
The patient remained afebrile with vital signs stable and sinus rhythm at 67 with a white count of 6.5, hematocrit 31.2, platelets of 88, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, BUN 42, creatinine 1.7 and a glucose of 94.
Renal came by and saw the patient and they recommended restarting the patient's home medications of Bicitra 30 cc t.i.d.
po, Reglan 5 mg q.i.d.
with meals, Pravachol 20 mg po q.d., and hold off on the Phos-Lo until the patient is taking more po and the phosphate is higher.
and to discontinue the patient's Captopril due to the patient's renal function, to start Hydralazine at 20 mg t.i.d.
Transplant nephrology came by to see the patient at which time they recommended to avoid all potentially nephrotoxic medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunoglucosides and intravenous contrast, otherwise to continue with current plan.
Postoperative day five, overnight events include a Foley being placed secondary to the patient's request, because he straight catheterized himself at home.
The plan was for an AICD placement the following day and NPO after midnight.
Renal came by to see the patient again and they recommended discontinuing Lasix if the negative Is and Os persist.
[**2105-7-29**] the patient was evaluated by EPS for the ICD implantation and on [**2105-7-30**] the patient underwent an AICD placement to his left chest.
[**7-30**], renal came by and saw the patient again at which time they just recommended to continue with current treatment and to continue to check the chemistries and follow Is and Os.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po b.i.d.
for seven days, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 hours prn, Rapamune 2 mg po q.d., Hydralazine 20 mg po t.i.d., Lopresor 25 mg po b.i.d., Pravachol 20 mg po q.d., Prednisone 5 mg po q.d., Bicitra 30 cc po t.i.d., Reglan 5 mg po q.i.d.
He will be receiving home physical therapy.
