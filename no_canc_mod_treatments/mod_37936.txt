The patient complains of increasing fatigue as well as a 14-pound weight gain since his discharge on [**2-15**] despite recently increasing his Lasix dose from 80 mg to 100 mg in the morning with an additional 80-mg dose in the afternoon, as well as the addition of Zaroxolyn administered prior to Lasix.
Therefore, the patient was admitted for further management of what was felt to be congestive heart failure exacerbation.
However, the patient was stabilized with increasing Lasix dosage.
Status post pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in [**2098**] secondary to third-degree heart block.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2086**] with cardiogenic shock at the age of 47; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2102-5-22**] with 50% proximal left anterior descending artery, severe pulmonary hypertension, wedge of 14, and global hypokinesis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d., captopril (discontinued the week prior to admission), aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., NPH 26 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m., sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
for chest pain, Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Pravachol 20 mg p.o.
q.d., digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
q.d., Isordil 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d., K-Dur one tablet p.o.
The patient was initially admitted to the Medicine floor and then subsequently he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for more intensive hemodynamic monitoring and further management.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on his current doses of aspirin, Pravachol, and Isordil given his history of coronary artery disease.
Given that the patient was felt to be significantly fluid overloaded with poor cardiac output, it was recommended that a Swan-Ganz catheter be placed and the patient to be placed on a Milrinone drip.
The patient was continued on Lasix which was changed to 40 mg intravenously b.i.d., and his digoxin was held given elevated digoxin levels, and captopril was held given his acute renal failure.
The initial Swan-Ganz placement was performed without difficulty and demonstrated hemodynamics as follows:  Right atrium 30 mmHg, right ventricle 80/30 mmHg, pulmonary artery of 80/30 mmHg, wedge of 30 mmHg.
The patient was subsequently started on a Milrinone intravenous drip which was renally dosed given his low creatinine clearance.
The patient continued to demonstrate elevated filling pressures and a high wedge; however, some benefit of Milrinone drip was seen by following mixed venous saturations.
The patient's Lasix dose was not felt to be adequate to promote diaphoresis, and therefore he was switched to a Lasix drip which was increased to its maximum dose.
Given the patient's overall fluid overload which was not appropriately responding to Lasix therapy, a Renal consultation was obtained to consider continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
Over the next few days the patient did not appear to respond to a Lasix drip with the addition of Zaroxolyn.
The medications were discontinued secondary to his lack of urinary output.
As the patient became nearly oliguric, a femoral vein Quinton catheter was placed, and the patient was initiated on continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
However, over the next few hospital days, the patient's cardiac output and cardiac index continued to decrease despite optimal Milrinone and vasopressin therapy in addition to continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
The poor prognosis for the patient in view of optimal medical management was discussed with the patient as well as his family.
A Renal consultation was obtained at the time of admission to comment on the appropriateness of initiating hemodialysis given the patient's overall fluid overload state.
An initial attempt was made to diuresis the patient with a Milrinone, Lasix, and supportive vasopressin drips; however, as these treatments failed and the patient became nearly oliguric, a Quinton catheter line was placed, and the patient was initiated on continuous venovenous hemofiltration dialysis.
In addition, the patient was maintained on Phos-Lo and Amphojel given his elevated phosphorous levels, and his electrolytes were followed carefully on a b.i.d.
However, despite adequate diuresis and hemodialysis the patient continued to remain oliguric and continued to demonstrate a decrease in cardiac output and index.
However, the patient had no signs or symptoms suggestive of a pneumonia on a clinical basis, and therefore antibiotics were withheld unless the patient had an increase in a white blood cell count of fever.
The patient has a history of sleep apnea and was continued on BiPAP at night.
The patient was also provided supplemental oxygen therapy as needed to maintain comfort given his overall fluid overload status.
