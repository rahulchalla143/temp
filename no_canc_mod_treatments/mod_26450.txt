Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD (MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to the ED with AMS and dehydration.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Aspiration Pneumonia: Pt required transfer to the MICU from [**1-17**] - [**1-18**] for management of aspiration.
Also hx of mucus plugging responsive to chest PT and suction.
He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn initially for his febrile illness but this was switched to vancomycin and meropenem given concern for zosyn related rash on his abdomen.
When the rash worsened, he was switched to ceftaz and completed an 8 day course with Vanc and Ceftaz given QHD which ended on [**2113-1-23**].
Caution is advised the next time patient is made NPO to monitor his finger sticks carefully.
Transplant surgery and the IV team were [**Month/Year (2) 653**] regarding assistance with short and long term plans for his access issues (see below on TRANSITIONAL ISSUES FOR DETAILS).
The patient's last 3 INRs were within [**2-24**] goal range and the heparin gtt was discontinued on [**2113-1-30**].
He was continued on keppra 1500mg daily, lacosamide 50mg [**Hospital1 **] wo incident.
Does not appear to be worsening despite heparin gtt.
Has been on coumadin but was subtherapeutic on arrival and started on a heparin gtt until his coumadin was therapeutic.
He will follow up with transplant surgery as an outpatient.
# ESRD on HD: MWF, received dialysis on schedule.
He was continued on home dose sevelamer, which was switched to Lanthanum and nephrocaps.
He was continued on home dose aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and coumadin (which was titrated up for therapeutic INR).
# Depression: Was formerly on fluoxetine as listed [**Year (4 digits) **] med but held on [**Year (4 digits) **] as it causes hypoglycemia and it can lower the seizure threshold.
After consultation with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the tranplant surgeons, his tunneled line cannot be converted to a VIP port, and he has no other veins available for central access given his multiple clots and left arm reserved for fistulization.
Best options are to use antibiotics that use HD dosing such as vanc and ceftaz in order to forgo IV access.

You were treated with IV antibiotics.
You had an nasal tube placed for medication administration and drainage of your stomach fluids as you were found to have a small bowel obstruction as well.
A discussion was held between your daughter, palliative care services, and the medical team about the safety of eating.
Your family was made aware of the risks of choking on food, respiratory failure, infection, and rehospitalization but still prefer you to be full code (meaning undergo CPR and use of breathing machine if your heart would stop).
We also addressed your long term intravenous access needs.
Also, in the future, using antibiotics only to be given at dialysis would also benefit.
We restarted you on coumadin for your recent blood clot but we had to increase your dose.
Your current dose of coumadin is 11 mg a day.
We also changed your sevelamer to Lanthanum.
We have not made any other significant changes to your medications this hospitalization.
