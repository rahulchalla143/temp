Given the necesity of doing the surgery earlier rather than later, defered cath and proceeded to surgery on [**3-24**], ORIF.
A Foley catheter is seen in the bladder.
HIP PA and LAT [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: Status post ORIF right intertrochanteric fracture in overall anatomic alignment.
Clinical correlation is required for further interpretation.

She received 800 cc IVF, and her post-op hct was found to be 28.7 (down from 33) therefore she was transfused 1 UPRBC and her hematocrit subsequently remained stable.
She was started on metoprolol 5 mg IV Q 6 hours (couldn't take PO meds - see below), and her heart rate remained in the 70s and 80s for the remainder of the hospitalization.
It is felt that her brief hypoxia was likely related to mild fluid overload from IVF received in surgery and PRBCs, as well as an underlying aspiration pneumonia (see below).
She was started on levaquin and gently diuresed, with improvement back to baseline of 2 L within a day.
She was given atrovent NEBs intermittently as well for her COPD.
Levaquin started [**3-25**] for a planned 5 day course, however the course was lengthened to treat for her aspiration pneumonia as well.
It is unclear whether her oropharyngeal dysphagia is related to the high level of food in her esophagus or simply related to the anesthesia used during the operation.
They recommended thoracics involvement, however the thoracic surgeons advised waiting 2 weeks to see if the food clears on its own rather than doing esophageal disimpaction secondary to the high risk of the procedure and necessity for general anesthesia.
The family agreed to placing a PICC for TPN for the next 2 weeks, after which time the patient will have a repeat CT scan to see if the food has slowly moved on its own enabling GI to do another scope to further evaluate the obstruction.
She was started on levaquin and flagyl on [**3-25**], to complete a 14 day course.
Her hypoxia was thought likely [**1-2**] aspiration/food bolus in esophagus.
She initially improved on bblockers and diuresis.
