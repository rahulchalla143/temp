The only available access that we had was a tunnelled hemodialysis catheter in her right groin.
Since she was medically improving, it was felt that it would be in her best interest if the line was removed as there was a significant risk of infection.
There was no need to follow labs on her and therefore lack of intravenous access was not a pressing issue.
During her stay, she was on night Bi-PAP for presumed sleep apnea.
The only outstanding issue was hypertension with systolic pressure between 140 and 160 and diastolic between 80 and 100, which required an increase in her Lopressor to 25 p.o.
She received two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit stabilized at 30.
It was decided that anti-coagulation would not be in her best interest:  All her previous clots had been in the upper extremities and she had a history of gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
She never required hemodialysis and it is likely that she will require some in the near future.
