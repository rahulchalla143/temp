Full left and right-sided maze procedure with a [**Company 1543**] Gemini X Irrigated Bipolar device, as well as the cryo catheter.
He underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation in [**3-/2131**]; however, had recurrence shortly thereafter.
He then underwent pulmonary vein isolation in 12/[**2130**].
He was taken to the OR and underwent left iliac and left femoral popliteal thrombectomy and placement of a left common iliac stent.
He also had left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomies and evacuation and drainage of a left medial calf hematoma.
He was started on Coumadin and heparin.
After the subdural hematoma, he stopped Coumadin and remains off anticoagulation.
The patient is very reluctant to be on anticoagulation long term given his past medical history but was on it short term after recent left leg arterial clot.
Given his palpitations, concern with anticoagulation and recent cardiac study with documented atrial fibrillation, he has been referred for consideration of MAZE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] removal.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
The patient was extubated on post operative day 1 with hypoxia after extubation requiring noninvasive ventilation.
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol.
Attempts to decrease sedation and wean from ventialtor resulted in agitation which was managed with haldol.
He developed a medication induced ATN which improved when diuretics and other nephrotoxic agents were d/c'd until renal function recovered.
Sputum eventually grew out staph coag positive and cirpto was d/c'd and he was started on IV Vanco.
He developed post-operative afib and was started on betablockers for but developed a junctional rhythm.
EP service was consulted and amiodarone was started.
He was also maintained on a statin.
