He was given diltiazem 20mg IV once, prompting a transition to a-flutter in the 80's, with his bp dropping to 60's-70's.
He was given NS and then a dopamine drip.
On dopamine, his bp came up to the 120's and hr back up to the 130's, and he was transferred for further management.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was given calcium and glucagon with little response, remaining hypotensive, so he was cardioverted with 50 joules, resulting in sinus bradycardia.
His bp was in the 90's on a low dose of a norepi gtt (changed from dopa for tachycardia and ectopy).

The IVC is >2.5cm in diameter with no change with respiration (estimated RAP >20 mmHg).
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
An NG tube has been placed seen to reach below the diaphragm.
Brief Hospital Course: 77m with htn, afib/flutter, chf with preserved ef, prostate ca s/p prostatectomy who presented with sx of increasing volume overload, was found to be in aflutter, and became bradycardic and hypotensive following administration of IV diltiazem requiring pressors and intubation.
#Shock/Pump -- His original presenting hypotension was felt to be mixed type in nature, with distributive component likely from the diltiazem (he has had this same response to the same drug in [**6-/2156**], with similar presenting symptoms) and a cardiogenic component from baseline heart failure with loss of supportive tachycardia.
By the second day of the admission he'd actually returned to his usual hypertensive state, and his anti-hypertensive medications were slowly re-introduced.
Following this, spironolactone was added both for his CHF and for its potentially salubrious effect on cardiac remodeling, done with an eye towards the subseuqently discussed dysrhythmias.
As such, the cardiology team actively diuresed the patient with furosemide 40mg intravenously on days [**1-23**] with a good response (nearly 1-1.5 liters negative per day) with a good response in both peipheral edema and room air sats (both at rest and ambulatory).
His regimen was changed around to include lisinopril, metoprolol xl, spironolactone, and furosemide.
This was first treated with diltiazem, causing the bradycardia and hypotension, then eventually cardioverted with 50 joules.
As such, he was started on amiodarone and warfarin.
The risks and benefits were discussed of both medications, and the patient understood, saying he'd continue taking the medications and would be seen regularly by his pcp for all requisite lab work.
He was easily extubated on day two, with intially low O2 sats (80's-90's) on room air that rapidly improved with diuresis.
This was likely due to ATN from his pressor-dependent hypotension as well as pressor use.
Once stable, more active diuresis and ace-inhibiton was initiated with ongoing improvement in his creatinine.
With high chloride, likely was originally hyperchloremic from agressive NS resuscitation.

You have recovered for an episode of low blood pressure and a fast heart rate (atrial flutter) for which your medications have been adjusted.
You had an endo-tracheal tube placed.
You are being discharged on a blood thinner to prevent strokes and will need to have labs checked weekly to make sure the medication is working appropriately.
