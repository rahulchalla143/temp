[**2192-4-24**]: G-tube placement via interventional radiology  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
PSH: - Carpal tunnel repair 20 yr ago - liver bx - [**2191-7-6**] Left shoulder arthroscopic subacromial decompression.
- [**2192-2-13**] Anterior cervical diskectomy C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7.
However, review of prior studies suggests that there has been prior instrumentation and intervertebral fusion devices at these levels and this may represent residua from that.
[**2192-4-15**] Tissue: Intervertebral disc, C3-C4, excision: Fibrocartilage and bone with acute inflammation and fibrin, consistent with abscess formation.
[**2192-4-15**] CXR: ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above the carina.
[**2192-4-15**] C-spine MRI: Progression of abnormality since the cervical spine MR of [**2192-4-14**].
ET tube in standard placement.
Endotracheal tube remains in place.
Extensive post-surgical changes as described above with no findings to suggest hardware failure status post recent corpectomy with C3-C5 anterior fusion.
[**2192-4-20**] CXR: The ET tube tip is 2.5 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.
[**2192-4-22**] CXR: ET tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carina.
Left subclavian catheter remains in place.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
[**2192-4-24**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
Persistent pre-existing right-sided basal atelectasis, otherwise, the lung parenchyma is clear, there is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
The patient proceeded to the interventional radiology suite, for percutaneous gastrostomy placement.
The feeding tube has been removed in the interim.
[**2192-4-29**] AXR: A pigtail catheter is seen across the abdominal midline.
[**2192-4-30**] CXR:  Existing PICC line repositioned, now with tip in the SVC.
[**2192-5-1**] MRI C-spine: Persistent extensive inflammatory changes after repeated anterior and posterior decompression and fusion.
However, the intensity of enhancement, the size of epidural fluid collections, the spinal cord edema, and prevertebral fluid and enhancement have all improved dramatically since the examination of [**2192-4-17**].
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE ON SURGERY: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
He underwent anterior and posterior approach removal of hardware and evacuation of epidural abscess with a posterior laminectomy to decompress.
Post-operatively he developed right sided hemiparesis and went back for repeat operation on [**4-15**] after repeat imaging showed increase in size of the epidural abscess.
He had a C4 vertebrectomy and incision of C3-C4 disk, with placement of anterior hardware for cervical spine instability.
Antibiotic coverage was switched to cefazolin once the Staph aureus was identified as MSSA.
He was started on meropenem, and vancomycin was re-added on [**4-19**].
He was found to be C. diff positive on [**4-19**], and PO vancomycin was initiated.
On [**4-24**] a percutanous gastrostomy tube was placed in IR (given concern for aspiration).
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE, BY PROBLEM, WHILE ON MEDICINE SERVICE: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68yM with history of cervical spondylitis s/p C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**] complicated by epidural abscess s/p evacuation and hardware removal on [**4-14**], growing MSSA, elevated WBC/protein in CSF concerning for meningitis, now extubated and transferred to the medical service for altered mental status/confusion.
All altering medications (benzodiazepenes, narcotics) were held, and his infection was treated as below.
Pain was treated with standing acetaminophen (500-1000mg Q6H), and tramadol was added when his medication improved.
He was started on low dose quetiapine for sleep and agitation.
Vancomycin was continued (through [**6-8**]), meropenem finished [**5-2**].
Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in two weeks; he should continue to wear cervical collar until then.
His respiratory status will need to be monitored (concern for aspiration; aspiration precautions and NPO until speech and swallow clears him).
Diagnosed as above during course on surgical service.
Continue PO vancomycin; will need to continue 5 days past finishing IV vancomycin (until finished with IV antibiotics).
Held statin for now given elevated transaminases.
Continue NPO and continue tube feeds.
Heparin SubQ, bowel regimen PRN given diarrhea, famotidine.
Insulin sliding scale while on tube feeds.
PICC placed; CVL from course on surgery was pulled.
