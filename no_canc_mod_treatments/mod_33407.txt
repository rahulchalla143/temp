The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.
On [**2104-7-10**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent CABG x3 (LIMA-LAD, SVg to diag, SVG to OM, SVg to PDA).
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He was known to have type I  second degree AV block and was trialed on low dose betablockers for their protective effect.
He developed progressive heart block (type I mobitz AV block)and betablockers were discontinued after consultation with electrophysiology service.
A pacer was recommended as an outpatient.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Symptomatic postoperative anemia, HCT=25, likely dilutional, was treated with 1 unit of red packed cells with good response.
Diuresis continued.
By the time of discharge on POD#5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
