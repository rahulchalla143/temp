# DM - patient takes metformin at home, sugars have been well controlled, was d/c'ed on lantus previously.
We held the metformin because of her CKD and put her on insulin sliding scale.
She can stay on insulin for now but eventually go back on metformin (if her kidney function is ok) as she would be unlikely to be able to administer insulin to herself.

Per patient, gabapentin helped pain improve.
