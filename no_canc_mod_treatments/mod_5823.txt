Of note, the pt was recently started on a new CCB (x 2 weeks; cardizem from nifedipine).
At OSH, pt rec'd calcium gluconate (unclear dose).
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given isoproteronal gtt at 1mcg/min then 2mcg/min.

Brief Hospital Course: Hospital [**Last Name (un) **]: 80yo F with hx of PVD, DM, HTN, Lung CA s/p resection and COPD presents to OSH with symptomatic AVB (mental status changes and ARF) now s/p PPM placement.
The location of block is also not perfectly elucidated but it appears to be at level of AV node as isoproterenol resulted in increased rate.
Therefore a temporary pacer wire was placed under fluoro in the L femoral position for VVI pacing at 60bpm.
She was therefore taken to the EP lab where a permanent pacemaker was placed on [**7-19**].
She received vancomycin prophylactically around the device placment.
She was also given an additional day of clindamycin as well.
Post pace make placement, the temporary pacing wires were removed.
A CXR confirmed proper placement of the pacemaker and its leads and the pacemaker was interrogated demonstrating appropriate capture.
Of note, the pt had been on coumadin 3mg QHS after developing atrial fibrillation post-op in [**3-22**] and on admission this was reversed given supratherapeutic INR.
She was restarted on coumadin at 5mg QHS the day after the pacemaker was placed.
INR should be followed closely and coumadin levels should be adjusted to achieve a goal INR of [**3-19**].
BP control was initially achieved with nitro gtt and then this was weaned off as outpt meds were restarted, including lisinopril (at same dose), diltiazem (at higher dose), and lasix (at lower dose).
She was also started on a low dose beta blocker for additional blood pressure control.
Her final regimen at time of dischage included diltiazem CR 360mg once daily, Lisinopril 40mg once daily, Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and lasix 40mg once daily.
Given her history of COPD, the effect of the low dose beta blocker should be monitored closely.
After placement of the PPM, her Cr has been trending down.
Her ACEI was titrated back up to her outpt dose and her lasix was similarly titrated back on.
Her renal function and urine output shouuld be followed closely in rehab with routine chemistries.
# Anemia: HCT was 27.9 on admission which then dropped to 24 after pacer placement (moderate procedural blood loss).
As the pt had a foley catheter in place at the time of the finding, she was started on Bactrim DS one tab [**Hospital1 **] for a total of 10day course for complicated UTI on [**7-19**].
She should complete ten day course of Bactrim (last dose [**2128-7-28**]) given this occurred in the setting of a foley catheter.
# Urinary retention: Her foley catheter was removed after her UA and urine culture returned positive for a UTI.
However she was found to be retaining 500cc of urine (as demonstrated by US on Post Void Residual) and so the foley was replaced.
This urine retention was attributed to her chronic use of narcotics (fentanyl patch) and resultant atony.
The foley catheter should remain in place until either she demonstrates the ability to urinate or an outpt urological appointment can be arranged by her PCP.
# Foot pain: The pt complained of left foot pain on HD #3.
The pt has known chronic pain from neuropathy, however her pain medications were held in the setting of ARF.
# COPD: The pt has a diagnosis of COPD and a hx of tob use but is not on any routine nebulizers or inhalers.
She was started on low dose beta blocker for additional blood pressure control as well as for additional PVD and CAD ppx.
She was not noted to have any pulmonary side effects of this medication, however this should be monitored routinely with regular physical examinations and treatment with nebulizers if necessary.
# DMII: she was maintained on ISS while in house and restarted on glipizide on discharge.
She was kept on aspirin and restarted on coumadin after the pacer was placed.
# PPx: The pt was maintained on DVT ppx with heparin sub Q during this admission.
