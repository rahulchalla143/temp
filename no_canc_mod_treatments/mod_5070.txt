CXR [**2120-1-28**] Nasogastric tube tip within the stomach.
UPPER GI BLEED:  An NG tube was placed in the ED with immediate return of ~1.5L coffee grounds initially, without clearing on lavage with 1L NS.
She was admitted to the MICU overnight and started on IV PPI.
Rather, a large hiatal hernia was seen  with much of the stomach taking a tortuous course through the thorax.
General surgery was involved, and at that time, the patient had decided against a surgical intervention due to high perioperative risk of mortality given her age.
She was transferred to the medical floor where she was continued on PPI and sucralfate.
She tolerated advancement of her diet without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
The minimally-invasive surgery team was consulted as the patient became more amenable to intervention, and felt that a correction of the hiatal hernia would be non-emergent though appropriately managed in the outpatient setting after undergoing repeat EGD to definitively establish a diagnosis of her friable fundus mucosa and eschar via biopsy.
She was continued on her PO PPI, sucralfate, and was instructed to stop aspirin.
She was discharged on her metoprolol and lisinopril.
