Admission Date:  [**2142-7-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-7-21**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic surgery  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times four  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant 64 year old diabetic male with established coronary artery disease.
He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the mid left anterior descending in [**2133-3-14**] and again in [**2134-4-12**] for restenosis.
He had done well with medical management but has gradually developed worsening exertional angina.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for  insulin dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two and hypertension.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post a vasectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2142-7-17**] for coronary artery bypass.
He received four grafts, left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
He was started on insulin drip for glycemic control.
He was initially on Neosynephrine for blood pressure control, however, this was quickly tapered off.
He had chest tubes that were placed intraoperatively, however, these had no air leak at that time.
On postoperative day #1 then his chest tubes were taken out.
He was started on Beta blocker and started to diurese with Lasix.
However, after 30 mg of intravenous Lopressor he failed to be adequately rate-controlled.
He was loaded with Amiodarone intravenously.
His rate was being controlled with Beta blockade as necessary.
He was once again loaded with intravenous Amiodarone and again converted to normal sinus.
Plan is to discharge the patient home on Amiodarone and Lopressor to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] on an outpatient basis.
If the patient continues to go in and out of atrial fibrillation he will need anticoagulation which would be addressed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] on an outpatient basis.
