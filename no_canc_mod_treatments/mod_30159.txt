She was given nebulizer treatments x 2 with no improvement prompting her PCP to send her into the emergency department.
She is on albuterol PRN at home which she has been requiring more frequently (though as above she ran out of this medication recently).
She was previously on flovent but stopped this medication approximately 1 month ago due to insurance issues.
She was given nebulizers x 3 the started on scheduled nebs q 1 hr nebulizer treatments in addition to prednisone 60 and IV magnesium.

Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo female with a hx of asthma requiring intubation in the past who presents with wheezing and shortness of breath c/w an asthma exacerbation in the setting of a probable viral infection, medication non complaince course c/b pneumonia and headaches found to have a chiari malformation and cervical syrinx  # Acute exacerbation of asthma Presentation was felt to be most consistent with an exacerbation of the patients known asthma secondary to environmental factors, URI and medication non compliance.
As above she initially required q 1 hr albuterol treatment in the ED.
She was started on oral prednisone and given a one time dose of IV magnesium.
She was admitted to the ICU given need for frequent treatments and history of requiring intubation.
Respiratory status improved and nebulizer treatments were spaced to albuterol every 4 hours and ipratropium every 6 hours.
Pulmonary was consulted and they advised to add Singulair and briefly placed her on IV steroids.
The Pulmonary team recommended a cost effective regimen including Symbicort, Spiriva and Singulair, given the patient social situation.
The pharmacy was called and it was estimated that this regimen would cost about $13 dollars a month.
Given that the patient had been hospitalized, she was initially started on broad spectrum coverage with zosyn.
She will be discharged to home with 9 additional days of Augmentin to complete her course.
Her only remaining symptoms toward the end of her hospitalization was left posterior neck pain/stiffness which was reproducible on exam.
She was given lidocaine patches and was encouraged to use non-narcotics analgesics given her constipation.
# HTN, poorly controlled The patient had been on blood pressure medications in the past and it appears they had been stopped for economic reasons.
# Constipation The patient was started on an aggressive bowel regimen.
She had a bowel movement with the assistance of enemas and multiple medications .
Patient was given Tessalon pearles and Guaifenesin for cough as well as Guaifenesin with codeine to allow for better sleep at night.
# Sinus Tachycardia Likely due to anxiety about discharge and albuterol treatment throughout her course.
SW provided her with as much support as possible and made SW support in her PCP's practice aware of these issues.
In addition, they called the patients pharmacy to be sure she could get her medications with her current insurance.
The patient indicated she did not have any medications at home, as a result I refilled all her medications.
