He was started on Lopressor, Plavix, aspirin, Integrilin, and nitroglycerin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further care.
The patient's most recent cardiac catheterization prior to this admission revealed the following:  an ejection fraction of 38%, a normal left main, a 60% tubular middle left anterior descending artery with a totally occluded first diagonal, faint left-to-left collaterals, a distal left anterior descending artery of 90%, a small ramus with a proximal 70%, circumflex system with a 90% first obtuse marginal inferior lesion, and a 70% superior pole lesion, a diffusely diseased third obtuse marginal.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 20 mm; and at that time the patient had stent to the first obtuse marginal with additional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the upper pole of the first obtuse marginal.
The proximal to middle left anterior descending artery lesion underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting, and the distal left anterior descending artery was treated with a stent also.
The patient was directly admitted to the catheterization laboratory at [**Hospital6 33**], at which time he underwent a limited study notable for in-stent restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery stent placed in [**2175-8-20**] and a 90% distal left anterior descending artery occlusion, and a distal left anterior descending artery that was subtotally occluded immediately proximal to a prior distal left anterior descending artery stent.
The proximal left anterior descending artery 80% in-stent restenosis underwent successful brachy therapy, and a stent was placed in the distal left anterior descending artery proximal to a prior stent to treat a restenosis.
The procedure was complicated by hypotension in to the 70s with bradycardia into the 40s, in a sinus rhythm.
He was started on dopamine which was eventually increased to 10 mcg/kg per minute, and the Coronary Care Unit team was then asked to evaluate and observe the patient overnight while peripheral anatropes were weaned.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Cardizem 240 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Paxil 10 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of hypotension, for which the short differential included active blood loss which was effectively ruled out by the CT study and a vagal response necessitating inotropic support.
After the dose of Ativan, the patient's dopamine requirement decreased from 9 mcg/kg per minute to 2 mcg/kg per minute over the course of an hour and a half.
The following morning, dopamine was discontinued.
Three vessel coronary artery disease; status post left anterior descending artery intervention times two on current admission.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Cardizem 240 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Paxil 10 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Folate 1 mg p.o.
