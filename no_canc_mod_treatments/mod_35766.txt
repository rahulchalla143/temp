She was transferred to the MICU where she was intubated for airway protection.
She was extubated on [**2109-10-10**] and was initially put on Bi-PAP which she did not appreciate and was doing well on room air so was transferred from the MICU to the regular Medicine floor.
Insulin NPH 20 units q.
Glucophage 1000 mg p.o.
Lithium 1200 mg p.o.
Patient was intubated with vent settings of pressure support of 5, PEEP of 5, fio2 of 40%, tidal volume 370, O2 saturation 95 to 98%.
Jugular venous distention and lymphadenopathy could not be detected or examined.
PULMONARY:  Patient had a chest tube that was placed to help with the drainage of the left pleural effusion / consolidation that was seen.
It was followed by CT Surgery and the chest tube self discontinued by the patient on [**2109-10-12**].
At that time she was started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
No further intervention was done.
Her elevation in her LFTs was probably secondary to drug interaction since she was taking high levels of Glucophage along with Klonopin and Risperidone.
At that time, it was decided that we will hold off on the Glucophage and the Amantadine, both which are known to cause elevated LFTs.
The patient was to continue her diabetic management through her NPH and her regular sliding scale insulin.
