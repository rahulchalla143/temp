He was evaluated by cardiologist and had shown positive stress testing and was therefore admitted for elective coronary angiography.
While on the angiography table the patient underwent a stenting procedure and his LAD had ultimately caused a perforation leading to tamponade.
Cardiac surgery was urgently consulted and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a bedside pericardial window during the resuscitation for the patient.
He had a saphenous vein graft from the left anterior descending as well as saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
He was weaned from his pressor support with Levophed.
Chest tubes were well placed and no evidence of effusion.
He was transfused one unit of red cells and was started on diuresis.
He was empirically given Vancomycin and Gentamycin times one week due to the fact that he had received an emergent prep as well as bedside pericardial window and he remained afebrile throughout his course.
Pain resolved with adequate analgesia and physical therapy.
Chest tubes and Foley were previously removed 48 hours before discharge.
