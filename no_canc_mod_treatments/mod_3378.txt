Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s when she was transferred to the CCU on a nitrogylcerin and nitroprusside drip.
The two drips were weaned off overnight.
The heparin gtt was held given her recently elevated SBP due to the risk of hemorrahage.
She had elevated BS in the 430's which remained elevated after 6 units of humalog x2, so she was started on an insulin gtt until the morning when she was weaned off and given 4 units of lantus and covered with SSI.
She was delirious overnight and was given 5 mg of zyprexa x2 and 2.5 mg iv haldol x1 for agitation and required restraints to avoid her from climbing out of bed and pulling out her IVs.

Her SBP rose to the 200's during the procedure again and she was started on a nitro gtt which was weaned off overnight as her blood pressue was better controlled with oral medications.
