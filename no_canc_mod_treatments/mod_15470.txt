CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  On [**2180-4-13**] baby girl [**Name (NI) 49775**] was transported to [**Hospital3 1810**] at [**Location (un) 86**] where she underwent ductus arteriosus ligation.
She tolerated the operation quite well and recovered subsequently at [**Hospital1 1444**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  At the time of her duct ligation, she was being maintained on high-frequency ventilation secondary to high ventilatory pressures during the period of time wherein she had pneumonia.
She remained on high-frequency ventilation postoperatively with mean airway pressures of 12 to 14 and amplitudes of 17 to 28.
Her FIO2 during that time ranged from the 0.2 range to 0.6 range, and she received several doses of Lasix postoperatively and then intermittently in the time frame just subsequent to her duct ligation.
She was transitioned to conventional ventilation on [**2180-4-27**] after her chest x-ray was reflective of patchy atelectasis and inhomogeneity which might be better treated with conventional ventilation.
She has remained on conventional ventilation since that time.
She is currently on Chlorthiazide which was started approximately three days ago and has already resulted in a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.
She is also on Combivent 1 puff q.8h.
Her Chlorthiazide dose is currently 10 mg/kg q.12h.
She had undergone several courses of indomethacin therapy and had not attained any significant volume at feedings secondary to her persistent patent ductus arteriosus.
Subsequent to her duct ligation, she was initially nothing by mouth; however, she was started on trophic feeds by [**2180-4-15**] and she steadily increased on feeds; such that by [**2180-4-25**] she had attained full volume feeds of mother's milk of Premature Enfamil 20 calories per ounce.
She is currently also being supplemented with iron sulfate as well as vitamin E.  She was also started potassium chloride supplementation at 4 mEq/kg per day and sodium chloride supplementation at 2 mEq/kg per day.
Her electrolytes will be checked frequently during this time of initiation of chlorthiazide therapy and electrolyte supplementation.
HEMATOLOGIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  At the time of her patent ductus arteriosus ligation, baby girl [**Name (NI) 49775**] was completing a 14-day course of amphotericin B as well as ceftazidime secondary to a probable pneumonia with a tracheal aspirate which grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans as well as Morganella morganii.
She completed her antibiotic therapy course with 14 full days on [**2180-4-19**].
She remained off of antibiotics until [**2180-4-28**] when she started a 7-day course of oxacillin and gentamicin secondary to a tracheal aspirate which had grown out gram-negative rods as well as gram-positive cocci.
She completed her 7-day course of oxacillin and gentamicin on [**2180-5-3**] and is currently off antibiotics.
She is currently being watched closely for further signs or symptoms of sepsis and will be started on antibiotics if necessary.
Of note, she is currently without central access and has had her peripherally inserted central catheter removed for approximately one week.
