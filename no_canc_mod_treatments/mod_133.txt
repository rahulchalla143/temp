HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service.
After being consented, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**10-24**], where he tolerated a ligation of the AV fistula for venous hypertension without complication.
Postoperatively, the patient was doing well, both during his initial postoperative check on the night of surgery as well as the morning after surgery on a.m. rounds.
After being shocked several times, he went into a ventricular fibrillation and ultimately was stabilized with several doses of Atropine and several doses of epinephrine and then being put on a dopamine drip.
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care following this unfortunate event.
A Neurology consultation was obtained and because of the patient's unresponsiveness, a brain death protocol was established.
