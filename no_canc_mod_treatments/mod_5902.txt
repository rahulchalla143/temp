Admission Date:  [**2104-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-6-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nsaids / Nut Flavor / Lactose / Corn / Radioactive Diagnostics, General Classif / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laparoscopic ileostomy on [**2104-6-23**] Central line placement (now removed) PICC line placement on [**2104-7-28**] for long-term antibiotics   History of Present Illness: HPI: Pt is a 64 year old female with a history of Crohn's colitis who was transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital after she was observed to have stool discharging from the vagina.
Pt's most recent admission at [**Location (un) **] was for Klebsiella urosepsis, which responded well to Levoflox and IVF.
According to OSH records, pt may also have had feculent material which drained from a foley cath.
Due to pt's complicated clinical course (including recent MI), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her presumed vesicular-sigmoid fistula.
Bipolar Disorder 6. h/o c diff, now with c diff toxin negative x2 but persistent diarrhea, s/p tx with flagyl 7. h/o VRE 8. h/o MRSA 9.
Patient has a known diagnosis of Crohn's but given only the sigmoid involvement and lack of asymmetry and skip lesions, diverticulitis should also be considered.
IMPRESSION: Small, partially mobile echodensity on the aortic valve as described above c/w (but not diagnositic of) a vegetation.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Pt's most recent admission at [**Location (un) **] was for Klebsiella urosepsis, which responded well to Levoflox and IVF.
According to OSH records, pt may also have had feculent material which drained from a foley cath.
Due to pt's complicated clinical course (including recent MI), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her presumed vaginal/sigmoid fistula.
She received 500cc NS x 2, with little improvement in BP.
Of note, pt had received both carvedilol and lisinopril on admission.
She was placed on peripheral dopamine to achieve SBP>90.
A right subclavian line was placed, dopamine was d/c'd, and pt was placed on levophed.
She was given more NS bolusus, and started back on dopamine gtt.
Dopamine was d/c'd, she was given another NS bolus, and was placed on Neo gtt.
During her second stay in the ICU, she was started on Neosyn drip for 24 hours with SBPs between 70s to 100s.
Vancomycin was added to her antibiotic coverage.
On [**7-9**] she was restarted on lopressor (at 12.5mg TID).
After refusing LENI for further evaluation, the pt was started on heparin drip and returned to the medicine floor.
Her Vancomycin was discontinued a few days later with the idea that she had completed a two-week course since her admission and there were no recent positive blood cultures to indicate its use.
At this time, it was noted that her stress-dose steroids had been stopped 24 hours beforehand at the completion of the planned 7-day course.
She was given Decadron 4 mg and transferred briefly to the MICU where she almost immediately stabilized.
Vancomycin was restarted.
She also consented to doppler ultrasound of her lower extremities at this time which revealed a partial thrombus in her left common femoral vein; the heparin gtt was continued.
During a subsequent hypotensive episode, antibiotic coverage was broadened by exchanging levofloxacin for cefepime, providing new coverage against pseudomonas (then on cefepime,vancomycin,flagyl).
In light of new sensitivities for enterococcus organism and drug rash suspected to be due to vancomycin, ID approved the initiation of daptomycin for staph areus and enterococcus coverage.
Flagyl was continued for coverage of enteric bacteria secondary to vesicular-colonic fistual and potential for urosepsis.
ID was consulted for underlying VRE and MRSA bacteremic sepsis as cause of her hypotension despite being on multiple broad-coverage antibiotics, including daptomycin, flagyl, and levoquin.
She had surgery on [**2104-7-23**] with placement of ileostomy and diversion of rectovaginal fistula.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened by exchanging levofloxacin for cefepime, providing new coverage against pseudomonas.
In light of new sensitivities for enterococcus organism and drug rash suspected to be due to vancomycin, placed on daptomycin for MRSA and VRE.
On flagyl for coverage of enteric bacteria secondary to vesicular-colonic fistual and potential for urosepsis.
ID consulted regarding modifying antibiotic coverage or adding antifungal med.
Elderly patients have a higher threshold for mounting a fever and patient may be septic based on hemodynamic instability.
Patient had central line removed prior to PICC line placement on [**7-28**] and sent for culture.
PICC line placed for long-term antibiotics.
A tranesophageal echocardiogram revealed small, partially mobile echodensity on the aortic valve as described above c/w (but not diagnositic of) a vegetation.
- Close monitoring of BP, patient remained normotensive post-op - Antibiotic course: -- Levo/Flagyl x 2 weeks from surgery [**7-23**], on day 10 -- Dapto X 6 weeks after central line was taken out, on day 5 - Central line tip culture no growth to date .
Since there has been a history of non-compliance and  lack of follow-up, surgery was consulted for surgical intervention, as opposed to starting infliximab.
Patient is POD #11 s/p ileostomy which has had adequate output, without obstruction and minimal drainage from fistula.
- Continue Mesalamine .
Left upper extremity ultrasound to evaluate for clot was negative which decreased concern for HIT and checking heparin dependent antibody was not clinically indicated given normal platelet counts.
- Continued on home meds ASA, lipitor discontinued due to elevated LFTs - Beta-blocker was continued throughout her hospitalization, and lisinopril was restarted on discharge .
# Adrenal insufficiency: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
She was on low-dose steroids, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, prior to surgery given hypotension.
Patient was switched to a prednisone taper on POD #7 to end at 10mg daily and be followed up by GI.
She was placed on calcium and vitamin D therapies as corticosteroids can accelerate bone loss and decrease serum calcium levels.
# Bipolar d/o: Continue outpatient regimen of VPA and Risperdal.
# Stage 1 sacral decubitus ulcers: Should be treated daily by wound care .
# FEN: Patient switched to soft PO diet on [**7-27**] and off TPN given functionality of ileostomy.
# Anemia: Patient's Hct has remained stable s/p 1u pRBC transfusion post sx.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, PPI Monitor PTT, goal of 70-80 .
Patient was been given option of palliative care vs. surgery and stated that she understands surgical risk and very much would like to proceed with surgery.
