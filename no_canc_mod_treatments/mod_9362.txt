CT head [**2207-12-16**] Stable overall appearance of bilateral subdural hematomas, with stable leftward shift of the normally-midline structures.
EEG [**2207-12-18**] This video EEG telemetry was abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background that was usually in the delta frequency range with superimposed bursts of generalized delta slowing, often with a bifrontal predominance.
These findings suggest the presence of a severe encephalopathy which can be due to diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic changes, infections, medication effects, or other etiologies.
These findings suggest the presence of a severe encephalopathy such as can be seen from diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic changes, medication effects, infections, and other such etiologies.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

On [**12-14**] the patient experienced a LUE seizure and received 6 mg of Ativan which resulted in cessation of seizure activity.
He was taken to the OR on [**2207-12-15**] for right craniotomy and subdural hematoma evacuation.
Intra-operatively, the patient received 2 more units of FFP and 1 pack of platelets.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He remained intubated post-op given his inability to awaken, but he was breathing spontaneoulsy.
The patient was started on phenytoin, and then was transitioned to Keppra, to be continued on discharge.
Also, the patient had a Cx that was positive for Moraxella, and so was treated with abx (broad spectrum, then narrowed to cefepime for 8 days).
Upon transfer to the medical floor, he was satting well on RA, but over time, required O2 and further diuresis in the setting of volume overload.
After transfer to the medicine service, metoprolol was further titrated up to 50 mg PO/NG QID, however could not be continued given low BPs.
As the pt was volume overloaded, it was thought that perhaps diuresis would help his heart rate.
EKGs were done over the course of his hospitalization which verified Afib with RVR.
It will be important that this issue is followed up by Neurosurgery as well as his PCP so that he can hopefully be restarted on coumadin after NSG deems it safe to do so.
For that reason, free water flushes were increased with tube feeds, and D5W was administered prn hypernatremia.
# Fevers - The patient developed a fever during his hospitalization.
He had already been treated with 8 days of cefepime for possible HAP.
It may also be due to the SDH, and also the pt was noted to have a CVL (left subclavian) at the time.
He was given tylenol prn for symptomatic treatment.
Of note, the pt did have a short course of dicloxacillin as well for possible cellulitis, however this was d/c'ed after we concluded it was more likely gouty elbow vs bursitis instead of cellulitis.
# Hypertension - The pt's BP was normotensive to hypotensive with the titration of nodal agents for his a-fib.
We stopped the pt's atenolol that he was on as an outpatient as his BP is normotensive on the new regimen for A-fib.
# [**Name (NI) 20973**] The pt had an NG-tube after the procedure for tube feeds and PO medications.
He was actually advanced to a soft diet with NSG, however with further altered mental status, he was made NPO and all nutrition was done via NG tube.
The pt self-d/c'ed his NGT, and after an unsuccessful attempt to replace it, he underwent a PEG placement after a family meeting was called and it was deemed in line with his healthcare goals.
His tube feeds were restarted after 24 hours without incidence.
(See below for management of erythema at site of PEG tube per Surgery team) .
Patient initially placed on dicloxacillin, but discontinued when felt to be less likely cellulitis.
Patient improved with indomethicin treatment, with plan to continue Rx for 2 more days.
If necessary, can use prednisone after indomethacin if clinical improvement slows (eg 20 mg daily).
# Erythema and skin breakdown at PEG site: Evaluated by surgery, feels no need to loosen stitches.
# Hyperlipidemia - On statin .
# HIT history - Avoided heparin products, not anticoagulation candidate.
To maintain pneumoboots and compression stockings for prevention of DVT.
# Incidental findings on MRI: Patient noted to have infrarenal abdominal aneurysm on routine imaging.
# On discharge, please continue PT, OT, PEG tube feeds, wound care, and please consider repeat speech and swallow evaluation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care-[**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS - Subdural Hematoma  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES - Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Intraparenchyma hemorrhage - Atrial Fibrillation - Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - Polyneuropathy of Critical illness - Gout arthropathy vs. Bursitis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a Subdural Hematoma (bleed around the brain), and you were on the Neurosurgery service after your surgical procedure to relieve the blood/pressure in the skull.
Afterward, you developed a pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics, and you also had a fast heart rate from "Atrial Fibrillation" which was treated with medications to slow your heart down.
You also weren't moving your legs too much after the procedure, and so an MRI was done which showed nothing that could account for your weakness.
Also, you had a sore left elbow which we feel is gout or bursitis, which we are treating with medications (Indomethacin).
