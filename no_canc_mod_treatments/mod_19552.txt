Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old woman with history of HTN, Raynaud's, and scoliosis s/p multiple surgeries, initially admitted for elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy, admitted to the MICU with hypotension, found to have a PE, complicated by right heart strain and flash pulmonary edema; now improved.
#Spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy:  Patient admitted for spinal fusion with osteotomy for symptomatic scoliosis with sicatica.
Following surgery, patient's leg pain improved.
The patient was maintained on oxycontin, oxycodone, gabapentin, and cyclobenzaprine for pain control.
The patient was started on coumadin and a heparin drip to bridge (day 1 [**2201-6-23**]).
She was continued on the heparin drip until therapeutic on coumadin for 24 hours.
Lovenox contraindicated in this patient given history of spinal surgery.
Please check INR on [**6-29**] and adjust coumadin dosing as needed.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix following episode of flash pulmonary edema, and volume status improved.
Patient continues to have lower extremity edema and JVD to 1 cm below jaw, requiring further diuresis on discharge.
The patient was discharged on lasix 20 mg PO daily.
She should continue on this medication until she becomes euvolemic.
At that point, a decision can be made about whether it is necessary to continue oral lasix.
Patient was not on any diuretic therapy prior to the current admission.
Creatinine returned to baseline with diuresis from lasix, and possibly post-ATN autodiuresis.
#Hyponatremia - Sodium decreased from 135 to 126 in the setting of volume overload, consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia.
The patient was continued on allopurinol.
# Code: Full (confirmed with patient) ========================================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Patient to continue lasix until euvolemic.
