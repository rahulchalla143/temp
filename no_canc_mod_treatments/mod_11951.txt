# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: On [**4-2**] found to have DKA with AG 30 and patient had missed his long acting insulin dose prior to admission.
Thus, the episode was attribued to a missed insulin dose.
In the ICU he was given fluids and placed on an insulin gtt.
Once his gap closed he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.
Patient states he is type 1 and has been on insulin although was on oral agents before.
After he was transitioned off the insulin drip, he was continued on his home dosing of Glargine 25 units QHS and a Humalog sliding scale.
He was discharged with this regimen and had good glycemic control but will need continued titration as an outpatient for further improvement.
He was continued on ASA 81mg daily.
His Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily.
Additionally, he was started on low dose Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was on Labetolol prior to admission, but his blood pressure was well controlled without this medication.
Likely he will need less blood pressure meds given hemodialysis.
Upon discharge, patient was instructed to discuss his new medications with his primary care physician.
This was likely secondary to muscle spasm in the setting of his hemodialysis.
He has a Quentin catheter in his right chest and a maturing fistula in his right forearm.
He was also continued on calcium acetate and discharged with continued dialysis as an outpatient.
Patient states he is on Advair at home.
While inpatient he was placed on standing Ipratropium and PRN Albuterol.
This briefly occurred while in the ICU, prompting intubation for airway protection.
This may have been related to pain medication or uremia given his ESRF.
