Admission Date:  [**2122-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-4-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Meperidine / Erythromycin Base / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Fever, [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central line and Swan Ganz catheter placement Chest tube placement   History of Present Illness: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent x 2 (last one [**2121-12-26**] post IMI), CHF with EF 60%, PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and s/p left brachial pseudoaneurysmal repair, transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] with fever and hypotension, as well as troponin leak.
A RCA Cypher stent was placed with 10% residual stenosis.
She was treated with aspirin, nebs for possible COPD flare, and started on heparin IV for possible unstable angina.
Her BP did not improve with fluid resuscitation, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on neosynephrine and heparin IV for possible re-cath.
S/p PTCA and stent placement to the proximal RCA.
PTCA with Cypher stent placement performed, with 10% residual stenosis.
Aorto-bifem bypass [**2111**] 2.
Bilateral cataract surgery  Social History: She lives with her sister, no etOH.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent on [**2121-12-27**] for in-stent restenosis, CHF, PVD, who returned to [**Location **] on [**1-8**] with chest pain, initially ruled out, and who then developed fever to 104, hypotension and rise in troponin I, transiently on Neo drip, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CK was 250, Troponin 1.22 (peak), EKG without ST elevations.
Her picture was felt most consistent with sepsis with demand-related ischemia rather than stent thrombosis, and the decision was taken not to proceed to cardiac catheterization.
A PA line was placed on admission, with initial numbers CVP 11, PA 43/16, SVR 620, CO/CI 7.1/3.76 felt most consistent with sepsis physiology, and MUST protocol was initiated, with fluid resuscitation.
She required pressors intermittently, intially Neosynephrine, then Levophed, which were eventually weaned off.
She was continued on Heparin IV for 48 hours, then D/C'd.
While in hospital, she was continued on ASA, Plavix and Lipitor.
BB therapy was eventually resumed when BP stable.
ACE inhibitor held pending recovery of renal function, resumed on [**2122-1-21**] with improving renal function and titrated up.
2) CHF: On admission, an echo revealed a depressed EF with inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis.
Diuresis was initiated when the patient was hemodynamically stable, and she was intermittently placed on a Lasix drip prior to extubation, with good diuresis.
Subsequent echocardiograms revealed poor EF approximately 20% (overestimated on [**2122-1-13**]) with global LV hypokinesis.
Post-extubation, she was given Lasix intermittently, with a goal negative daily fluid balance.
ACE inhibitor therapy was held pending recovery of her renal function, and was resumed on [**2122-1-21**].
She was discharged on Lasix 20 mg PO QD.
She will need daily weights, with titration of Lasix to 40 mg PO QD if weight increases >3 lbs.
3) Pulmonary: On admission, a PA line was placed via the left subclavian vein, complicated by a tension pneumothorax requiring intubation and emergent chest tube placement.
Serial ABGs and labs revealed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, with compensatory hyperventilation.
The chest tube was pulled on [**2122-1-18**], without subsequent reaccumulation.
She was also started on a Prednisone taper for possible COPD exacerbation, to be continued as an out-patient.
She was given bronchodilator therapy via nebulizers, changed to inhalers at discharge.
All cultures were unremarkable, including sputum, urine and blood cultures.
She was empirically started on Levofloxacin on admission.
Vancomycin and Flagyl were added on [**2122-1-11**] in the setting of ongoing fever and hypotension and she completed an empiric 7-day course of antibiotics, D/C'd on [**2122-1-16**].
She was also anemic, and was transfused 2 units of PRBCs on [**2122-1-12**] to maintain her hematocrit above 30.
