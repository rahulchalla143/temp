The patient was placed on Labetolol 800 mg TID with goal SBP 160-170 and she remained on maximum doses of clonidine, enalapril and norvasc.
In fact, she was placed on Elanapril 40 mg PO BID.
She at times required Hydralazine 10 mg but would refuse IV so was placed on PO prn for systolic BPs over 200.
She initially complained of a headache which resolved with lowering of BP to the 140-150s systolic.
The patient was placed on telemetry for monitoring while HTN urgency resolved.
2) Line infection: The patient presented with right groin pustules believed to be secondary to a line infection in her right groin.
As a result, the patient was covered empirically with Vanco which she received with dialysis and was dosed by level.
[**Street Address(2) 1326**] surgery removed the line on Sunday, [**2160-8-17**].
She then went to IR for a right venogram on Monday [**2160-8-18**] at which time a left groin cath was placed.
After the placement of the left groin cath, she was noted to have developed pustules on the left near the cath site.
She was placed on the OR schedule for AV fistula on [**2160-8-20**] secondary to concern that the patient had poor compliance and would not return for a graft placement if told to remain on a 2 week course of antibiotics.
She is now status post RUE graft on [**2160-8-20**] which remains patent.
3) ESRD: s/p HD [**8-15**].
- [**Month/Year (2) 1326**] evaluated the patient on [**2160-8-17**] and requested a right venogram of her right upper extremity to assess access for possible right cephalo-radial AV fistula.
A right upper extremity AV graft was placed on [**2160-8-20**].
Her renagel was also increased to 2400 TID.
She was continued on epogen through dialysis.
She was given Imodium for symptomatic relief.
Their recommendations were that the eosinophilia could be contributed to the vancomycin she is receiving, however, as it is causing her no symptoms and if there was strong suspicion for a line infection, that eosinophilia alone would not be a reason to discontinue the medication.
