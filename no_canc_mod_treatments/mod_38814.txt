[**2117-2-19**] - Extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation [**2117-2-18**] - Bedside bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage   History of Present Illness: This is a 69 year-old Female with oxygen-dependent COPD, CAD, diastolic CHF, mitral stenosis, IDDM, HTN, HLD who presented to an [**Hospital6 7472**] ED on [**2117-2-10**] with acute hypoxic respiratory failure with oxygen saturations in the 81-85% on 2L NC and hypotension.
She had completed a course of antibiotics and Prednisone as an outpatient earlier this month for presumed pneumonia.
Given her recent hospitalization 1-month prior, she was started on atypical coverage with Azithromycin as well as HCAP PNA coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-2-17**] for involvement of interventional pulmonology given her bronchiomalacia and cardiology consult for her worsening mitral stenosis, and further work-up of of her renal failure.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated with Fentanyl and Versed.
Patient has received intermittent IV Lasix dosing with adequate diuresis.
Her antibiotic coverage was focused to IV Vanc and she was maintained on Prednisone 40 mg PO daily.
She received Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer and has been -5.7L for length-of-stay fluid balance.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (baseline on [**2-18**].5L NC with baseline saturations in the 90-93% range; has had episodes of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the past) - question of bronchomalacia 2.
Coronary artery disease (question of prior anterior and inferior MI) 5.
Peripheral vascular disease (s/p aortofemoral bypass, [**2108**]) 10. s/p cholecystectomy [**16**].

However, she improved with treatment for health care associated pneumonia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and COPD, and did not require bronchial stenting.
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION/ACUTE-on-CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE/PNEUMONIA: Patient was transferred from [**Last Name (un) 91880**] Hospital following intubation for respiratory failure and concern for bronchomalacia as significant contributor (bronch there showed clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, and stenosis of right middle lobe oriface - biopsies revealed no malignancy).
At [**Hospital1 18**] she was continued on treatment for HCAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn was aggressively diuresed with improvement.
She underwent bronchoscopy just prior to extubation which did not show stenosis and BAL fluid grew only commensal flora after abx.
She was extubated and completed treatement with a course of Vancomycin for 14 days as well as started on a prednisone taper given likely exacerbation of COPD as a contributor to respiratory failure.
She was discharged to continue a prolonged taper as recommended by her outpatient pulmonologist.
She was diuresed aggressively to a weight of 74kg on discharge with improvement in her respiratory symptoms (although not completely back to her baseline respiratory function-on 3L O2 by NC instead of usual 2L).
She was continued on her home BB/ACEI as well as COPD bronchodilators and inhaled steroid.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, Hypertension: Patient was continued on home aspirin, statin, Carvedilol, ACEI, long acting nitrate.
#Type 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON INSULIN - The patient has known IDDM and her home glucose range is noted to be 60-180s mg/dL, per the patient.
She is controlled with Levemir 72 units SC QHS and Novolog sliding scale prior to meals.
Consider outpatient evaluation of MR, MS, diastolic heart failure and CAD with Cardiology - no acute indications for balloon valvuloplasty at this time (prefers to see [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91881**], MD) 2.
Patient will continue on home oxygen therapy with goal oxygen saturation of 88-93% on 2.5-3L of oxygen via nasal cannula 3.
Patient will continue on steroid taper, as follows: Take 30 mg by mouth for 3-days ([**2117-2-26**] to [**2117-2-28**]).
