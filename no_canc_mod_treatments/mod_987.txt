He tolerated the procedure well, but his post-operative course was complicated by respiratory distress in the PACU requiring reintubation and admission to the Surgical ICU.
During that time, he was transitioned off of IV fluids and his diet was advanced.
His pain was well controlled on oral medications.
[**Last Name (STitle) 665**], the patient was transferred to the Cardiology service for management of his fluid overload secondary to his congestive heart failure in the setting of a surgical intervention and the associated fluid shifts.
On the cardiology service he was diuresed with 80mg IV lasix, followed by a lasix drip at 10mg/hr.
He tolerated diuresis well, with no signs of hemodynamic compromise.
A foley catheter was placed, draining 800ccs of urine with resolution of his pain.
The foley catheter was left in place and he was started on Flomax (tamsulosin).
He was started on amoxicillin 875mg Q12 hours for a 14-day course.
The patient has atrial fibrillation, s/p pacer placement and AV junction ablation.
He restarted coumadin post-op with a lovenox bridge.
He was discharged on a half dose of Coumadin (1.25mg daily) and will follow-up with the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 197**] clinic.
The staples were removed and steri-strips placed.
He was seen by physical therapy who felt he could walk well, even with a foley bag in place.
