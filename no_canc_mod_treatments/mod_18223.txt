He has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Hospital1 882**], and [**Hospital 100**] rehab within past several months for CHF, C. difficile, and GI bleeding, the latter two necessitating diuretic dose reduction with resultant CHF exacerbations.
Patient presents today after dyspnea while getting up to go to the bathroom.
EMS was called and administered 50mg IV furosemide on initial evaluation and placed on non-rebreather for decreased oxygen saturation.
He was then placed also on a nitroglycerin gtt and for his hypoxia, he was also started on BiPAP.
Eventually, his blood pressure improved to systolic 140s and his oxygenation improved so that he was transitioned from BiPAP to nasal cannula and his nitroglycerin gtt was turned off.
He did receive a dose of levofloxacin empirically prior to chest x-ray.
Of note, patient has been on long-standing oral vancomycin and metronidazole for which the duration needs to be clarified by discussion with [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
