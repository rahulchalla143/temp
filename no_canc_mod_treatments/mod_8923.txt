[**Known lastname 1453**] expired on day of life five ([**2149-4-11**]) secondary to respiratory failure.
[**Hospital 37544**] medical history remarkable for congenital hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and hypercholesterolemia.
This pregnancy was complicated by dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation, cerclage placement at 18 weeks, and cervical shortening with ballooning of cervix at 22 weeks, treated with bed rest.
She received betamethasone on [**4-1**] and [**4-2**].
On day of delivery, cervical dilation with maternal fever to 100.1 with concerns for chorioamnionitis prompted delivery by cesarean section.
[**Known lastname 1453**] emerged with poor tone and poor respiratory effort, with a good response to positive pressure ventilation with bag and mask, heart rate greater than 100.
Respiratory:  Noted to be crying on admission, and was re-intubated and placed on ventilator support, pressures 18/5, rate of 24, and 40-50%.
Weaned to minimal ventilator support and, on day of life two, ventilator support consisted of pressures 14/4, rate of 14, 24-26% oxygen.
On day of life three, required increased ventilator support.
The ventilator support was changed from SIMV to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation with a mean airway pressure of 7, an amplitude of 26, 70-100% oxygen.
On day of life five ([**4-11**]), [**Known lastname 40931**] respiratory status worsened with more severe pulmonary interstitial emphysema and inability to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90% despite increased settings on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and 100% oxygen.
She was treated with indomethacin on day of life three for signs and symptoms consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus.
[**Known lastname 1453**] also required hydrocortisone and dopamine for blood pressure support, with maximum dopamine infusion of 25 mcg/kg/minute.
Was maintained on glucose water, and total parenteral nutrition, following serum electrolytes every six to eight hours, and fluids and electrolytes adjusted to maintain within normal limits.
There were several brief episodes of hypoglycemia, treated with D-10-W boluses and adjustment of glucose and fluids.
Gastrointestinal:  Started on phototherapy on day of birth for a total bilirubin of 3.1.
Received three packed red blood cell transfusions during the hospitalization.
Infectious Disease:  Ampicillin and gentamicin were started on admission, and continued throughout the hospital course for presumed sepsis.
