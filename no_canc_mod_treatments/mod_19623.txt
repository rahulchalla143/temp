CXR, portable, [**2142-11-27**]- Right pleural effusion with associated consolidation, likely atelectasis.
However, pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended .
CXR, portable, [**2142-11-29**]- Reason: evaluate for PTX s/p R thoracentesis In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], there has been removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST, [**2142-12-4**]- Reason: Please assess pulmonary "nodules" noted in [**2142-11-27**] CTA for round atelectasis [**2-23**] CHF vs. masses, suspicious for malignancy.
Involution of the thymus also argues for an infection, but more likely is vasculitis, including Wegener or Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], and lymphoma, including lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate post-procedure complications.
IV lasix was given in the lab and milrinone was initiated.
The patient tolerated milrinone load well and was transferred to the CCU with stable blood pressure for further care of her heart failure.
Prior to this admission she was not taking any medications for her congestive heart failure despite being diagnosed with heart failure at [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year and was found to have an ejection fraction of 24%.
During this admission, the patient was informed of her [**Last Name **] problem and the importance of outpatient follow up and chronic medication adherence was emphasized.
Diuresis was performed with IV Lasix, with good response and she was ultimately transitioned to an oral regimen.
Additional cardiac medications were gradually added during the admission, and her SBP held in the 80s-100s.
This medication regimen included Lasix 10 mg PO daily, lisinopril 5 mg PO daily, and Toprol XL 25 mg PO daily.
She was followed by the congestive heart failure service throughout this admission who adjusted this regimen to optimize her function and symptoms.
A cardiac catheterization on [**12-10**] was significant for no angiographically apparent disease in all vessels, a CI of 1.3, SVR 3015, and elevated biventricular filling pressures as well as PA pressures.
She briefly was transferred to the CCI to allow for her to receive milrinone and IV lasix for more aggressive diuresis.
On the floor, she tolerated the above medication regimen well.
For the majority of her hospitalization she was anticoagulated with a heparin drip and ultimately transitioned to warfarin for chronic anticoagulation.
Differential diagnosis for a lymphocytosis is extremely broad and includes infectious, autoimmune, hypersensitivity, malignant and pre-malignant states.
Flow cytometry revealed non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma were not seen in specimen.
Abnormal Liver Enzymes: On admission the patient was noted to have a midly elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase.
Vaginal Bleeding: Patient with noted vaginal bleeding since initiation of anticoagulation for her pulmonary embolism.
While on a heparin gtt for her PE/DVTs as above, she was noted to have several episodes of hemoptysis.
This was discussed with infection control, who recommended placing the patient on TB precautions and ruling her out for tuberculosis with three induced sputum samples for acid fast stain.
The patient will need 9 months of INH therapy as an outpatient.
Includes secondary syphilis, rickettsial infections, RMSF, guttate psoriasis, hand-foot-mouth disease.
She received symptomatic treatment with sarna lotion.
Prophylaxis: Given her known history of blood clots she was anticoagulated with heparin with a bridge to coumadin.
