The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where she had several episodes of hypotension requiring volume resuscitation.
The patient was started on Milrinone for her right ventricular dysfunction with the Milrinone and volume resuscitation.
The patient was started on a Midazolam infusion for sedation, as it was felt that the Propofol was contributing to hypotension.
On postoperative day number one, the patient remained on vasopressors as well as inotropic support and continued with the intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.
The patient continued to have varying requirements for vasopressors, continuing to require Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin to maintain adequate blood pressure.
The patient also required a small amount of hypertonic saline replacement which, by postoperative day number four, corrected her sodium back up to 130.
The patient was weaning off of her pressors.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day number four.
