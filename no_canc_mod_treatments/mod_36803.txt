Admission Date:  [**2180-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nadolol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: HCV cirrhosis, upper GI bleed, cerebral edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left IJ Central line R arterial line mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: 49 y.o.
Endoscopy revealed bleeding esophageal varices which were banded x 3 but she continued to bleed and required a repeat endoscopy the following day with three more bands placed to achieve hemostasis.
She was placed on prophylactic levofloxacin on day #1.
She remained hypotensive and required pressor (levophed).
She received lactulose and rifaxamin.
On [**2180-12-19**] she had a tonic clonic seizure and received ativan.
Of note, on the AM of transfer, she bit her ET tube when sedation was lightened and required paralytic to place a bite guard.
Past Medical History: **HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, on transplant list - dx'ed in [**2176-10-14**] - decompensated in [**2177-2-11**] (+ EtOH use) - completed inpatient rehab program, sober since - sx of encephalopathy, ascites, Grade I varices (last EGD [**7-21**]) - hepatopulmonary syndrome, on home O2 at night (2L) **Depression **Hip fracture s/p ORIF [**2180-1-14**] **cholelithiasis, s/p ccy **s/p hysterectomy/BSO **s/p tonsillectomy **s/p ankle surgery **s/p miscarriage at age 16 **s/p tubal pregnancy at age 24   Social History: Married, separated from husband (but he is still involved in her care).
Significant h/o polysubstance abuse, including marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin (all last used in early 20s), as well as prescription narcotics (last in [**2-15**]), and tobacco.
Initial CXR, portable [**2180-12-21**]: PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The endotracheal tube is 2 cm from the carina, recommend pulling back between 2 and 3 cm.
A nasogastric tube  terminates overlying the mid stomach with side port well beyond the GE junction.
A right subclavian catheter terminates over the mid SVC.
Automated and routine sampling demonstrated periods of generalized slowing consistent with an underlying encephalopathy.
Routine samplings showed a background suggestive of an encephalopathy involving both superficial and deeper structures and additional slowing in the left mid-temporal region.
[**12-31**] CXR Nasogastric tube terminates in body of the stomach and is no longer coiled.
Endotracheal tube has apparently been removed.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted to [**Hospital6 **] with variceal bleeding, stabilized endoscopically, but then developed altered mental status, presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, and intubated for airway protection.
Nonetheless, she was continued on lactulose and rifaxamin for any contribution of hepatic encephalopathy to her AMS.
Neurology was consulted and recommeded EEG and empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis with acyclovir (10mg/kg Q8H).
No recommendation was made for mannitol initially given her sodium of > 150, but when sodium dropped below 150 on [**2179-12-22**], several doses of mannitol were given.
Neuro recommended stopping mannitol on [**2180-12-23**], and starting hypertonic saline instead to reach sodium goal 150-155.
Her continuous EEG showed evidence of seizure activity at that time, and she was loaded with Keppra and maintenance dose begun.
Serial repeat 24h video EEGs showed no further seziures, although she remained intubated and on propofol.
Eventually neuro agreed with d/c'ing hypertonic saline and letting sodium drift down to 140 (but not below).
# Respiratory:  Initially was intubated at OSH for airway protection after she became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy, later felt to be cerebral edema (see above).
However, was noted at OSH to have fever and grew MRSA in sputum, so was started on Vanco on [**2180-12-20**] for a MRSA pneumonia.
At [**Hospital1 18**], her ventilator settings were changed to ARDSNET settings, and her FIO2 was progressively weaned.
She completed a 2 week course of vancomycin and remained afebrile subsequently.
She is comfortable on nasal cannula at time of transfer.
# GI/Liver - Initial presentation to [**Hospital3 **] Hosptial showed bleeding [**1-15**] esophageal varices and she was stabilized with volume resuscitation.
She was continued on IV protonix daily and monitored with daily HCTs.
She was also started on post-GIB SBP ppx with cipro after her broader antibiotics (vanc/ctx) were d/c'ed once bacterial meningitis was felt to be unlikely.
A beta blocker was added for post-bleed ppx.
She was not stooling initially; given lactulose Q1H until she began stooling.
She was also being treated for documented MRSA PNA with vancomycin.
She remains on acyclovir for a planned 3 week course per ID and neurology ([**Date range (1) 108979**]).
She was briefly on ciprofloxacin for post-GIB sepsis ppx.
Received several platelet transfusion at [**Hospital3 **] hosptial, but none at [**Hospital1 18**].
