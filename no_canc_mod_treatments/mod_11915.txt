He was evaluated by tele-neurology at [**Hospital1 2025**] and was deemed a candidate for tPA, however his blood pressure was 202/92 and infusion was delayed as 30mg of labetalol were given to bring his blood pressure down to goal.
Past Medical History: - CAD- s/p quadruple bypass 15 years ago.
He was given IV tpa at OSH for L MCA stroke and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], CTA/CTP performed and given the improvement and lack of further clot burden on CTA, no additional intervention was pursued.
He was initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring s/p tpa.
Given the hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke, Coumadin was not started at this time.
Instead, he was kept on ASA 325mg once daily and will get repeat CT head in 2 weeks, with consideration of starting Coumadin at that time if no further hemorrhage.
