Mother was treated with Betamethasone on [**3-26**].
Delivery was by cesarean section with Apgars 5 at one minute and 7 at five minutes.
Current physical examination reveals with endotracheal tube, 3.0 cm tube taped at 7.4 cm marker at the lip on ventilator settings of 27/7 and a rate of 36, requiring FIO2 of 30 to 40%.
Baby is lethargic with a Fentanyl drip running.
She has a central PICC line in and a peripheral intravenous line.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The baby initially received three doses of Surfactant and required conventional ventilation with peak pressures of 22/5 and a rate of 35.
She had peak pressures of MAP of [**9-15**] and Delta P of 22, required several bicarbonate boluses for metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
She was critically ill which required not only high ventilator settings but also prolonged course of antibiotics, see Infectious Disease below.
The baby ultimately developed large bilateral pneumatoceles which are present on chest x-ray.
She has remarkably weaned her vent settings over the last several days from 28/7 and a rate of 40, overnight on [**5-23**] to 19 escalated to 100% oxygen and began a watch for necrotizing enterocolitis.
Cardiovascular - The baby initially did not require any pressor support on admission, had a soft murmur.
Plan would have been to repeat another echocardiogram when she completed her antibiotics if not indicated sooner.
She was receiving Diuril 30 mg p.g.
She also was receiving [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Cl supplements 1.5 mEq p.g.
She had a radial artery line inserted and a double lumen umbilical vein catheter through which she received maintenance intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition.
Trophic feedings were started on day of life #7.
When she became sick with Staphylococcus aureus she was once again made NPO and enteral feedings were reintroduced on day of life #42.
She currently is receiving PN 12.5% glucose, 2 gm of protein and 1 gm of fat with 2 mEq/100 cc of sodium chloride and 2 mEq/100 cc of potassium acetate.
She currently has a central PICC line in place and a peripheral intravenous line.
She had electrolytes within normal limits on [**5-22**] with a sodium of 135, potassium of 4.6, chloride 101 and carbon dioxide of 23.
Gastrointestinal - The baby initially demonstrated physiologic jaundice and received phototherapy and has demonstrated a high direct bilirubin for which she has been treated with Phenobarbital and Actigall which was started nearly 2 days ago .
Actigall was started on [**5-23**], dose 15 mg p.g.
Hematology - The baby is 0 positive, Coombs negative and has received numerous blood transfusions.
The baby also has required platelets in the last 24 hours.
PT/PTT and fibrinogen are also pending as well as D-Dimer.
Her neutropenia was thought to be related to maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension and bone suppression.
On [**4-6**], day of life 9 she for lability had a repeat blood culture and complete blood count sent and was started on 48 hours of Vancomycin and gentamicin.
She received a blood transfusion at that time and looked clinically improved and antibiotics were discontinued.
Again on [**4-17**] to [**4-18**] she had a sepsis evaluation because of instability and also right upper lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
She was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin and was ultimately switched to Gentamicin and Oxacillin.
She received 21 days of Gentamicin, Oxacillin continued for 29 days and then was switched to Zosyn.
8 hours which equals 44 mg/dose and Gentamicin 4.5 mg intravenously which is 3 mg/kg q.
Other positive results - [**5-16**], Urine culture positive for Escherichia coli which was resistant to Ampicillin, Piperacillin and Trimethoprim.
[**5-20**], Cerebrospinal fluid was negative.
At that time she received 20/kg as stated above of platelets and is receiving packed red blood cells.
She has been on a Fentanyl drip since [**4-28**].
She was started at 2 mcg/kg/hr, achieved a maximum of 4 mcg/kg/hr by [**5-12**] and has been weaning down with her dose being down to 2 mcg/kg/hr on [**5-23**] and [**5-24**].
Continue NPO with close observation for necrotizing enterocolitis.
Medications - She is currently on Meropenem 44 mg intravenously q.
8 hours, Gentamicin 4.5 mg intravenously which equals 3 mg/kg, [**Hospital 19188**] 2 puffs via endotracheal tube q.
8 hours, Phenobarbital 7 mg intravenously q.d.
Zosyn was discontinued [**5-25**].
Fentanyl drip 3 mcg/kg/hr.
Immunizations received, due for 60 day immunizations this week, none received to date.
Immunizations recommended - I.  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  A.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
