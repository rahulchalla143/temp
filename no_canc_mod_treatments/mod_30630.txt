Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation who was admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB and hyponatremia.
Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory support.
Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.
Patient presumed to have COPD exacerbation wasn was treated with iv solumedrol and transitioned to po prednisone.
He was treated with vanc/zosyn for PNA given gram + rods in his sputum cx and hx of MRSA in his sputum.
MRSA was felt to be a colonizer and Vanc was discontinued on discharge.
This antibiotic treatment plans was discussed with his outpatient pulmonology team.
He was also treated with IV steroids, atrovent nebs, advair, albuterol prn, and guafenesin.
He was discharged on a slow steroid taper and will follow up with his pulmonologist as an outpatient.
# Hyponatremia: Unclear what precipitated such as drop, likley [**3-4**] to significnat home lasix dose (60mg [**Hospital1 **])  Had been slightly hyponatremic during his admission at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and lasix had been discontinued.
His family believes lasix was restarted, and the patient had been eating and drinking minimally since his discharge.
Also given his chronic steroid use, there is a question of possible adrenal insufficiency (elevated potassium/hyponatremia) though chronic steroid use does not cause primary adrenal insufficiency so mineralocorticoid axis should be intact.
His Na began correcting after he was given IVF and his hypovolemia was fully corrected once he was extubated and was able to control his po intake.
He received one dose of po lasix in order to restart him on his home medications and Na dropped to 132, so it was discontinued.
He was advised to remain off Lasix for the time being.
His lasix was held as above due to hyponatermia.
He was also given compression stockings to wear and instructed to elevate his legs as much as possible.
# Hypertension: his BP regimen was continued with slight changes to his doses of verapamil and amlodipine while in-house.
He stated this is herpes that breaks out intermittently and has been treating it with fluocinonide ointment which clears it up.
His dermatologist's office was [**Name (NI) 653**], but there was no clear reference in the records by review of a nurse to indicate herpes; he has had an irritant dermatitis treated with topical steroids including clobetasol.
Topical steroids were not given in-house, and he was advised to follow up with his dermatologist as an outpatient.
