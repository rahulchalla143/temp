This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin based on          the detection of inducible resistance .
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

She was loaded with AEDs, intubated and sent to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was worked up for a cause of her seizure.
# NEURO: When she arrived she was intubated and sedated.
However, even after propofol was weaned off her exam was limited and she did not follow commands or open her eyes to stimulation.
She was continued on phenytoin IV 100mg Q8H, and her EEG did not show any seizure activity.
She did require restraints briefly, but has not required mits/wrist restraints in the 24 hours prior to her transfer back to the NH.
This was checked in the setting of propofol sedation, and so may have been spuriously elevated.
Her TG level continued to downtrend as propofol was weaned off.
She received a few days of statin therapy, but deferred any long term treatment until the outpatient setting until her lipid panel can be checked again.
However, her hospital course was complicated by a VAP (see below) for which she was treated with antibiotics.
She was given PRN doses of lasix to prevent her 6L positive volume overload from effecting her lungs.
She was started on vancomycin, cefepime and tobramycin.
Her BAL and sputum Cx grew out MRSA and she was continued on vancomycin and other ABx were D/C'd.
Day 1 of vancomycin was [**11-5**], she is to finish a presumed 14 day course for VAP, to end on [**2197-11-19**].
To receive long term antibiotics, a PICC line was placed.
We guiac'd all pt's stools and they were negative.
This improved with fluid hydration as above.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: - Continue vancomycin until [**11-19**].
- Continue keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] indefintely, patient to follow up with her own neurologist.
- Please monitor levels of vancomycin especially if other medications will be changed - Have patient follow up with PCP and neurologist - Please check a repeat lipid panel in [**1-22**] weeks - Obtain a repeat CXR following resolution of vancomycin therapy to check for clearance of VAP  Medications on Admission: Alendronate ASA 81 Sertraline 12.5 daily omeprazole folate, Vit D, Calcium albuterol prn   Discharge Medications: 1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

- We started you on a medication called Keppra for preventing further seizures.
Please be sure to take all your medications as instructed below.
- We also initiated you on a medication called vancomycin, which we would like for you to take by IV (intravenously) until [**2197-11-19**].
