The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is being AV paced 1.
