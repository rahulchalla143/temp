The patient got a temporal hemodialysis catheter for hemodialysis planning for permanent tunnel catheter within the next few days.
It was decided to wait for five additional days from the day of the catheter tip was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus until placement of the permanent tunneled catheter.
The patient's Vancomycin was dosed at dialysis, however, the patient continued refusing dialysis frequently and never completing recommended four hour dialysis run.
The patient got a permacath placed on [**2125-11-8**], and underwent hemodialysis through that, however, his course was complicated by bleeding from permacath site.
The patient received DDAVP, intravenous and p.o.
Vitamin K and a total of two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient stated that he did not want a catheter pressure dressing continued and the bleed stabilized.
The patient continued exhibiting a lot of behavioral issues such as ripping out an intravenous while blood products were running and having blood spill all over the floor, smoking in his room, being absent from the hospital for hours at a time, all of which were appropriately addressed with the patient.
The cultures came back positive with VRE necessitating removal of the tunneled catheter placement.
The catheter was removed and the patient was started on Linezolid which the patient has been compliant with.
His surveillance cultures have been so far negative and since the patient has been off dialysis for seven days, temporal femoral hemodialysis line was successfully placed on [**2125-11-20**], and the patient was successfully dialyzed.
It is planned for the patient to undergo an interventional radiology placement over the permanent tunneled catheter under general anesthesia on Friday.
After that time, the patient will likely be discharged to [**Hospital1 1238**] for further treatment and management.
The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2125-11-19**], which was read as cannot exclude vegetations on aortic and mitral valves and therefore consistent with endocarditis necessitating six weeks therapy with Linezolid.
Infectious disease consultation is going to be called today on [**2125-11-20**], prior to placement of another permanent catheter in the setting of VRE.
End stage renal disease - Hemodialysis - The patient had multiple hemodialysis lines and tunneled catheters as above.
The patient had permanent hemodialysis catheter placed and then discontinued due to development of VRE infection.
The patient now has a temporal hemodialysis line and is planned for permacath placement within the next few days.
HIV/AIDS - The patient continued on Atovaquone prophylaxis for toxo and PCP .
Lower extremity pain - The patient complained of bilateral feet tenderness.
The patient has a history of gout and the patient was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o.
Due to end stage renal disease, higher doses of Colchicine could not be given to the patient.
Steroids will not be started at this time in the setting of ongoing VRE infection.
