PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile with a blood pressure of 118/67, heart rate 77, respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation 99% on face mask following extubation.
AORTIC STENOSIS:  The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] approximately a month prior to admission following cardiac catheterization.
The patient was referred by her primary cardiologist for aortic valve and mitral valve replacement.
On the following day, the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization for repeat evaulation and standby valvuloplasty.
Her aortic valve area was measured at 0.8 with an area index of 0.53.
She had a pacemaker placed in [**2165-12-6**].
She was continued on her home dose of Amiodarone as well as aspirin.
The patient was started on a low-dose of an ACE inhibitor which she tolerated well.
She was also restarted on her home dose of Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Her total lung capacity was 2.47 (65% predicted).
However, they were not able to offer any therapy for her chest wall deformity.
The DLCO decrement was felt to correct for lung volume and they were reassured that the patient did not desaturate during ambulation.
Pulmonary consult felt that possible etiologies for the trend down as compared to previous PFTs included the small ground glass opacity, mucous, possible history of aspiration due to esophageal dilation, pulmonary edema, or Amiodarone.
They recommended stopping Amiodarone, although the patient is on Amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation.
The patient was continued on calcium, vitamin C, and Actonel during the hospitalization.
