History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year-old woman with history of CVA and renal transplant in [**2147**] at [**Hospital1 112**], on coumadin s/p CVA and for blood clot in her legs many years ago.
Two weeks ago she banged her right leg which subsequently became red and swollen; she saw her PCP; there was no fracture, and she was started on Keflex for possible cellulitis.
She held her coumadin for the last 2 days for bruising.
Patient was given CTX/vanco, 2 units FFP, 2 units PRBC's morphine and zofran.
In the MICU she recieved 4 units FFP, Vitamin K, and 4 units of blood.
Past Medical History: - CVA - s/p renal transplant ([**3-5**] to HTN, high cholesterol) - hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - s/p R-hip replacement at [**Hospital1 112**] - history of DVT 12 years ago, diagnosed with hypercoaguable state at that time, ?
Right ankle swollen, erythmatous, painful.
Anechoic structure in right renal hilum, likely a parapelvic cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: A 63 year-old woman with history of HTN/ESRD s/p LRRT [**2147**] presented [**4-5**] with supratherapeutic INR to 24 and hct 15 (admitted overnight to MICU [**4-5**]-->[**4-6**]), now s/p FFP and vitamin K with INR 1.3 and s/p 6U PRBCs with hct 21 and stable.
Her CBC could be followed up as outpatient, and stool guiaics repeated if her hematocrit does not return to baseline.
This was likely due to an interaction between coumadin and Keflex.
She denied any recent changes to her diet or herbal supplements although several other of her medications were recently adjusted.
She received FFP and vitamin K and her INR came down to 1.3.
We stopped the Keflex as she had already completed a 14-day course for cellulitis.
During this admission, we continued her Cellcept and prednisone; cyclosporine dose was adjusted slightly because levels were low.
She was continued on nafcillin for treatment of RLE cellulitis.
However, when it was clear that she had already completed a 14-day course of treatment, antibiotics were stopped.
Plastics (hand surgery) was consulted in the emergency room and recommended for light compression with ACE bandage and a volar resting splint from OT.
When it was clear that her hematocrit was stable and that she was not actively bleeding, metoprolol and Lasix were restarted.
As above, coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR.
Medications on Admission: - coumadin 5mg daily - prednisone 5mg daily - cellcept [**Pager number **]/750 - cyclosporine 100/50 - metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] - lisinopril 20 mg daily - tricor (?)
145mg - crestor 40 mg daily - lasix 20 mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
Cyclosporine Modified 25 mg Capsule Sig: Three (3) Capsule PO Q12H (every 12 hours).
Tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every twelve (12) hours as needed: No more than 200 mg total in one day.
Prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Mycophenolate Mofetil 250 mg Capsule Sig: Three (3) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Rosuvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Lasix 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Tricor 145 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Your hematocrit was also found to be very low (15), which we suspect was due to bleeding into the skin and probably a small amount of blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract.
We treated the symptoms with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to help reverse the effects of coumadin.
You also received several units of blood transfusions to help increase the hematocrit.
We changed the dose of cyclosporine to 75 mg twice daily.
You have finished a sufficient course of antibiotics for treatment of cellulitis.
It will be important to see your hematologist and nephrologist in the next couple weeks, to discuss this admission and some of the medication changes.
