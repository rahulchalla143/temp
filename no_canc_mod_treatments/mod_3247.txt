Patient hypotensive during catheterization, s/p IABP placed at OSH.
Pt was weaned off all pressors.
Amiodarone was given, and patient reverted to NSR with improved pressures.
Received lasix diuresis, initially with drip (with minmimal effect), then transitioned to IV after ultrafiltration was stopped and then to PO.
Started ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy for CAP, which was continued for a 7-day course.
CAD was medically managed with atorvastatin 80mg, changed to simvastatin after concern for atorva contributed to rhabdo in past, aspirin 325mg, plavix 75mg.

Heparin gtt stopped [**1-4**] after bleeding noted at venipuncture site.
He was started on amiodarone drip with resolution into native rhythm.
The patient, however, returned to atrial fibrillation, so digoxin therapy was instituted in addition to amiodarone.
Coumadin was started and dose adjusted for goal INR [**3-16**] with heparin bridge.
After renal consultation, the patient was started on hemodialysis via IJ temp dialysis catheter.
HD was stopped and IJ catheter was removed prior to discharge.
He should have a follow up appt with his Nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19334**] at the [**Location (un) 86**] VA next week to assess renal function and continue with home dose of Epogen.
# Urinary retention: The patient had a Foley placed at admission.
Foley was discontinued and re-inserted twice during admission [**3-15**] failure to void.
Tamsulosin was started prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack that required a cardiac catheterization with a bare metal stent to the left anterior descending artery.
During this procedure, a balloon pump was placed to help your heart, you were placed on a breathing machine and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
You were started on Plavix (Clopidogrel) and aspirin to keep the stent open.
Please take these medicines every day, do not not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or stop taking Plavix or aspirin unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] tells you it is OK.
You were started on coumadin to prevent strokes that sometimes are caused by atrial fibrillation.
It is very important to monitor your coumadin level (INR) while you are taking this medicine to keep the level between [**3-16**].
You also had trouble urinating after the foley catheter was removed.
We started Flomax to help this problem and the Foley catheter will remain in until you are seen in the urology clinic next week.
Start taking dextromethorphan-guaifenesin and Cepacol for your cough 2.
STart taking Amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation.
STart taking Trazadone as needed for sleep 4.
