The patient was initially transferred to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where a right chest tube was placed for an opacified right hemithorax seen on chest x-ray.
The patient was then flown by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital6 1760**] on route receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 liters of crystalloids.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol prn  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination demonstrated a heartrate of 60, blood pressure 160/80, respiratory rate, the patient was on an Ambu bag with pulse oximetry being 99 and 100%.
General, the patient was brought with his left leg splinted and wrapped with obvious deformities.
He was intubated and unresponsive to examination on initial presentation at [**Hospital6 256**].
The patient underwent a wide variety of imaging which included head and face computerized tomography scan, cervical spine computerized tomography scan, right wrist films, tibia-fibula films, chest computerized tomography scan of abdomen, abdominal pelvis computerized tomography scan as well.
IMPRESSION:   Following the initial resuscitation workup the patient's injury summaries were thus - 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following his initial resuscitation, the patient had a left chest tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit, given the need for positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation.
Cordis line and radial A lines were placed.
The Neurosurgery Service was consulted to place communal drain and the patient's coagulopathy was reversed during hospital day #1 after receiving approximately 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate and the Ophthalmology Service was consulted initially for the infraorbital fractures.
It was felt that he would initially need open reduction and internal fixation of his facial fractures when stabilized.
They were to control intracranial pressures for less than 25, wanting an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for mandibular fractures.
After resuscitating the patient initially and using adequate amounts of Propofol for sedation.
Chest tubes were placed for his pneumothoraces with an initial positive end-expiratory pressure measuring 10.
Gastrointestinal, the patient was kept NPO with an nasogastric tube and from an infectious disease standpoint the patient was begun on ................. on open fractures.
Since Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**] was breathing through the existing endotracheal tube they would like to do a temperature replacement tube without muscle relaxants.
Because of the blood in the airway attempts at using the fiberoptic bronchoscope were unsuccessful.
After that, they reoxygenated the patient with cricoid pressure and manual in-line stabilization.
The patient was given Etomidate and Succinylcholine and reintubated successfully orally.
Following this intubation, auscultation suggested a right lung collapse and pneumothorax with aspiration consolidation.
On [**2175-3-22**], the patient was taken by the Orthopedic Service to the Operating Room where an incision and drainage of the left and right proximal tibia were performed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Trauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
The patient received approximately 3 units of red blood cells during the operation.
They felt that his orbital wall fractures did not require immediate intervention.
For further management of the patient's head injury, a right jugular bulb catheter was placed on [**2175-3-22**].
They recommended placing the patient on Clindamycin for this.
For this patient remained in a hard collar for approximately six weeks during his hospitalization here.
At that point they recommended beginning tube feeds and packed with fiber for protein.
Tube feeds were initiated on [**2175-3-23**].
Initial on [**2175-3-23**] the patient's antibiotics were changed from Clindamycin to Unasyn given his continued high temperatures.
The Neurosurgery Service was again reconsulted and left frontal lobe ventriculostomy drain was placed without difficulty.
The patient remained intubated and sedated.
On [**3-27**], with the patient's right chest tube put out very minimal amounts.
The right chest tube was discontinued.
Additionally on [**3-27**], we decided to begin the patient on a pentobarbital coma for his persistently elevated intracranial pressures.
He was also begun on a standing around-the-clock of Mannitol 50 gm q.
In addition throughout the first week of his hospital stay Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**] continued to spike high fevers despite Unasyn for antibiotics.
Between [**3-28**] and [**3-29**], in addition, the patient was begun on broader spectrum antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Meropenem.
This was managed with Pitressin for several days when the sodium subsequently resolved.
From [**3-30**], to [**3-31**], the patient's intracranial pressures remained in the 20 to 30 range and the drain drained approximately 102 cc over night.
Over the next several days his sedation was progressively weaned in order to obtain a good neurologic examination.
On [**3-31**], the patient's paralytic sedation was held.
Following withdrawal of his pentobarbital again his neurological examination was followed for the best clinical examination for a number of days in order to obtain the prognosis for Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**].
On [**2175-4-3**], the patient's Vancomycin was stopped for a total seven day course.
Additionally, the patient's Meropenem and fluids were also stopped, having had a total seven day course of those and with a course of Unasyn and Clindamycin prior to those.
He tolerated having his sedation paralysis weaned and with intracranial pressures in the 20s to 30s.
He was tolerating tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition without difficulty.
