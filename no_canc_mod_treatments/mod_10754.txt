By report, the patient has a history of jaundice requiring initial stent placement times three in [**2166**], with subsequent stent removal in [**2171**] and cholecystectomy in [**2172**].
The patient was subsequently recommended for bilateral PTC stenting and drainage prior to a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
PTC placement was attempted on [**2178-10-20**], at which point a right-sided drain was placed successfully, but a left-sided drain placement was complicated by biliary obstruction.
The patient was subsequently scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy, left hepatic resection, and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy for [**2178-10-16**].
Bilateral biliary stent placement and removal in the distant past.
Recent right percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and drain placement.
Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
Status post colonoscopy with colonic polyp removal.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with an estimated blood loss of 1,400 intraoperatively.
The patient required two units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and took 7,000 cc of crystalloid through the course of his operation.
The patient was placed on postoperative antibiotics vancomycin 1 gm q.12h.
and ciprofloxacin 400 mg b.i.d.
; deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was provided via heparin s.c. 5,000 q.8h.
and pain control via an epidural managed by the anesthesia service.
The patient was administered a 500 cc bolus of normal saline secondary to a transiently diminished systolic blood pressure, at which point his epidural rate was adjusted from 8 cc to 6 cc per hour.
On postoperative day number two, the patient's nasogastric tube was discontinued without complication and the patient was subsequently noted to be ambulating well independently.
At this point, his wound dressing was removed and his suture line examined; wound evaluation revealed a clean abdominal incision with intact staples with mild serous drainage from the floor right extent of the wound.
The patient also demonstrated mild pericarp-incisional erythema and subsequently had a vancomycin dosage increased to 1,21 mg every 12 hours for the duration of his stay.
On postoperative day number three, the patient was successfully transitioned to oral pain medication, provided via Percocet,  The patient was also transfused two units of blood for a hematocrit of 26.4 and demonstrated an appropriate post transfusion hematocrit increased to 33.1 on subsequent blood draw.
The patient was subsequently transitioned to an oral medication regimen with the exception of his intravenous vancomycin, eosinophils complication.
Incisional examination demonstrated decreasing peri-incisional erythema with no evidence of active drainage and staples intact.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain and biliary drain were noted to be intact and patent throughout.
