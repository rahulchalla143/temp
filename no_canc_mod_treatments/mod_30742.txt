There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 50500**] was admitted on [**2100-8-6**] and taken to the operating room where he underwent Aortic valve replacement and Coronary artery bypass grafting x3.
Please see operative note for details, in summary he had: Aortic valve replacement 25-mm Biocor Epic tissue valve and Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch and the posterior descending artery.
He tolerated the operation and immediately post-operatively was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated on propofol and on neo for BP support.
Propofol was weaned off readily and patient was extubated without difficulty on POD #1.
On POD#2 he developed rapid afib which was treated with IV Lopressor and amiodarone and he continued to require neo for blood pressure support.
He converted to sinus rhythm and Neo-Synephrine infusion was weaned off.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
On POD# 3 he was transferred to the step down unit for ongoing post-operative care.
He was diuresed postoperatively and developed ATN which improved when Lasix dose was decreased.
Once on the stepdown floor he continued to have intermittent episodes of rapid afib and his beta blocker was titrated accordingly, rate control was difficult to achieve.
EP was consulted and he was also started on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.
