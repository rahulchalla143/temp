No definite acute intracranial hemorrhage  EEG [**2178-5-31**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake and asleep states due to the presence of intermittent right mid-temporal epileptiform discharges.
The endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina and it should be advanced [**1-16**] cm for more secured seating.
Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach.
As before, the endotracheal tube is too high, 2 cm above the upper margin of the clavicles and no less than 6 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach.
Right PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.
She was given ativan and valium (unknown doses) at an OSH and intubated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival here she was intubated and sedated with no further signs of seizure activity.
She was loaded with Keppra and started on Ceftriaxone IV and admitted to the neuro ICU.
Neuro: She remained quite obtunded and was unable to be weaned from ventilatory support.
She was continued on Keppra and connected to LTM, which showed an encephalopathic background in delta-theta frequences without further evidence of epileptiform activity.
Aggrenox was discontinued in the setting of hemorrhage and she was switched to aspirin.
Vessel imaging and TTE were considered for further work-up but were deferred after discussion with family regarding goals of care when patient was made CMO.
CV: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring during her admission which revealed atrial fibrillation.
She was continued on Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and Simvastatin 10mg daily.
Aggrenox was switched to aspirin after she was found to have hemorrhagic conversion of new infarct.
Endo: She was maintained on fingersticks and sliding scale insulin for blood glucose control.
UA was positive upon admission and she was initially started on ceftriaxone for empiric treatment.
CXR subsequently began to show evidence of aspiration pneumonia vs. VAP and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to linezolid/cefepime.
Pulm: She was maintained on mechanical ventilation and was unable to be weaned due to her poor mental status and lack of gag reflex.
Prophylaxis: She was maintained on SC heparin and a bowel regimen, which were stopped when pt was made CMO.
Medications on Admission: Aggrenox Insulin Metoprolol Zoloft Zocor Trazadone MVI Vitamin D  Discharge Medications: N/A, pt expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: R MCA infarcts Seizures Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2178-5-30**] after being found seizing at home.
She was taken to an outside hospital and given medications to stop her seizures.
A breathing tube was placed to protect her airway.
Her seizures stopped with medication but she was still not waking up appropriately.
Given her poor prognosis and low likelihood of recovery, her family decided to make her care focused on comfort measures only.
The breathing tube was removed and she passed away peacefully on [**2178-6-9**].
