A bile duct stent was placed.
Because the patient continued to saturate at 87% on RA, she was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2117-11-2**] w/ 2L supplemental O2 by NC and a steroid taper.
This stent was successfully replaced and a 5mm stone removed.
Post-procedure, the patient became tachycardic with SBP in the 80s and poor O2 sats, requiring phenylephrine and NRB in the ERCP suite.
She was admitted to the ICU where she required intubation for hypoxic resiratory failure.
The patient's shock was initially thought to be secondary to biliary sepsis, and she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, including vanc and zosyn, for strep anginosus and strep mileri in blood cultures.
A drain was inserted into the paracolic gutter, which showed an amylase level of [**Numeric Identifier 61575**], suggesting that the patient's pseudocyst had ruptured, either before the patient's ERCP or at some point in her hospital course.
After developing a diffuse rash, Derm consulted and thought it was possibly related to zosyn drug reaction, and she was treated with a course of steroids.
She ultimately was discharged to rehab with a tracheostomy.
Of note, she recieved cipro and flagyl peri-procedure the day prior to admission  Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Depression Choledocholithiasis Pancreatitis ARDS Elbow surgery Tubal ligation  Social History: Currently living at [**Hospital3 **].

No pain medications were needed.
A CVL was placed and she was started on levo/phenylephrine drip to keep SBP > 100.
The patient was also given agressive fluid resuscitation and albumin to improve BP.
The phenylephrine was weaned as patient's BP tolerated, and by HD3 it was stopped.
The patient was initially started on empiric vancomycin.
ID was consulted and recommended amikacin, aztreonam, daptomycin, and clindamycin, which the patient was started on HD 2.
Triamcinolone cream was applied to the rash, and it improved throughout the remainder of her stay.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
