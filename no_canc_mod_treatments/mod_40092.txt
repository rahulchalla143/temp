A septic meningitis was discovered, but the etiology was not discovered (a broad diagnosis for this was considered, including vasculitis, Sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer and various infectious etiologies; CSF for various infections along with cytologies were lost in transit to lab - however, stroke was thought to better explain his symptom complex per Neurology and thus a repeat lumbar puncture was not pursued).
Airway Protection: He as initially intubated on for decreased upper airway tone and AMS.
Although he tolerated pressure support ventilation after he regained function after coma, he had intermittent apnea episodes.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] was considered (but his respiratory tracings were not consistent with this) as well as more ominous pattern of brainstem dysfunctioning.
It was considered secondary to brainstem dysregulation and/or hypoglycemia.
