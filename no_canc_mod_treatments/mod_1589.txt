Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11505**] for hypotension after reported fall (unclear etiology, hypotension resolved), as well as altered mental status (presumably related to medications received for her wrist fracture, resolved with Narcan).
Of note, on that presentation she received steroids in the ED because she was wheezy but they were not continued.
She continued using her Advair [**Hospital1 **] as well as PRN Albuterol inhaler and nebs with minimal improvement.
She had a PCP visit to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u her hospitalization on [**6-9**] (6 days ago) and was started on Prednisone 20mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, decreased to 20mg daily three days ago (she did take it this AM).
She received ASA and SL NTG; EKG was not concerning.
She received Vanc/Zosyn, Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, Insulin 6U for glucose in the 300's, and Tylenol 1g PO.
Also notable for continued back pain and left wrist pain, very poorly controlled FSBS in the setting of Prednisone (up to 400's), continued polyuria related to her DM2 but no dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11503**] [**Known lastname **] [**Doctor Last Name 11504**] is a 78y/o lady with asthma, diverticulitis s/p SBO's with multiple abdominal surgeries, DM2 with Metformin uptitrated last month, falls with recent Colles' fracture who presents with continued cough/dyspnea, hyperglycemia, and elevated lactate.
She was continued on prednisone and given nebulizers.
Her prednisone was weaned down to 30 mg daily but was not weaned further because of adrenal insufficiency (see below).
She was restarted on her other home asthma medications.
her lisinopril was changed to losartan for possibility lisinopril was contributing to cough/wheezing.
Adrenal insufficiency: She had hypotension during this admision as well as previous admissions.
She was instructed to contine prednisone 30 mg daily for about 3 weeks but she should follow up with endocrinology before tapering.
# Elevated lactate: Likely from medication and volume depletion.
She reports her metformin was recently uptitrated which may have been contributing.
Her metformin was stopped and she received IVF and her lactate returned to [**Location 213**].
Diabetes mellitus type 2: Her metformin and glipizide were stopped on admission and she was started on insulin sliding scale.
Hypertension, benign: She has been on lisinopil, clonidine and lasix which were held in the setting of hypotension on presentation (this was thought to be due, at least in part, to adrenal insufficiency.
She was later restarted on colidine at a lower dose and her lisinopril was switched to losartan as above.
Her lasix was not continued on discharge.
-continue home Gabapentin, Morpine and PRN Oxycodone .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -[**Month (only) 116**] need insulin if blood sugars elevated on steroids and without metformin -Needs to be on long prednisone taper as directed by endocrinology -Blood cultures pending at time of discharge -Would consider outpatient referral to Pulmonary.

Because of this condition you will need to stay on prednisone for a longer period of time and to follow up with an endocrinologist.
We also decreased the dose of clonidine you were taking and stopped the furosemide.
You should also see a lung doctor (pulmonologist) for further management of your asthma.
We also stopped your metformin because you developed a condition called lactic acidosis.
Stopping this medication in addition to starting prednisone may make your blood sugars increase.
Please do not stop any medications until you have spoken to your doctor.
