On [**10-2**], the patient was brought to the operating room for coronary artery bypass grafting.
In summary, the patient has CABG times three with the LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA and saphenous vein graft to OM.
His bypass time was 68 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 46 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well, was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He had propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and lidocaine at 2 mg per minute.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient had a low cardiac index and was therefore begun on a milrinone infusion following which the patient improved hemodynamically.
He remained intubated throughout the evening of his operative day.
On postoperative day one, his sedation was weaned.
He was weaned from the ventilator and attempts at extubation caused some hypoxia following which a pulmonary consult was obtained.
Pulmonary's recommendation was to begin on IV steroids, to decrease his PEEP and FIO2 as tolerated.
His PEEP was weaned as was his of FIO2 and he was successfully extubated.
Additionally, the patient was noted to have some periods of atrial fibrillation during postoperative day two for which an amiodarone infusion was begun.
Following his neurological event, the patient was begun on heparin and Coumadin as well and was discontinued.
On postoperative day six, the patient was ultimately transferred from the CSRU to 520 for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
His medication regime was refined and on postoperative day nine, it was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation.
