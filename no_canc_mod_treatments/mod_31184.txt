Admission Date:  [**2180-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Phenergan / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for possible tracheostomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG and tracheostomy placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and diastolic heart failure who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for tracheostomy placement.
MRSA was found on sputum culture (but no white count and no fever), and vancomycin was started (now day #5).
Her vent settings at the time of transfer were SIMV 500 x 10, FiO2 0.4, PEEP 5. .
Her beta blocker and calcium channel blocker (which she is on because of atrial fibrillation with RVR) were discontinued, and her rhythm converted into atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was given 2 liters of IVF with improvement of her blood pressure to the 110's, she was loaded with digoxin, and her beta blocker was restarted (at a lower dose) on the day of transfer.
Of note, her sugars have been difficult to manage, so she was placed on an insulin gtt.
The right PICC line has been removed.
There has been a median sternotomy with cerclage wires intact.
Brief Hospital Course: 70yF with atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement, admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory failure requiring ventilation, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy placement.
She had completed a course of vancomycin at the OSH for MRSA in the sputum so her antibiotics were stopped on admission and she remained afebrile.
Her sedation was weaned and she tolerated a switch from AC ventilation to PS 15/10 FiO2 40% TV ~500.
She was oxygenating and ventillating well on these settings and was transfered to pulmonary rehab for further weaning off the vent.
She was initially hypotensive in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
She remained afebrile and did not require pressor support.
She was in poorly controlled atrial fibrillation on admission and was intially treated with digoxin given her borderline blood pressure.
As this improved with hydration her home nodal agents were gradually reintroduced (diltiazem and metoprolol).
She was intially managed with an insulin drip but transitioned to long acting and sliding scale insulin prior to discharge.
Her long acting insulin will need to be readjusted in the future as needed.
She was initally placed on a heparin drip and her INR allowed to trend downwards for her trach/PEG.
After the procedure her heparin was restarted and she was bridged to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.
She should have her coumadin titrated to maintain her INR between [**2-27**].
She had a PEG tube placed and she was started on Replete tube feeds at 60ml/hr continuously prior to discharge which she tolerated well.
