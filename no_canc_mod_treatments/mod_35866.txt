Her pain was controlled with narcotics and she underwent initial closed reduction of her posterior 90% angulated comminuted R supracondylar fracture while in the ED.
Because of her severe osteoporosis and COPD, it was determined that the risk of ORIF was too high, and that conservative management of her fx's with bilateral leg casts for 6 wks would provide greater benefit than surgery.

Her pain is currently being controlled with tylenol q6h and 5-10 mg of oxycodone Q4 hours prn.
