Admission Date:  [**2146-11-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-3-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levaquin / Latex / Keflex / Aspirin  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, shortness of breath, NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stenting of a vein graft [**11-21**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 27273**] is a 72F with H/O CABG [**56**] yrs ago, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic diastolic CHF, asthma/COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin (hx of cerebral aneurysm s/p clipping) presenting from [**Hospital3 3583**] with 2 day history of progressive worsening chest tightness and SOB.
She has a baseline chronic productive cough which worsened over the 2 days prior to presentation; it did not respond to her home nebs and and she developed SOB at rest.
She was given Lovenox and Plavix at the OSH.
Also given vancomycin 1 g, Zithromax IV 500mg and started on prednisone 40 mg daily for possible COPD exacerbation.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CAD RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: CAD, s/p MI x 2, chronic atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated, chronic diastolic CHF, last echo [**2145-3-5**] LVEF 61% w/ mod LV hypertrophy and L atrial dilation -CABG: 20 yrs ago -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  none -PACING/ICD:  none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Asthma COPD on 2L home O2 Left great toe non-healing ulcer followed by vasc surgery Mild chronic kidney disease from DM/HTN DJD MRSA Ulcerative colitis Incisional hernia hx cerebral aneursym, s/p clipping 30 yrs ago w/residual R pupil defect and strabismus hx of AAA s/p repair at [**Hospital1 112**] in the 90s  Social History: -Lives with husband; 4 children.
LUNGS: Well healed sternotomy scar.
Asymmetric density in the right upper lobe and right paratracheal region merits further evaluation on a followup chest radiograph after diuresis to exclude right upper lobe infection and right paratracheal adenopathy.
Saphenous graft angiography demonstrated a Y graft with RCA limb occluded proximally and the OM limb with a proximal 95% graft stenosis.
Successful stenting of the proximal 95% stenosis in the OM limb of the Y graft with a VISION Rx 3.5x18 mm bare-metal stent (BMS) deployed at 19 atm.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F with CAD S/P CABG, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic diastolic CHF, asthma/COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin (H/O cerebral aneurysm s/p clipping) presenting from OSH with progressive worsening chest tightness and SOB leading to diagnosis of NSTEMI and transferred for cardiac catheterization.
Given Lovenox at OSH.
Difficult to assess EKG changes due to LBBB, troponin bumped up to 1.1->1.33, CKs flat.
Heparin gtt was initially stopped secondary to hemotpysis; however, it was restarted due to ongoing chest pain.
The patient underwent cardiac cath on [**11-21**] after she became hemodynamically stable, which revealed PCW 31, PA 49, LMCA 100% proximal, RCA 100% proximal, Y graft with limb to RCA proximally occluded and limb to OM 95% proximal stenosis; other vein probably stump occluded; BMS was placed in OM graft.
The patient was started on ASA 325mg (despite H/O epistaxis on full dose ASA, had no further episodes of epistaxis noted).
We increased beta blockade to 300 mg daily, continued high dose atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
She had been Plavix loaded at the OSH, and we continued Plavix 75 mg daily, which should be continued to 1 month, 3 months preferably.
Worsening of LE edema and respiratory status s/p pre-cath hydration; respiratory status improved with diuresis.
Due to increased pressures seen on cardiac cath, the patient was diuresed with Lasix gtt and transitioned to torsemide 60 mg twice daily with daily potassium repletion.
We continued valsartan 80mg daily, metoprolol.
We continued rate control with metoprolol, full dose ASA and intermittent heparin gtt.
Hct 27 on day of discharge; she was transitioned to PO PPI, will have her continue as outpatient.
# Asthma/COPD/bronchitis: 2 L/min supplemental O2 requirement at baseline while patient asleep or at rest.
She was noted to desaturate to mid 80s with ambulation; she notes no history of this, and her ambulatory sats improved with diuresis to the low 90s.
Concern for COPD exacerbation/PNA at OSH, received vancomycin 1 gm x 1, azithromycin IV 500 mg x 1 and started on prednisone.
She completed a course of vanc/azithromycin and prednisone taper for concern for acute bacterial bronchitis/pneumonitis or COPD exacerbation.
She developed blood tinged sputum with heparin gtt, which was evaluated by pulmonology.
We switched the patient to xopenex [**3-8**] tachycardia noted after albuterol treatment.
Patient will require PFT and pulmonology follow-up as an outpatient; no need for repeat imaging per pulm and radiology as the abnormal finding at OSH consistent with ectatic vasculature involving the aorta.
# HTN: BP 127/58 this AM.
Increased metoprolol to 300mg daily, home Diovan d/c'd during stay in CCU, but resumed before discharge.
Continued home regimen of 70/30 and covered the patient on insulin sliding scale.
Will have patient restart home regimen upon discharge.
We avoided nephrotoxic medications and administered pre-cath Mucomyst; pre-hydration was held due to fluid overload/poor cardiac function.
We continued home atorvastatin 80mg daily.
However, on further review of the images by the pulmonologists and radiologists, it appears to be ectatic vasculature involving the aorta and will not require follow-up imaging per pulmonary.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - Coronary artery disease with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and prior coronary artery bypass surgery with documentation of vein graft occlusion and stenosis.
We had difficulty with performing your cardiac catheterization due to the blood tinged sputum that you developed while on heparin and the blood we found in your stool.
You eventually underwent a cardiac catheterization and a bare metal stent was placed in one of your coronary arteries.
Please make the following changes in your medication: - START Plavix 75mg daily for 1 to 3 months (3 months preferred) - INCREASE aspirin to 325mg daily - START Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate) 300mg daily - START pantoprazole 40mg twice daily - START torsemide 60mg daily  - STOP metoprolol tartrate - STOP lasix  **Please do not stop taking Plavix or aspirin unless directed to do so by a cardiologist**  Please continue all other medications as prescribed.
