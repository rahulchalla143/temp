You were admitted because your [**Hospital1 2286**] line fell out; you also experienced multiple symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision.
You also had a seizure while you were here.
We did briefly start you on antibiotics but your symptoms cleared spontaneously, which suggests that this is less likely to be an infection.
For this reason, you do not need to take antibiotics when you go home.
The medication changes we made during this hospitalization are: (1) We started you on keppra 500 mg daily.
(2) Instead of taking tacrolimus 0.5 mg twice a day, you should take tacrolimus 0.5 mg daily in the morning.
(6) We started you on Vitamin D 800 units daily.
