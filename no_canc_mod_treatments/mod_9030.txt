Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old female with PMH of depression followed by a psychiatrist with h/o suicide attempt 15 years ago and past psychiatric hospitalizations (last 1 year ago), bipolar disorder, HTN, and hypothyroidism who initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] at 4:30PM on [**2-25**] s/p an overdose of reportedly 300 tablets of aspirin and 10 tablets of Tylenol Extra Strength at 3:30PM this afternoon.
Toxic ingestion:  The patient reported taking 10 tablets of Extra Strength Tylenol and 300 tablets of Aspirin.
She received 2 doses of activated charcoal and was started on a bicarb drip with a goal pH 7.5 to 7.6.
She was initially treated with N-acetylcysteine for the Tylenol ingestion, but her serum levels trended down and NAC was stopped as she was below the nomogram.
As her PCO2 remained low with the CNS mediated tachypnea and she did not require intubation at any point.
Her Aspirin remained at 30 for 24 hours, raising the possibility of a continued bezoar.
Her Aspirin levels continued to trended down, and she did not require further dialysis, or EGD to look for bezoar.
Her home Lithium, citalopram, glycopyrrolate, clonoazepam were held.
She will require inpatient treatment on discharge.
She was also hypotensive and difficult to wean off pressors, perhaps in part due to sepsis.
She was started on antibiotics, and due to rapid clinical improvement, transitioned to PO levofloxacin.
She will need to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin by [**2183-3-13**].
The patient had large urine output, dilute urine with urine osmolality 133 with serum osmolality 304.  Review of outpatient labs at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] revealed that hyponatremia has been chronic since at least 07/[**2181**].
Her lithium levels were in the therapeutic range, and lithium was stopped during this hospitalization as above.
She will require outpatient followup with nephrology following discharge from inpatient psychiatry, and should be continued to be encouraged to drink plenty of water.
Hypotension:  She had been persistently hypotensive after her toxic ingestion of ASA, likely due to vasodilation from direct aspirin toxicity, possibly complicated by an aspirin bezoar or sepsis from aspiration pneumonia.
She was maintained on three pressors to facilitate dialysis as above, but was successfully weaned off pressors on [**2183-3-1**].
We restarted her home lisinopril and her blood pressures were stable and well-controlled at the time of discharge.
# Elevated LFTs: Likely secondary to tylenol toxicity combined with aspirin toxicity.
Continued home levothyroxine 88mcg daily.
She will require inpatient psychiatric treatment following discharge from the medical floor.
Psychoactive medications were held during this hospitalisation and may need to be reinstated as appropriate.
She will complete a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia on [**2183-3-13**]  Medications on Admission: -Levothyroxine 88mcg daily -Lithium 300mg [**Hospital1 **] -Citalopram 20mg daily -Dulcolax daily -MVI daily -Glycopyrrolate 1mg TID -Clonazepam 0.5mg daily -Lisinopril 2.5mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Salicylate and Tylenol Overdose.
You were admitted following an overdose on aspirin and tylenol, following which you became obtunded and developed severe metabolic abnormalities.
You were cared for in our intensive care unit, where you required aggressive treatments and dialysis to remove aspirin from your body.
You also had some liver damage from the tylenol, for which we treated you with N-acetylcysteine to remove tylenol from your body.
You were started on antibiotics for this, and will need to complete a course of levofloxacin following discharge.
Once we stopped fluid treatments for your overdose, we noticed that the sodium level in your blood was high.
Blood and urine tests suggested that this is probably a condition called "nephrogenic diabetes insipidus" a condition in which the body makes excess amounts of dilute urine and causes the sodium level in the blood to rise.
This is a consequence of your long-term lithium use.
Now that you have medically recovered from aspirin and tylenol poisoning, you will need further treatment in a psychiatric facility.
