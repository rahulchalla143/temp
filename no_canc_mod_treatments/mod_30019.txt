Admission Date:  [**2197-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2147-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is status post ventral hernia repair, panniculectomy and liposuction and this was complicated by acute renal failure, congestive heart failure and requirement of ventilatory support/slow vent wean/trach.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 49-year-old man with past medical history significant for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who is status post a DDD pacer in '[**84**] which was replaced in the year [**2195**].
He also is status post a gastric bypass in [**2193**] for morbid obesity and his postoperative course at that time was complicated by a trach for ventilatory support.
Pacer change as noted before 3.
Orthopedic surgery in the 70s  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant history of tobacco and no significant alcohol or other drug usage.
Enalapril 20 mg po bid 4.
Coreg 12.5 mg in the a.m. and 25 mg po q p.m. 5.
Lasix 80 mg po bid 6.
Spironolactone 25 mg po bid 7.
Desipramine 50 mg po bid 8.
Potassium 10 to 20 milliequivalents q day  HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient was admitted on [**2197-1-24**] after having had a ventral hernia repair with panniculectomy and axillary liposuction done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cooperative with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgical team.
His postoperative course, however, was significant for oliguria which became anuria x5 hours despite Foley irrigations and manipulations.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a PA catheter placement and volume resuscitation after this persistent oliguria despite fluid challenges.
The patient had dobutamine started and continued volume resuscitation per the Intensive Care Unit staff.
The patient received pressure support and resuscitation and was seen by multiple consult services on the first postoperative day.
The renal service did an official consult noting that by the time of evaluation the patient was on dobutamine at 7.5 and Levophed at 0.2 mcg per kg per minute and had minimal urine output of approximately 20 cc.
The EP service also saw this patient with regards to his atrial fibrillation and they recommended cardioversion during this admission if at all possible.
The patient was cardioverted on [**3-29**] per the EP service and then started on amiodarone drip.
Oxygenation with his congestive heart failure was initially a significant challenge to the surgical house staff, but with Lasix the patient did maintain urine output and began to auto diurese somewhat.
The patient also required significant PEEP on the ventilator during this time which helped to recruit extra alveoli.
He began to defervesce on his own after conservative management.
Eventually, one of the patient's BAL cultures grew out a multi resistant Enterobacter which the infectious disease people were not sure was colonized or not, but approved imipenem and blood cultures from [**4-9**] grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative which were actually off of an A-line but this line was changed and the patient was started on vancomycin.
The patient completed a 14 day course of both imipenem and vancomycin and at the end of this time really was afebrile and with a normalized white blood cell count.
The patient did not require dialysis during this time and with supportive Lasix and the tincture of the time, the patient's creatinine normalized.
In terms of his cardiovascular function, his pressors of dobutamine, DOPA and Levophed were intermittently weaned to off, as well as his Lasix strip and his cardiovascular function was optimized with the use of amiodarone to continue him in a normal sinus rhythm and captopril.
The captopril was increased during his hospital stay per the congestive heart failure service.
As the patient was a prolonged vent wean and failed a trial of extubation, he received a percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2197-4-20**] which was uncomplicated.
He really did well in terms of decreased secretions, etc with the trach which allowed deep suctioning and tolerated a pretty quick vent wean.
He was receiving tube feeds at goal of ProMod with fiber at 90 an hour.
He was optimized in terms of cardiac status and was restarting on his at home Lasix dose down the tube, but had had captopril which had been increased to 37.5 mg tid down the tube to decreases overall systemic vascular resistance.
His agitation which he had had especially all while on the vent was significantly diminished and the SICU team had incorporated a down the tube dose of Haldol and Ativan into the patient's medicine regimen and he really was quite calm and could communicate reasonably and seemed comfortable.
It should be noted that his wound actually was well healed at the time of discharge as well and both his JPs which had been in the subcutaneous tissues post surgery had been discontinued for some time by the plastic surgical team.
Clonidine patch 0.3 mg tid q week, change q Wednesday 2.
Haldol 1 mg down the nasogastric tube [**Hospital1 **] 3.

Aspirin 325 mg down the tube q day 7.
Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units tid 8.

Albuterol nebulizer q4h prn 11.
Atrovent nebulizer q4h prn 12.
Captopril 37.5 mg down the tube qid  He was to be restarted on his at home dose of Lasix down the tube and potassium and he received prn Ativan 1 to 2 mg q4h intravenous prn.
It should be noted that the patient's feeding tube and medication administration tube was actually a nasogastric tube post pyloric placed by interventional radiology.
He was to be continued with physical therapy and to continue strengthening.
