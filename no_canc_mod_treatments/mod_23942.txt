Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2137-9-21**] for evaluation and treatment of a small bowel obstruction and right inguinal hernia.

After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was admitted to the SICU NPO and intubated, with an NG tube to low suction, on IV fluids and empiric IV Zosyn, and a fentanyl drip for pain control.
On the floor, Neurology continued to follow the patient, and both Physical and Occupation Therapy were consulted.

Lab results were remarkable for an electrolyte imbalance consisting of potassium of 3.0, sodium 152, chloride 110.
Gentle free water repletement with D5W and potassium repletement per protocol were started.
Situation was complicated by poor sleep the night before and disruption of her anti-Parkinsonian medications due her somnulence.
The hypersomnulence resolved and mental status returned to baseline later that afternoon with repletement of electrolytes and free water.
She did not require pressors in the SICU.
She was given Metoprolol 5mg IV Q6Hours PRN for hypertension, which was converted to home doses of Altase and Norvasc when tolerating POs and after medication dosages were verified.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
Initially, nectar thickened liquids and ground solids was recommended, but upgraded to soft solid diet with thin liquids by POD#6.
The patient's renal functions progressively improved over the course of the admission with IV fluid rescusitaion and electrolyte repletement, with the patient's renal functions completely normalizing by POD#6 (BUN 18/ Creatinine 0.7).
Empirically, she received one dose of IV Vancomycin post-operatively and four days of IV Zosyn.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout her stay; sliding scale insulin was required while the patient received free water repletement with IV D5W, but no longer needed at the time of discharge.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin, and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
The patient ambulated early and frequently with assistance and a walker.
Occupational Therapy was also consulted.
The patient was tolerating a regular soft solid diet, ambulating with a walker and assistance, urine output via the urostomy was good, and pain was well controlled mostly with acetaminophen.
