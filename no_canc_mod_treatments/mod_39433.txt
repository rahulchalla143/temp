He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent surgical debridement.
He has some discomfort in the affected groin area that is well controlled with current pain regimen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: colon cancer s/p sub-total colectomy [**2101**] s/p appendectomy   Social History: - Tobacco: Quit 35 years ago.
[**2107-11-1**] EGD: Blood was seen in the esophagus.
Cardiac Cath (prelim report) [**2107-10-31**]: 1.
A modest caliber AV grossve with 50% stenosis just after the origin of the OM2 and slow flow is also noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 65M with history of Colon Ca (s/p hemicolectomy in [**2101**]) and no cardiac history who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for operative debridement of necrotizing fasciitis and whose post-op course was complicated by STEMI and then upper GI bleed.
Initially he was covered broadly with Vancomycin and Zosyn until sensitivities became available.
He was then switched to Penicillin and Clindamycin.
He was therefore switched to linezolid and instructed to add penicillin to his allergy list.
He will complete a 2 week course of antibiotics from day of debridement ([**2107-10-24**]) with last dose given on [**11-7**].
Regardless, the antibiotics given are appropriate for both organisms.
Subsequent 12 lead ECG showed inferior/posterior/lateral ST elevations.
He was therefore started on aggressive medical antiplatelet therapy with ASA, Plavix 600mg X1, heparin X72hrs, and Integrilin X 24hrs.
The intensity of his medical regimen was decreased because of GI bleed requiring 5 units of blood and he was discharged on ASA 81mg daily.
He was also started on Atorvastatin 80mg.
Metoprolol will be started at that time if BPs tolerate.
# Acute Systolic Heart Failure (EF: 35-40%): Due to STEMI as described above and exacerbated by fluid resuscitation during septic shock.
He was diuresed with IV lasix initially but was stable and euvolemic for several days prior to discharge and therefore he was not discharged on any diuretic.
However he may require a low dose diuretic in the future.
He was started on lisinopril 5mg daily which will be uptitrated as BPs tolerate.
Metoprolol not started prior to discharge because of low-normal BP.
