He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred tot he CVICU intubated and sedated in critical but stable condition.
All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
He was weaned off all drips and Beta-Blocker/Statin/ASA and gentle diuresis was initiated with a transient postoperative oliguria.
His rhythm postoperatively went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone and increased beta-blocker.Anticoagulation with Coumadin was resumed for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/MAZE procedure.
He continued to progress and his creatnine improved towards baseline.
His INR and coumadin dosing will be followed by [**Hospital3 3583**] [**Hospital 197**] Clinic.
