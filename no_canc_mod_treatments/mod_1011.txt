Admission Date:  [**2144-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-6-17**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Ticlid / Persantine / Aspirin / Benadryl / Xylocaine / Prevacid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1620**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress and weakness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardial window  History of Present Illness: This 86 year old man with h/o Afib(on warfarin), CHF, CAD(s/p AMI '[**33**]), and PVD, developed a fever 1 wk prior to admission, and since his primary physician had relocated, he opted to treat himself with amoxicillin 1000 mg tid, using pills that he kept for dental procedures.
Non-focal     Pertinent Results:  Brief Hospital Course: Prior to going to the Operating Room for the pericardial window procedure, he was given 2 units of FFP and coumadin(INR-1.8) was held.
His Nitrates and HCTZ were also temporarily held.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated on [**2144-6-12**] after a transient episode of tachycardia and O2 desaturation that required lopressor and increase in his O2.
pericardial effusion, RA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7151**] dilated, mod-severe TR/MR, severe apical hypokinesis, mild hypokinesis of rest of LV   After extubation in the CCU, pt stabilized and was returned to floor.
CT remained in place, and was removed [**6-15**] by cardiac surgery without complications.
Pt started on ethacrinic acid and HCTZ on [**6-15**] to aid in diuresis (this regimen is one of the only ones he tolerates due to multiple drug reactions), with close attention paid to electrolytes.
The right lung showed a pleural effusion, but the patient elected to attempt to reduce the effusion with diuresis alone and not to perform thoracentesis.
When INR came down to patient's baseline on [**6-16**], pt was restarted on his home dose of coumadin (2 mg po qd 5 days of the week, 3 mg 2 days of the week).
The patient stated his MD [**First Name (Titles) 7152**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7153**] his INR at 1.3 to avoid nosebleeds at higher INRs, but it was explained that a range of [**1-21**] was required for prevention of stroke in patients with A-fib.
Pt told medical team that his arthritis and back pain was well controlled with the Tylenol regimen, therefore, pt was told he should follow up as an outpt by talking to his PCP and asking him/her to make a referral for pain management if patient wants to explore pain management further.
