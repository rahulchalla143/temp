Admission Date:  [**2181-8-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-9-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2115-1-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old male patient who underwent coronary artery bypass graft on [**2181-8-20**], times five.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be severely hypoxic despite supplemental oxygen and was intubated in the Emergency Department and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
He underwent cardiac catheterization and subsequent coronary artery bypass graft on [**2181-8-20**].
Carotid artery disease, status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2178**].
Spinal stenosis, status post back surgery times two.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Lasix with supplemental potassium replacement p.r.n.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
Prednisone 5 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Albuterol nebulizer treatment p.r.n.
At the time of examination, he was intubated and sedated.
It was their recommendation to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Piperacillin and Levofloxacin.
They also requested Legionella titer to be sent which was ultimately found to be negative and bronchoscopy was recommended.
It was their recommendation to continue beta blockers and Amiodarone.
It was their assessment that the patient was a 66 year old male status post coronary artery bypass graft who was readmitted with respiratory distress, fever and hypoxia, likely from pulmonary edema as well as nosocomial pneumonia.
The patient had persistent problems with fever and elevated white blood cell count although the only cultures which had come back positive were that of an arterial line tip as well as one positive blood culture which was positive for Staphylococcus.
The patient was eventually heparinized due to intermittent bouts with atrial fibrillation and this was ultimately converted to Coumadin for long term anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation.
The patient continued Levofloxacin and Flagyl for empiric coverage of presumed pneumonia.
On [**2181-9-6**], through [**2181-9-7**], the patient was noted to have a maculopapular rash over his trunk, his back and his thigh with persistent fever.
However, it was felt by the pulmonary medicine service that the patient should undergo tracheostomy due to noncompliant lungs and the patient requiring high driving pressures for adequate ventilation.
It was their feeling that it would be a very prolonged ventilator weaning process before he was ultimately not requiring mechanical ventilation.
On [**2181-9-10**], the patient was taken to the operating room and he underwent gastrostomy placement for continued nutritional support as well as tracheostomy for continued ventilatory support by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated these procedures well and was transported back to the Intensive Care Unit from the operating room.
During this course of hospitalization, the patient also had some difficulty with loose stools, however, multiple specimens for C. difficile were sent and have been returned as negative.
Over the next few days, the patient's tube feedings were increased.
He was on intravenous Heparin drip for anticoagulation due to his intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation.
He had been discontinued from his antibiotics since he had completed the full courses which were recommended by the infectious disease service.
On [**2181-9-13**], the patient was weaned off continuous sedation, was given pain medication and sedation on a p.r.n.
His ventilator was weaned to CPAP mode with significant levels of pressure support with the plan to wean this very slowly over the next few days to weeks if necessary.
On [**2181-9-14**], the patient had some episodes of anxiety, questionable agitation, despite occasional doses of Ativan, Morphine and Haldol which were being dosed as needed.
He was started on a Clonidine patch for better control of sedation concerns.
It was their recommendation to hold off on any antibiotic administration unless the patient spiked a very high fever or unless there was an identifiable bacteria which required treatment.
It is felt that the patient is making progress with weaning of the ventilator albeit very slowly and it was felt appropriate for the patient to be screened and placed in a rehabilitation facility for continued long term ventilator weaning as soon as it was felt appropriate by the Intensive Care Unit team.
His ventilator right now is on CPAP mode with 7.5 of PEEP and his pressure support was weaned today from 18 to 16.
There is slight tenderness at the site of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
Lopressor 50 mg per gastrostomy tube b.i.d.
Amitriptyline 75 mg per gastrostomy tube q.h.s.
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg per gastrostomy tube t.i.d.
Lansoprazole 30 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
Nystatin powder to the groin t.i.d.
Prednisone 5 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
Clonidine patch 0.3 mg transdermally q.week to be applied on Tuesday.
Ativan 2 mg per gastrostomy tube q.h.s.
Coumadin 2.5 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
Albuterol MDI q4hours p.r.n.
Ativan 1 mg per gastrostomy tube q6hours p.r.n.
The patient is maintained on tube feeds for nutritional support which is Impact with Fiber at 70 cc/hour and the patient has been tolerating this well.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
