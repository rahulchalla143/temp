She was started on acyclovir on empirically on [**8-21**] and LP on [**8-22**] reportedly was postive for VZV PCR, although report is not included.
Renal US showed no hydronephrosis, and acyclovir was DC'd on [**8-30**].
However, Cr improved to 1.1 on [**8-31**] and acyclovir was restarted.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Aortic stenosis s/p AVR (21mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra Porcine Valve) [**2133-2-4**] -Osteoarthritis -Pending bilateral knee replacements -Colectomy with h/o colostomy for bowel obstruction/?diverticulitis   Social History: She is a widow with 5 grown children.

Esophageal catheter with retained fluid and aeroselized material in the proximal and mid esophagus.
Sequelae of aortic stenosis (now status post valve replacement), including 4.1 cm ascending aortic dilation and severe left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left PICC terminates at the top of the superior vena cava.
These findings could represent a combination of hemorrhage as well as meningitis and encephalitis.
While this could be due to global cerebral volume loss, the possibility of communicating hydrocephalus should be considered.
Microbiology: +Varicella PCR on CSF at OSH (1.8 million copies -> <3000 copies) [**2136-9-4**]: VZV PCR <500 copies, negative for HSV, negative [**Male First Name (un) 2326**]  Brief Hospital Course: A/P:82 yo F with h/o dementia, HTN, AS s/p AVR ([**Hospital1 18**]), vasculitis on mycophenolate (Cellcept), admitted [**2136-8-20**] to [**Hospital3 2737**] with VZV encephalitis (1.8 million copies on PCR) with course c/b ARF and worsening obtundation.
Her repeat LP here showed increased WBC in CSF, so she was started on IV bactrim given concern for listeria meningitis by the ID team.
Her respiratory status worsened with desaturation to 70s on room air, requiring a nonrebreather and transfer to ICU.
Her pain was managed with morphine and her secretion was managed with scopolamine patch and prn hyocyamine/glycopyrrolate.
# Obtundation: Unclear if this was related to the patient's VZV meningoencephalitis, as she reportedly improved with tx at OSH, but became and remained obtunded throughout this hospital stay.
Patient was continued on acyclovir for treatment of VZV meningoencephalitis and EEG was obtained to evaluate for seizures, which showed slowing and PLEDs but no actual seizure activity.
She was started on Keppra and lacosamide was added to improve the EEG without clinical improvement.
Her repeat MRI on [**2136-9-11**] showed new subarachnoid hemorrhage, and her anticoagulation for DVT/PE were reversed, but upon discussion with her family, decision was made to focus on comfort care given the poor prognosis.
Patient was started on heparin and CTA was obtained, which showed left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus.
She was continued on heparin gtt with bridge to coumadin.
At OSH, acyclovir was discontinued due to ARF, but restarted a day later when ARF resolved.
Acyclovir was discontinued when decision was made to focus on comfort care.
Currently 1.1 per OSH reports, but was up to 1.5 and attributed to acyclovir tx.
Should be noted patient was continued on celebrex daily as well.
Also possibly due to urinary retention, foley placed after retention x2.
Presented with abdominal/leg pains.
Initially treated with prednisone and methotrexate, but has been on cellcept for years and doing very well, so dose has been weaned off.
# HTN: Amlodipine increased to 10mg at OSH, but antihypertensives held in house given ongoing infectious issues and concern for sepsis.
# HLD: continued on home pravastatin 20mg, and discontinued when decision was made to focus on comfort care.
