HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, status post recent total knee replacement and hip fracture in [**2162-11-25**], chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially presented from rehabilitation on [**2-3**] with fevers to 102 and hypoxia at 89% in the setting of oxygen saturations of 89% on room air.
During this subsequent hospital course, the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection and a questionable right lower lobe infiltrate, and blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters which subsequently grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had five days of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from [**2-2**] to [**2-7**] at which point the patient was treated initially with Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
There was on blood loss and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was also placed which revealed the central venous pressure of 9, PA pressure of 49/20, cardiac output of 5.12.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while intubated for further hospital course.
The patient was maintained on Vancomycin dose by level and subsequent cultures from the tissue grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was maintained on Vancomycin dose by level given her creatinine that had continued to rise.
They recommended continued coverage with Vancomycin, and Neurosurgery continued to follow the patient who recommended following the patient's mental status and neurological examination as the sedation from the ventilation was weaned off.
That was uncomplicated with successful wean to pressure support.
Bacteremia - The patient was dosed by level, given her creatinine with Vancomycin.
She was initially started on Zosyn but given the creatinine rise and positive eosinophils in her urine this was changed to Aztreonam for a total 14 day course which ended on [**2163-2-26**], as per infectious disease records.
The patient was continued on AC and was subsequently weaned and extubated on [**2-24**] as detailed above with improved oxygenation saturations, as the patient was tolerating 2 liters of nasal cannula on discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She was initially loaded on Amiodarone prior to transfer and maintained on Lopressor.
Amiodarone was decreased on [**2-21**], given the loading taper and the patient initially had a long QT, documented to be 490.
This was also multifactorial in the face of having received Haldol during the course.
Coronary - The patient was maintained on Aspirin per Neurosurgery and Cardiology recommendations and beta blocker as tolerated for her blood pressure.
Swan was discontinued on [**2-20**] and the Lasix drip was started with a goal of negative 1 liter out.
The Propofol for sedation was weaned off and the patient was subsequently taken off of beta blockade from a hypotension and increasing of creatinine.
The patient was also placed on a Lasix drip for further diuresis which improved her creatinine slightly but after overdiuresis her creatinine continued to rise but plateaued until the day of this dictation.
Herpes simplex virus labialis - The patient was treated with Acyclovir which was discontinued on [**2-23**].
Endocrine - The patient was maintained on an insulin drip which was discontinued on [**2-23**] and tapered fingerstick blood glucose.
Hydrocortisone was initially given at stress doses given her chronic Prednisone which was subsequently being tapered off for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - The patient was maintained on Flovent, metered dose inhaler, inhaled, and subsequently started on steroid taper.
Delta MS - The patient had laughing mania delirium prior to transfer and on arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was intubated and sedated.
As she was weaned off of her intubation as the patient was lightened.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained which showed no acute process and she was initially started on Haldol which was subsequently discontinued given her prolonged QTC syndrome in favor of uveitis.
She responded with 2 units of packed red cells without any further hematocrit drop.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was subsequently maintained on tube feeds while she was intubated and planned post extubation with placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for tube feeds.
