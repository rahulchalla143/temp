He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

In the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid) should be considered.
Left vetriculography was deferred given renal insufficiency.
There was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures consistent with contriction.

Serosanguinous ascitic fluid likely from traumatic tap, cytology was negative for malignant cells and pathology shows inflammatory cells and histiocytes.
Ceruloplasmin was slightly elevated.
B2 microglobulin and Kappa2 were pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed up as an outpatient.
Patient was continued on b-blockade for rate control.
