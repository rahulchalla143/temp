Of note, pt was hospitalized ~1 mo ago for PVD, failed LLL angioplasty and stent intervention for ischemia which failed and amputation under consideration for chronic non healing ulcer.
Pt has been on oxycodone for pain which has resulted in sedation and consequently poor PO intake.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxia and shortness of breath due to acute diastolic CHF exacerbation Acute on chronic kidney failure, CKD4 Angioedema UTI Peripheral vascular disease Chronic non-healing left toe ulcer Hypertension Hyperlipidemia CAD Chronic diastolic CHF CVA, late effects Depression Iron deficiency and B12 deficiency anemia DM2 uncontrolled with PVD complications   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had acute on chronic kidney failure likely due to an effect of medications and due to volume depletion within the blood vessel (despite having too much fluid elsewhere).
You had swelling of your lip due to angioedema - probably an allergic reaction to either ACE inhibitors (of which your chronic medicaion vasotec is one example) or augmentin (which you were recently started on for cellulitis).
From now on please avoid all ACE inhibitor medications and penicillin containing antibiotics.
