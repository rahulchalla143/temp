Patient was found to have a pulse and was started on lidocaine and Lopressor.
Patient was cardioverted at 100 joules and then given 150 mg of amiodarone and converted to sinus in the 70s.
Of note, the patient had a PA catheter placed in the outside hospital Intensive Care Unit which showed a central venous pressure of 23 and right ventricular pressure of 46/23, a PA pressure of 52/30 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 28.
Patient was transported on dobutamine.
Patient denied any history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  The patient was on amiodarone 1 mg per minute, Lopressor 12.5 mg per G tube b.i.d., propofol, aspirin, Protonix and dobutamine.
Respiratory rate of 15 and an oxygen saturation of 100% on pressure support ventilation of [**9-9**] breathing at a rate of 15, taking volumes of 600 and 50% FIO2.
His electrocardiogram post cardioversion was quite unremarkable and did not suggest structural heart disease, however, the patient did undergo coronary catheterization which revealed elevated left-sided pressures but clean coronary arteries.
The patient was maintained on an aspirin and beta-blocker while he was being evaluated for heart disease.
From a myocardium standpoint, the patient had globally depressed ejection fraction at the outside hospital initially requiring inotropic support for cardiogenic shock.
Dopamine was easily weaned off and the patient was diuresed to lower his left-sided filling pressures with a goal PAD of less than 18.
He was started on an ACE inhibitor.
Patient was also given a beta-blocker.
Patient underwent ICD placement without difficulty.
Patient underwent cardioversion times three with brief conversions to normal sinus rhythm but then recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
He was loaded on amiodarone 400 mg po q.i.d.
and will eventually finish his load as an outpatient with an aim of outpatient cardioversion in the near future.
He remained difficult to rate control and was continued on Lopressor, as well as started on digoxin for better rate control.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient for INR checks and for continued management of his dilated cardiomyopathy.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg po b.i.d.
Zofran 8 mg po b.i.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Warfarin 5 mg po q.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg po q.i.d.
Cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation, status post AICD placement.
