Brief Hospital Course: This 74 yo woman was admitted with simultaneous NSTEMI (max trop 0.09) and stroke affecting her left corona radiata and posterior putamen resulting in right face, arm, and leg weakness, and dysphagia.
The etiology was thought to be more small vessel, but in the context of these events on anti-platelet agents, it was felt she would ultimately benefit from anticoagulation.
In the short term, a joint decision between neurology and cardiology was made to hold off on anticoagulation out of fear for hemorrhagic conversion and to continue her aspirin and plavix.
Her blood sugars were difficult to control in the context of having her home metformin and glyburide held.
Her blood pressures were also difficult to control and after a period of 3 days during which most of her BP meds were held in an attempt to allow her BP to autoregulate in the aftermath of her stroke, she was restarted on her home regimen, and her lisinopril was increased to 10 mg daily.
Her lipid panel showed elevated lipids including an LDL of 113, and so her lipitor was increased from 20 to 80 mg daily and zetia 10 mg daily was added.
She failed her S/S eval and she subsequently received meds and tube feeds through an NG tube.
She was originally scheduled for PEG placement [**2124-12-18**], but this was postponted until [**12-21**] as she was quite hypertensive immediately before the initially scheduled PEG placement.
In the meantime, her plavix was DC'd and she was kept on aspirin as the only blood thinnner.
After PEG placement [**12-21**], aspirin was DC'd and coumadin was started with a lovenox bridge.
On discharge, her neurological exam was significant for right arm and leg weakness in the 4/5 range, dysphagia, and dysarthria with language output limited to stating name and answering simple yes/no questions.
