She has not been taking her medications the last few days since she has been drinking ETOH and was worried about the interactions.
She was given Percocet for back pain and ativan for anxiety.
She was given levaquin for PNA seen on CTA.
She was given Lasix IV without significant diuresis.
She was given a neb, Lasix 20 IV, and CXR was ordered.

[**5-31**] ct sinus: IMPRESSION: Although endotracheal intubation confounds interpretation, extensive opacification with multiple air-fluid levels among the paranasal sinuses can be seen in pansinusitis.
The patient failed non-invasive ventilation (due to progressive hypercarbia) and required intubation on [**2184-5-26**].
The patient's baseline obesity hypoventilation, and continued hypercarbia made liberation from the ventilator difficult.
Despite remaining negative, the patient was still unable to come off of the ventilator, so a tracheostomy tube was placed.
After placement of her trach, she continued to be diuresed with IV lasix prn with careful observation of her electrolytes given a history of contraction alkalosis.
Improvement was slow, and shge continued to require pressure support ventilation, initially for 24` a day, then with increasing amounts of time on trach mask.
On [**6-20**] she was weaned from the vent and maintained on trach mask for the entire day.
This was replaced and placement confirmed by CXR.
She should be maintained on PO lasix and her electrolytes monitored while at rehab.
As her fluid status contributed to her respiratory failure she was aggressively diuresed with lasix drip.
Her HCTZ was held and she was put on a beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**].
An ace was also started for afterload reduction.
The patient had alkalosis at times, likely related to her diuresis, but this improved with KCL and diamox prn.
When her contraction alkalosis worsened her lasix was stopped and it was felt she was adequately diuresed at that time.
Given this organism a concern for peritonsillar abscess and sinusitis was raised.
She also likely had a pneumonia given her cxr during her course.
She recieved vanc and meropenem for 14 d for the fusiform bacteria.
She was given emperic flagyl but spiked fevers while on this.
In additon, after a CT torso showing only a LLL pna, she was treated with a second course of broad spectrum antibiotics (vanco and cefepime to cover ventilator-associated pna), starting [**6-16**] for a planned eight day course.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of Afib/flutter and is on CCB, BB and coumadin at home.
Here, she became modestly hypotensive while on sedation and her calcium channel [**Month/Year (2) 7005**] was held; she was only treated with metoprolol given hypotension and was intermittently on heparin which was later stopped due to hematuria.
Heamturia resolved (likely foley trauma), and her warfarin was restarted.
She may have had withdrawal while on the vent because she was agitated.
She responded well with sedation (fentanyl and midazolam) and haldol prn, but she responded best to quetiapine.
Quetiapine tid provided excellent control of anxiety and agitation, with as needed lorazepam for rare agitation.
As she was vented during the majority of her course her ARF resolved and was followed closely while on lasix but did not recur.
