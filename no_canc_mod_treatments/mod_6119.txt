Regarding his medication regimen, aspirin was held during his initial perioperative state but was restarted within 2-3 days of his procedure.
His ACEI and beta blocker were initially held due to the need to maintain an SBP > 120 in the perioperative state.
His ACEI was restarted and his beta blocker will need to be added back on within his first 3-4 days at rehab with goal to maintain SBP>90 per neurosurgery.
His ACEI and beta blocker were initially held as discussed in #3 CAD.

You had a procedure called an anterior cervical diskectomy, arthrodesis, and plating of your C4-C5.
While you were hospitalized, you were also found to have a urinary tract infection and were treated with an antibiotic called vancomycin for a five day course.
Given the difficulty of wearing your collar and your recent procedure, you are unable to swallow food.
We have instead placed a PEG tube (feeding tube) into your stomach so that you can continue to receive nutrition and medications.
We also held your coumadin in the setting of your recent injury and surgery.
Your neurosurgery team felt comfortable restarting your coumadin on [**2123-10-17**].
Your tegretol was also held for a few days while you were unable to eat.
We continued you on all of your previous medications and continued your dialysis according to your previous schedule.
You normally receive dialysis on Tuesday - Thursday - Saturday; however due to the [**Holiday 1451**] holiday, you received dialysis on Monday [**10-18**], are scheduled to get dialysis on Wednesday [**10-20**], and then resume your normal schedule with dialysis on Saturday [**10-23**].
Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.
We have made the following changes to your medication list since your admission: - dexamethasone - you were added on this medication to improve swelling around your spinal cord after your fall.
We will slowly decrease your dose of steroids over the next 7-8 days.
- Senna and bisacodyl - we added these medications to maintain regular bowel movements.
- Tylenol - We added scheduled tylenol to treat post-operative pain.
- Morphine - We added morphine as needed for pain breakthrough - Pantoprazole - We added pantoprazole to prevent stress induced esophagitis or ulcers.
