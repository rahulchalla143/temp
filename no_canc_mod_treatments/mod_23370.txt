Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Administration of intravenous tissue plaminogen activator.
History of Present Illness: Time Code Stroke called: 20:17 Time Neurology at bedside for evaluation: 20:17 Time (and date) the patient was last known well: 18:55 [**2193-7-12**] Initial NIH Stroke Scale Score: 15 Subsequent NIH Stroke Scale Score: 11 t-[**MD Number(3) 6360**]: Yes Time IV t-PA was given 21:29 [**2193-7-12**]  *****  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 85206**] is a lovely 62 year-old right-handed man with a past medical history including renal transplant (PCKD) and left eye prosthesis who presented about one hour following the sudden onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis.
Initially the patient had a very "technological conversation" with the salesperson.
After sitting down, he developed an apparently complete right hemiplegia at about 7:20 pm.
A non-contrast CT of the head was thought to be unrevealing; in the setting of the patient's renal transplant and creatinine of 1.9, it was considered unsafe to perform CTA/P studies.
A repeat NIHSS survey following the imaging revealed improvement with a score of 11 (loc questions 2, right facial palsy 2, right arm  plegia 4, severe aphasia - anomia, fluent with neologisms, paraphasic errors, inappropriate to context 2, dysarthria 1; he could move the right lower extremity and sustain versus gravity without problem).
After a  review of contraindications, risks, and benefits, IV t-PA was administered with clear improvement; the patient became able to lift the right upper extremity at last versus gravity.
A normal saline bolus was given and pressors were started in an attempt to maintain an SBP of 160-180.
REVIEW OF POTENTIAL CONTRAINDICATIONS TO tPA: * Absolute - Negative for: stroke or head trauma within 3 months of admission, hx of intracranial hemorrhage, major surgery within 2 weeks of admission, pregnancy, persistent SBP > 185 or DBP > 110, platelets < 100, 000 or INR > 1.7 * Relative - Positive for: improvement in stroke sx - Negative for: GU or GI procedure within 3 weeks of admission, LP within 1 week of admission, seizure, glucose < 50, >400, NIHSS <4, >22  GENERAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: - Positive for: as above - Negative for: fevers, chills, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, muscle, rash.
Past Medical History: -PCKD, Likely autosomal dominant (several family members with the disease on both sides; no h/o SAH or aneurysm), s/p renal transplant in [**2171**] (current baseline Cr=1.6, follows with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7741**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] Nephrology).
The patient was treated initially with hemodialysis and has a non-functional AVF in his left arm.
-Left eye prosthesis secondary to herpes infection (prior to transplant)  -BPH, ?on no meds  -Sepsis (E. coli) of unknown etiology (patient thinks it is from something he ate, but cannot recall any N/V/D GI symptoms around that time) requiring 2 day stay in [**Hospital1 2025**] ICU; no intubation or pressors per the pt.

Patient instead had aphasia of Wernicke's type on arrival with hemiplegia.
In ICU required pressor support with phenylephrine and then was transitioned to midodrine with continuation of intravenous fluids before transfer to floor on hospital day four.
Difficulty Voiding Foley catheter was removed on [**7-14**] in the a.m. and the patient could not void, despite full bladder.
Given single transplanted kidney, reinsertion of catheter was felt prudent.
He was started on oxybutynin, but this was stopped given some confusion and concern for exacerbation of hypotension.
He still suffers from substantial lexical impairments, with frequent word replacements and word-finding difficulties.
He was continued on aspirin and Plavix.
His Foley catheter was discontinued on [**2193-7-18**]; UA at that time 0-2 WBC, 11RBC, prot 30, negative leukocyte esterase, negative nitrites, occ mucous.
Cardiology did not think this heart rhythm or your symptoms require a pacemaker at this time, but this should be taken up by his PCP and followed with an ECG and possibly Holter monitoring as an outpatient.
IVF was d/c'd on [**7-18**], but midodrine was continued (long-term plan for this medication will be developed based on his symptoms at home, by his PCP/Nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2578**] and by stroke f/u appt).
This worsened this worsened with conservative treatment [**2109-7-16**] (warm compresses, elevation).
Also of note, we recorded a FSBG of 250 after he received Prednisone 10mg on [**7-18**]; his hemoglobin A1c is 6.9%.
He was covered by sliding-scale insulin (minimal requirements) while here as an inpatient.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Stroke (involving the Left thalamus, posterior-capsule and globus pallidus)  Secondary Diagnosis - Bradycardia (symptomatic) patient gets confused - you were seen by cardiology in house, who did not feel that you needed any intervention at this point.
- Right forearm cellulitis in an intravenous access site (this was discussed with infection diseases, you need to continue on Bactrim for 10 days, and if this does not work you need to try doxycycline, and if this does not work, you may need intravenous vancomycin - you will need this followed up by your PCP.
Discharge Condition: Exam notable for frequent word replacements and/or word-finding difficulties and 0/3 recall at three minutes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with stroke symptoms: Right arm and leg and facial numbness/weakness, aphasia (difficulty with normal/fluent speech), and mild confusion.
You were given an IV medication called tPA to break apart the clot in this artery and restore bloodflow to this part of your brain.
You were started on a medication called Plavix, which will reduce your future risk for stroke -- you need to fill the prescription for Plavix and begin taking it immediately, once every day, to reduce your risk for future strokes.
A Foley urinary catheter was placed in your bladder for several days with relief of the urinary retention.
You should see a Urologist as an outpatient to seek a definitive diagnosis and if needed, treatment for BPH.
You also had a very low heart rate (bradycardia to the 30-40bpm range), which caused you difficulty maintaining your blood pressure when sitting or standing up.
The cause of your sinus bradycardia was not determined with certainty and it resolved; possibilities include cyclosporine (Sandimmune) effects and side-effects of the stroke.
For now, you need to keep taking a medication that was started in the hospital, called midodrine -- you need to fill this prescription and take it three times every day to keep your blood pressure up; your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
