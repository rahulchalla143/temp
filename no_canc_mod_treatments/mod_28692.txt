endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 42y/o M w/ a PMH of only HTN who was transferred here after a 1month admission at an OSH for further management of his liver disease.
He presented to the the ED at [**Hospital3 **] where he found to be confused and jaundiced and was admitted for furhter management.
His ARF was thought to be [**1-13**] renal hypoperfusion [**1-13**] diuretic therapy and poor PO intake but worsened despite IVF support.
He was initially treated with CTX/azithromycin for the suspected PNA but these were later d/c for unclear reasons.
UCX during this time grew multiple organisms including MRSA and he was treated with vancomycin by level.
Taps of his abdomen were reported to be c/w SBP but no note of antibiotic therapy is made in the d/c summary and these results show <10 PMN per tap.
He was eventually transfered her for further management of his medical conditions.

[**10-7**] CXR:Lung volumes remain quite low, and the right hemidiaphragm is still markedly elevated, but less so compared to the prior study.
He was shortly started on pentoxyphylline for his alcoholic hepatitis and completed over a 3 wk course in the hospital.
Steroids were not administered b/c of concern over potential infection.
Due to concern over very poor po intake (abt 300kcal/d) A post-pyloric dauboff feeding tube was placed and he was begun on continuous tube feeds with thiamine, folate, and multivitamin.
He gradually improved with this therapy and his bilirubin declined from 34 on admission to 11 on discharge.
His feeding tube was discontinued after a trial at po with about 1300kcl and 40g protein daily intake.
He was placed on lactulose and rifaxamin due to hepatic encephalopathy which gradually cleared.
He improved with cholestyramine and is dishcarged with this medicine.
Renal failure: Mr [**Known lastname **] Cr was 2.7 on transfer from OSH, which improved to 2.0 with 1L NS bolus.
He was started on midodrine, octreotide, and IV albumin at maximum doses for treatment of presumed hepatorenal syndrome.
At several points in his hospitalization paracentesis was performed with approx 3-4L off per procedure (8g albumin/L replaced) and his creatinine would subsuquently rise and then gradually fall.
Nevertheless, his renal failure gradually improved and he tolerated several large volume paracentesis and was then started on low-dose diuretics (lasix 20, aldactone 50) with large and persistant diuresis.
He will continue lasix 20mg/aldactone 50mg daily after discharge.
#ID: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted with low-grade fevers to 100.7-8, leukocytosis to 18 (neutrophil predominant, no left shift).
CTX was discontinued without clinical worsening.
EGD during his hospital course revealed esophageal candidiasis and he was started on fluconazole.
Within several days he began having high fevers up to 103 and was empirically started on CTX and flagyl to cover empirically for C-diff and SBP or pneumonia.
He subsuquently developed a pruruitic rash and eosinophilia; with negative cultures and no sympoms to suggest infection all antibiotics were stopped and his leukocytosis, eosinohpilia, and fevers resolved prior to discharge.
Of note, he did receive 9 days of fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis treatment and was also treated with continued nystatin.
Immunizations: He was immunized with the first series of HBV; he was + for HAV Ab; he also received a pneumovax and an influenza vaccine.
He was started on Mirtazipine 15mg qhs which seemed to help quite significantly with insomnia and seemed to improve Mr. [**Known lastname **] mood.
He will continue with Mirtazipine 30mg qhs on discharge.
