The patient's symptoms persisted until she presented to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital on 529/01 and was found to have finger stick blood sugars in the 300s with an anion gap of 19 and 15 ketones in her urine and small acetone in her blood.
The patient was treated with DKA with intravenous fluids and an insulin drip.
Routine check of her CK and troponin noted elevation in troponin.
Coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent in [**2099**], cardiac catheterization on [**2106-5-28**] revealed left anterior descending coronary artery with diffuse disease, left circumflex with diffuse disease, right coronary artery with 99% occlusion with left to right collaterals, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16, left ventricular and diastolic pressure 20.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.
Lopressor 75 mg po b.i.d.
Cardizem CD 120 mg po q.d.
Univasc 15 mg po b.i.d.
NPH insulin 30 units in the morning and 15 units in the evening.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg po q day.
O2 sat 91% on room air.
2+ distal pulses.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with known coronary artery disease with three vessel disease with recent cardiac catheterization to define anatomy considered not amenable to cutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass graft currently.
During this hospitalization the patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix was added for greater antiplatelet activity.
She was continued on Lopressor and was started on Isordil, Zocor and continued on her Univasc.
Her cardiac regimen was maximized during her hospital stay.
On the day prior to discharge the patient received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix in the setting of her blood transfusions and diuresed approximately 1500 cc and was approximately 1600 cc negative for the day.
She was not discharged home on Lasix as she has never been on standing Lasix in the past.
Following the patient's acute presentation with a non ST elevation myocardial infarction and known disease not amenable to intervention the patient received 48 hours of heparin and Integrilin.
As noted a cardiac catheterization was not repeated during this hospitalization given recently defined anatomy.
She would likely benefit from erythropoietin given probably anemia of chronic disease.
The patient was started on an insulin drip and given aggressive intravenous fluids at the outside hospital.
The patient was continued on that regimen here at the [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2106-7-1**] and [**2106-7-2**].
On [**2106-7-3**] the patient's insulin drip was turned off.
Her NPH dose was increased slightly from 30 and 15 at the time of discharge to account for required regular insulin over the prior day.
She was started on Reglan and will be discharged on this medication.
She was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on the day prior to discharge and her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 31.
Infectious disease:  The patient was noted to hve a superficial infection of a right antecubital intravenous site following its removal.
She received daily betadine dressings and application of 4 by 4 gauze pads.
The patient should continue this care at home and should return should she develop fevers or chills, or worsening erythema or pain at this site.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was out of bed and maintained on Protonix during this hospitalization.
Univasc 15 mg po b.i.d.
Lopresor 100 mg po t.i.d.
NPH insulin 36 units subQ q.a.m., 17 units subQ q.p.m.
Plavix 75 mg po q day.
Welchol 625 mg three tabs po b.i.d.
Zocor 20 mg po q day.
Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Cardizem CD 120 mg po q day.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
Reglan 10 mg po q.i.d.
The patient will pursue cardiac rehab at [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital with patient to call to arrange.
