Other differential diagnoses would include toxic metabolic processes and infection, although these are considered much less likely, given the callosal, optic nerve, posterior fossa and cervical spine involvement.

Although true seizure activity was in question his Dilantin continued and the length of treatment would be dependent on any further seizure activity and EEG testing off sedation.
Irrigation and debridement, left open carpal dislocation, closed reduction, anterior capsular repair, carpal tunnel release and placement of external fixator and 2.
Closed reduction right carpal dislocation, release of carpal tunnel, anterior capsular repair and placement of external fixator.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His sedation was gradually weaned and he was eventually extubated without any difficulty.
He did have oligoclonal bands in his CSF which could aid in the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.
He will have VNA services for home Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.
He had some intermittent delta wave slowing in the right temporal region and will continue on dilantin until his appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] and then be re evaluated.
