HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old gentlemen with end stage liver disease secondary to NASH, diabetes mellitus, esophageal varices, status post banding, who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 256**] from [**2198-2-28**] through [**2198-3-6**] for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and anemia.
He was given glucagon, oral glucose and sent to [**Hospital6 4620**].
He was given Zosyn, put on a nonrebreather face mask and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
He received a total of 8 liters of intravenous fluids, 1 gram of vancomycin.
His systolic blood pressure was in the 60s to 70s and then he was placed on a Levophed drip with increase in the blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure to the 90s.
He was oxygenating at 95% on a 15 liter nonrebreather face mask.
End state liver disease secondary to non alcoholic steatohepatitis now off of the transplant list due to lack of social support and noncompliance with medications.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Controlled on NPH 25 q.a.m.
Lactulose 30 mg po t.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Aldactone 50 mg q.d.
Flagyl 250 mg po b.i.d.
Lasix 20 mg q.d.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Percocet prn.
Propanolol 10 mg t.i.d.
Ciprofloxacin 750 mg q. Tuesday.
NPH 25 mg q.a.m., 25 mg q.p.m.
Regular insulin 10 mg q.a.m., 5 mg q.p.m.
Insulin sliding scale.
Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus 8.5/3.2/1.9.
Sepsis:  The patient was placed on a sepsis protocol with a goal central venous pressure of [**9-13**].
The patient was given aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and Flagyl.
Levophed was titrated to a mean arterial pressure greater than 60.  his Lasix, Aldactone and propanolol were held.
A paracentesis was performed and was negative for SVP.
The vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were stopped on [**3-11**].
The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.
His Ciprofloxacin will be continued after this course has been completed, just once a week q. Tuesday for SVP prophylaxis.
Hypotension:  The patient was weaned off of Levophed as above.
As a result of the aggressive fluid resuscitation with his previous hypotension to the 60s, he had a resulting non gap metabolic acidosis.
His Aldactone was restarted on [**2198-3-12**] and his Lasix was restarted as well.
These were titrated up to a dose of Lasix 40 mg po q.d.
and Aldactone 100 mg po q.d.
Though, crackles did diminish somewhat when the Lasix and Aldactone were titrated up.
As stated above, he will be treated with a 14 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
Cough:  The patient did have persistent dry cough that was somewhat controlled with Tessalon pearls and Robitussin.
It did improve after diuresis on the floor.
This was felt to be likely dilutional post 7 liters of intravenous fluid.
However, given the patient's guaiac positive state and questionable bloody emesis in the Emergency Room, Gastroenterology was consulted and they did not feel that the patient had an active gastrointestinal bleed and had only Grade 1 varices, therefore, they recommended maintaining him on Protonix and falling hematocrit.
He was transfused for a hematocrit goal greater than 27.
He was given subcutaneous Vitamin K for a total of three days.
Given his lack of frank bleeding, no additional doses of Vitamin K were administered on the floor.
Other considerations would be delirium versus medications versus sepsis.
He was maintained on lactulose t.i.d.
Decreased urine output:  Initially the patient had decreased urine output, and there was some concern for hepatorenal syndrome, however, after aggressive fluid resuscitation, his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with greater than 1 cc/kg/hour of urine output.
Nevertheless, as a prophylactic measure, he will be maintained on 750 mg of Ciprofloxacin q. week.
Diabetes mellitus:  Initially the NPH and regular insulin standing doses were held given his hypoglycemia and mental status changes.
He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale in house with good effect, his total insulin requirement per day.
He will be placed on 5 units of NPH q.a.m., 5 units NPH q.p.m.
Following the resolution of the patient's sepsis, he had a normal anion gap acidosis likely secondary to aggressive fluid hydration as well as diarrhea with a urine anion gap that was less than 12.
Prophylaxis:  He was maintained on Pneumoboots while in bed.
He will likely need long-term care.
Insulin NPH 5 q.a.m., 5 q.p.m.
Insulin sliding scale.
Albuterol 1-2 puffs q.
Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg po q.h.s.
Spironolactone 100 mg po q.d.
Furosemide 40 mg po q.d.
Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d.
Metronidazole 500 mg po b.i.d.
Ciprofloxacin  750 mg q. week starting on [**2198-3-20**].
Benzonatate 100 mg po t.i.d.
4 hours prn cough.
Protonix 40 mg po q.
Prochlorperazine 10 mg intravenous q.
Tylenol 325 mg po q.
6 hours prn with a maximum Tylenol dose in 24 hours of 2 grams.
Lactulose 30 mL po t.i.d.
He should follow-up as needed with the Hepatology Service, however, he is no longer a candidate for orthotropic liver transplant at this time.
