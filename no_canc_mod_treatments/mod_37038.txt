Admission Date:  [**2110-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-7-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plaquenil / Glyburide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2110-7-11**] Cardiac catheterization [**2110-7-12**] Pericardiocentesis with drain placement and L+R heart cath  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN, rheumatoid arthritis and gallstones (but no cholecystitis) presents with 1 day history of chest pain.
ECG notable for SR @ 89 with ?ST-elevations and hyperacute T waves in anterolateral leads with Q waves that are new compared to last prior ECG in [**2107**].
She was given aspirin 325, 1 SL NTG, after which BP dropped to 60s but improved with 200cc bolus.
Started briefly on heparin gtt but then stopped prior to admission to the floor.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was feeling comfortable with no chest pain since receiving morphine in the ED.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for: + chest pain, syncope and presyncope (most recently last week) - dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations  Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Rhematoid arthritis - Gallstones - s/p hysterectomy - s/p appendectomy  Social History: Lives with her sister (also in her 90s) in [**Location (un) 1468**], MA.
Sister died at age 7 durng tonsillectomy from ether use.
Successful PTCA and stenting of distal LMCA into LAD origin with 3.0x18mm Integrity bare metal stent with proximal stent segment postdilated to 4.0mm.
LCx jailed, however only minimal pinching of origin with TIMI 3 flow.
Successful closure of right femoral arteritomy with 6F angioseal.
Successful distal LMCA-LAD PCI with BMS 4.
She was found to have a large STEMI with placement of bare metal stent.
Course complicated by large pericardial effusion and subsequent cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis and transfer to the CCU, as well as hypotension requiring pressors and acute kidney injury.
Patient had a right femoral artery approach with mostly single vessel LAD disease with a 90% proximal ostial LAD lesion, s/p BMS placement.
During the cath, she suffered a brief period of hypotension with systolics in the high 60's mmHg associated with balloon inflation, otherwise systolics maintained in the mid 100's mm Hg range.
She was started on full dose aspirin 325mg, atorvastatin 80, and plavix 75mg initially.
After developing pericardial effusion (see below), her aspirin dose was decreased to 162mg to avoid bleeding complications, and her statin was stopped due to transaminitis.
Unable to tolerate beta blocker or ACEI given hypotension.
She will need to continue aspirin and plavix at rehab, with possible re-initiation of statin when LFTs normalize and beta blocker/ACEU when BPs will tolerate.
Bolused with 500 cc's NS x 2 with BP up to the 80's.
She was urgently transferred to the CCU (see CCU course above), where she was started on dopamine.
She had some reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, so drain was placed.
Cause of her tamponade is not entirely clear-- no dye extravasation seen from coronary arteries on repeat cath during pericardiocentesis, however she may have had a small puncture that then clotted off.
She was given 60mg iV lasix and diuresed well and has return to normal urine output.
She should have her BUN/Cr checked at next PCP visit to ensure full return to baseline.
On aspirin 162mg, however not on b-blocker or ACEI due to low BPs and no statin due to transaminitis.
# Transaminitis:  AST 100s, ALT 200s, tBili initially high from hemolysis but trended down to normal, alk phos normal.
Atorvastatin was stopped, but could consider restarting in the future once LFTs have normalized.
#  Hypertension:  Was taking diltiazem and lisinopril at home.
Due to hypotension, home medications were held.
Could consider starting beta clocker and ACEI one hypotension has resolved  # Rheumatoid arthritis:  given tylenol PRN  TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - STEMI:  s/p BMS to LAD ostium, now on aspirin 162mg and plavix 75mg.
Should start metoprolol and ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] once blood pressure allows and restart statin once LFTs have normalized - [**Last Name (un) **]:  should have BUN/Cr checked at next PCP visit to ensure renal function has remained normal - Transaminitis:  should recheck LFTs at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
- Anemia: due to hemolysis (cause unknown) and acute blood loss, should have hct checked at next PCP follow up - FULL CODE (was DNR/DNI while in the CCU, however now wants "to live a little longer")  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were taken for a procedure called cardiac catheterization, where a large blockage in your coronary artery was found and opened with a stent.
After the procedure you developed fluid around your heart that needed to be drained, and you were sent to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
Changes to your medications: START aspirin 162mg daily START plavix 75 mg daily STOP diltiazem temporarily, until your blood pressure and kidney function improves STOP lisinopril, temporarily, until your blood pressure and kidney function improves Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
