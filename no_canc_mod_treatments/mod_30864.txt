During hospitalization the following problems were addressed:  1. mental status changes: The patient responded well to narcan and was found to have methadone and benzo's in his utox which suggests a medication overdose.
He was intubated and sedated initially with propofol, then versed and fentanyl.
When sedation was lifted he was treated with low dose methadone at 15mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn morphine prior to dressing changes.
As his mental status responded to narcan, and the patient had had a thorough work-up just two weeks prior during his prior hospitalization, it was not felt his presentation warrented head CT or LP.
From their assessment, it was an accidental overdose, and may have been secondary to a medication error.
The complete tox screen revealed Trileptal and Clozaril in his system, which were confirmed by his nursing home to be ordered for another patient on the same floor.
He was treated initially with levofloxacin and clindamycin for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
On day two, vancomycin was added to the regimen to cover for possible MRSA pneumonia given his previous hospitalization history.
He was extubated on day #3, but required supplemental oxygen by face mask and continued to produce copious secretions/sputum.
On day 3 his urine showed psueudomonas so his antibiotic regiment was changed to Vancomycin and Meorpenam.
The Vancomycin discontinued after his MRSA screen was negative.
He was treated for a COPD flare during his last hospitalization earlier this month.
At this time he was continued on combivent MDI for secondary prphylaxis and treatment.
He underwent an ORIF repair, with intramedullary nailing with cephalomedullary device, gamma nail of right femur fracture.
He was briefly on neosynephrine while in PACU.
He received 4 units of blood and his hematocrit subsequently stabilized.
His pain in his right leg is well controlled on his current regimen of methadone, morphine elixir during dressing changes, RTC tylenol, and neurontin.
He was diuresed successfully with Lasix and his shortness of breath resolved.
The patient would also benefit from a social work addictions consult given his two recent admissions and continued risk for overdose and aspiration.
He was continued on his bowel regimen and baclofen for muscle spasm.
Patient was also given prn morphine during dressing changes.
Tyelenol and Neurontin were also added to his regimen.
Decubitus ulcers:  wet to dry dressing changes were continued.
The patient is supposed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in plastic surgery for a possible skin graft to those areas.
His suprapubic catheter was changed and he completed a ten day course of meropenem.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia-He has HIT which was discovered during this admission.
He was put on argatroban during his perioperative period.
Currently he is on fondaparinux for prophylaxis as he is at significant.
