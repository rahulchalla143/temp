History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old right handed man with a past medical history significant for a.fib (not on Coumadin - has been undergoing cardioversion and ablations, and has been off for at least a month, HTN, HLD, DM - on insulin and oral medications, who presents with a sudden onset of right sided weakness, determined to have a LMCA syndrome at an OSH, given tPA and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Here on examination he continued to have severe deficits, given a stroke scale of 23.
Time Code Stroke called: 15:06 Time Neurology at bedside for evaluation: 15:07 Time (and date) the patient was last known well: 12:25 (24h clock) NIH Stroke Scale Score: -19- t-[**MD Number(3) 6360**]: --- Yes Time t-PA was given ------:------ (24h clock) -X- No Reason t-PA was not given or considered: Already given at OSH, completed at [**Hospital1 18**] .
Past Medical History: - afib: only on ASA not on Coumadin (been off for at least a month) - HTN - DM on insulin - HLD - CAD had a stent at least 1 year ago - s/p cholecystectomy 1 year prior   Social History: Lives with his wife.
R field cut III, IV, VI:Left visual pref, with encouragement can cross eyes across midline to right VII: right facial droop, lower half of face IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
-Coordination and gait: not tested .
PORTABLE CXR [**2163-9-30**]: The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina.
He was started on ASA 325 mg daily.
He was also maintained on heparin 5000 units TID for anticoagulation and bridged to Coumadin 5 mg daily.
His last CT scan on [**2163-10-4**] showed the presence of a large volume MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion as well as intraventricular hemorrhage.
The CT on [**2163-10-4**] did not show any signs of local vasogenic edema concerning enough to start on osmotic therapy.
He subsequently required a tracheostomy because of an inability tolerate secretions and impaired swallow/gag function.
As patient was transferred from ICU to general floor, he was placed on a VAP antibiotic bundle (vancomycin, tobramycin, cefepime) which helped reduce his fevers and leukocytosis and resulted in clearing of the CXR over the course of 3 days.
*)CARDIO: Upon admission, blood pressure medications were withheld to allow for autoregulation.
During the first two to three days of ICU stay, he developed a rapid ventricular rate required a bolus of amiodarone over the course of 24 hours.
He was subsequently stabilized with regiment of metoprolol and diltiazem which have been carefully titrated to 37.5 mg TID and 90 mg QID respectively.
*)Infectious Disease: Mr. [**Known lastname 90711**] was started on treatment for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was initially on vancomycin, tobramycin, and cefepime per VAP protocol but was then taken off the tobra given the negative cultures.
However, due to the continued fevers, we decided to treat for a total 10 day course with vancomycin and cefepime which will be completed on [**2163-10-20**].
*)ENDO: Diabetes medications were held and patient was placed on insulin sliding scale for better control of blood sugars per stroke protocol.
He was restarted on his metformin, and was also continued on insulin.
All his lipid modifying agents were held out of concern for worsening hemorrhagic process.
*) ABDOMEN: Patient suffered a pneumoperitoneum, thought to be secondary to placement of PEG tube.
The patient did not suffer from belly tenderness of peritoneal signs following the noticed pneumoperitoneum, and it has since resolved on repeat x-rays.
Of note, he developed aspiration pneumonia while in the hospital, requiring his placement on an antibiotic regiment.
On day of discharge, his INR was 2.0 on the aspirin bridge to Coumadin.
We have continued him on both aspirin and Coumadin and his INR will need to be rechecked, the aspirin can be discontinued once his INR is stable between [**2-24**].
