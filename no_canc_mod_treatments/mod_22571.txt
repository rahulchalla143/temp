Admission Date:  [**2165-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-11-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-7-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain - tx to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 4298**] with STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization - no intervention on totally occluded RCA.
History of Present Illness: HPI: 34 yo M no PMH but a family hx of lupus anticoagulant (mother and sister) was in usual state of health until 4d PTA when he began to feel nausea in the evening.
He was given a dose of enoxaparin and tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for PTCA.
Some small amt of blood flow was restored with a balloon, but no further intervention was successful.
Past Medical History: PMH: None PSH: kneecap reconstruction x 2 at age 5, arthroplasty 10 yrs ago (3day hospital stay - does not recall heparin sq)   Social History: FH: mother - lupus with [**Hospital1 62555**] sister - [**Name (NI) 62555**] without lupus No history of early MI/early death ..... SH: etoh socially [**1-28**] drinks/wk, non-smoker, no current illicits.
Pertinent Results: Labs at OSH prior to transfer: CK 655 .
Treatment of totally occluded proximal RCA using balloon inflations, Export catheter clot removal, and intracoronary administration of medications as well as systemic enoxaparin and eptifibatide.
Clot was noted on the wire and the balloon despite administration of enoxaparin and eptifibatide.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW:  34 yo M no cardiac risk factors with fam hx of anti-cardiolipin and distant cocaine hx presented with STEMI and 100% RCA occlusion that could not be opened on PTCA - per cath lab, suction cath was used to remove large amounts of fresh blood clot.
Heparin drip was continued for anticoagulation given the question of hypercoaguability as the cause of the patient's MI.
Heme service was consulted and recommended a limited hypercoagulable workup given his arterial clotting.
Prior to discharge, the patient was started on coumadin and lovenox as a bridge.
In addition, he was started on amiodarone therapy after a baseline PA/Lateral CXR, TFT's, and LFT's were obtained as baseline.
The goal of amiodarone therapy was for short term rhythm control (2-3 months) to be followed by EP study with likely pulmonary vein isolation.
A suction catheter returned large amounts of fresh clot.
The wire was covered with blood clot when removed from the fem line after the procedure.
Thereafter, the flow was minimally reestablished and the pt was managed medically with asa, BB, acei, plavix, and heparin.
Amiodarone was started Chem 7 was monitored closely for rising creatinine or potassium given the initiation of an ace inhibitor.
The patient remained on heparin until the patient was started on lovenox and coumadin prior to discharge from the hospital.
The patient was receiving metoprolol for cardioprotection post-MI.
The patient was also receiving anticoagulation therapy for presumed hypercoaguabiltiy - see below.
He was started on amiodarone therapy with the goal of a short course of therapy until and EP study could be done.
The patient was thought to be a likely candidate for pulmonary vein isolation to erradicate his arrhythmia.
He was scheduled for MR and [**Hospital1 **] in addition to the KOH monitor to prepare for this possibility.
## Hypercoaguability - There is a history of anticardiolipin in the patient's family.
Intervention in the cath lab was unsuccessful.
The patient was tested for lupus anticoagulant and [**Doctor First Name **] and was negative.
Included in these labs were anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM), anti-platelet factor 4, homocysteine and factor V Leiden.
The patient was maintained on heparin and changed to lovenox prior to discharge.
Warfarin was also started prior to discharge with the plan to anticoagulate pending return of the hypercoaguability labs.
Coumadin was to be managed through Dr.[**Name (NI) 8261**] office.
It was planned that he would remain on lovenox until he reached therapeutic levels of coumadin (INR 3-3.5 given hypercoaguable state).
If the hypercoag w/u was negative, coumadin therapy might not be necessary long-term (his lone afib was planned for ablation, and might be managed with chronic ASA therapy in this young man if ablation were not to be successful).
Many of these decisions will require detailed follow-up as an outpatient with hematology and cardiology.
