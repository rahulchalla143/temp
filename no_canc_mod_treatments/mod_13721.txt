Admission Date:  [**2112-6-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-7-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-3-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 66 year old female who presented with light-headedness, dizziness, hematemesis, to an outside hospital on [**2112-6-6**], and was found to have a hematocrit of 15.0 and workup was consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient was transfused a total of sixteen units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma at the outside hospital.
At the outside hospital, the patient continued to bleed actively with falling hematocrit and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy two more times.
On [**2112-6-7**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a spurting visible vessel in the distal esophagus and 9cc of Epinephrine were injected.
At the outside hospital, the patient was intubated for airway protection as she was noted to have hematemesis with likely aspiration.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2112-6-11**], for further management of her upper gastrointestinal bleed and respiratory status.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient is an obese woman, intubated and sedated.
The oropharynx is with endotracheal tube in place.
Chest x-ray showed the endotracheal tube in proper position, patchy alveolar opacity in the right lung, opacity with air bronchograms in the left retrocardiac region, differential diagnosis multifocal aspiration, pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema.
The patient did not require a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and she remained guaiac negative with no signs or symptoms of active bleed.
The patient did receive one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2112-6-22**], for a slowly decreasing hematocrit to 27.0 over several days.
Her hematocrit responded appropriately to this one unit of packed red blood cells and she did not require further transfusions.
The patient was maintained on proton pump inhibitor throughout her hospital stay.
Respiratory distress - The patient was transferred here intubated and sedated.
The patient was difficult to wean from the ventilator likely due to a combination of bilateral atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
Likely, it was a side effect of being intubated on the ventilator as well as due to underlying chronic lung disease.
A chest tube was placed on the right with good results.
The patient's bilateral pleural effusions were decreased with diuresis as well as on the right side with the placement of the chest tube.
The patient was started on Ceftriaxone on [**2112-6-17**], for her left lower lobe consolidation as well as spiking fever.
The patient briefly required CPAP via face mask as she clinically was requiring great effort for breathing.
The patient was started on Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers q4hours, standing dose.
On [**2112-6-22**], the patient was switched from Ceftriaxone after five days to Ceftazidime and Vancomycin for increased white blood cell count and fever to 102 degrees with continued left lower lobe consolidation.
These antibiotics were chosen to cover broadly for pneumonia pathogens including pseudomonas as well as hospital line infection from her central line.
The patient was restarted on Lasix p.r.n.
The patient responded very well to diuresis and pulmonary edema decreased significantly.
The patient's Lasix dose was decreased on [**2112-6-28**].
With good diuresis as well as treatment of the pneumonias and pneumothorax, the patient was weaned slowly on oxygen from nonrebreather face mask after extubation to nasal cannula by [**2112-6-28**].
On [**2112-6-27**], Vancomycin and Ceftazidime were discontinued as the patient had received six days of these antibiotics as well as five days of Ceftriaxone and was clinically stable with no signs or symptoms of infection.
The same day the patient's arterial line and central line were removed.
After extubation and weaning of sedation, the patient remained responsive but clearly confused and disoriented.
Psychiatry was consulted and the patient was started on Haldol 4 mg and then increased to 6 mg q.h.s.
The patient also responded well to Haldol p.r.n.
The patient also received Ativan 2 mg once for agitation with good effect.
Cardiovascular - The patient with no known cardiac history but with pulmonary edema which contributed to difficulty to wean from ventilator as well as from oxygen after extubation.
The patient was started on Nitroglycerin drip on [**2112-6-21**], which was discontinued on [**2112-6-26**].
The patient was also started on a Diltiazem drip and then switched to an Esmolol drip after the Diltiazem did not affectively control the patient's heart rate.
The Nitroglycerin and Esmolol drips effectively controlled the patient's heart rate and blood pressure but they remained labile.
Possibly contributing to this were her frequent nebulizer treatments with Albuterol.
Another important factor contributing to the patient's systolic blood pressure and heart rate elevation was anxiety and agitation as mentioned above.
The patient was started on Metoprolol three times a day via her nasogastric tube with good effect and both the Nitroglycerin and Esmolol drips were tapered to off.
Currently, her heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled on Metoprolol 100 mg three times a day.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was provided nutrition via nasogastric tube and tube feeds were as per nutrition consultation recommendations.
They recommended a gastric feeding tube.
That day the patient's daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and consented for this procedure on the patient's behalf.
Gastroenterology was [**Name (NI) 653**] and planned gastric feeding tube placement on [**2112-7-1**], or [**2112-7-4**].
The patient's potassium and magnesium were repleted as needed throughout her hospital stay.
Prophylaxis - The patient was started on subcutaneous Heparin on [**2112-6-17**], after hematocrit continued to be stable and gastroenterology consultation agreed.
The patient was also maintained on proton pump inhibitor throughout her hospital stay.
Access - The patient had a left subclavian central line which was eventually removed on [**2112-6-27**], as the patient no longer needed to receive medications via the line.
DISPOSITION:  The patient was screened for rehabilitation facility and approved awaiting a bed.
