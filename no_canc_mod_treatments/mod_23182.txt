He was intubated and sedated on arrival, and family was not initially at the bedside to obtain history regarding last known well time or precipitating events.
En route to OSH, he reportedly had [**1-11**] minute convulsive seizure of which further details are unknown, and for which he was given valium 5 mg with cessation of seizure.
Upon arrival to the OSH, he was intubated and received ceftriaxone, ativan, versed and paralytics; head CT was obtained and was reported as "bilateral occipital strokes."
He was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] and arrived after 10PM for further management.
En route he received an additional 4mg of IV ativan.
He was seen briefly off of propofol and did not respond to stimuli.

Endotracheal tube 2.7 cm above the carina.
NG tube with side port near the expected location of the GE junction.
Recommend advancement to ensure placement of the side port within the stomach.
A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
Local anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.
The sheath was attached to continuous heparinized saline flush.
Using a 4-French Berenstein II catheter and a 0.035-inch Glidewire, the left vertebral artery was selected.
The Berenstein catheter was removed and a 6-French Envoy guiding catheter was used to select the left vertebral artery with the aid of the Glidewire.
Total of 7 mg was administered into the basilar artery and left posterior cerebral artery.
The catheter was then repositioned into the right posterior cerebral artery and 4 mg of TPA was administered in divided doses of 1 mg each.
After pharmacologic thrombolysis was performed, mechanical thrombolysis was performed using the 0.014-inch guidewire.
Angiography was repeated through the microcatheter in the basilar artery.
All catheters and wires were removed.
Based on the findings of this post-procedure angiogram and discussion with the Neurology and Neurosurgical Services and review of the preprocedure MRI, it was decided that further transcatheter therapy was not indicated and thus the procedure was stopped.
IMPRESSION: Complete occlusion of the mid basilar artery extending to the basilar tip was treated with a combination of pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis (a total of 19 mg of TPA was utilized).
FINDINGS: Today's examination demonstrates decompressed lateral ventricles due to a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter.
He underwent placement of a ventricular drain for obstructing hydrocephalus by the neurosurgical team.
Stat head CT performed just following the procedure showed extravasation of contrast/blood, subarachnoid blood around brainstem into 4th ventricle, and swelling of posterior fossa.
Following the procedure, exam off propofol and paralytics showed absent brainstem reflexes with pupils 5-6 mm and unreactive, no corneals, no gag, no nasal tickle, could not assess OCR because hard collar in place; there was trace tripleflexion versus withdrawal to nox stim in lower extremities, absent movement to noxious stimulation in the upper extremities, trace DTRs and mute toes.
At 1600 on [**2-26**], the patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypotension requiring epinephrine, atropine and neosynephrine gtt.
The following morning, off all sedating medications, the patient's exam remained unchanged with regards to absent brainstem reflexes, trace DTRs, with occasional trace tripleflexion of the lower extremitites to nailbed pressure.
He was continued on the ventillator for harvest of organs in the OR, until time of apnea and asystole following organ harvest.
