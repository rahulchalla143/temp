male with dm, htn, dyslipidemia, djd, atrial fibrillation who was admitted for total knee replacement surgery which he underwent on [**2167-4-7**].
His post op course was c/b hypotension for which he was placed on neosynepherine gtt.
He was weaned off with fluid boluses and was transfused 1 U prbcs.
He was given 150 mg IV amiodarone along with 100 mg po amidarone- his home dose.
His atrial fibrillation remained poorly controlled and thus he was transferred to medicine for further management.
Tip of the right central venous line projects over the SVC.
M with DM, HTN, Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter s/p L TKR whose post op course was complicated by hypotension requring neo, low grade fevers, cough and atrial fibrillation with rapid response.
He was therefore treated symptomatically for his Atrial fibrillation and was also diursed aggressively with lasix to remove the source of stimulation.
He was loaded on Amiodarone IV but also required additional nodal agents including beta blockers and a diltiazem drip for adequate control of his rate.
He was subsequently weaned off diltiazem and the amiodarone was decreased to a maintenance dose and he converted to NSR.
In addition, he was also started on coumadin anticoagulation as well for dual benefit of Atrial fibrillation and TKR ppx.
At time of discharge, his medication regimen for Atrial fibrillation consisted of Amiodarone 200mg once daily as well as metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and coumadin 3mg QHS.
ACEI was continued but at a reduced dose for additional CAD benefit.
Ischemia: Although unlikely, ischemia could not be ruled out as a cause of rapid ventricular response.
He was continued on ASA, the lisinopril dose was decreased as above (from 40 to 2.5mg) to allow for more room for rate control.
The statin dose was increased based on lipid panel obtained during the admission.
The pt was discharged on simvastatin 40mg QHS.
The pt was rate controlled as above and also was started on afterload reduction with ACEI and he was diuresed with lasix IV.
He was given 40mg IV lasix with good response.
He should have daily weight and strict ins and outs measured to verify appropriate diuresis (with goal of neg 500cc/day) without compromise of kidney function as verified by routine labs (chem7) drawn atleast twice a week.
He should be on weightbearing as tolerated on the left leg.
He should continue the keflex for two weeks post discharge, this should subsequently be followed up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpt after the appointment.
Another consideration was also CHF from massive fluid resuscitation during TICU stay post op.
The CHF was treated as above, while his COPD was managed with the addition of flovent and standing nebulizer treatments of atrovent and albuterol.
He was only maintained on post op Cephlexin as per orthopaedic service.
DM: The pt was admitted on oral hypoglycemics, however given the multitude of complications, the pt was taken off his oral hypoglycemics and started on lantus 10units QHS.
Infection was ruled out as above.
Pain: The pt was continued on oxycodone and acetominophen rtc as per ortho for pain.
Prophylaxis: The pt was initially given IV heparin but was transitioned to coumadin as above, PPI was contineud for GI ppx and he was continued on a bowel regimen.
