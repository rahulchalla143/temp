SBPs tolerating blood loss (in 100s-110s); HR around 100.
Has gotten a lot of volume (4 PRBCs, 2 FFP, 4L NS), has not needed vent thus far but may need this evening.
Surgery and IR also consulted for management of large LGIB, presumably diverticulosis related.
Also recieved zosyn for +UA.

Admission for BRBPR with hypotension and respiratory failure, likely diverticular bleed, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
Patient was hypotensive intitially, responded well to IVF, but then was placed on dopamine overnight of admission for BP support.
IR was following patient and felt that no further intervention was needed given stable HCT since angio.
Warfarin was held during hospital course.
Patient was on dopamine for three days after bleed but was weaned off of dopamine on HD3 without complications or need for reinitiation of dopamine.
Echo determined to be related to overall fluid positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood products given for GI bleed.
Pt is currently only on Lasix 20 mg IV bid.
She was on lisinopril 20 mg daily and diltizaem SR 120 mg daily prior to admission.
Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA, CHF exacerbation related to fluid recuscitation for GI bleed.
Patient on admission requiring placement on ventilator for respiratory support.
CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly collapse.
The patients AM CXR continued to improve daily as she was weaned off pressors, continued on albuterol/ipratropium and decreased on her overall fluid intake.
On HD 3 she was weaned off vent to trach collar successfully without further ventilator support requirements.
She is currently volume overloaded and being diuresed wtih Lasix 20 mg IV BID.
Once euvolemic, Lasix dose may be titrated down to maintenance dose.
Due to hypotension requiring dopamine during hospital course, patient was held on her home lasix and lisinopril.
New echo findings felt to be due to elements of volume overload from fluids given during inpatient stay.
She is currently volume overloaded and being diuresed wtih Lasix 20 mg IV BID.
Once euvolemic, Lasix dose may be titrated down to maintenance dose.
Given high risk of bleeding, decision made not to restart warfarin anticoagulation while in the hospital.
Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistant organisms.
She was started empirically on zosyn on admission given exposures.
She was switched from zosyn to cipro on [**4-4**] after sensitivities back.
# Diabetes-  Seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%.
Patient started back on lasix on HD 4.

During your hospital course, you needed a ventilator connected to your tracheostomy for respiratory support and required medications for blood pressure support.
You were able to be weaned to your baseline respiratory status and baseline blood pressures.
You will need to discuss with your primary doctors when and if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] should ever be restarted on your coumadin because you have a very high risk of bleeding again and another bleed could be life threatening.
