She was started on Levo/Flagyl for suspected diverticulits on [**8-3**] at rehab.
Past Medical History: 1)	Hypertension 2)	s/p DVT in left upper extremity ([**2150**]), on warfarin   since then 3)	PNM in [**2-/2153**] (treated with 5 days azithromycin) 4)	Bladder carcinoma (diagnosed [**2152-10-9**]), s/p TURBT [**2152-11-3**], chemo and XRT at [**Hospital1 2025**] (last treatment 4 months ago) 5)	s/p thyrodectomy?
Brief Hospital Course: 1) leukocytosis/UTI/?colitis: The patient was admitted to internal medicine for evaluation and treatment of her UTI and her ?colitis seen on her CT abdomen.
The patient was evaluated by the surgical service, who was concerned that the inflammation around the colon could be infectious, and recommended antibiotic coverage to include diverticulitis and c. diff colitis.
The patient was initially treated with Vanco/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl, and saw little improvement in her symptoms.
Her urine culture from [**8-7**] then came back growing Pseudomonas Aeruginosa sensitive to ceftazidime as well as enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
She was continued on flagyl as well for concern for intraabdominal process.
MICU TRANSFER: On the morning of [**8-16**], the patient was noted to have a WBC jump from 24 to 30, with low systolic pressure down to 80s-90s, as well as hypoxia at 88% on 3L (increased from her baseline of 2L), necessitating NRB.
She was started on levophed and wide open fluids and transferred to the MICU.
She was placed on BiPap 10/5 with 80% FiO2, but ABG was 7.3/34/112 - A-a gradient 275.
Her antibiotics were broadened to include tobramycin and caspofungin per ID recommendations.
Surgery was following, however felt the patient was too unstable to be taken to the OR for laparotomy given her pressor requirement.
In this setting, her HR and BP continued to trend down, and attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this setting were deemed futile.
2) CHF: Per report, the patient had been treated with Lasix 80mg PO daily until recently, when her low blood pressures became prohibitive.
The patient had bibasilar crackles in the ED, and was given Lasix 40mg IV x1 with good urine output response.
However, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and required 250cc boluses x3 with improvement to BPs of 90s over palp.
