CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-10-18**] 11:49 AM CHEST: Tracheostomy tube is present.
The tip of the Dobhoff tube lies within the second part of the duodenum.
The patient was started on steroids and admitted to the Trauma ICU.
In the OR he was a difficult intubation because of his prior C4-6 surgery.
He was started on levofloxacin for what appeared to be an evolving pneumonia; vancomycin was added when his clincal status did not immediately improve, and then he was switched to a combination of vancomycin, flagyl and zosyn.
Given his pulmonary status, DTs, and concern for difficulty with reintubation because of the halo, he underwent a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy on [**10-11**] with no complications.
He remained afebrile during the last 5 days of his stay while still on Zosyn and Vancomycin, and his blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
After a discussion with the ID fellow, he was discharged on Zosyn and Vancomycin with plans to complete a full 14-day course.
