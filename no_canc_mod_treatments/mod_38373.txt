He was initially treated with mannitol and an emergent ventriculostomy briefly, then he was taken to the OR for emegent hemicraniectomy.
Post-operatively, he was managed in the Neuro ICU with his primary issues being hypertension, respiratory difficulty, infection, and persistent depressed LOC.
[] Hypertension - In order to manage his hemorrhage, the patient was placed on several oral antihypertensives but he had poor response to most of them except clonidine.
His NG clonidine however resulted in periodic drops in his BP below the desired range (SBP 100-160), so he was switched to a clonidine patch.
He intermittently required a nicardipine infusion for further control.
He was eventually started on Lisinopril 40 and HCTZ 25 (he did not respond well to hydralizine NG or amlodipine NG for which he was on high doses).
His most recent BP regimen is listed below in his discharge medications.
[] Ventilator-associated pneumonia, Tracheostomy, Stridor - He was intubated perioperatively for respiratory support but twice [**Last Name (un) 92523**] extubation with excessive stridor and respiratory distress.
He eventually was transitioned to a tracheostomy and his respiratory requirements were downgraded to supplemental O2 by trach mask only.
?He twice required broad-spectrum IV antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for Streptococcus pneumonia/H.
[] Gastrostomy, Pneumoperitoneum - He underwent gastrostomy placement but the next day had abdominal discomfort with a finding of free air under his diaphragm.
He subseuqently tolerated tube feeds and medications via GT.
HE HAS BEEN TOLERATING REPLETE TUBE FEEDS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY ON DISCHARGE.
However, the recommendation at this time from ID (who discussed this case with his outpatient ID physician) was that HAART therapy was not indicated at this time.

He was found to have a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in his left basal ganglia which ultimately required the placement of an endoventricular drain and a hemicraniectomy.
His ICU course was complicated by the development of difficult weaning from the ventilator (requiring a tracheostomy), percutaneous gastrostomy to deliver nutrition and medications as well as two rounds of antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.
