This is a 42-year-old white male who presented to an outside hospital on [**2118-6-15**] for an elective catheterization for his severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
He was seen by his primary care physician about five days prior to his admission at which time he was started on atenolol for a newly-diagnosed hypertension.
Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2118-6-15**] which revealed 50 percent left main coronary artery stenosis, 100 percent mid left anterior descending stenosis, 70 percent mid left circumflex artery stenosis and a 99 percent OM stenosis with a 100 percent totally occluded right coronary artery.
The patient was subsequently referred for coronary artery bypass grafting which he underwent [**2118-6-16**].
The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times three with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81 minutes.
Total cross clamp time was 48 minutes.
The patient was discharged from the Operating Room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Propofol in stable condition.
The patient was extubated the same day as surgery without complications and the patient was placed on an alcohol drip due to his history of alcohol abuse prior to surgery.
The patient was taken off his intravenous drip of alcohol with no evidence of alcohol withdrawal noted.
His Foley catheter and chest tubes were removed postoperative day two.
He continued to void well now requiring doses of Percocet for pain, however reportedly comfortable.
