Admission Date: [**2121-6-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2121-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-7-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent ([**10-29**]), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, status post recent axillobifemoral bypass graft on [**2121-5-6**] who is transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] with fever and arrhythmia.
The patient underwent a recent bypass surgery for blue toe syndrome and course was complicated by a polymicrobial groin site infection, which included methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which the patient was treated with one week of Vancomycin and two weeks of po Linezolid.
Her course is also complicated by complete heart block necessitating the placement of a DDD pacemaker, which was placed on the [**11-12**].
She was initially started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone on the [**11-10**].
In addition, the patient was noted to have a rapid irregular heart rhythm that was thought to be rapid atrial fibrillation and was loaded with intravenous Amiodarone.
The [**Hospital 228**] [**Hospital3 **] course is also notable for a 2 unit packed red blood cell transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 in the setting of guaiac positive stools and an INR of greater then 8.0.  REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Fatigue, malaise, chest pain centered around the pacemaker insertion as well as dyspnea on exertion, stable three pillow orthopnea and stable lower extremity edema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery cypher stent on [**10/2120**] (one vessel disease).
Peripheral vascular disease status post axillobifemoral bypass graft [**2121-5-6**].
As mentioned the patient is status post DDD pacemaker placement on the [**2121-5-12**] for complete heart block.
Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenously q day.
Aspirin 81.
Lopressor 5 intravenously q 6.
Vancomycin q 48 hours.
The patient was continued on intravenous Vancomycin    on a renally dosed basis.
Given the discomfort around her    pacemaker site as well as fluctuance at the pacemaker    site, as well as her frequent arrhythmia the    Electrophysiology Service was consulted.
Pocket was extensively    irrigated with antibiotic solution (Gentamycin and    Vancomycin) and was debrided of necrotic appearing tissue.
A Penrose drain was placed in the wound and the tissue was    approximated, but not closed.
Given the history of groin infection that included involvement with MRSA shortly after the axillobifemoral graft was placed as well as the high grade MRSA bacteremia, the patient was taken for MR of the torso to ascertain whether the axillobifemoral graft might be infected.
The patient's    Amiodarone was discontinued and the patient was maintained    on telemetry in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
After pauses caused by the    blocked APCs she was noted to have inappropriate QT    prolongation of up to over 600 milliseconds and on several    occasions underwent a Torsad like nonsustained ventricular    tachycardia of up to five beats.
The patient's potassium and magnesium    were aggressively repleated with a goal potassium greater    then 4.5 and a goal magnesium greater then 2.5.
The patient was    maintained on beta blocker and the dose of beta blocker    was titrated upwards to help prevent phase three blocking.
Out of concern for reinfection of even a temporary    pacemaker wire the patient was maintained on telemetry    without reinsertion of pacing wire and remained    hemodynamically stable even during the short burst of    torsad like nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient was maintained on    aspirin, ace inhibitor and Lipitor.
Right sided visual loss:  The patient complained of    partial right sided visual defect several days into the    hospital course.
The defects are further concerning as the    patient is maintained on anticoagulation for her bypass    graft and had an elevated INR of greater then 8 prior to    admission.
The patient's visual examination was noted to be    stable on subsequent serial examinations.
The patient does,    however, have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease    as well as Barrett's esophagus and was maintained on an H2    blocker rather then Protonix or Nexium.
However, her creatinine subsequently improved serially to    a level of 0.9 on the [**5-15**].
