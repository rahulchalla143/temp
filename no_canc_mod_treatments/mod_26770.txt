Small-to-moderate moderate-sized right hemopneumothorax with numerous rib fractures, as above.
Four contiguous ribs are fractured in two places, on the right,as above raising the possibility of flail chest.
Fracture in the left scapula probably corresponds to an old fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: As soon as the preliminary CT findings were obtained, interventional radiology and Ortho were notified of the patient's condition and admission.
A Foley catheter was placed and the patient was taken to the TSICU.
However, the epidural caused some hypotension that responded to fluid boluses.
She was transfused 2 units of blood and a stat CXR was obtained to evaluate for worsening of her hemopneumothorax.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU in stable condition.
She was eventually weaned and extubated from the respirator on [**2112-3-12**] and was able to oxygenate effectively.
She used her incentive spirometer effectively and her epidural catheter was removed in preparation for her transfer to the Trauma floor.
She was able to tolerate a regular diet and her pain was adequately controlled with short and long acting oxycodone and scheduled Tylenol.
She was treated for 3 days with Toradol which was effective but due to her need for prophylactic Lovenox for 4 weeks and her pre op daily aspirin, the Toradol was stopped.
After stopping Toradol her pelvic pain increased and her Oxycontin was increased to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She will continue breakthru oxycodone as needed.
Incentive spirometry and out of bed as much as possible has been encouraged.
Her DVT prophylaxix is with Lovenox 40 mg daily for 30 days post op.
Of note, Ms [**Known lastname 23486**] was started on low dose Lopressor on [**2112-3-15**] due to tachycardia which has been present since admission.
Despite fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions and pain control her heart rate persists around 100-110.
Hopefully as the acute phase passes she will normalize and not need beta blockers.
