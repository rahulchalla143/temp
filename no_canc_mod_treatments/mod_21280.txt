There is a large thrombus extending from the distal right common carotid into the proximal right internal carotid and external carotid arteries, with 99% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, better demonstrated on the CTA, and complete occlusion of the proximal external carotid artery (with reconstitution via retrograde filling).

The patient had a CTA head and neck here which revealed recanalization of the R MCA with cutoff seen at R M2 superior division and evidence  of thrombus at the R CCA occluding 99%, extending to R ECA and R ICA with recanalization distally.
The patient was briefly placed on a heparin drip despite this due to concern for the right carotid occlusion.
