Admission Date:  [**2159-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-5-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Thrombosed right internal jugular vein with need for total parenteral alimentation for internal jugular vein thrombolysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 25 year old female with a complex past medical history with short gut syndrome requiring chronic venous access for total parenteral alimentation and subsequent numerous line infections.
The patient had a temprary left femoral line placed in early [**Month (only) 958**] through which she gets intravenous fluids and total parenteral nutrition.
She had cleared an infection and had negatove cultures after antibiotic therapy.
The decision was made to change to a right internal jugular line and discontinue the patient's old left femoral line secondary to increased risk of infection.
In the past the patient has had numerous line infections with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Serratia, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and it was thought that keeping a left femoral line in place would increase the risk of infection greatly.
Over the last few days the patient admits to increased fatigue and somnolence and lowgrade temperatures, but denies high fevers, rigors, purulence, erythema, or tenderness to the left femoral site.
The patient was taken by Interventional Radiology this morning to get a right internal jugular line placed but it was noted that the internal jugular vein was occluded.
Interventional Radiology performed a high right internal jugular stick and started TPA infusion with the hope of lysing the thrombus and a re-attempt of placing a working right internal jugular on [**2159-5-9**] and subsequent removal of the patient's indwelling left femoral line.
Gastrointestinal dysmotility beginning at age 13, diagnosed with gastrointestinal motility study, status post colectomy status post secondary to gastrointestinal vasculitis which has resulted in short cut syndrome and the need for chronic total parenteral nutrition.
Status post gastrostomy tube, placed for gastric decompression.
Bladder atony with chronic suprapubic catheter.
Chronic pain syndrome in the lower half of the body maintained on chronic Dilaudid PCA at home with large doses of Benadryl.
Recurrent line infections, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Serratia, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis on the past secondary to line infections.
Chronic venous access managed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at Interventional Radiology, status post multiple central line placements and status post numerous recannulation attempts, most recent the patient had a femoral line placed on [**2159-4-3**].
Dilaudid PCA 4 mg/hr basal with 1.5 mg bolus q.
15 minutes, maximum 15 mg q. hour; 2.
Famotidine 40 mg b.i.d; 3.
Reglan 10 mg intravenously q.
Zofran 10 mg intravenously five times a day; 5.
Benadryl 100 mg q.
Ativan 3 mg intravenous push q.
Vitamin K 10 mg q. Monday; 8.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
Estraderm patch 0.1 mg Monday and Thursday; 11.
Epogen 5000 units subcutaneously Tuesday and Thursday; 13.
Paxil suppositories 10 mg per rectum t.i.d.
Neosporin irrigation 650 cc, suprapubic catheter.
Suprapubic catheter in place.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies upon admission, revealed white blood cell count 3.6, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 136, PT 13.8, PTT 40.6, INR 1.2, fibrinogen 322, sodium 139, potassium 3.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 7, creatinine 0.5, glucose 97, calcium 8.7, phosphorus 4.6, magnesium 1.7.
The morning of [**5-9**], the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology where they found that the thrombus was only minimally lysed and it was decided to give the patient a further day of total parenteral alimentation.
On [**5-10**], the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology once again.
The left femoral line was changed over a wire without difficulty.
Upon inspection of the right internal jugular vein it was noticed that the internal jugular vein was still occluded and was completely collapsed and there would be no hope of placing a functional right internal jugular line in the patient at this time.
The plan at that time was to bring the patient back in two to three weeks at which time they would try once again to obtain more stable and a cleaner site for central venous access for the patient's total parenteral nutrition and numerous intravenous medications.
The patient would be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Interventional Radiology in two to three weeks for reattempt at placement of another central line.
