HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 16 year old female with a history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung transplants in [**2108-9-11**], who was admitted on [**2110-12-12**], following a rigid bronchoscopy with dilation and Mitomycin application to reduce swelling and scar tissue in the left main stem bronchus.
Shortly after application of Mitomycin, the patient developed a stridor and was treated with Albuterol and racemic epinephrine treatment before transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit for observation.
While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient acutely desaturated with a pulse oximetry of 60%, was given a nebulizer treatment, non-rebreather mask and failed to improve with hypoxia in a range of pAO2 of 44.
The patient was on CPAP with a pressure support of 8 and PEEP of about 10 and FIO2 of 100, and her oxygen saturations improved to the 90s.
Initially, this was thought to be an allergic reaction to Mitomycin and was treated with intravenous steroids, Benadryl and Pepcid.
For the next 36 hours in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient could not be weaned off oxygen and would acutely desaturation if the FIO2 dropped below 90%.
The patient acutely desaturated with oxygen of 60s while on the vent prior to having the CT scan.
The patient was scheduled for a stent on Friday, [**2110-12-19**].

ALLERGIES:   Multiple, multiple allergies including Imipenem, Zosyn, Piperacillin, penicillin, Estrianam, Vancomycin, .............and tobramycin.
Prograf 7 mg p.o.
Prednisone 5 mg p.o.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 16 year old white female with a history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung transplant now status post stent placement in the left mainstem bronchus with a right middle lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia, awaiting transfer back to the [**Hospital3 18242**].
PULMONARY:  The patient is now status post stent placement with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s on two liters.
Currently, the patient is continued on her immunosuppressants including mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus and she is on a Prednisone taper.
It should be noted that prior to the stent placement, the patient's oxygen saturations continued to decline.
The patient was instructed to lay on her right side to help with the ventilation perfusion match.
At the time of dictation, sputum Gram stain and culture were pending.
The patient was started on Clindamycin for questionable aspiration.
At the time of this dictation, the patient was to be started on tobramycin, Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin as well although these are pending to be started upon her transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
The patient takes her own Ultrase, pancreatic enzymes prior to meals and snacks.
Blood sugars have been completely out of control given that the patient's p.o.
The patient usually takes 32 units of NPH in the morning with 2 units of Humalog.
She is also covered with a Humalog insulin sliding scale.
The patient also with status post new lung status post transplant, so it would be less likely that it is a permanent pulmonary process as usually right ventricular strain would improve with improved lungs.
