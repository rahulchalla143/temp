Her symptoms tend to improved following removal of HD.
She was then immediately removed from HD and started on solumedrol.
She has not had a full session of HD in roughly 1 week.
She had a hematology consult done prior to transfer for hypereosinophilia; recommendations included solumedrol to supress Eos and consideration of BM bx if no improvement.
Due to concern for possible infectious process, sh was started emperically on daptomycin and meropenem on [**4-30**].
When questioned, the patient states that she has been on and off antibiotics since [**Month (only) **] for "bacteria in her blood."

Additionally, the patient was pre-medicated prior to dialysis with famotidine, singulair, hydroxyzine and IV solumedrol to prevent further reactions.
The patient underwent dialysis uneventfully five times with this regimen.
Her last two dialysis runs were executed with oral prendisone substitute for IV solumdrol.
Results from hyper eo work-up at the tiem of discharge: CXR normal, ESR WNL, ANCA negative, SPEP WNL, Strongy IgG Pending, Stool O+P negative, TCR re-arrangment pending, T-cell flow pending, cytogenetics pending  # ESRD: After her initial allergic reaction at [**Hospital3 **], she received two dialysis runs in the MICU here with the premedication regimen above.
These runs were uneventful, and she was transferred to the floor for dialysis under premedication.
The patient was stabilized with 10 mg of prednisone qd, and 6 U of NPH were added to her morning insulin regimen prior to prednisone treatment.
# HTN: The patient was found to be hypertensive throughout her hospitalization into the 190s, on one instance requiring a hydralazine push in the ICU.
Accordingly, her daily labetolol was uptitrated to 400 mg TID and she was started on amlodipine 10 mg QD.
With these medication changes, her blood pressure trended downwards.

During your hospitalization, we discovered you had elevated levels of blood cells commonly responsible for allergic types of reactions, called eosinophils.
We are now giving you a small dose of steroids every day to suppress these cells in order to make dialysis safe for you.
You will be taking steroids and a specific medication regimen prior to dialysis.
You should continue taking prednisone 10mg for 1 week with an end date of [**5-14**] ([**Date range (1) 94011**]).
Medication Changes: Continue Prednisone 10mg until [**5-14**], then take Prednisone 5mg for one week ([**Date range (1) 88555**]), then take Prednisone 5mg every other day for one week ([**Date range (1) 66820**]).
