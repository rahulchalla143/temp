EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Occasional bursts of right posterior quadrant [**2-23**] Hz delta frequency activity were seen.
ABNORMALITY #2: In the most electrographically awake-appearing portions of this tracing, a symmetric 7-7.5 Hz theta frequency background was seen.
The former abnormality may represent a focal area of subcortical disturbance, while the slow background is more consistent with a larger, subcortical, deep midline abnormality.
No frank epileptiform activity was seen during this  recording, but if the patient has frequent symptoms, continuous EEG recording with event monitoring and spike and seizure detection algorithms may provide additional diagnostic information  Portable NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage with small extraaxial component in the left occipital lobe is unchanged compared with prior exam, without significant mass effect.
NEURO: Amyloid angiopathy with new occipital hemorrhage - mannitol used initially for symptomatic improvement.
