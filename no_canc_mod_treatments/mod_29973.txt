During your stay, you were kept on heparin drip for your clot.
Prior to discharge, you received one dose of Lovenox injection (another form of heparin).
Given the abnormal heart rhythm and the repeated clotting, we recommend that you stay on coumadin to reduce the risk of further clots in the future.
We made the following changes in your medication list: Please HOLD Lasix Please HOLD Potassium supplement Please HOLD Aspirin Please START lovenox injection 60 mg every 12 hours until you are told to stop the injections, (when your coumadin level is appropriate) Please START Coumadin 5 mg daily at 4 pm Please START Diltiazem 15 mg twice daily (changed from Diltiazem 30 mg twice daily) .
