She was thought to be a very high risk for an elective repair several years ago and at that time the hernia did not appear to be the type that would have a high propensity towards incarceration.

She remained intubated until day 2 post-op.
She remained in the SICU for a total of 7 days, where treatment of pre-admission pneumonia was started with IV Zosyn.
She was continued on Zosyn after being transferred to the surgical floor.
Her white blood count improved and her antibiotics was switched to Levofloxacin.
It remained within normal limits until it up-trended when levofloxacin was removed.
Hence, levofloxacin was restarted.
She has remained NPO [and needs to remain NPO until at least seen in clinic].
She was discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation center with specific intructions for post-hospital care and follow-up.
