Admission Date:  [**2125-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-8-10**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old woman with history of CAD status post CABG in '[**15**] with peripheral vascular disease and inflammatory bowel disease causing chronic diarrhea who is presenting with hypotension and hypoxemia.
She was administered 4 liters of normal saline over several hours with increase in blood pressure to 105/50 and subsequently developed hypoxemia, orthopnea, and CHF by chest x-ray.
Patient was administered 10 mg of IV Lasix with rapid improvement in dyspnea and O2 saturations.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in '[**15**].
Chem-7 with a sodium of 128, potassium 4.4, chloride 87, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose 166, calcium 9.0, magnesium 1.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66-year-old woman with history of CAD status post MI, status post CABG with peripheral vascular disease and history of chronic diarrhea, who presents hypotensive and hypoxemic.
With this acute change in her ejection fraction with her mitral regurgitation and elevated troponins and history of coronary artery disease, patient was evaluated by Cardiology and eventually taken for a cardiac catheterization, where she had three stents placed from her saphenous vein graft to her LAD.
Patient tolerated the cardiac catheterization well.
Was started on 18 hours of an Integrilin drip, tolerated that well, and continued on aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker after catheterization.
Patient was diuresed gently initially in the MICU after being fluid resuscitated and patient was diuresed with Lasix to which she responded well and was continued on that daily.
Patient's hypoxemia could also be related to underlying COPD.
Patient's rate was controlled with metoprolol and patient's discomfort immediately improved.
She was initially also started on a Heparin drip, and then started on Coumadin after procedures were done.
Patient's rhythm remains stable, and patient was only continued on her beta blocker for her rhythm and Coumadin.
Patient will likely have to continue Coumadin initially for three weeks, but possibly life long which is because of increased risk of atrial fibrillation.
Patient was also noted after cardioversion and after cardiac catheterization to have episodes of NSVT going up to 12-13 beats.
These were all asymptomatic, however, the frequency of these episodes were concerning, and patient was evaluated by the Electrophysiology department and plans were made to return in one month's time to have an Electrophysiology study and likely placement of a defibrillator and AICD because of concerns for ischemic cardiomyopathy with NSVT.
Patient was agreeable to this and otherwise was not started on antiarrhythmics at this time.
Patient will be on the monitor after this placement and can be evaluated for number of episodes of NSVT, and then can have adjustments of her antiarrhythmic regimens.
Otherwise for patient's coronary artery disease, she was continued on beta blocker, transitioned to a Toprol XL regimen because of new CHF.
She was continued on he ACE inhibitor and titrated up for better blood pressure control and better cardiac growth.
Patient was also continued on an aspirin that she will continue for life and Plavix which she will continue for at least nine months, and Coumadin which she will continue indefinitely until determined otherwise.
These findings made ischemic colitis less likely and then patient was treated as a Crohn's colitis patient and started on IV steroids, continued on levo and Flagyl, which she is to complete for a 14 day course and steroids eventually switched to a p.o.
However, patient after stent placement could not tolerate MRI per Radiology because of concern of newly placed stents.
Eventually, the patient may require a cholecystectomy, but this will be continued to be followed closely.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Patient on oral agents at home.
However, with increased steroid regimen, patient was started on a NPH sliding scale regimen through the course of her stay for better blood sugar control especially in light of her ischemia.
Patient tolerated NPH sliding scale regimen very well, however, prior to discharge, the patient was transitioned to an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Nutrition:  Patient was on diabetic 2-gram sodium, low residue, low lactose diet for her diarrhea and otherwise was stable.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was continued on a proton-pump inhibitor, her Ambien and Coumadin which will be continued indefinitely with a goal INR of [**3-13**].
