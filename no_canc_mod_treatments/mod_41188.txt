Post laminectomy, patient had hypoxemia and was treated with nebs, antibiotics and with diuresis.
He was discharged to rehab without O2 requirement and on home dose of PO Lasix 40.
He was given IV ceftaz [**Hospital1 **].
Intubated for MRI and airway protection.
Nonetheless, emergent I&D was performed with 6 L washout of infected lumbar wound, wound cultures sent which later grew out MRSA, no CSF taken as dura was intact, and two lumbar drains placed and hemovac applied.
Antibiotics switched to vanc/zosyn (starting on [**11-26**] and [**11-27**] respectively) with improvement in WBC (27->20->12->normal on transfer to floor today).
Afebrile and subsequently narrowed down to vancomycin per ID given culture of GPC in pairs and clusters (likely MRSA) for a planned total course of antibiotics of 8 weeks (from day 1 [**2197-11-26**]).
PICC Line was placed on [**2197-11-29**].
He was diuresed with two doses of IV lasix 20mg and then switched to 40mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] for [**11-30**].
First troponin was negative.
Initially on Fentayl PCA for control of back pain and neck stiffness.
Past Medical History: - Diastolic Heart Failure with preserved EF - recently started on Lasix by his PCP.

He presented [**11-26**] with sepsis and neck pain and was found to have MRSA wound infection at laminectomy site and MRSA bacteremia requiring ICU admission and pressors.
Course complicated by decompensated [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], 30 beat run of V-tach in context of K+ of 3.2, anemia requiring transfusion of PRBCs, staph aureus pneumonia, bowel pseudoobstruction/ileus, PICC associated DVT, ATN.
Also s/p drainage of paraspinal MRSA-infected hematoma [**12-15**] and debridement of sacral ulcer first in OR on [**12-19**] and then at bedside on [**12-26**].
Washout of wound was performed on [**11-26**], dura was intact and wound cultures grew staph aureus sensitive to vanc and corynebacterium.
He currently has PICC and initially thought to need 8 week course of vancomycin starting from [**2197-11-26**].
JP drain was left in.
Decision was made with orthopedics to remove infected hardware and to definitively drain paraspinal abscess in OR on [**1-1**].
Will need 6 week course of vancomycin with start date of [**1-1**] (to finish [**2198-2-12**]).
# Intermittent fevers: The patient began spiking intermittent fevers up to 101.2 on [**12-4**] and his antibiotic regimen was broadened by adding cefepime and flagyl to his vancomycin.
The patient's sputum culture grew out coag + staph aureus, and he was treated for presumed MRSA pneumonia.
A urine culture came back positive for [**Month/Year (2) **] with 10k - 100k organisms / ml; however upon changing the foley the enterococcus bacterial count decreased to [**2185**] organisms/ml without treatment indicating bacterial colonization with [**Year (4 digits) **] and not true UTI.
Azithromycin was added to the patient's regimen per ID recs for possible COPD exacebration.
Last day of azithromycin was [**12-10**].
Last day of Cefepime was to be [**12-11**].
However, given new O2 requirement on [**12-20**] was started on another course of Cefepime ending on [**12-27**].
The patient is volume overloaded on exam and has [**Last Name (LF) 9215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was diuresed with good effect on respiratory status, although diuresis was limited by kidney function.
He was started on continuous albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers on [**12-6**], and a five day course of azithromycin starting on [**12-6**], which improved his breathing.
Underwent thoracentesis on [**12-18**] on the left side.
Concurrently began aggressive course of diuresis starting [**12-18**] with up to 160mg IV lasix daily.
He is currently on room air and not requiring IV lasix.
We placed him on standing lasix 20mg PO qd for peripheral edema.
# Pseudobstruction: Abdominal pain, distention, constipation and intermittent nausea developed after TSICU call-out.
A rectal tube was placed but did not relieve the pressure, or lead to increased passage of stool, and no change was seen on KUB.
GI recommended electrolyte repletion and serial rectal exams with stimulation to produce BMs.
# Anemia: Patient with gradual hemoglobin drop requiring transfusion of 7 units of PRBCs through course of hospitalization ([**12-5**], [**12-6**], [**12-9**], [**12-20**], [**12-31**] x2, [**1-4**]).
IV lasix used to remove fluid as tolerated by his kidneys.
Due to hypoxia from pleural effusions on [**12-18**] began aggressive course of diuresis starting [**12-18**] with up to 160mg IV lasix daily.
He is currently on room air and not requiring IV lasix.
We placed him on standing lasix 20mg PO qd for peripheral edema.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/ATN: Baseline creatinine 0.4-0.6.
Diuresis attempted, however his Cr increased from 1.1 to 1.3 and his BUN increased to 29.
Due to hypoxia from pleural effusions on [**12-18**] began aggressive course of diuresis starting [**12-18**] with up to 160mg IV lasix daily.
RUE ultrasound revealed a catheter-induced thrombus associated with the PICC line in his right brachial vein.
A new PICC line was placed in his left arm given necessity for continued antibiotic administration.
He was started on heparin gtt and his PTT on [**12-9**] was 73.3.
Warfarin 5mg started [**12-11**] but then discontinued due to need for OR interventions.
Subsequently maintained on heparin gtt.
RUE was rechecked after patient had been on anti-coagulation for one month, and showed interval clot resolution.
Decision made to stop anticoagulation at that time given patient's bleeding risk and lack of data to support continued anticoagulation for PICC related clot in brachial vein only.
# Back and Neck pain: Acute on chronic pain secondary to nerve compression due to spinal stenosis, multiple surgeries, and recent infection.
The patient was initially on a fentanyl PCA, but on the floor was weaned to oral oxycodone, acetaminophen and gabapentin 100 TID.
Increased amounts of opioids were avoided due to abdominal pain and ileus vs pseudobstruction.
# Enterococcus in urine: Patient found to have [**Last Name (un) **] in urine with 10k - 100k organisms / ml; however upon changing the foley the enterococcus bacterial count decreased to [**2185**] organisms/ml without treatment indicating bacterial colonization with [**Year (4 digits) **] and not true UTI.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # DMII:  Patient's home metformin was held and he was put on FSS and insulin sliding scale.
# HTN: Patient was continue on home amlodipine.
# BPH:  Patient was continued on home finasteride and tamsulosin with no issues on this admission.
Last day of vancomycin will be [**2198-2-12**].
# Titrate diuretic dose: patient started on furosemide 20mg daily on [**2198-1-9**].
Electing not to treat as no clinical signs of UTI and we believe this is chronic bladder colonization # Consider changing labetalol to cardioselective beta blocker such as metoprolol # If worsening abdominal pain and distension and patient not stooling, GI recommends: - Serial rectal exams with stimulation to produce BMs, patient should be rolled on left side for this - Electrolye repletion # Sacral ulcer, continue wound care as follows: Cleanse ulcer with wound cleanser set to "stream" pat dry, use cotton tip swab as needed to remove excess cleanser Prep periwound tissues with No Sting Barrier Wipe and miconazole powder fill ulcer with slightly moistened AMD Kerlix Cover with softsorb dressing Secure with Medipore H soft cloth tape and pink Hy tape to inferior edge change [**Hospital1 **] # Per ortho: TBSO when out of bed.
