Two plus distal pulses bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, the patient went to the operating room, where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to OM).
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and postoperatively was taken intubated to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit on standard medications.
She was started on amiodarone and beta blockade to help her rate control.
At this point, on the floor she remained hemodynamically stable, and telemetry demonstrated that she would have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no effect on hemodynamic status.
She was maintained on beta blockade, and the decision was made to anticoagulate her, due to her frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation followed by sinus rhythm.
She was started on heparin, and this was continued until her INR was therapeutic on her Coumadin.
