# COPD Exacerbation: Patient presented with hypoxia and shorntess of breath which required BiPap and an ICU admission.
He improved with BiPap and standing nebulizers and was transferred to the floors on 2L of oxygen.
He was placed on standing albuterol and ipratroium nebulizers q6h with a q2h PRN which he improved on.
He was also placed on prednisone 60mg daily.
Plan would be for a prednisone taper of 60mg for 1 day (End [**5-2**]), 40mg for 3 days ([**Date range (1) **]), 20mg for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 61537**]) and 10mg for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 61876**]).
He should conintue with albuterol nebs PRN and spiriva daily.
He was also placed on Levofloxacin as he was having dyspnea and increased sputum production.
He was started on an inuslin sliding scale and his sugars improved.
His insulin sliding scale will need to be titrated based on his sugars and prednisone taper.
# BPH: Patient had no symtoms during his admission therefore he was continued on terazosin.
# GERD: He was stable in his home regimen therefore was continued on omeprazole.
