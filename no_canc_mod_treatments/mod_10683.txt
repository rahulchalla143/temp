Using laryngoscope, EMS did not see anything in the oropharynx and started bagging the patient until arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
The patient remained unresponsive but agitated, not following commands, so she was intubated for airway protection w/ etomidate and succinate; the ED resident reports not seeing any food around the vocal cords etc.
The patient's initial ABG before intubation showed 7.26/36/175/17 with a lactate 5.7.
The patient was initially sedated with propofol but remained agitated, moving all four extremities and still not following commands although would turn her head to voice.
Two large bore IVs and NGT were placed and the patient volume resuscitated with 2L IVF.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and on sedating medications but following commands.
Respiratory Therapy trialed her on pressure support but RR ~6, too sedated from fentanyl boluses.
Daughter and son-in-law at bedside.
Denies any pain but endorses discomfort from ETT and strongly wishes to be extubated soon.
