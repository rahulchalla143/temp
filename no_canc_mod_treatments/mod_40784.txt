Admission Date:  [**2125-3-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-4-13**]   Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an unfortunate 88-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for cardiomyopathy and severe systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, and a history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter status post ablation who presented to the Medical Service on [**2125-3-28**] with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema three weeks after having a right knee operation at [**Hospital3 1196**] upon being discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility.
At this point, he was quite .....................  His grave prognosis was discussed in detail with the wife and multiple family members and the likelihood of having some ischemic or dead bowel within his abdominal cavity was very high and the family elected to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy for definitive diagnosis and therapy.
He underwent a subtotal colectomy with a Hartmann's procedure as well and an end-ileostomy and a gastrostomy tube placement.
The patient was extremely labile during the procedure requiring multiple pressors in order to keep his systolic blood pressure.
All this time he was unable to be weaned off the ventilator and progressively deteriorated requiring more and more ventilatory support, eventually developing a pneumonia.
During all this time he was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and his medical management was maximized while he was in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with collaboration of Cardiology as well as the Renal and ID Team.
Following Cardiology recommendations and in an effort to improve his hemodynamics, on postoperative day number two, the patient was started on milrinone in an effort to increase his cardiac performance.
Unfortunately, the patient developed a sustained V tach that resolved after a 43 beat run, ultimately requiring to be placed on an Amiodarone drip.
A family meeting was carried out with the family and once again the really poor prognosis as well as the critical condition was explained in detail to the family members but at that time decided to make the patient a DNR but continue full support medically.
He continued to require pressors in order to keep a minimal systolic blood pressure and his renal function was worsening by the day.
On the morning of this same postoperative day number five, he dropped his pressure to the 80s requiring the addition of a new pressor to keep him up around 50.
The family meeting was held in the presence of the residents of the surgical team, the attending, as well as the ICU staff and upon explaining once again the seriousness and the critical condition that he was at that time, the family decided to make him comfort measures only and not proceed with any further medical therapy.
Pressor support was withdrawn and he was kept on a Fentanyl drip, making sure that he was comfortable.
Shortly after these measures were undertaken, the patient underwent a cardiorespiratory arrest.
