The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the ER and subsequently admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management and treatment.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit rose to 30.
They recommended following serial hematocrits and should they fall he may need an angiogram with subsequent embolization.
He was transferred to the Trauma floor for further management.
Of note, he had a foley catheter placed 5 weeks ago as his son was having a difficult time caring for him with his urinary incontinence, especially with daily lasix.
He was initially on IV Kefzol and then switched to Keflex orally.
The catheter was removed on [**2160-10-22**] but bladder scanned after eight hours for 600 cc's.
The catheter was then replaced and another voiding trial should be done when he is more ambulatory.
His blood sugars were out of control on admission and his Lantus was resumed along with a tight sliding scale for coverage QID.
The Physical Therapy service was involved for a full evaluation and felt that rehab would benefit him over time as his mobility is compromised by his muscle weakness.
