4) Coronary artery calcification.
7) Adrenal lesions not well characterized on this study appear consistent with adenomas on prior studies.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 yo F with DM II, HTN, ESRD on HD, who presented with shortness of breath, found to have new onset atrial fibrillation, cardiac ascites, course complicated by persistent bleeding in the setting of attempted [**Numeric Identifier **] in preparation for cardioversion, requiring transfer to the MICU.
She also underwent abdominal ultrasound as well as paracentesis with 800cc of fluid removed, and ultimately it was thought that her ascites was c/w cardiac ascites.
She also had new onset atrial fibrillation, and patient was started on a heparin gtt with the plan for TEE and subsequent cardioversion.
However, after TEE was performed, she had not yet been dialyzed and it was thought that cardioversion would not be successful in the setting of volume overload.
Topical thrombin was applied to paracentesis site which eventually stabilized bleeding.
She had been scheduled to receive blood transfusion with dialysis, but HD would not accept her because she was bleeding.
She received 1 unit of pRBCs prior to transfer to the unit.
Trauma surgery was consulted for persistent bleed, and it was determined that she should no longer continue on a heparin gtt.
Heparin had not been supratherapeutic during this time, however, she had been bleeding almost persistently despite this.
She was transfused one more unit of pRBCs with an appropriate stabilization of her hematocrit.
# Bleeding: Initially patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin, was on ASA 325mg.
In addition, she is a dialysis patient and has platelet dysfunction at baseline.
Heparin gtt has been discontinued as well as Coumadin, and ASA was reduced to 81mg given bleeding.
Paracentesis site bleeding was initially tamponaded and controlled with topical thrombin, but in the setting of being on heparin gtt, bleeding has persisted, requiring compression for >30minutes and dDAVP to control bleeding.
The patient will be treated with aspirin 325mg po daily now that HCT is stable.
For rate control she is on metoprolol XL and verapamil SR.  She had an episode of tachycardia to the 140s during dialysis, likely due to the fact that she was due for rate controlling medications.
# Ascites: Patient is s/p paracentesis, ascitic fluid consistent with portal hypertension from cardiac etiology.
On admission was on lantus 45U qam and 15 units of lantus qhs.
The patient was informed of insulin regimen changes for outpatient and to continue to monitor blood glucose with fingersticks, primary physician's direction.
She received hemodialysis while inpatient and also nephrocaps, sevelamer, fluid restriction.
# Hypertension: Previously on regimen of labetalol, lisinopril, nifedipine, hydralazine, clonidine, and isosorbide.
We have discontinued hydralazine, changed nifedipine to verapamil, and decreased metoprolol, titrated down clonidine.
# Dyspnea: Likely a combination of fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, mechanical stress of ascites.
Continue dialysis for volume overload.
# Pancreatic lesion: ?cyst, consider MRI eval as outpatient.

Secondary diagnosis: - Diabetes mellitus type 2 - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - End stage renal disease on hemodialysis - Osteoarthritis - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Chronic anemia   Discharge Condition: Atrial fibrillation on aspirin, respiratory status stable   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and were found to have atrial fibrillation.
You were originally treated with [**Hospital **] (blood thinner) but due to increased bleeding, the [**Hospital **] was held.
Please take all medications as directed.
Some of your medications have been changed: a.
New medications include metoprolol XL 150mg by mouth once daily, verapamil SR 240mg by mouth once daily.
c. The doses have been changed on some of your medications.
- decrease clonidine to 0.2mg by mouth twice daily - increase isosorbide mononitrate to 120mg by mouth once daily - insulin glargine has been decreased to 20 units once each morning.
Do not take any insulin glargine (lantus) in the evening.
