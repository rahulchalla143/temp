HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease status post three coronary artery bypass graft surgeries (the last of which was in [**2153**]) and peptic ulcer disease status post a Billroth I surgery approximately 50 years ago who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department with a gastrointestinal bleed.
He states he has had intermittent chest pain, dyspnea and finger paresthesias.
Severe coronary artery disease status post three coronary artery bypass graft surgeries the last of which was in [**2153**].
Peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth I in approximately [**2106**].
Isosorbide dinitrate 30 mg po q.i.d.
Clopidogrel 75 mg po q day.
Propanolol 10 mg po four or five times a day.
Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
Amlodipine 2.5 to 5 mg po q day.
Serum chemistries demonstrate sodium 137, potassium 5.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 71, creatinine 1.6, glucose 107.
These procedures were done on the 19th, 22nd, and [**2-2**].
During the first two esophagogastroduodenoscopies the most predominant areas of oozing were treated with epinephrine and local cautery.
Because the patient's hematocrit continued to drop following these procedures, during his third esophagogastroduodenoscopy the anastomotic site was treated with Argon plasma coagulation.
Throughout the course of his hospitalization the patient was transfused 7 units of packed red blood cells and one unit of platelets for his falling hematocrit.
The surgical staff felt that continued medical management was the first appropriate treatment for the patient's ongoing oozing.
This treatment initially recommended by the Gastroenterology Service includes Sucralfate 1 gram po q.i.d.
and supplemental iron therapy.
In addition, both his aspirin and his Clopidogrel were held throughout his hospitalization.
Neither of these medications were restarted at the time of discharge and further consideration to restarting these medications should be made in conjunction with the patient and his primary care physician following his discharge from the hospital.
He was also continued on a proton pump inhibitor throughout his hospitalization.
This medication will be continued on discharge.
In addition, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes on multiple occasions.
Although his Propanolol was initially held around the time of his acute gastrointestinal bleeding on admission this medication was subsequently restarted and titrated to both heart rate and blood pressure.
In addition, he was continued on his oral and topical nitrates for treatment of his angina.
As noted above his antiplatelet agents including aspirin and Clopidogrel were held throughout his hospitalization due to his ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
In addition, his Losartan and Amlodipine were held throughout the hospitalization.
Further management of the patient's antihypertensive regimen should be made in conjunction with the patient and his primary care physician following discharge.
Isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg po t.i.d.
Propanolol 20 mg po q.i.d.
Sucralfate 1 gram po q.i.d.

The patient was also scheduled for a colonoscopy with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1940**] on [**2157-2-25**].
The patient was provided with further details regarding this procedure by the Gastroenterology Service prior to his discharge from the hospital.
