Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old female with a history of severe asthma requiring intubation in the past who was admitted to the intensive care unit with hyoxemic asthma exacerbation.
Her asthma triggers are allergic, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) although it doesn't look like she has been treated with omeluzamab as an outpatient.
She has been on a long steroid taper for ABPA this calendar year but not in the past 1.5 months.
There was no evidence on her CXR to suggest a focal pneumonia and she did not have a leukocytosis, thus antibiotics were not started.
Additionally, she did not have a viral prodrome to support nasal swab.
She was treated with albuterol nebs q2h, ipratroprium nebs q6h, methylprednisolone 60 mg q8h x 1 day, then transitioned to prednisone 60 mg po.
Her home montelukast, loratidine, fluticasone nasal spray and fluticasone/salmeterol inhalers were continued.
Not on treatment because she has been travelling back and forth to [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
