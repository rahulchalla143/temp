Admission Date:  [**2158-7-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2158-7-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-9-7**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old gentleman with a history of hypercholesterolemia, history of exertional angina for about a year, who originally presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with the onset of chest pain and tightness at rest and subsequently was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.
Patient was diagnosed with acute posterior MI and received two doses of Retavase 20 minutes after arrival.
He was also started on heparin drip, nitro drip and was given metoprolol.
He was subsequently asymptomatic after 2 mg of morphine en route to [**Hospital1 188**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 98.4, blood pressure 80s to 110 over 50s to 60s, pulse 60, respirations 16, O2 sat 99% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
Patient is status post posterior MI, status post Retavase thrombolytic treatment times two at the outside hospital.
Patient was continued on aspirin, heparin drip.
Was restarted on metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d., on a statin and on a nitro drip.
Patient was found to have mid-RCA total occlusion with collaterals and OM1 lesion, both of which were stented.
Patient was subsequently given atropine and dopamine and returned to the CCU.
Integrilin was held.
Patient was started on IV Protonix.
GI consult was called and it was felt that patient was hemodynamically stable and had gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation and lytic therapy.
Patient was treated with aspirin, Plavix, atenolol, lisinopril and a statin which was transitioned to patient's outpatient regimen.
The patient had an episode of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of being anticoagulated with two doses of lytic therapy at the outside hospital as well as Integrilin post cardiac catheterization.
Integrilin was held.
It was decided that since this was in the setting of anticoagulation, patient would, however, benefit from being treated with Protonix and being followed in the outpatient gastroenterology office four to six weeks after discharge for probable endoscopic evaluation.
The patient has maintained good oxygen saturation and has not required supplemental O2 since transfer from the cardiac intensive care unit.
The patient has a good lipid profile, however, since patient is status post MI and status post stent, he will continue to be on statin therapy as an outpatient.
Gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of treatment with thrombolytics.
