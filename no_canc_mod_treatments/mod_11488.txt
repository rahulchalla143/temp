# Pemphigus foliaceus with HSV/CMV superinfection: Dermatology and wound care were consulted.
Clinical suspicion was for disseminated HSV and she was started on acycolvir.
Detailed skin care and dressing changes were ordered.
Fluid losses through the skin were repleted using intravenous fluids.
Skin lesions also grew pseudomonas and proteus which were felt to be colonizing and given no systemic symptoms were treated with skin care including acetic acid only.
Given lesions were near her eyes ophthalmology was consulted and they recommended eythromycin eye drops.
She was also started on ciprofloxacin eye drops for pseudomonas given she had skin lesions abutting her eyes.
ID recommended against prophylaxis treatment for pseudomonas colonizing the skin.
The patient was transferred to the floor with Prednisone for Pemphigus treatment and Valacyclovir for HSV superinfection.
Skin biopsy from [**2164-5-14**] showed no further HSV infection, so Valacyclovir converted to prophylaxis dose.
Incidentally, CMV was seen in the tissue, so ID re-consulted to address this issue.
Atovaquone, Pantoprazole, and Vitamin D for prevention of complications from chronic high dose Prednisone.
Pain control for painful skin lesions was with MS contin [**Hospital1 **] and dilaudid (PCA initially, then converted to PO).
