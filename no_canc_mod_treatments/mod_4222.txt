He had a cardiac echo done on [**2192-6-13**] which showed a markedly dilated left atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, moderately dilated aortic root, and severely thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets.
He had recently prior to admission had a work-up for anemia, including a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed an anemia consistent with his HIV infection, and iron deficiency due to hemolysis from damaged cells across the aortic valve.

Following the results of this catheterization, a consult was called to cardiothoracic surgery service for possible coronary artery bypass grafting with replacement of aortic and mitral valves.
The remainder of his preoperative work-up was within normal limits, and on [**2192-10-12**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 2 with endoscopically harvested saphenous vein graft to the OM and endoscopically harvested saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
He also had aortic valve replacement with a #19 mm bovine pericardial valve, and a mitral valve replacement with a #27 [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.
The surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 14968**] with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as assistants.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a total cardiopulmonary bypass time of 225 minutes, with a crossclamp time of 203 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm and on dobutamine, Levophed and propofol drips.
Consequently, he underwent a bedside bronchoscopy, for which he had minimal secretions, but a thick white plug was suctioned.
After extubation, his Levophed was able to be weaned off, although he did require atrial pacing to keep the systolic blood pressure greater than 90.
The patient continued to progress and eventually was able to maintain a blood pressure greater than 90 without pacing, and a heart rate in the mid to upper 50s to low 60s.
He was out-of-bed to the chair each day and began work with cardiac rehab and physical therapy.
He continued with physical therapy while on the floor, and on postoperative day #5 his pacing wires were DC'd without incident.
He was given boluses of IV Lopressor up to a total of 40 mg, and was started on a diltiazem drip to achieve rate control.
He also was being given sotalol which was a preoperative medication and this was increased to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was his preoperative dose.
He did remain with a heart rate in the 130s-150s throughout the overnight period despite increasing the diltiazem drip up to a maximum of 20 mg.  On postoperative day #6, the EP service was consulted, and it was planned that he would go for cardioversion on that day.
He has since maintained normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66, and continues on his sotalol 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].
