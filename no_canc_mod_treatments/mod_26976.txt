# Abdominal pain: Pt's abdominal pain was considered likely secondary to C. diff colitis, given postive stool cultures and recent treatment with antibiotics, although CT abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of overt bowel pathology.
Pt was continued on metronidazole IV with vancomycin PO.
Tube feeds were held for bowel rest, and pt was given TPN for nutrition.
Pt was initially given hydromorphone PCA without a basal rate, which was inadequate for pain control.
After pt decided to transition to [**Name (NI) 3225**], pt was provided with morphine drip, and antibiotics were removed.
# ARF: Pt developed acute-on-chronic renal failure, given recent Cr baseline ~1.6.
Furosemide was held and pt initially was aggressively hydrated with NS boluses and a basal rate, with some improvement of Cr but no improvement of urine output.
# UTI: Pt's repeat urine culture was positive for yeast, and pt was started on fluconazole for treatment, until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Esophageal stricture s/p PEG placement:  Pt was given meds through his PEG, although tube feeds were held for bowel rest.
# Hypothyroid: Pt continued on home regimen of levothyroxine until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Paroxismal atrial fibrillation: Pt was monitored on telemetry given his h/o pacemaker placement for tachy-brady syndrome, until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Ischemic heart disease s/p CABG '[**18**]: Pt was continued on home regimen of carvedilol, until he was made [**Year (2 digits) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Aortic stenosis: Echo demonstrated end-stage heart failure, with significant MR, TR, and AS, as well as LV hypomobility.
# DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 650mg Q6H PRN Fentanyl patch 50mcg Fluconazole 100mg daily Furosemide 20mg daily Heparin SC 5000mcg TID Levothyroxine 25mg daily Metoclopramide 10mg daily Morphine 2-4mg Q4H PRN MVI Percocet-5 Q6H PRN Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Simethicone 80mg QID NaCl nasal spray Vancomycin 125mg PO Q6H Water 250ml NGT TID Zolpidem 10mg QHS PRN Atrovent 0.5mg Q4H PRN Albuterol nebs PRN TID Piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25g Q6H  Discharge Medications: Expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired   Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired   Completed by:[**2139-8-10**
