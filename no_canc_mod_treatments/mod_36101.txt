In the ED, EKG was remarkable for complete AV nodal dissociation with ventricular rate of 40.
Patient was intubated; he was given atropine and started on transthoracic pacing with peripheral dopamine.
A cordis was then placed with a transvenous wire and he was started on temporary pacing.
Dopamine was weaned off.
Labs in the emergency room were remarkable for potassium of 7.8 and blood sugar of 350 for which patient was given calcium chloride and insulin.
Was given three amps of calcium chloride.
OG, RIJCVL and cordic with transvenous pacing wires placed.
Seen by EP (confirmed wire placement, voltage and hemodynamics) and Renal (no dialysis for now).
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Although the patient was conscious upon arrival to the ED, he was shortly after sedated and intubated.
Only aunt and cousin in US.
Sedated, intubated, central lines, restraints x2.

He was sedated, intubated and paced on arrival on the floor.
Wrist restraints were needed because of the need to maintain endotracheal orogastric tubes and central venous line with pacer wires.
Sedation was weaned and he was extubated the following day after correction of hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia, which resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm wihtout further bradycardia.
He was delirius and agitated after extubation, requiring low-dose antipsychotic medication.
With clearing of his mental state, pcyhotropics were stopped.
This was likely provoked by slowed flow in vessels given arterial line (artery is patent), intravenous line in outflow and wrist restraint.
Lovenox was started and analgesia given.
Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic with medications and did not respond to atropine.
Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperkalemic hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)   Given insulin and kayelexate with resolution, later supplementation with potassium containing fluids as potassium fell below 5.
Cardiac rhythmicity normal with correction of potassium and glucose.
Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor control and chronicity more than this acute event and is 11, suggesting average glucose of 280 mg/dl.
DM management will be critical to prevent further bradycardic arrest and other complications.
He has been taking oral anti-hyperglycemics along with standing 70/30 (14 units [**Hospital1 **]) and sliding scale.
Aimed for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient, while intubated and sedated.
