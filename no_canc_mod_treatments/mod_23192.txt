In the ED and found to have blood pressure in 70s that responded to IV fluid boluses, and she received 8 litres total of normal saline.
However, patient refused further surgical intervention after medical treatment.
Per ED resident, patient adamantly refused central venous line insertion and was felt to have capacity at the time.
She denied any symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fevers, or chills.
A stent was put in at the end of the study per endoscopic report.
CONCLUSION: Choledocholithiasis with massive dilatation of the common duct, 2.8 cm common bile duct with stone and sludge within the common duct.
Her systolic pressures were in the 70s, but improved to the 90s with crystalloid and IV antibiotics (vanco/cipro/flagyl).
She underwent ERCP for evacuation of cholelithiasis.
Stent placement was successful, no purulent drainage was appreciated, but sphincterotomy was not performed because of hypoxia during the procedure.
Numerous stones were retained, and gastroenterology feels she should have repeat ERCP with sphincterotomy and lithotripsy in 2 months.
Therefore, antibiotic was switched to ceftriaxone.
Given bacteremia, 14 day total course of antibiotics recommended.
A midline was placed, as the E. coli was not sensitive to any tested oral antibiotics, and she will required 10 additional days of IV ceftriaxone.
COPD -- hypoxia during ERCP/MAC anesthesia, but stable upon presentation on the floor on two liters.
Home COPD meds were continued, and she did not require supplemental oxygen for >24 hours prior to discharge.
