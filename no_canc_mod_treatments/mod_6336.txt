She takes Aspirin and Plavix at home, and these were discontinued on admission.
She was continued on her home doses of Amlodipine 10 daily, Lisinopril 40 qhs, Lasix 20 PO daily, and Metoprolol 125 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her Aspirin 325 mg daily can be restarted in 1 week.
The Plavix was started in [**5-17**] for medical management of presumed CAD, and it is not clear if she needs to continue this medication.
Her FeUrea was 14%, indicating dehydration, and she was given IVF with improvement in her Cr to 1.2 at the time of discharge.
She was not taking in enough food, so her Humulin N was decreased to 10 U qAM and 4 U qPM, with a HISS (she does not tolerate regular insulin).
Her FSBG should be closely monitored in rehab, and her Humulin N can be changed as needed.
Gerontology was consulted during this admission, and suggested starting her on Celexa 10 mg daily for her depression.
