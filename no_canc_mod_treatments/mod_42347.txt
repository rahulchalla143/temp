Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 56yo man with h/o poorly controlled DM admitted with DKA secondary to medication non-adherence in the setting of depression.
DKA - The patient was started on an insulin drip per standard protocol for ~30 hours.
His anion gap closed, and he was started on NPH at 15u [**Hospital1 **] given his poor PO intake (on 25u [**Hospital1 **] at home).
This was initially thought to be a stress reaction similar to that evidenced in a prior admission, but after one blood culture grew E coli he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
Flagyl was discontinued given the culture results of E coli.
He was aggressively hydrated with IVF and his Cr was 0.7 on discharge.
His hyperglycemia was treated with IVF and insulin, and he received calcium for the hyperkalemia.
CV - He had a h/o cardiomyopathy, but not CAD.
He was discharged on home regimen of ASA and lisinopril.
At discharge, Pharmacare had been contact[**Name (NI) **] to waive the copay for his prescriptions and he was notified of this.
