She is allergic to Bactrim and so she was started on Primaquine and Prednisone and Clindamycin with little improvement.
She was switched to Pentamidine and Prednisone later on admission again without significant improvement in respiratory status.
She continued to spike fevers on the Primaquine and Prednisone, so she was started empirically on Levofloxacin and Zosyn and for a short time Vancomycin.
The patient continued to worsen on these medications and spike fevers.
She was also  on Azithromycin q week, Fluconazole q day for suspected thrush.
The Azithromycin is her [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis and Valacylcovir for CMV prophylaxis.
All cultures remained negative throughout hospitalization including blood, urine and myolytic cultures.
It is unclear what infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] or agents were responsible for the patient's continuing deleterious course, however it was felt by infectious disease consult as well as the medical team that PCP alone was most probably not responsible as she should have been receiving adequate therapy with the Pentamidine and steroids.
After a long talk with the family it was decided that comfort should be the goal given the relapsing course of her illness and on [**2155-3-17**] antibiotics were discontinued.
She was put on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
She was able to rebound with normal saline boluses.
