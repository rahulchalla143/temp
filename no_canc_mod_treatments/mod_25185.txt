On day of admission he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 1 and aortic valve replacement utilizing a mechanical valve.
By post-op day one he was weaned off of any inotropes and was started on beta blockers and diuretics.
Chest tubes were removed and he was then transferred to the cardiac surgery step down floor.
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day two.
Later on this day his heart rhythm went in atrial fibrillation which eventually converted to sinus with Lopressor and Amiodarone.
Also on post-op day two he was started on Coumadin for his mechanical aortic valve.
Of note, he was anemic with HCT between 23-29, but remained asymptomatic and was started on Iron and Vit.
