# EARLY SEPSIS: Patient presented with fevers, hyotension, tachycardia and a lactate of 4.8.
The differential was broad including line infection (new HD line placed on [**12-31**]), pneumonia (CXR without obvious infiltrate), CMV Viremia (viral load [**12-29**] negative), UTI, C. Diff (recent infection [**11-5**] but without any symptoms to suggest this).
Patients BP/HR improved after administration of 2L IVF, and broad coverage with Meropenem (GN coverage) plus Daptomycin (GP coverage) as well as PO Vanc, given bandemia.
During hospitalization, antibiotics were narrowed to daptomycin.
Patient will need to complete 4 week course of Daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in setting of known thrombus that is possibly seeded.
She will receive Daptomycin when she receives HD.
The renal team has arranged for her to get the medication at HD.
Patient has no LVH on prior ECHOs to invoke repolarization changes.
In the mean time, patient is medically managed for coronary artery disease; she is on aspirin and small dose of beta-blocker.
Simvastatin was added during this admission.
Sinus tachycardia invariably improved/resolved after gentle IVF (250cc-500cc NS).
However, after treatment with zofran and resolution of nausea, her heart rate remained in the 120s, which argues against that theory.
# Low Blood Pressure: Patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 100s to 110s, though was noted to occasionally be in the 90s, which responded to small IVF boluses (250-300cc).
She should continue on Midodrine 10mg TID.
# ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant: Patient was continued on HD and maintained on Prednisone.
She was maintained on warfarin with goal [**12-31**] and should continue anticoagulation until resolution of the thrombus or indefinitely.
# CMV viremia: Patient has been treated with valganciclovir.
Plan is for her to f/u with outpatient ID with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2150-1-21**] regarding need to continue this treatment.
She was treated with digoxin load and PRN PO metoprolol.
She will continue on digoxin 0.125mg 3/week and metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient, with holding parameters for SBP<95 or HR<55.
This appears to occur after HD and may be related to volume depletion.
# Anticoagulation: Patient should continue on coumadin with goal INR [**12-31**].
