He was taken directly to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Aspirin and lopressor were started.
He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery.
Although he converted back into normal sinus rhythm, he continued to have episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coumadin was started for anticoagulation.
A persistent small, left apical pneumothorax was noted on chest x-ray and a repeat chest x-ray was obtained with his chest tube on water seal.
His left chest tube was subsequently removed.
Heparin was started as a bridge to coumadin as his INR was subtherapeutic.
Chest tubes were removed on the floor and pacing wires removed before INR was therapeutic.
He remained on amiodarone and coumadin and INR on day of discharge was 2.4.
He was instructed to take 1 mg of coumadin that evening at home.
