He was started on amiodarone infusion at OSH.
Impression from cardiology was for re-stenosis of stents placed in [**2199-2-9**] and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and EP consult for discussion of possible upgrade of ICD to BivPM.
No complaints of dizziness, back pain, groin pain, or leg pain.

He had complication post-procedure for hypotension and he was transferred to the CCU.
Follow-up EKG later in the evening after admission showed left axis deviation, evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction with q-waves and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
For NSTEMI management, hHe was continued on his  ASA 325 mg daily,  Plavix 75 mg, Atorvastatin 80mg daily and a heparin drip was started.
He continued to have intermittent mild to moderate chest pains during his hospital stay which were relieved with low doses of IV Morphine.
Beta blockers were held given the concern for cardiogenic shock and his extremely low EF.
An arterial line was placed for better monitoring of his hemodynamics and his non-invasive BP was noted to be approximately 10mmHg less then arterial measurement.
He was given some gentle diuresis as tolerated by SBP and his Spironolactone was held due to his low BPs.
Unfortunately, the patient continued to required increasing amounts of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations above 90%.
HYPOTENSION: The patient's SBPs of 80-90s declined to the low 70s and his MAP by arterial line measure dropped into the mid-40s to low 50s range so the patient was started on a Dopamine drip.
He had started on Amiodarone at an OSH just prior to admission but this was held in the setting of his severe hypotension.
He was monitored via continuous telemetry.
RENAL FAILURE : The patient's renal dysfunction and climbing creatinine were felt to be secondary to his poor forward flow and faltering cardiac index in the setting of his advanced heart failure and overnight NSTEMI.
He remained difficult to wean off of oxygen and diuresis was limited because of extreme renal failure and inability to dose large amounts of lasix in the setting of his extreme hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.
PRE-DIABETES: The patient was placed on sliding scale insulin for glycemic control in the setting of ACS.
ADDITIONAL CARE / PROPHYLAXIS: -In terms of wound care, the patient was given a Duoderm for additional care of his buttock ulcer during his hospital course.
A bowel regimen was given with Colace and Senna tablets and Heparin drip per ACS protocol covered the DVT prophylaxis concerns.
The EP team was called to deactivate the patient's pacemaker and he was given IV Morphine for comfort and IV Lasix drip for additional relief of his gross fluid overloaded state and pulmonary edema.
