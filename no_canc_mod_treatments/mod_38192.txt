HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2125**] (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery), and status post myocardial infarction times four with positive enzymes; however, the patient has declined cardiac catheterization each time.
The cough was characterized as constant, productive of thick yellowish sputum with no associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or diaphoresis.
He was prescribed amoxicillin which was never filled.
Clinically, he was felt to be in congestive heart failure and volume overloaded and was admitted for management of his congestive heart failure and a viral pneumonia.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient had the following findings:  An arterial blood gas of 7.4, PCO2 of 48, and a PO2 of 67, atrial pressure was noted to be 14, right ventricle 61/8, cardiac output of 3.22, cardiac index of 1.58, pulmonary artery pressure of 60/34, with a mean of 45, and a wedge of 39 to 40.
Lasix 40 mg intravenously was given in the catheterization laboratory times one.
During catheterization, the patient was noted to be hypotensive, and thus started on a dopamine drip leading to a run of supraventricular tachycardia and eventual hypertension, necessitating initiation of nitroglycerin drip.
Given his hemodynamic instabilities, the patient received direct current cardioversion times two with no break in his atrial fibrillation.
He was initiated on amiodarone drip, and soon thereafter intubated given worsening agitation, tachypneic, and in general grave condition.
His blood pressure continued to drop, especially after intubation with the use of propofol with his nadir at 37 for approximately five minutes.
The patient was thus started on milrinone for inotropic support as well as maintained on Levophed with the addition of vasopressin for pressor support.
Diabetes diagnosed eight years ago; on insulin times three years.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2124**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**2125**], myocardial infarction times three since, and two positive stress tests with apparent report of fixed defects.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications as an outpatient included)  1.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Flovent 44 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.
Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o.
Digoxin 250 mcg p.o.
Aldactone 50 mg p.o.
Insulin (70/30) 26 units q.p.m.
Amaryl 8 mg p.o.
Zestril 5 mg p.o.
Right groin with an arteriovenous sheath in place, and no hematoma.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization with the following findings:  A right-dominant system revealing 3-vessel coronary artery disease; the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending artery was subtotally occluded after a large first diagonal, the left circumflex was subtotally occluded proximally with late filling of a large first obtuse marginal which collateralized at the posterior descending artery, the right coronary artery was occluded proximally, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery was occluded, and the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery could not be engaged because the left subclavian artery was occluded 3 cm distal to its origin, but seemed to be filling the distal left anterior descending artery via competitive flow on the native vessel.
IMPRESSION:  A 63-year-old male with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of multivessel and graft coronary artery disease.
Beta blockers and Lopressor could not be utilized considering the patient's low blood pressure.
The Coronary Care Unit team consulted the Interventional Cardiology Service, and the decision was made to pursue revascularization of the left subclavian from which the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft was coming off; although, the primary Coronary Care Unit team felt that the benefit of such a procedure may be minimal, they felt that intervention upon the left subclavian may improve the patient's heart function and hemodynamics.
Lastly, the patient did not wish to be considered for coronary artery bypass graft (as per his and his family's wishes).
(b)  Pump:  The patient was noted to be in cardiogenic shock on admission to the Coronary Care Unit and was maintained on milrinone, Levophed, and vasopressin drip.
The patient's Swan numbers were monitored closely, and with noted improvement the patient's vasopressin drip was discontinued on hospital day two.
Thereafter, the patient was maintained on milrinone and Levophed drip which was slowly tapered to off.
In addition, the patient was placed on a Lasix drip for diuresis in the setting of a markedly elevated wedge pressure.
The patient diuresed well with the Lasix drip which was titrated from 1 mg to 25 mg per hour.
However, the Lasix drip was discontinued on hospital day three secondary to hypotension.
The patient continued to diuresis well in spite of the stopping of his Lasix drip, and the patient was also supplemented periodically with intravenous Lasix times one to insure adequate diuresis.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient remained in sinus rhythm after being cardioverted, and the patient was maintained on an amiodarone drip.
The patient was maintained on assist-control with frequent arterial blood gas monitoring of his ventilation and oxygenation status.
On hospital day four, in preparation for his upcoming cardiac catheterization, a trial of weaning and extubation was attempted; however, with the decreasing of the patient's sedation and switching over to pressor support the patient was not noted to take any spontaneous breaths.
Therefore, the decision was made to maintain the patient on assist-control and to continue to lighten up his sedation.
In addition, the patient was noted to have purulent sputum and was started empirically on Levaquin and Flagyl for a likely pneumonia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As above, the patient was started empirically on Levaquin and Flagyl for a pneumonia.
The patient was started on vancomycin.
The patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale as well as being placed on a baseline NPH of 4 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
