She has never had a wheeze before despite multiple episodes of BOOP/COP.
The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] because of increased shortness of breath and has been on prednisone and methotrexate for a suspected recrudescence of BOOP/COP.
Over the past week, however, the patient has had intermittent short-lived episodes of substernal chest heaviness, which she reports most closely resemble angina from her previous heart problems (which include 3 stents in her coronary vessels; the patient also reports renal artery stents and what seem to be iliac stenting on left).
She has had a barium swallow and reports she has been asked to have an endoscopy as well.
Past Medical History: BOOP/COP s/p Bx [**2172**] HTN HLD CAD s/p 3 stents GERD T2DM s/p knee replacement ([**2181**]) s/p TAH h/o proctitis ([**2177**]) h/o Babesiosis ([**2180**])   Social History: She is married and lives with her husband.
Brief Hospital Course: 70F with PMH BOOP/COP, CAD s/p stent x3, PAD who presents with dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia, chest pressure of two months duration.
# Dyspnea, Hypoxia, Chest Pressure:  DDx is broad, including cardiac, pulmonary, and inflammatory causes.
Given her use of steroids without ABX prophylaxis, PCP or other infection also needs to be considered.
Given the background of foot rash and nasal lesions, Wegener's was of concern.
While in the MICU, the patient was placed on a NRB.
She was continued on treatment for presumed PCP with steroids and Bactrim.
She was also started on vanc/ceftax for possible HAP for seven day course.
The possibility of intubation was discussed with the patient for possible bronchoscopy.
However, because of the risk of intubation and the potential for a very difficult extubation [**1-14**] her underlying lung disease, she was not immediately intubated.
Several attempts were made to wean her from the ventilator but failed due to hypoxia.
On [**2184-12-4**] patient's husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 10132**] together with his family, decided to extubate [**Known firstname 4115**] and to change the goals of her care to comfort care.
# Kidney injury: BUN 50, creatinine 1.4.
While in the MICU, her renal function worsened, with creat increasing to 2.1; possible related to medication effects of Bactrim.
