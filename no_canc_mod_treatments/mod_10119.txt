Blood culture during admission grew 202 bottles positive for Providencia Alcalifaciens sensitive to Imipenem and Levofloxacin.
Renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis resulting in the potassiums of 6, anuria, worsening acidosis requiring hemodialysis; 2.
Distributive shock secondary to gram negative sepsis requiring Dopamine drip, antibiotic coverage with Levaquin, Gentamicin and Imipenem; 3.
Cholestasis, ischemic pancreatitis, mesenteric ischemia, obstructive jaundice; 4.
Respiratory failure, the patient was initially intubated for airway protection after failing CPAP due to his mental status changes.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 73 year old white male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP, history of rheumatoid arthritis on Enbrel, admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**12-11**] with likely pyelonephritis and gram negative sepsis causing multi-organ dysfunction including renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis requiring hemodialysis, DIC subendocardial ischemia, toxic metabolic encephalopathy and hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred from the outside hospital for further management at the family's request.
The patient was continued on Levaquin 250 q.d.
and Imipenem 250 q.
Per renal recommendations, the Levofloxacin was changed to 250 mg q.
Imipenem was discontinued on [**12-23**], Levaquin was discontinued on [**2162-12-26**].
The patient's Foley catheter was changed on [**12-27**] and a repeat urinalysis was read as no evidence of infection.
The patient was intubated but became hypotensive after intubation requiring transient pressure support with Dopamine.
Sputum cultures in the MICU grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was started on Vancomycin that was dosed renally by prn Vancomycin levels.
He was transferred to the floor, back to the [**Hospital **] Medical Service on [**2163-1-4**] and was to continue on Vancomycin for a total of a 12 day course.
Therefore a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was placed by Interventional Radiology while the patient was in the MICU.
The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was placed [**2163-1-3**].
The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was used for tube feeds on [**2163-1-4**] without complications.
The patient required transient hemodialysis but by [**1-4**] his creatinine was back to baseline levels at 2.2.
They recommended Flomax and that the patient have indwelling Foley catheter to prevent further episodes of retention and urosepsis.
The patient was continued on Flomax with no difficulty.
The patient was consulted by Neurosurgery who recommended blood pressure control and normalizing the INR.
The patient received Vitamin K for this purpose.
He was continued on Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers and Vancomycin.
As a consequence he was medically managed for his cardiac disease, treated with Aspirin and with blood pressure control.
Lopressor was held as the patient was bradycardiac on his medication.
For blood pressure control the patient was on Amlodipine 5 mg q.d.
and the patient was also on Lasix 40 mg q.d.
DISPOSITION:  The patient was ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility on [**2163-1-6**]  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1.
