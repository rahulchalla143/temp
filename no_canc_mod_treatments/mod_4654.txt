He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] after decortication of bilateral fibrothoraxes and subsequently required placement of a tracheostomy.
He was being intermittently ventilated at rehabilitation and had reportedly been doing well.
A right internal jugular central line was placed in the Emergency Department and he was given initially five liters of intravenous fluids and was placed on Levophed to support his blood pressure into the mid 90s.
He was given an initial one dose of Timentin through a peripheral intravenous in his foot and was later put on ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin after a central access was obtained.
On admission, he was found to have an elevated creatinine of 2.7 with a prior baseline as high as 1.6.

Initial Chem-7 notable for a sodium of 140, potassium 3.0, chloride 89, bicarbonate 43, BUN and creatinine 70 and 2.7, glucose of 125.
He was initially placed on pressors, given aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.
After approximately an hour on pressors, the pressors were weaned off and the patient had stable blood pressure.
Initially he was given central access, serial lactates were drawn; an arterial line was placed, and he was placed on steroids for presumed relative adrenal insufficiency.
He was placed on ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
After the patient's blood pressure stabilized, he became afebrile and his urine culture returned as infective pseudomonas, he was taken off steroids and placed on Zosyn for pseudomonas coverage.
He was placed on Zosyn for complete three week course.
A PICC line was placed for long term antibiotics.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY:  The patient has had a Foley catheter in place for at least one to two months because of a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary retention.
A Foley catheter was continued during his inpatient hospital stay but he will likely need an outpatient urology evaluation and / or possible transurethral resection of the prostate procedure as indwelling Foley catheter may increase his risk for recurrent urinary tract infections and / or future episodes of urosepsis.
PULMONARY:  The patient was continued on the ventilator intermittently as he had done previously and he was not thought to have a primary pulmonary process as the cause of this admission.
Because of air leak around the cuff of his tracheostomy, his tracheostomy was changed to a Portex #7.
He did well on intermittent pressure support and no vent changes were made.
He will continue with a ventilatory wean as he had done previously at rehabilitation.
He was continued on aspirin and beta blocker.
Consideration was made to starting an ACE inhibitor but was not started given his renal failure.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  His creatinine was elevated up to 2.7 on admission thought to be due to his sepsis and decreased intervascular volume.
After aggressive intravenous fluid hydration, this currently dropped to 1.2 at the time of discharge which is well within his baseline.
To maintain adequate nutrition, Gastroenterology was consulted and a PEG was placed on [**3-24**].
The patient had minimal bleeding around the site of the PEG placement so his aspirin dose was lowered from 325 mg to 81 mg which is a prophylactic dose.
His PEG was safe for tube feeds, so tube feeds were begun.
He was continued on a Regular insulin sliding scale.
He was afebrile with stable hemodynamics and doing well on a ventilator.
He was felt to be safe for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for continuation of his ventilatory wean and for continued intravenous antibiotic therapy.
