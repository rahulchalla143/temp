BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 47777**] is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted on [**2164-1-26**] to [**Doctor First Name **]- [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for elective repair of retroperitoneal abdominal aortic aneurysm for a 6.2 x 6.3 x 9.6 cm aneurysm.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2164-1-26**], and had a retroperitoneal approach for his abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with tube graft from the infrarenal side to his aortic bifurcation.
Postoperatively he was noted to be hypotensive and was started on Neo- Synephrine.
He had a total abdominal colectomy with  ileostomy done emergently.
He was taken back now to the surgical intensive care unit where he stabilized, still requiring pressors and IV fluids throughout the evening.
He was maxed out on Levophed and Neo-Synephrine at this point as well as vasopressor 1.2 per hour.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation requiring synchronized cardioversion because of hypotension.
He received boluses of epinephrine.
During this time he had somewhat stabilized, however was still hypotensive requiring maximal pressors and was on epinephrine drip.
The family, after a lengthy discussion, felt that he would not want to proceed with any further care and he was made CMO.
