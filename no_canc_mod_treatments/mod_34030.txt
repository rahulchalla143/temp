Vancomycin was increased and was treated with IVIG on [**10-30**].
Aspirin was stopped due to positive guaiac stools.
On the floor, pt was found to have a nonocclusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein surrounding the indwelling PICC catheter on [**11-7**].

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
The cardiac output, calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption, was preserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.
Video Swallow [**10-28**] FINDINGS: Bolus control, bolus formation and anterior to posterior tongue movement were moderately reduced, with AP rolling of the oral bolus.
Laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were moderately reduced.
Episodes of aspiration were noted to occur after the swallow secondary to pharyngeal residue across all administered consistencies, including honey- thick liquid, nectar-thick liquid, and puree consistency.
Residue was also noted on the NG tube within the pharynx, also contributing to penetration of material into the airway after the swallow.
His course was complicated by septic shock secondary to c dif colitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, PICC line-associated and spontaneous DVT but further complicated by hematochezia and worsening of his chronic dysphagia.
The patient was started on po vancomycin and IV flagyl.
Urgent GI and surgery consultations were obtained.
Given the patient had a benign abdominal exam no surgical intervention was felt to be necessary.
He was medically managed with antibiotics, fluids and pressor support.
He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics started including PO and IV Vanc and IV Zosyn and flagyl.
His dose of vancomycin was increased to 500mg Q6 and he was treated with IVIG once on [**10-30**] in consultation with GI and he has demonstated a subsequent improvement in his WBC count to 5.0 on [**11-13**].
He will require a prolonged vancomycin taper and close follow up with Gastroenterology.
His IV flagyl was discontinued upon discharge from the hospital.
- On discharge, he should start on a Vanco taper as follows: 500 mg PO QID x 6 days 125 mg PO QID x 7 days 125 mg PO BID x 7 days 125 mg PO QD  x 7 days 125 mg PO QOD x 7 days 125 mg PO Q3D x 14 days During the last week, he should start saccaromyces boulandii 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and continue this for 2 weeks.
He was briefly on Phenylepherine on [**9-23**] for blood pressure control and was loaded with amiodorone and digoxin.
Given he was found to have guaiac positive stools on subcutaneous heparin and aspirin alone and his atrial fibrillation has not been persistent and in the setting of severe illness, he was not felt to be a candidate for anticoagulation.
His heart rate has been well controlled on the regimen of digoxin and amiodarone.
He should continue on digoxin and amiodorone and follow up with his PCP for further management.
His digoxin was discontinued on [**11-5**].
He will continue his 400 mg daily dose of amiodarone then switch to 200 mg thereafter.
Based on his recent and prior history of GI bleeding, anticoagulation was not thought safe.
He should have baseline PFTs done as an outpatient and follow-up with his PCP.
3) BRBRP/GI bleed- During his initial MICU course he was found to have guaiac positive stools on subcutaneous heparin and aspirin alone and given his severe illness and the absence of a-fib, he was not anticoagulated.
On his second return to the floor, the pt was found to have a nonocclusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein surrounding the indwelling PICC catheter on [**11-7**].
His PICC was pulled and he was started on a heparin gtt.
Heparin gtt DC'd.
The need for colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was discussed with GI, and it was decided that there was no need for urgent colonoscopy and GI would prefer to defer given active inflammation and bowel wall thickening on CT, though they were improved from previous.
He was continued on atorvastatin 40mg daily.
His aspirin was held for guaiac positive stools.
5) Parkinsons Disease - The patient was continue on Senemet 25-100 TID.
6) DVT: As above, his course was complicated by PICC line associated thrombosis.
He had an IVC filter placed due to his contra-indication to anti-coagulation.

9) Hypertension: Held antihypertensives given BP intolerant, previously on Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10 mg QD.
10) FEN/GI: The patient had difficulty with placement of a feeding tube due to a large hiatal hernia.
Speech and swallow consultation was obtained and recommended NPO status and consideration for PEG placement.
Given the patient's severe C. diff infection he was not felt to be a candidate for surgical placement of a feeding tube at this time.
He is not a candidate for PEG placement due to his hiatal hernia.
He had a NG tube placed by interventional radiology in the post pyloric position.
Following the patients recovery, further evaluation should be considered for feeding tube placement.
He should also be reevaluated for the option of pleasure feeds by mouth.
