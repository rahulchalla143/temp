Prior to last admit, pt had 1 week of yellow watery stool, non-bloody, non-black, occuring about six times/day, worse at night.
He was transiently on Levo/Flagyl but these were discontinued after negative stool culture.
By HD#4, he was forming more formed stool, and in fact his stool became too hard and so he was re-started on a stool softener colace.
It was felt that he likely had a viral enterocolitis, or less likely, an ischemic colitis from possible hypotensive episode during HD session.
Patient was not felt to warrant a colonoscopy at the time, as he improved on conservative management.
300cc of NS was given, which brought up the BP to 92/60, but then it fell to 71/45.

A right- sided PICC has been removed.
Dopamine was started on the floor in addition to fluid boluses, and pt was transferred to the MICU.
He was initially on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin but was tailored to Ceftriaxone.
He also has adrenal insufficiency from long term use of prednsione for gout.
So he received stress dose steroids of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone since the hypotensive espisode.
He was treated with ceftriaxone for the E.Coli sepsis.
The source was thought to be either from sigmoidiscopy or line related as he had femoral line in his right groin as well as tunneled HD line in his left IJ.
After temporary HD line was placed in the left groin, both of the old lines were removed.
Plan at this point was to place a tunneled HD catheter by IR.
Placement of this catheter was complicated by the fact that patient was having mental status change and did not have a health care proxy.
After discussion with ethics, it was thought that placement of these catheters was medically necessary and both a tunneled Left HD catheter and left PICC line were placed.
The left groin catheter was removed at this point.
The patient was then successfully weaned down to low-flow nasal canula.
At this point, the patient had completed ceftriaxone for his previous E. Coli bactermiea, but was already receiving Flagyl for a possible previous aspiration.
In the setting of this leukocytosis, the patient again became hypotensive and was empirically started on Vancomycin IV and Zosyn.
The patient was additioanlly started on PO Vancomycin and the Flagyl was discontinued.
The patient, who previously had been weaned back down to 10mg PO qd of prednisone was again brought to his stress dose steroid of 100mg hydrocortisone qd for possible adrenal insufficiency.
In the setting of continued GI output, the patient additionally had a rectal tube placed on [**2144-7-5**] to avoid contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer.
The patient's PICC was pulled and the patient was started on an IV Heparin drip.
The patient was scheduled to have an additional PICC placed the following day.
THat evening, the patient was noted to have some epistaxis without hemodynamic compromise and the Heparin Drip was immediatley stopped.
As the patient was DNR/DNI it was determined that the patient may recieve pressors if necessary in the unit, but at most could receive bi-PAP or CPAP for ventilatory support.
The patient was placed back on 100% O2 on non-rebreather, but was maintaining BP 90-110 without pressors.
The patient was not receiving insulin, and was given amps of dextrose as needed for hypoglycemic episodes as well as basal fluids with D5.
Upon suction, frank blood was suctioned through a nasal trach tube.
The patient was immediately given 1 unit of platelets for hrombocytopenia and the patient previously that evening had received i unit of FFP for an elevated INR.
- [**2144-7-15**] Prior conversations with the patient when he was lucid revealed that the patient was willing to continue hemodialysis, but only if he was able to go back to his retirement home for treatment.
The patient reported clearly to the medical team he did not want to stay in the hospital indefinitely on hemodialysis and he did not want to die in the hospital, with his life being prolonged on hemodialysis.
Given the above and his recent medical decompensation, thought likely to represent sepsis and DIC, the decision was made, agreed upon by all healthcare workers involed in his care, that Mr. [**Known lastname 52065**] would not have wanted continued aggressive medical management.
The decision was made to place the patient on comfort care, and all medical treatments including blood draws and HD were stopped.
On [**2144-7-15**] the patient was placed on a morphine drip titrated to comfort.
He underwent sigmoidoscopy which showed multiple patchy erythematous and edematous area but etiology was inconclusive.
The plan was to send him for colonoscopy but patient became septic with E. Coli bactermiea s/p sigmoidoscopy for which he was treated with ceftriaxone.
The patient was additionally started on PO Vancomycin at this time 125mg po q6h for treatment of likely C. Diff Colitis.
The patient was additionally given questrum 4 gm PO QID to help solidify his bowel movements.
The patient was additionally found during his stay to have frequent contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer with feces.
Because of this, a rectal tube was placed while the patient experienced diarrhea to avoid contamination of his open wound.
Flagyl was added in addition to Ceftriaxone to cover for anerobes for pneumonia as well as empiric coverage for GI flora.
Ethics consult was otained to define a long term care as he is clearly DNR/DNI.
7)Nutrition: Pt with albumin of 1.8 primarily from persistent diarrhea and decreased po intake from inumerous NPO peri-procedure and ICU stay.
Paient was started and weaner from TPN during stay.
remainder of hospital course as above  8)Gout: Pt with long standing use of prednisone 10 mg qd for chronic gout.
9)Hypothyroid: His synthroid dose was just increased to 50 mcg qd on last admission.
