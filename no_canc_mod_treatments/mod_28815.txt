Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with h/o possible idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on chronic prednisone admitted with progression of DOE, low grade fevers and change in sputum color after failing outpatient empiric therapy for PNA.
The differential for this patient on chronic prednisone was considered to be broad, including atypical CAP as well as fungal infections, [**Age over 90 3390**], [**Name10 (NameIs) **] less likely MAC given upper lobe distribution.
Pt was covered for CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
Bactrim was also continued for [**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] stain in sputum Cx was negative.
Pt was also continued on nebulizers as needed.
He is restarted on his home dose of Advair and Spiriva before d/c.
Patient's prednise was also continued at his usual dose (received Solumedrol IV bolus in the ED).
Troponin elevation.
Improved to baseline with gentle hydration.
Most likely multifactorial secondary to steroid therapy and infectious process.
Most likely in the setting of chronic prednisone and inhaled steroids.
