He had a positive stress test and ultimately [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty and stenting.

PROCEDURE:  Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with 20 mm Dacron tube graft.
Using sharp and blunt dissection, the peritoneum and its contents were swept out of the iliac fossa, towards the right side, raising the kidney as well.
Dissection was carried over to the lateral surface of the aorta, exposing the left common iliac artery.
A vessel loop was placed around the left renal artery to prevent embolization into the renal when clamping the aorta close to it.
A longitudinal aortotomy was then made and this was T'd off proximally and distally.
A large amount of thrombus and atheromatous debris was removed from the aortic sac.
Multiple lumbar branches were suture ligated with figure-of-eight 2-0 silk suture ligatures.
A couple of small bleeding points were found on the right corner of the anastomosis and these were repaired with interrupted horizontal pledgeted mattress sutures of 3-0 Prolene.
We then took the graft and trimmed it to an appropriate length, and a second end-to-end anastomosis was fashioned between the graft and distal aorta with a running continuous suture of 2-0 Prolene using the standard graft inclusion technique.
One or two bleeding points in the distal anastomosis were encountered and these were repaired similarly with horizontal pledgeted mattress sutures of 3-0 Prolene.
The activated clotting time was checked, and the heparin was then fully reversed with protamine.
The internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles were closed in a single layer with a running continuous suture of double-stranded #1-PDS, and the external oblique was closed with a separate running continuous suture of double-stranded #1-PDS.
Some subcutaneous sutures of 3-0 Vicryl were used to line up the skin properly, and the skin was closed with skin staples.
A dry sterile dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] open excision and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm on [**2187-2-27**].
Postoperatively he remained intubated and was transferred to the cardiovascular ICU with an epidural and a small amount of pressors.
He was started on a CIWA scale for agitation.
On POD 3 his platelets count dropped to 75 so his heparin was stopped and anti-heparin antibody was found to be negative.
He received an additional 2 units on POD 4, and this time his hematocrit bumped appropriately and subsequently remained stable.
He was also febrile and was started on Cipro empirically.
He complained of abdominal distension and constipation, so was started on a bowel regimen with good result.
He received several doses of lasix and diuresed well.
