Question of insulin allergy.
The patient had been on NPH x 20 years.
However, in [**2162-10-9**], he reports fairly abrupt onset of urticarial reactions he described as daily and co-relating with his insulin administration.
Over the last several months, has changed insulin regimens without any improvement in urticaria.
The patient now being admitted for improved blood sugar control in the setting of steroids and management of urticaria to determine if remedies can be made to the question of insulin allergy.
Operational workup thus far has shown specific IgG antibody negative on multiple insulin regimens.
NovoLog insulin 20/30 units subcutaneously t.i.d.
Medrol 4 mg p.o.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
Doxepin 10 mg p.o.
Hydroxyzine 25 mg p.o.
Chemistries:  Sodium 136, potassium 6.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3, glucose 420, calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.7, and phosphorus 3.5.
In the past, he had tried multiple insulin regimens and had reported reactions with all types of insulin.
Initially, the plan was for the patient to be tapered off of his Medrol dosing and also tapered off antihistamines.
His reactions were somewhat unique for true insulin allergy, given the fact that there was no local reaction at the site where the syringe entered the skin.
Records from outside hospitals did in fact show that he has a positive antiGAD antibody and negative C- peptide antibody, showing that in fact he was type 1 diabetes and would require insulin for treatment.
There ultimately was a trend towards moving patient towards shorter-acting insulins and even a, thought about possibly insulin pump.
The patient, at this time was not ready for his pump and at this point was not felt to be a good candidate, since he was somewhat unreliable in his self-administration of insulin as an outpatient.
Ultimately, after several days of continued reactions to largely longer-acting insulins, it was thought the next step would be to move the patient to the ICU for an insulin-desensitization trial.
He did travel to the ICU midway through his hospital course and underwent desensitization with a Regular insulin IV drip, which went without complications.
The protocol was provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] and [**Last Name (un) **].
The patient initially did well following insulin desensitization, tolerating Regular insulin without reactions.
However, 1-2 days after his ICU stay, patient had another reaction, which he thought was secondary to Regular insulin administration.
The reaction was in the evening, although later on early in the morning, patient received Regular insulin again without a reaction.
After having been abstaining from all antihistamines x 2 days and using Medrol at higher doses to mitigate urticarial reactions, patient underwent skin testing for various insulins.
The plan at this point was to restart patient on Lantus and a sliding scale insulin [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations.
Meanwhile, he was initiated on a steroid taper and was started back on antihistamines.
Diabetes:  As mentioned above, the patient initially admitted for question of an insulin allergy and for further assistance of management of diabetes in the setting of high-dose steroids.
Ultimately he was found to be a type 1 diabetic based upon results of antiGAD antibodies and C-peptide antibodies.
He will be continued on atenolol 50 mg p.o.
CAD:  The patient was started on low-dose aspirin 81 mg and Lipitor, in addition to his beta-blocker, for history of CAD.
Transient hyperkalemia:  The patient had several episodes of hyperkalemia, asymptomatic, without ECG changes.
For this reason, an ACE inhibitor was not started even though the patient has diabetes.
