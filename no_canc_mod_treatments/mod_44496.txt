Was proptly evaluated by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 35880**] from the stroke team, MRI confirmed the diagnosis of stroke and since he met the NINDS criteria, he was treated with IV 0.9 mg/kg of IV tPA.
Finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin, no ataxia on the right.
Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus were also normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Blood pressure was controlled with a Labetalol drip and following TPA, Mr. [**Known lastname 54239**] actually did well.
After  a long discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] from the Vascular Surgery team, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] form the NES/INR team and the stroke team it was deicided that it was prudent not to operate emergently and he was started on heparin.
Urology was consulted who inserted a Foley catheter and started a three-way irrigation.
Fenestram and Flomax was started and Levaquin was started for a presumptive urinary tract infection.
Vascular Surgery at that point, decided that the patient should not be anti-coagulated on Coumadin long- term prior to repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The Foley catheter irrigation continued through [**2140-12-26**].
In addition, a transesophageal echocardiogram was considered, but since Vascular Surgery requested no anti-coagulation on the patient, no change in therapy would result from getting the test so we deferred the transesophageal echocardiogram.
The patient's head was put down to flat and he was given intravenous hydration.
He remained somewhat confused because it is likely that his urinary tract infection had not cleared and Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy recommended placement at rehabilitation.
