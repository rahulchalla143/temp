Admission Date:  [**2190-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-11-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: sudden onset headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2190-7-3**] DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM WITH COILING OF ACA ANEURYSM [**2190-7-3**] PLACEMENT OF RIGHT FRONTAL EXTERNAL VENTRICULAR DRAIN [**2190-7-11**] PLACEMENT OF RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ALSIUS CATHETER [**2190-7-22**] PEG PLACEMENT   History of Present Illness: HPI: The patient is a 71 year old woman who had a sudden onset headache this AM around 11-12noon with nausea and vomiting.
Aneurysm at the bifurcation of right anterior cerebral artery A2 segment pointing towards the left side in the interhemispheric region.
An endotracheal tube is visualized with the tip at approximately 2.9 cm from the carina.
An NG tube is also visualized in the stomach with the tip not clearly visualized, however the distal sideport is clearly distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube is visualized with the tip at approximately 2.9 cm from the carina.
NG tube appears in the stomach.
She had an emergent ventriculostomy placed and she was brought for coiling of the aneurysm.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left common carotid artery arteriogram, left vertebral artery arteriogram, right vertebral artery arteriogram, right internal carotid artery arteriogram, right common femoral artery arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common femoral artery puncture site.
INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Coil embolization of right A2 aneurysm with Target coils.
Access was gained to the right common femoral artery using a Seldinger technique and a 6 French vascular sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.
We now exchanged out the [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter for an Envoy 6 French catheter in the right internal carotid artery.
Following this, the aneurysm was catheterized with an SL-10 microcatheter and a Synchro microwire.
The seizures appear to begin from the left frontal region and then spread to bilateral frontal regions and occasionally diffusely.
The seizures appear to begin from the left frontal region and then spread to bilateral frontal regions and occasionally diffusely.
Seizures were less frequent than on prior recordings but still occupied nearly 50% of the recording each lasting from [**1-/2109**] minutes.
There is a coil pack in the anterior interhemispheric fissure with streak artifact.
The left vertebral artery is hypoplastic when compared to the right as demonstrated on prior studies.
LENIS [**2190-7-12**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
Seizures were much less frequent and briefer than on prior recordings.
EEG [**2190-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent bifrontal (L>R) epileptiform discharges occasionally in semi-periodic runs.
Her exam improved after the EVD placement and a she was able to be extubated on [**2190-7-4**].
The EVD was distally and proximally flushed with NS and the EVD then began to drain appropiately.
A load of Dilantin was given and Dilantin 100mg TID was started.
She remained on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
In the evening she had some L arm shaking that was observed and self resolved within a few minutes, EEG was on.
Her oxygenation had decreased on Friday eve and a CXR was performed which appeared stable, she was given Lasix 10mg x1.
Her IV fluids were discontinued.
She was bolused with Dilantin and her maintenance dose was increased to 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She had an Alcius catheter placed for fevers that were thought to be central in nature.
On [**7-14**], her blood pressures have been labile and required two agents and a couple of boluses of albumin.
Evaluation of her CTA revealed no evidence of vasospasm and she was taken off pressors on [**7-14**].
EEG monitoring revealed sub-clinical seizures on the 27 th and 28th, she was bolused several times with dilantin and her dilantin level was increased on [**7-16**] to 300 [**Hospital1 **].
The pt pulled out her NGT and was bright enough for bedside trial of oral intake, but will need a PEG placed on this hospitalization as her PO intake is not adequate to sustain her nutritional needs.
PEG was placed on [**7-22**] withought incident.
The patient is being screened for a rehab facility and was given a bed for [**7-24**] but the family refused placement as they wanted a different facility.
