He was admitted to the ICU and given over 5 L fluids, started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, including flagyl, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.
His antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin and flagyl and after two days on the general wards without complications, he was discharged on levofloxacin for 11 days to treat a presumed UTI.
This was thought secondary to withdrawal of betablockade (patient's beta blockers had been held when he came in with low blood pressure).
The patient was controlled with oral beta-blockers, but sporadically had HR at roughly 90-100 while on the floor.
He was asymptomatic and was discharged on his previous dose of oral betablocker.
His beta-blocker could be titrated up at his long term facility as managed by his primary care physician.
DM: The patient was controlled on insulin sliding scale.
His metformin was held until the day before discharge because of receiving CT. .
He would benefit from iron therapy in the outpatient setting.
