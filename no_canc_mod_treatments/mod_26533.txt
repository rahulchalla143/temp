Admission Date:  [**2163-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Heart catheterization   History of Present Illness: 76 yo WF with PMH of CAD s/p MI, ?CVA, HTN, tobacco abuse and CRI, who presents with chest pain.
At the time, EMT believed her to be in SVT/RAF and gave adenosine 6mg x3 and diltiazem 18mg IV.
She was given ASA 325mg x1, Plavix 300mg x1, morphine 2mg x1, Lopressor 5mg x1, and started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt with resolution of ECG changes.
In addition, she was started on insulin gtt at 6 units/hour for a FSBG of >500.
An attempt was made to cross the RCA lesion with a guide wire, however she developed bradycardia with transient heart block.
She was given Atropine which resulted in tachycardia with possible Afib.
She was given protamine to reverse the hep gtt thinking this episode of hypotension may have been due to tamponade.
Physical Exam: VS: HR: 90, BP: 112/50, RR: 12, SaO2: 100% on NC at 2L GEN: obese elderly female in NAD but alternating between lethargic and interacting.
Resting hemodynamics after onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventriular response demonstrated severely elevated filling pressures including mean right atrial pressure of 27 mmHg and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 mmHg.
After restoration of sinus rhythm and balloon pump insertion, hemodynamics markedly improved with mean right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, PCWP mean of 10 mmHg, and cardiac index of 3.2 L/min/m2.
Given the episode of decompensation in the cath lab and the chronic nature of her occlusion, it was decided that no further attempts at catheterization would be attempted, and the patient was medically optimized on ASA, Lisinopril, and Lipitor.
Plavix was not considered to be necessary in the absence of stenting.
A stat TTE performed in the cath lab during her episode of decompensation revealed a severely depressed LV function with an EF of [**10-7**]%, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed emergently.
Her outpatient regimen of Digoxin was discontinued in the absence of heart failure at time of discharge.
Through her hospital course, she was up titrated on her beta-blocker and AceI as tolerated by her BP, with goals to maintain SBP <130 and HR <70.
She was eventually transitioned from an insulin gtt to SSI coverage and finally to oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with good control.
In the setting of CAD, she was started on an oral TZD [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and instructed to follow-up with her PCP for further management.
She received diabetic nutritional counseling prior to discharge.
With post-cath hydration of bicarb in D5W, her renal failure resolved and creatinine treanded towards her baseline.
In the setting of improved renal function, her AceI and diuretic medications were up titrated.
Although she was recently started on prednisone for her gout we will avoid this medication given the NSTEMI and potential for "thinning" the LV resulting in free wall perforation.
Instead a regimen of allopurinol and colchicine were dosed renally; other alternatives such as NSAIDS or prednisone were considered to be less desirable.
FEN: Patient was started on a cardiac, diabetic, diet with careful repletion of electrolytes to keep k>4 and Mg>2.
She was discharged with home VNA services for monitoring of vital signs, assistance with her new medication regimen, and diabetic teaching.
