The hematocrit on the day prior to admission was 43.4.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells with a repeat hematocrit of 39.
The patient was also given 2 L normal saline and an additional 2.5 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 4.25.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, and the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg. White blood count was 16.2 with 14% bands.
Status post right hip replacement.
MEDICATIONS AT REHABILITATION:  Lipitor 20 mg q.d., Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d., Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.d., Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Coumadin 2.5-3.0 mg q.d., Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Atrovent 1-2 puffs q.i.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Multivitamin 1 tab q.d., regular Insulin sliding scale, Promote with fiber, free water boluses 150 cc.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  On admission the patient was intubated and sedated but was bleeding from his nares and oropharynx.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 16.6, hematocrit 29.2, platelet count 365; CHEM7 with a sodium of 143, potassium 4.2, chloride 97, bicarb 24, BUN 35, creatinine 1.1, glucose 176; PT 47.3, PTT 51.6, INR 4.25; urinalysis negative; initial ABG on presentation was pH 7.44, pCO2 34, pO2 78, on 100% FIO2 assist control, PEEP 5.
Hematology:  The patient had a significant nasopharyngeal bleed and was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells at an outside hospital.
The patient's Coumadin was reversed with 2 [**Location 35950**] and Vitamin K.  The patient's Aspirin and Coumadin were held during the course of the hospitalization.
The patient's bleeding was believed to be an upper respiratory source while on supratherapeutic Coumadin.
No mass was noted; however, the endotracheal tube partially obstructed the view.
The patient was eventually stable on vent setting to pressure support [**4-9**], FIO2 at 40%.
He was empirically started on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was started on Vancomycin.
The patient completed a 14-day course of Vancomycin on [**10-1**].
The patient was started on Mellaril 50 mg t.i.d.
No antibiotics were added at that time.
On [**10-3**], the patient received a bedside tracheostomy with no complications.
The patient was given fluids and packed red blood cells.
On admission the patient required blood pressure support with Levophed.
Approximately five days later on [**9-19**], the patient was weaned off Levophed and did not require pressure medications for the duration of the hospital course.
This was treated with Vancomycin because the sputum subsequently grew out MRSA.
On [**9-25**], the patient's white count was elevated to 19.8, and the patient was started on a 14-day course of Levaquin 500 mg q.24.
Neurologic:  The patient is status post stroke times two.
On [**9-20**], the patient was weaned off sedation which was Ativan and Morphine.
FEN:  The patient received tube feeds through an orogastric tube.
Initially the patient was receiving Promote with fiber at 95 cc/hr.
He was subsequently changed to Respalor at 60 cc/hr because Respalor is a more concentrated tube feed.
The patient received fluid boluses to maintain urine output.
A PEG was placed [**10-5**] for long-term nutrition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin 20 mg q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Ipratropium 2 puffs q.6, Lansoprazole 15 mg q.d., Levothyroxine 500 mg q.d., Solu-Medrol 2 puffs b.i.d., Thioridazine 50 mg t.i.d.
