Labs were remarkalbe for Troponin 1.05, CKMB 16.3.
Patient given ASA, morphine, with relief of chest pain and started on heparin gtt.
She was taken for emergent cath which showed a thrombus in the LAD thrombectomy was performed and a BMS placed.
A baloon pump was placed and she underwent rapid sequence intubation with 10mg etomidate and 80mg rocuronium.
After 30 minutes return of circulation was achieved.
Tandem heart catheter was initially placed in the left artrium and she developed hypotension, ECHO showed severely dialated RV.
The catheter was pulled into the right atrium and she was placed on ECMO.
She was started on dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine drips.
On arrival to the ICU she was intubated on assist control tidal volume 460, rr 22, 100%FiO2, Peep of 5, initial vitals were bp:106/93 p87 on norephinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-)Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: None -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: None -PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HIV/AIDS HCV HTN ?Renal failure (in OMR though renal fx fine here) CVA CAD s/p IMI (per EKG)in [**2183**] cervical low grade SIL from core bx R DVT [**2185**] tx w/ enoxaparin  Social History: The patient reports living alone in [**Hospital1 778**] but has 3 PCA's that help her during the day and part of the night.
CXR ([**2191-7-22**]): The presumed TandemHeart catheter extends from the upper abdomen where it passes out of view to the SVC at the level of the azygos insertion.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Right subclavian infusion port ends in the upper SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular failure hypotension and PEA arrest.
She was placed on ventricular assist device and pressors to maintain mean arterial blood pressure >70.
Within 24 hours, she was able to be weaned from all pressors except epinephrine, however her tandem heart required increasing volume requirements (up to 11L in first 24 hr, along with multiple infusions of albumin) to maintain VAD 3.0-3.5L/min.
She was gradually weaned off epinephrine and transitioned to vasopressin.
Given her increasing fluid requirements, she developed anasarca with multiple fluid filled blisters diffusely.
Because of decreased urine output and continued volume overload, she was started on a lasix drip.
She became hypotensive with MAPs in the 50s and required additional norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure.
She received 30 minutes of chest compressions which may have been suboptimal as tandem heart was being placed.
Once rewarmed, she became intermittently agitated, tachypnic, fighting the vent and pulling at lines, requiring very high doses of sedation with versed and fentanyl.
She was plavix loaded in the cath lab, and was started on atorvastatin.
ACE and beta blocker were withheld given hypotension.
# Metabolic acidosis: Lactate level was 12.2 on arrival to the CCU, likely related prolonged cardiac arrest with end-organ ischemia.
She was started on a bicarb drip for her metabolic acidosis and required frequent adjustments in bicarb drips and her sweep to maintain adequate acid/base balance.
#HIV: HAART was held in setting of acute illness.
# Goals of care: Given prolonged cardiac arrest, unresponsiveness and multiple co-morbidities, prognosis was poor.
Extensive conversations were held with family regarding pt prognosis.
