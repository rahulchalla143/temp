HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old Caucasian female with a history of hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and a large hepatic cyst, who underwent attempted laparoscopic cystectomy and marsupialization of the cyst at an outside institution.
This required massive resuscitation and blood transfusion.
Eventually patient was discharged home and returned several weeks later with jaundice and ascites.
Bile was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity and a transampullary stent was placed.
The following day she was taken to the interventional suite where she underwent placement right and left percutaneous transhepatic catheters.
A J-tube was placed at this time as well as multiple catheters in the subphrenic space on the right side as well as in Morison pouch to collect any residual abscess.
Over the next several days she required increasing oxygen support and eventually was placed on a ventilator.
She had multiple episodes of diarrhea which had been treated for C.diff colitis at the outside institution and the cultures did not grow Clostridium difficile at this institution.
Due to continued fever and chills, she was taken back to the interventional suite where an 8 French pigtail catheter was placed into the remnant cyst cavity.
The catheter drained approximately 40 to 50 cc of bile stained fluid on a daily basis, the cultures of which also grew Enterococcus and gram negative rods.
She remained on IV antibiotic therapy and supportive treatment for some time.
Eventually she was able to be weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
