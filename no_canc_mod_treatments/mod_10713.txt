Therefore, this prompted an emergent transfer to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac revascularization and he was sent here on both intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin drips.
He remained pain free on his heparin and nitroglycerin drips through the night and the next morning was taken to the Operating Room.
On [**2102-5-4**] the patient had coronary artery bypass graft times four.
His grafts were left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to diagonal.
