History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83900**] who is an 86-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, First and second-degree Wenckebach AV block, severe aortic valve stenosis, systolic congestive heart failure, presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion and need of tissue AVR scheduled for [**2127-4-21**] presenting to CCU for aspirin desensitization.
His history of aspirin "allergy" was from >40 yrs ago where he reports ?shortness of breath, but unclear if had true anaphylaxis- regardless he was told not to ever take the drug again.
From an AS standpoint, he was not deemed high enough surgical risk for Core Valve and thus given his progression of symptoms with dyspnea with minimal exertion, decision was made to proceed with AVR.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
