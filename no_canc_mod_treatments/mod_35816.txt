[**2163-7-29**] CXR: In comparison with previous study of [**7-27**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with continued small bilateral effusions in a patient with intact sternal sutures and previous CABG and valve replacement.
Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended to diagnose endocarditis if clinically indicated.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 y/o WF with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, systolic CHF with EF 25-30%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation initially admitted to hospital with CHF exacerbation, now with VISA line related bacteremia (6/6 bottles).
# VISA bacteremia/sepsis: Patient spiked fever on [**7-27**], blood cultures drawn which grew GPCs in pairs and clusters and was intially started on vancomycin.
This line was removed on [**2163-8-2**] and switched over a wire given concerns that patient would not agree to additional procedure for line placement.
However, when blood cx from [**2163-8-2**] cont to grow VISA the line was removed on [**8-4**] and patient given 72 hr line holiday.
She had a new tunnelled HD cath placed on [**2163-8-8**] (this was re-sited and placed on the left) as well as a right sided PICC line placed.
Patient was followed by the infectious disease service who has recommended a 4 week course of daptomycin ([**Date range (3) 106288**]).
# Dyspnea/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Most likely due to acute on chronic systolic heart failure given history, fluid overload on physical exam, and radiographic findings.
Pneumonia was unlikely given lack of cough, fever, leukocytosis, or focal CXR findings.
Her dyspnea responded well to dialysis treatment and her oxygen saturation remained stabely in the high 90's on [**1-7**] liters of oxygen.
# CKD/ESRD on HD - Pt has been on dialysis for past 6 months via R Quintin.
New HD line planed on [**2163-8-8**] and dialysis treatments resumed.
Calcitriol was stopped on this admission per the renal team as she receives zemplar at HD.
Would suggest restarting metoprolol succinate in the future if blood pressure can tolerate this.
# Anemia: Hematocrit levels were measured daily and a slow trending down was noted.
Patient received epo with HD.
Iron studies pending at time of discharge which renal has agreed to follow as pt may require IV iron with HD.
She was continued on her outpatient regimen of amiodarone.
As noted above, her metoprolol was held given episodes of hypotension in setting of infection.
