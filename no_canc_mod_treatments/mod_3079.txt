Risks and benefits of surgery were offered after surgical consult was obtained.
PREPARATION:  The patient was taken to operating room after intravenous antibiotics were administered.
Venodyne boots were placed and activated.
Dissection of the anterior abdominal fascia performed with electrocautery.
A gastrotomy was made, and a gastrojejunostomy tube was passed through this opening with the tip in the proximal jejunum.
The balloon of the gastric portion was inflated, the pursestring suture was closed, and the stomach was sutured to the anterior abdominal wall at the entry site of the gastrojejunostomy tube with 3-0 silk sutures.
The skin was reapproximated with skin staples.
The tube was then secured to the skin with 2-0 nylon suture.
Sponge, sharp and instrument counts correct x2 prior to closure.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] was present for the entire procedure per HCFA regulations.
Swallow Study:  BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  HISTORY: Thank you for consulting on this 60 y/o female with CAD (s/p MI x2 and stent '[**93**] and '[**01**]) and COPD on home O2 who woke up with severe abdominal pain causing SOB and left shoulder pain resolved who was found with perforated duodenal ulcer and peritonitis.
She went to the OR on [**2203-7-28**] for prmimary repair with G-J tube placement.
She has been taking ice chips without difficulty, but we were asked to perform a bedside swallow evaluation prior to advancing the pt to a diet.
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: The pt did not present with any overt signs of aspiration today at the bedside and would recommend advancing her to a PO diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids.
CXRs following her respiratory arrest do not appear to indicate aspiration from oral and pharyngeal dysphagia, but cannot rule out aspiration from reflux / tube feedings from this evaluation.
It is recommended that the pt have repeat CXRs as her diet is advanced to monitor for changes.
Suggest advancing the pt to a PO diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids.
Attempt giving pills with thin liquids.
A central line was placed, IV fluids and antibiotics were initiated, and she was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
Her ulcer was repaired and [**Location (un) **]-patched; a gastrojejunostomy tube was placed.
She tolerated the procedure well.
Because of her compromised pulmonary status prior to surgery she remained intubated post-procedure and was taken to the ICU for further care.
Postoperatively, her vent settings were weaned to extubate, and she was extubated on POD 1 without event.
Tube feedings were started per jejunostomy tube.
Hydrocortisone was provided for adrenal support as she was on high-dose steroids prior to admission for COPD exacerbation.
On admission a small are of stage 2 skin breakdown was noted at her coccyx and upper back: duoderm was placed.
Low dose prednisone was started at 10mg.
Primary care medicine saw her and wrote a brief note in agreement with current low dose steroid treatment and recommended increased bronchodilator treatment, which was followed.
H. pylori antibody test was negative.
Later that day she was found with respiratory distress; respiratory rate in the 40s and oxygen saturation in the low 80s on NRB mask.
Lasix was given without adequate response and she was intubated and transferred to the ICU.
On POD 8 a right upper extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out DVT as her arm was swollen.
On POD 9 her respiratory culture was positive for pseudomonas and her antibiotic therapy was changed to Zosyn.
At this point her tube feeds were started back, metoprolol was added for cardiac protection, and Lasix was provided as needed to prevent pulmonary edema.
A swallow study was completed, and per recommendation she was advanced to thin liquids and soft solids.
She was transferred to the floor with aspiration precautions.
At POD 15 her bowel function had fully returned and her foley catheter was removed.
On POD 16 a PICC line was placed in planning for IV antibiotics at discharge and her central line removed.
She was able to swallow her medications without problems.
Tube feeds remained for main nutritional support.
Fiber was added to her tube feeds to improve her loose stools.
