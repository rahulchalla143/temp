LINE PLACEMENT  Reason: Please eval for line position  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old woman with altered MS, now s/p L basilic picc placement.
Median sternotomy wires and a mitral valve replacement are in place.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present and appears well seated and leaflet motion is visualized.
([**Numeric Identifier 105335**])         Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo woman with PMH of DMII , Mitral valve replacement not on coumadin , HTN , CVA [**2151**] with R sided hemiparesis, admitted for NKHOS, with rapid afib, large [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] clot, hypotension, and RLL PNA.
Was given 1.5 L of NS in ED and given insulin drip.
Since d/c drip and initiation of SC insulin, had intermittently high blood sugars to 400s, usually after meals; this was better controlled w/ higher basal insulin and tighter sliding scale.
Would continue on this regimen w/ adjustments as necessary at rehab facility.
# thrombocytopenia - Pt had a left atrial clot seen on ECHO during this admission and was started on heparin drip.
Started argatroban and coumadin w/ INR initially in therapeutic range of [**4-20**] and within goal PTT of 60-80.
According to [**Hospital1 18**] pharmacy guidelines, we felt that her INR was more than twice the level expected for concurrent coumadin/argatroban therapy (2 days total).
Therefore, we stopped argatroban for 4 hours and rechecked PTT/INR.
Given that the bleeding risk w/ restarting argatroban was high, and HIT antibody was still pending, she was given a dose of coumadin 2mg and rechecked her INR in the afternoon.
It remained stable at 1.9, and she was given the evening dose of coumadin 2mg.
She will need to have her level checked on [**1-18**] to ensure that coumadin is at therapeutic dose.
Started on levofloxacin on [**1-12**] - will complete 7 day course on [**2157-1-20**].
She was initially started on heparin drip, but this was discontinued due to possible HIT.
Digoxin and metoprolol for rate control, and she seems to be tolerating this well - would check digoxin levels after discharge.
Currently rate controlled on digoxin and metoprolol.
This continued to improve w/ oral fluid intake.
Covered w/ levaquin and will have f/u U/A after abx completed to ensure that infection has cleared.
Will continue anticoagulation for now.
Now back to normal after IV hydration.
# porcine MVR: was not anticoagulated prior to admission and does not require anticoagulation specifically for the valve .
# PPx: PPI, anticoagulated, bowel regimen .
# Access- PICC [**1-12**] and peripheral IV .
