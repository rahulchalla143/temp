He received multiple bolluses of Crystalloid and ultimately was stabilized on pressors.
The patient was started on Levaquin, Flagyl and Tobramycin, although Tobramycin was also ultimately discontinued and Vancomycin was started.
He developed a gastrointestinal bleed and was ultimately intubated for airway protection on [**2193-6-9**].
Shortly thereafter patient's renal function ultimately deteriorated and he was started on CVVHD.
Right femoral neck fracture, status post open reduction,    internal fixation on [**2190-9-7**], procedure complicated    by MRSA infection.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Protonix 40 mg IV b.i.d., hydrocortisone 100 mg t.i.d., sliding scale insulin, Ceftriaxone, octreotide drip approximately 15 mg q 1 hours, Tylenol p.r.n., Bactrim, Fentanyl drip, total parenteral nutrition, intermittent CVVHD.
LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, CO2 24, BUN 110, creatinine 6.7, glucose 75, hematocrit 23, platelets 63, calcium 8.6, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 2.1.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Shortly after arrival in the intensive care unit the patient's right internal jugular catheter was immediately exchanged for a catheter capable of accepting a Swan.
Preparations were made at that time for additional inotropic support as well as CVVHD.
Infectious disease consultation felt that the patient had multiple possible sources for sepsis and final antibiotic course regimen including Vancomycin, meropenum, caspofungin was selected.
At that time HIV testing was necessary to assess patient's candidacy for transplant.
Hospital days 2 through 4 patient's pressor requirements continued to increasing including Neo-Synephrine drip which at that time was 1.25.
A delicate balance had to be maintained for diuresis and dialysis needs which were maintained using CVVHD and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure maintenance.
Despite expansion of the antibiotic regimen patient's white count continued to increase peaking at 24.6 on hospital day 4.
Given the patient's increasing coagulopathy, sepsis and circulatory collapse he was not longer being considered a good candidate for liver recipient and the family's request was thought to not be unreasonable.
In accordance with their request pressors were withdrawn and ventilator settings were changed to room air.
