SMV, splenic and portal vein thrombosis.
No gas is seen within these fluid collections at this time.
Numerous abdominal collaterals and mild splenomegaly consistent with portal hypertension due to the thrombosis.
This may not be a clinically significant finding, however, could possibly be seen in pyelonephritis and therefore correlation with urinalysis recommended.
Abdominal CT showed hemorrhage and near-complete de-vascularization of the pancreas with necrosis.
Patient was seen in consultation by [**Last Name (un) **] and started on Lantus with a sliding scale with resultant good control of his blood sugars.
He received extensive teaching regarding his diabetes and insulin.
Fevers Patient was febrile on presentation to the ICU and was empirically treated with Meropenem for five days.
He received an empiric course of Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl for 48 hours, which was also stopped when repeat cultures were again negative.
Colonoscopy was deferred given his complex hospital course but should be completed as an outpatient.
He was started on iron supplementation.
Portal vein/superior mesenteric vein thrombosis Patient seen in consultation by general surgery and hepatology, who recommended anticoagulation given the risk of mesenteric ischemia with SMV thrombosis.
The patient was started initially on a Heparin to Coumadin bridge with 5mg of Coumadin daily, but quickly became supratherapeutic with an INR to 4.0 after only two doses of Coumadin.
After his INR decreased he was re-started on heparin bridge with coumadin 2.5mg daily.
His INR was rising very slowly, and his coumadin was again increased to 5mg daily.
He received 5mg coumadin for the last 2 days prior to discharge, and his INR increased only from 1.1 to 1.4.
He was discharged with lovenox and coumadin with plans to have his INR rechecked 48 hours after discharge.
He was continued on coumadin 5mg daily upon discharge.
No evidence of primary liver disease or cirrhosis noted on imaging or endoscopy; very low suspicion for HIT given one negative HIT antibody and the steady rise in his platelet count early in his hospital course while on Heparin.
Due to concern for bleeding from this aneurysm, he was recommended to undergo a coiling procedure with IR.
He underwent angiography with IR, but no pseudoaneurysm was seen.
