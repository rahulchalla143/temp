He received aspirin, beta blocker, heparin, morphine sulfate and nitrates.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department where he was given Integrilin and pain control with morphine.
The left main, left anterior descending artery and left circumflex were normal.
The right coronary artery was primarily occluded with extensive dissection and thrombus.
This was anterior jetted times two and a proximal stent was placed.
Resting hemodynamics showed markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with pseudo-constrictures in a pattern indicative of right ventricular infarction.
Primary revascularization of the RCA was done using a three vessel times 33 stent with good results.
Post PTCA he had hypotension and he was transiently started on dopamine at 5 mcg and transiently went into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 116.
Dopamine was turned off and his atrial fibrillation stopped.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in V3 through V4 and right-sided leads with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V4R consistent with proximal right coronary artery involvement with right ventricular involvement.
SUMMARY:  This is a 46-year-old male with an acute myocardial infarction involving right ventricle, significant proximal RCA clot and dissection status post PTCA and stenting.
Cardiology: A.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient was placed on aspirin and Plavix.
Was on Integrilin drip status post 18 hours after the procedure.
Started on beta blocker and left on 25 of Toprol XL.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor leaving on 5 mg of Zestril and a statin of 10 of Lipitor.
Patient initially presented on dopamine to the Intensive Care Unit.
He was weaned off dopamine and bolused intravenous fluids.
B:  Pump:  Patient, as stated earlier, was started on ACE inhibitor.
Following regional wall abnormalities:  Basal anterior septal HK, basal inferior septal AK, basal inferior AK, mid inferior AK, basal inferolateral AK, septal apex AK, inferior apex AK, apex AK.
He, during his stay here, would ___________ to 88% but did complain of feeling fatigued and tired prior to presenting as well as he has a positive pressure airway device at home.
Toprol XL 25 q. day.
Zestril 5 mg q. day.
Lipitor 10 mg q. day.
Plavix 75 mg q. day.
Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets p.r.n.
