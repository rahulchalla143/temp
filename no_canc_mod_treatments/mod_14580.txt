Admission Date: [**2177-1-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2177-1-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-5-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   REASON FOR ADMISSION:  On [**1-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for scheduled pulmonic valve repair, and right ventricular aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a planned biatrial maze procedure.
The patient was on Coumadin for a preoperative history of cerebrovascular accident.
At that time,    he was found to have anomalous left coronary artery off    the right coronary artery which was sacrificed and    complicated by emergent coronary artery bypass grafting    with a vein graft to the LAD and circumflex with    augmentation of the right ventricular outflow tract for    right ventricular outflow tract outflow postoperatively.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enalapril 5 mg p.o.
twice daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
once daily, Lasix 20 mg p.o.
once daily, atenolol 25 mg p.o.
once daily, Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
once daily, Coumadin (dosing usually 5 mg but this varied), trazodone (unknown dose), and baclofen as needed.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A MRI in [**2175-12-28**] showed a dilated right ventricle with severe dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 21 percent, unobstructed RV/PA homograft, mild proximal PA narrowing bilaterally at the insertion of the conduit, mild left ventricular dysfunction, with an ejection fraction on the left side of 45 percent, dilated ascending aorta to 3.2 cm, vein graft to RCA had calcified disease, the RCA from the right coronary cuff was rotated clockwise, the graft in the aorta to the LAD and circumflex was patent, and the left anomalous vein was occluded.
The LAD and circumflex graft was patent.
On [**1-15**], the patient underwent a redo sternotomy with a vein graft to the left anterior descending, coronary artery bypass grafting times one, biatrial radiofrequency maze, pulmonic valve replacement with 27 pericardial tissue valve, and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a 24-mm gel weave graft.
The patient also had right ventricular plication and intraaortic balloon pump was placed.
He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in critical condition on a Levophed drip, a milrinone drip, an epinephrine drip, and atrioventricular pacing.
He was on an amiodarone drip at 1 mg a minute, a Levophed drip at 0.4 mcg/kg/min, a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, a propofol drip at 30.
The patient was also on an insulin drip and epinephrine 0.13 mcg/kg/min.
He remained on maximal pressure support as well as some inotropic support.
He remained intubated and sedated, requiring increasing support as well as ventilatory support.
On postoperative day one, a right femoral arterial line was placed for monitoring his hemodynamics and a right femoral Quinton catheter was placed to initiate continuous venovenous hemodialysis after the patient's very long pump run for management of his fluid volume status.
He remained on maximal support at this time; intubated and sedate with an intraaortic balloon pump.
Total bypass time was 7 hours and 40 minutes.
Over the course of the evening, the patient required very high doses of pressors and multiple rounds of blood products.
He remained intubated and in critical condition.
Vascular Surgery was consulted because it was determined that the patient would need ECMO and were trying to fashion a Dacron graft off the right femoral artery to use for ECMO cannula.
The plan was to sew two grafts to the right femoral artery and perfuse the graft while decannulated in the left femoral artery to allow the patient to have antegrade and retrograde flow on the ECMO to provide for the amount of time it was needed off ECMO.
[**Last Name (STitle) 59847**]at evening - at approximately 8:30 - the patient was doing very poorly even on ECMO overnight.
A discussion was held with the family given the patient's extremely poor prognosis on maximal support with ECMO.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times one,    redo sternotomy by atrial maze procedure, pulmonic valve    replacement/reconstruction right ventricular outflow tract    with gel weave graft, right ventricular plication, an    intraaortic balloon pump  placement.
Status post emergent ECMO placement.
Status post congenital repair of tetralogy of Fallot with    surgeries in [**2134**], [**2139**], and reconstruction of the right    ventricular outflow tract and bypass surgery in [**Month (only) 404**] of    [**2166**].
