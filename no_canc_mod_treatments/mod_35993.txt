Discharge Instructions: You were initially admitted for pain control after your cervical surgery.
You will continue on IV antibiotics and steroids at home to continue to treat both these conditions.
This is a side effect of the steroids and should normalize as you stop taking them.
You were started on a medication to help control your sugars called metformin.
In conjunction with the pain service here, we found a pain control regimen that appears to control your pain relatively well.
This may be altered in the future but you should continue this regimen for the time being.
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, aspirin, Ibuprofen etc.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
