is an 85 year-old right-handed man with a history  of CAD s/p CABG and placement of 3 stents, pacer/defibrillator, and severe chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, who was in his usual state of health when he fell asleep for a nap on the day of admission, then awakened a number of hours later with slurred speech, left facial droop (witnessed by pt's son), and inability to raise left arm (also witnessed by patient's son).
As at baseline he has occasional tremors of arms and legs when he sits up from bed and complains of numbness in the first three fingers of his left hand, which has been going on for years.
Per OMR, he was neurology service in [**10-3**] for evaluation of a similar episode, involving dysarthria and truncal ataxia.
He was also noted to have glove and stocking distribution sensorimotor neuropathy, steppage gait, and bilateral foot drop.
He was diagnosed with Vitamin B12 deficiency (for which he continues treatment) and a probable midline cerebellar stroke, although MRI imaging could not be obtained due to the pacemaker.
There is evidence for superimposed, severe, median neuropathies at both wrists (as in bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome); the left is chronic and ongoing.

He uses a walker at baseline.
-DTRs: 1+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle jerks bilaterally.
-gait: Narrow-based, normal arm swing.
He underwent a Right ICA stent on [**2102-7-5**], with complications of hypotension and confusion/delerium.
His goal SBP> 120 to prevent hypoperfusion to the CNS, so he was taken off all antihypertensives during his stay.
His pressures stabilized off the medications and ran from SBP 110-130's.
He was kept on aspirin and plavix s/p TIA and for his CAD.
He was seen by Neurology, who recommended a work-up for infection vs. metabolic vs. hypoperfusion causes.
He was then screened for placement to rehab.
However, starting the 13th, his mental status once again began to decline and the patient became confused, with hallucinations and agiation.
Neurology and Psychiatry were consulted, and their recommendations included r/o infection, d/c Zyprexa and Seroquel (use Haldol for agitation), and possibly repeat a head CT if his confusion continues.
He occasionally requires Ativan or Haldol at night for sleep.
Most likely his confusion is a result of many factors, including his lengthy hospital stay, hypoperfusion injury, possibly underlying dementia, and his medications (primarily Zyprexa and Seroquel, which were d/c'd).
