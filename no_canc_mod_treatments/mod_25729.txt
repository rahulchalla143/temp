[**2171-11-2**] Left PICC [**2171-11-10**] Right PICC   History of Present Illness: 67 year old male presented to the ED today from his PCP's office after having 4 days of abdominal pain.
Past Surgical History: Umbilical hernia repair with mesh.
Esophageal distention and gastric distention likely due to positioning of the tip of the NG tube within the jejunal limb of the gastrojejunostomy.
NG tube could be withdrawn by approximately 6 cm to achieve gastric positioning.
Status post sigmoidectomy with left end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.
Suctioning of the NG tube is recommended to prevent aspiration of the oral contrast.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin based on          the detection of inducible resistance .

Brief Hospital Course: On [**2171-10-17**], the patient was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole and transferred emergently to the operating theatre for perforated viscus, given peritoneal signs and significant free intra-abdominal air.
Post-operatively, he was admitted to the SICU on acute care surgery and resuscitated.
He was extubated, and on [**2171-10-21**], he was started on tube feeds through an NGT placed distal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis.
Unfortunately he went back to the ICU on [**2171-10-26**] as he had a series of problems which culminated with rigors and a temperature of 101.1, desaturation to 77% on 5LNC and a chest CT consistent with aspiration.
Issues leading up to it were rapid afib, a distended abdomen, intolerant of tube feedings and some brief Vtach.
His atrial fibrillation was short lived and he then continued on Lopressor.
In the interim he received both enteral feedings and eventually hyperalimentation when his post pyloric feeding tube came out.
His surgical wound was healing well and his ostomy was pink and in time began to function.
He underwent frequent clamping trials with his nasogastric tube, initially failing but in time successful.
He gradually was started on liquids and over 48 hours was advanced to regular without any nausea or vomiting.
He had 2 sets of blood cultures drawn and his PICC line was removed.
He was placed on IV Vancomycin and improved within 24 hours.
Another PICC line was placed so that TPN could continue however in the interim his GI tract opened up and his diet was advanced.
He was evaluated by the Infectious Disease service and they recommended a 4 week course of IV Vancomycin with weekly folow up of his renal function and CBC.
His current dose of Vancomycin is 1 GM every 8 hours and his last trough was 18.9 on [**2171-11-12**].
He will continue on that dose until [**2171-12-5**] and will have home IV therapy service for assistance.
The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy service followed him daily and as he progress he was independent and getting stronger.
