Cardiac surgery and Pulmonary was consulted to comment on his candidacy for AVR and he was deemed to be a poor open surgical candidate due to his existing comorbidities, but possibly for percutaneous valve replacement in the future.
The patient improved on IV solumedrol.
He was given an albuterol neb, which per pt worsened his SOB.
In OSH ED he recieved adenosine 18 mg total which failed to break his tachypnea, and he was also noted to be tachycardic into the 150s; he also recieved IV lopressor and was transferred to ICU where he was placed on BIPAP and given dilt 10 mg IV which [**Last Name (un) 4662**] HR down to 120s.

Today the patient developed acture respiratory distress that was not responsive to IV lasix 80s or a Lasix gtt; the team felt that his [**Last Name **] problem was likely cardiac and mechanical, he should be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], patient had an a line placed c sbp in the 140/70, noted tachypnia at 33, and face mask o2 at 12 L. HR 114.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2L home O2 -Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus -Questionable history of syncope -History of pulmonary embolus in [**2120**] -GERD -left femoral aneurysm repaired [**7-/2133**] [**Hospital1 2025**] -AAA, infrarenal evaluated at 4.5cm on [**2133-7-16**] CT -recurrent pneumonia -lung nodules, stable -large pneumothorax requiring chest tube post-bronch [**2133**]  Social History: The patient is divorced.
Left PIC line ends at the origin of the left brachiocephalic vein.
CXR [**2134-1-12**] ET tube in standard placement.
Left PIC line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Heterogeneous opacification in the right mid and lower lung zone has improved, probably due to decreasing edema in the setting of severe emphysema, but the asymmetry still raises concern for extensive pneumonia particularly due to aspiration.
Resolving right pulmonary heterogenous opacity, either represents pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
CXR [**2133-1-16**] Tracheal and nasogastric tube have been removed.
There is a right IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory failure: Patient presented with large right-sided infiltrates, pulmonary edema, and baseline end-stage COPD on admission.
He was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix gtt and then transitioned to IV lasix on [**1-15**].
Successful extubation on [**2134-1-15**] with transition to BIPAP and then face mask.
He continued to be aggitated off sedation, olanzapine was traded for haldol around the On [**1-16**] while having CVL replaced and lying flat, developed significant dypsnea and increasing O2 requirement requiring re-intubation.
After speaking with patient's daughter, decision was made to take patient off BiPAP and make him CMO.
He expired roughly 45 minutes after removal of BiPAP.
Aggressively diuresed with lasix gtt.
It was determined that due to his multiple comorbidities, his increasing deconditioned status, as well as information gathered from family and friends stating he would not want to be institutionalized for a prolonged period of time, he would not be a candidate for valvuloplasty and/or percutaneous valve replacement.
Coumadin was held and he placed on a heparin gtt.
He became persistently tachycardic throughout hospilization, worsening with extubation and fever.
He was loaded on a diltiazem drip and heparin gtt with heart rates persistently in the 130s and SBPs in the 120-130s.
On HD 5 he was put on amiodarone gtt.
