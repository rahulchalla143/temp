Admission Date:  [**2119-4-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2119-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-6-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft with ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%, diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease, transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for Swan-Ganz placement and hemodynamic monitoring on [**2119-4-27**].
While at the outside hospital, the patient's Lasix and ACE inhibitor had been held and the patient subsequently experienced an approximately 10 kilogram weight gain over that time.
Use of his ACE inhibitor was limited secondary to low blood pressure.
The patient was subsequently started on a Milrinone drip on [**2119-4-14**].
Milrinone was temporarily discontinued for his ventricular tachycardia.
His digoxin was discontinued and his electrolytes were aggressively repleted.
On [**2119-4-27**], the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for more aggressive hemodynamic monitoring with a Swan-Ganz catheter as well as continuation of the Milrinone drip.
The patient subsequently had his dose of Milrinone titrated up.
Amiodarone for control of his arrhythmias and to prevent firing of the AICD.
He ultimately required loading with intravenous Amiodarone which better controlled his ectopy.
Following that deployment, the patient was started on intravenous as opposed to p.o.
Amiodarone as noted above.
Over the next several days, the patient became progressively more hypotensive despite withdrawal of his Carvedilol, limiting of his diuresis and decreased dose of his Milrinone.
Several family meetings were held over the course of the final week of his life to discuss code status and withdrawal of care and emphasis on comfort.
Following repeat family meeting on [**2119-5-4**], and repeat discussion with the patient, Milrinone was discontinued for hypotension.
The patient was continued on his other cardiac medications.
