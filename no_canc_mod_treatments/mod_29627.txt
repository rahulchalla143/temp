Admission Date:  [**2144-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-9-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: GI bleeding, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2145-9-23**] DART Chest tube insertion [**2144-9-25**] Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 89 year old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, seizure disorder, and recent fall with resultant pelvic fracture, hypertension, history of rectal prolapse and constipation who initially presented with acute blood loss anemia from lower GI bleeding.
However, the patient has been noted to have no additional bleeding and was additionally noted to have pneumothorax from CVL placement and tachycardia for which endoscopy was delayed.
Given relative stability since initial presentation and cessation of bleeding, decision was made to forego endoscopy at that time.
[**Name (NI) 6**] Echocardiogram was obtained which was revealing for a hyperdynamic LVEF >75% and severe resting LVOT gradient and moderate to severe Mitral regurgitation.
The patient was seen by cardiology with impression LVOT was likely secondary to longstanding hypertension and now hypovolemia with recommendation to continue beta blockade, maintain normovolemia, and avoid medications that might dramatically lower preload or afterload.
Of additional note the patient experienced a complication of a right apical pneumothorax in setting of attempted IJ line placement in the ED.
The patient has subsequently had a DART chest tube placed by IR with subsequent near resolution of pneumothorax.
After patient transfer, [**Name (NI) 653**] by lab that 2 bottles from single set of blood cultures from the CVL placement had grown out gram positive cocci, which initially were treated with vancomycin, but ultimately were judged to be contaminant, given no fever and negative peripheral cultures.
A CT Abdomen revealed a stricture, but no mass, so surgery was consulted, who felt no immediate need for surgery given lack of obstruction.
The patient was previously on Topamax 100mg [**Hospital1 **], but this was decreased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] due to concerns about drowsiness due to the Topamax Hypertension rectal prolapse hearing loss hip fracture hyponatremia   This was thought to be due to HCTZ which was discontinued.

COLONSCOPY [**2144-9-25**]: Findings: Lumen: A stricture was noted at the sigmoid colon with friable surrounding mucosa.
The stricture was confirmed on CT but no obvious mass seen - Patient had not had further bleeding x72 hours at time of discharge - Hematocrit has been stable at time of discharge - Given stricture in the sigmoid, we obtained a surgical consult, who concurred that watchful waiting is best given her high risk for surgery, and the lack of obstruction or other surgical lesions.
- She is being treated for colitis with Cipro and Flagyl to finish on [**2144-9-30**].
- She was placed on oxygen and monitored by serial CXR - After 24 hours with lack of improvement a DART chest tube was placed by interventional radiology.
