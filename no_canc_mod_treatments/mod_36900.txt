Levofloxacin and vancomycin were started and continued throughout.
Initially required a bicarb infusion given worsening acidemia and increasing lactate levels.
PA catheter numbers obtained but did not provide clear evidence for sepsis or pump related failure.
2.PNA/COPD/Resp Failure: Pt treated empirically with levoflox and vancomycin for PNA.
He was therefore intubated for respiratory failure.
After initial improvement, he remained dependent on mechanical ventilation despite multiple weaning attempts.
Agitation and sedation requirements also played a role.
Levo was changed to cefepime for pseudomonal coverage given continued need for mechanical ventilation with persistent secretions.
3.COPD:Pt was started on dexamethasone for COPD and possible adrenal insuff given on chronic steroids.
A cortisol level returned very elevated at >100 though, and the steroids were weaned down.
Also had hydralazine and nitro gtt as his BP would tolerate to attempt afterload reduction.
Soon though, he became relatively hypotensive, so all BP lowering medds had to be held.
With persistent low BPs, phenylephrine was added in addition to IVF boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
Picture had become unclear as to whether pt needed diuresis or what his CO was, so PA catheter was placed.
As noted above, CO was in nL range and SVR/PCWP were close to nL even off pressors so not consistent with either sepsis or cardiac failure.
6.FEN:Tube feeds were started for nutrition and poorly tolerated.
Placed on hydral and nitro gtt, as well as low dose BB.
He had been intubated for >1 week with no clear endpoint or easily reversible process.
The ventilator was disconnect vent once the family was all present.
