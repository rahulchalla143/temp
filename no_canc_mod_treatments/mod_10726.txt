Due to extensive cardiogenic shock, the patient was placed on maximum doses of Dopamine, Neo-Synephrine and Levophed as well as having an intra-aortic balloon pump placed before leaving the catheterization laboratory.
A temporary pacemaker was also inserted and he was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continuos hemodynamic monitoring of his cardiogenic shock.
ALLERGIES:  Rocephin and diazepam.
General:  Intubated and sedated, completely unresponsive to sternal rub.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Endotracheal tube and gastrostomy tube in place, pupils dilated, neck supple.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 20.2, hemoglobin 13.9, hematocrit 41, platelet count 151,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 12, BUN 38, creatinine 3.1, glucose 254, prothrombin time 22.6, partial thromboplastin time 124.1, INR 3.6, albumin 3.9, alkaline phosphatase 95, AST 428, ALT 106, total bilirubin 1.2, calcium 7.2, phosphorous 6.5 and magnesium 2.1.
Chest x-ray confirmed proper endotracheal tube placement with mild pulmonary congestion, consistent with congestive heart failure.
