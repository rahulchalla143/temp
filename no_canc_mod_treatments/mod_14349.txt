Admission Date:  [**2102-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-9-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2031-4-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Alendronic Acid / Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: diaphoresis, bilateral shoulder pain, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: catherization with proximal left anterior descending stent placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 71 year old female with a h/o hypercholestrolemia but no known coronary disease, 50+ pack year tobacco history who was at [**Hospital1 18**] for an eye appointment when she experienced bilateral shoulder discomfort, diaphoresis, and nausea.
Subsequent catherization was significant for a 100% proximal LAD occlusion, and the patient recieved a PTCA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Hemodynamics at time of catherization showed  CO/CI 3.30/1.98 PA 23/15 PCWP 4.
She was started on pressors, fluids, and a balloon pump was placed to increase forward flow.
Patients hypotension eventually resolved with medical management, she was taken off of pressors, and her Hematocrit stabilized.
Osteoporosis 3.  s/p Cholecystectomy 4.  s/p Hysterectomy 5.
- Father had CABG surgery at age of 89.
Physical Exam: Post Cath VS:  98.0, 90/48, 95, 17, 100% 4L O2  GEN - lying flat, uncomfortable, alert and orientedX3 HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MM dry NECK: supple, JVP flat PULM: diffuse wheezing bilaterally, no rhonchi or stidor CV: RRR, 2/6 SEM at LUSB without radiation, distant heart sounds ABD: obese, baseline distension, tender in RLQ with no rebound/guarding/peritoneal signs, NABS EXTREMITIES: right groin bandage intact with sl ooze.
A right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter is present.
The patient is post cholecystectomy with clips seen in the gallbladder fossa.
A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.
Heparin and Integrilin were administered prophylactically.
The patient became somewhat hypotensive, requiring atropine and pressors, but the flow in the LAD and diagonal was normal after administration of diltiazem.
The stent was then post-dilated with a 3.5 x 9 mm NC Ranger at 16 atm and 14 atm.
Given the patient's persistent hypotension, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed through the right femoral arteriotomy site.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated low filling pressures, and fluids with peripheral vasconstrictors were administered.
The first diagonal branch was just after the LAD origin and the second was more distal, beyond the septal branch.
The patient's central aortic pressure was low throughout the case despite agressive IV fluid hydration.
When the blood pressure remained low, despite these interventions, an inta-aortic baloon pump was inserted.
At the end of the case, after several liters of IV saline, the patient's blood pressure had stabalized and doses of  pressors were actively being weaned back.
The patient's blood pressure at completion of the case had improved to ~90mmHg on 5mcg/kg/min  dopamine and 40mcg/min Neosynephrine.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course by System:  71 year old female with no known coronary disease presented with Anterior STEMI s/p proximal LAD [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] complicated by retroperitoneal bleed.
A.  Cardiovascular Ischemia:  Patient presented with diaphoresis, bilateral shoulder discomfort, and nausea.
Patient was taken for catherization where a 100% proximal LAD occlusion was found with a normal right coronary artery, left marginal, and left circumflex.
Pt was started on Integrillin and loaded with Plavix.
Integrillin was discontinued once retroperitoneal bleed was identified.
Patient remained on Simvastatin (adverse effects from Lipitor), Plavix, and ASA.
Once hypotension resolved, patient was put on and discharged on beta blocker and ACE-Inhibitor.
A Balloon Pump was placed to increase forward flow.
After catherization, patients hypotension continued and she was treated with pressors (dopamine + levophed).
Hypotension eventually resolved with medical management.
Patient was discharged on beta blocker and ACE-Inhibitor.
Patient was transfused with 4 [**Location **] and bleed resolved with medical management.
Patient was managed with sliding scale Insulin and achieved tight glucose control below 120 during hospital course.
D. Prophx Patient was given Senna/Colace for constipation prophx.
Due to retroperitoneal bleed, Heparin was avoided.
However, patient was on ASA and on venodynes for DVT prophx.
