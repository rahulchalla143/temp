PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 115, his blood pressure was 90/50, and oxygen saturation was 99% on a nonrebreather face mask.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed progressive pulmonary edema as compared to previous chest x-ray prior to noninvasive ventilation.
No evidence of pneumonia on current chest x-ray.
The patient was continued on ceftriaxone throughout his hospital stay for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on continuous positive airway pressure with good effect.
The patient's oxygen saturation remained in the low 90s on a nonrebreather and slowly improved on methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously q.6h.
The patient was slowly tapered on his intravenous steroids, and upon discharge was instructed to continue taking prednisone 40 mg by mouth every day ongoing until his appointment with his pulmonologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
At the time of discharge, the patient's respiratory status had improved markedly, and he was saturating in the low 90s on nasal cannula.
(b)  Congestive heart failure:  Due to his diastolic dysfunction, the patient's congestive heart failure was treated with intravenous Lasix during his stay in the hospital.
The patient was discharged with home dose of Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day  The patient was also maintained on his nebulizers throughout his hospital stay which were switched over to meter-dosed inhalers with good effect.

Therefore, the patient was just maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula or face mask with good effect.
