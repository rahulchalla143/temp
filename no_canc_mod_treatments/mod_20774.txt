The patient was placed on heparin drip and transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**].
The patient also had a history of transient ischemic attack with no residual and was placed on Coumadin prior to her admission.
Status post pacemaker insertion.
Status post left total hip replacement, [**2109**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Coumadin, Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Norvasc, Prilosec, Synthroid 125 mcg p.o.
once daily, Imdur 90 mg p.o.
once daily, Zestril 3 mg once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 85, saturation of 99 percent on three liters nasal cannula, blood pressure 130/70 with a respiratory rate of 16.
She had two plus bilateral radial pulses, two plus femoral pulse on the left.
Her right femoral artery had an A-line in place.
She was also started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Nitroglycerin drip helped to improve her blood pressure to the 130s systolic.
She continued in atrial fibrillation and remained on an intravenous heparin drip as well as receiving her beta blocker.
Additionally, the patient had some postoperative bleeding from her right groin site and required additional compression to avoid hematoma.
Heparin was held.
The patient was given an intravenous fluid bolus and was followed on the Cardiology service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], cardiologist, was also notified.
The following day, surgery was rescheduled but the patient that night spiked a temperature to 101.2 and surgery was again postponed.
A dental consult also revealed the patient had a retained root of a tooth which should probably be removed before surgery but it was unlikely to be the source of her fever.
Their recommendations were followed in terms of specific mouthwash for the patient to use.
The patient was also seen by the Infectious Disease consult team who recommended a full body scan for the patient's chest, abdomen and pelvis to look for any sources of her fever.
On [**2111-11-4**], the patient's right groin hematoma was approximately walnut sized with occasional droplets of bright red blood oozing.
The patient was cleared for surgery on [**2111-11-5**].
On [**2111-11-6**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to the diagonal and vein graft to the ramus.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit AV paced in stable condition on a Neo- Synephrine drip at 0.24 mcg/kg/min and propofol drip at 10 mcg/kg/min.
Recommendation was made that the patient get outpatient follow-up after discharge post bypass surgery to follow-up on the nodules.
Epicardial pacing wires remained in place.
On postoperative day one, the patient remained on an insulin drip at two units per hour.
The patient continued on perioperative antibiotics.
The patient was oriented though and following all commands and moving all four extremities.
Beta blockage was restarted with Lopressor.
Chest tubes remained in place.
On postoperative day two, the patient received two units of packed red blood cells which brought her hematocrit up to 31.
The patient was restarted on her Coumadin of 3 mg dose that evening and started on Captopril.
Chest tubes were pulled.
Lasix diuresis was begun and the patient was transferred out to the floor.
The patient continued on Coumadin 3 mg dose that evening.
Captopril was increased to 6.25 twice a day.
She was seen again by the Electrophysiology service on [**2111-11-9**] and recommended keeping the patient NPO that day so that she could have her generator changed the following morning as soon as she received Infectious Disease clearance.
On postoperative day six, the patient continued to have a little bit of confusion and restlessness the evening prior after her pacemaker change.
She continued on vancomycin perioperative antibiotics additionally to cover her pacemaker change.
The patient was encouraged to be more mobile with physical therapy but was stable.
Her Foley was removed and she continued on her Coumadin dosing for atrial fibrillation.
It was determined the patient would probably require discharge to rehabilitation as she was still requiring a sitter one to one.
On postoperative day five, discharge planning was begun and rehabilitation screens were also accomplished to allow the patient to go to an outside facility, to continue work with Physical Therapy and her general overall strength given her age.
She continued to progress and was using her rolling walker without any difficulty.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57323**], for an appointment in [**7-25**] days post discharge but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57323**] is also responsible for following the patient's Coumadin dosing and INR, phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33129**].
The patient was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her surgeon, in the office in approximately three weeks post discharge for her postoperative surgical visit.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four.
Status post pacemaker generator change.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
Synthroid 112 mcg p.o.
Pravachol 10 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
This evening's dose of Coumadin, 1 mg for the evening of    discharge, 1 mg for post discharge day one on [**2111-11-14**]    and [**2111-11-15**], then INR check and call results to Dr.    [**Last Name (STitle) 57323**] for additional Coumadin dosing.
