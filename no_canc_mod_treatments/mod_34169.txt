History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62 year old male with a cardiac history significant for four vessel CABG in [**2092**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] (now with patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM1 and occluded SVG-OM2 and SVG-RPDA), POBA of LCx in [**1-/2103**], and DES to proximal LCX in 5/[**2102**].
A catheter was placed, finding 1.5 L of retained urine.
He was febrile to 101.7 F at that time, and his antibiotic coverage was broadened from a planned week long course of Cipro to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
His antibiotics were changed to Zosyn in the setting of his worsening condition on [**2104-5-28**], and his clinical status slowly improved.
Blood pressures were reportedly as high as 200/100 at the OSH, and he was reportedly on an Esmolol drip for a brief period, but later titrated to Metoprolol 200 mg PO BID.
He had an NG tube in place and had been started on TPN for nutrition at the OSH.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for the absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # CAD: MI in [**2075**] and [**2078**] -- Four vessel CABG at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2092**] -- POBA of LCx on [**2103-2-2**] -- DES to LCx on [**2103-3-29**] # Hypertension # Hyperlipidemia # DM-type II (borderline) # Sleep apnea -- on CPAP # Arthritis -- mostly fingers # Hernia repair as an infant # Arthroscopy of the left knee  CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension  CARDIAC HISTORY: # CABG: Four vessel in [**2092**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] (patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM1, subsequently occluded SVG-OM2 and SVG-RPDA) # PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -- In [**2103-2-2**], he underwent PCI (POBA only due to difficulty delivering stent) of the origin LCX with 30-40% residual stenosis and stable mild dissection performed after recurrent angina and an abnormal nuclear stress.
-- In [**2103-3-29**], he had a repeat cath for progressive repeated angina.
Bivalirudin was commenced prophylactically.
The patient also receieved ASA and Plavix (chronically on 75 mg daily and was reloaded post procedure with additional 600 mg).
COMMENTS: 1- Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial-proximal LCX with a 3.0x15 mm Endeavor DES, post-dilated to 3.5.
HEENT: NG tube in place, NCAT.
Physical Exam on Transfer: VS: T 97.7(96.3-98.0), BP 142/86(130-153/83-94), HR 78(64-78) ....RR 18(16-18), SpO2 97(94-98) on RA, uses CPAP for sleep apnea ....Wt 100.2 kg today, 101.6 kg yesterday, 107.3 kg at admission Gen: Middle aged male in NAD.
Foley with yellow/brown urine and some sediment.
Skin: PICC line entry site with ecchymosis, no signs of infection.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2104-6-3**] 10:08 PM INDICATION: Confirmation of PICC line placement.
FINDINGS: Status post sternotomy and CABG.
The PICC line is inserted over the left upper extremity, the tip projects over the cavoatrial junction.
Low lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly without signs of pulmonary edema.
Exophytic sigmoid diverticulum is increasingly decompressed with an air-fluid level and communication with the urinary bladder is less well visualized given urinary bladder decompression with foley catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old male with a cardiac history significant for four vessel CABG in [**2092**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] (now with patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM1 and occluded SVG-OM2 and SVG-RPDA), POBA of LCx in [**1-/2103**], and DES to proximal LCX in 5/[**2102**].
His hospital course was complicated by continued fever, sepsis, and a subsequent NSTEMI due to demand ischemia with a Troponin of 1.57 at its peak.
He was treated with Cipro followed by Levo/Flagyl followed by Zosyn, and his clinical status improved.
He received cardiac and renal clearance for his surgery, which is planned for [**2104-6-12**].
There is communication of stool and gas into the bladder, though reduced since admission.
Patient was febrile as high as 104F with tachycardia at OSH, though he has been afebrile on Zosyn since the 14th.
The patient will need the fistula repaired, hopefully in the near future, as the patient will continue to have interrmittent UTIs and associated complications until the issue is addressed.
His Foley catheter continues to drain somewhat feculent urine, though much improved from the time of admission.
He was continued on Zosyn 2.25 g IV Q6H during his hospital stay.
Urology and Surgery were consulted and plan for surgery on [**2104-6-12**].
He was increased to full dose Aspirin and his other cardiac medications were continued except for his ACE inhibitor, which was held due to his reduced renal function.
Heparin was not appropriate as the event was greater than 48 hours ago and was most likely demans rather than thrombotic in origin.
He should not receive diuretics or ACE inhibitors given his [**Last Name (un) **].
He was started on a Nitro drip on admission, but maintained SBP 126-171 overnight on [**2104-6-4**] without the drip.
The Nitro drip was discontinued on [**2104-6-5**] and he was started on a low dose Nitro patch.
He continued to have elevated BP, so Hydralazine 25 mg PO Q6H was added with some improvement.
His blood pressures stabilized by [**2104-6-7**] on a combination of Metoprolol 200 mg PO BID, Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily, Hydralazine 25 mg PO Q6H, and Nitro Patch 0.2 mg/hr.
Anemia labs including iron panel, B12, folate, retic count, and repeat Hct were sent to work up his anemia.
After starting IV fluids on [**2104-6-8**], his Hct dropped to 28.6, likely due to hemodilution.
# Diarrhea: There was obvious concern for C.Diff given the multiple broad spectrum antibiotics he had taken recently.
It was kept as an active order, however, as Oxybutinin 5 mg PO Q8H PRN.
# Sleep Apnea: He was continued on CPAP while in hospital.
His oral diabetes medication were held while in the hospital and he was written for an ISS.
However, he required only minimal insulin during his stay since his glucose levels usually remained within a normal range.
# FEN/Lytes: On admission, the patient was NPO with an NG tube and was receiving TPN for bowel rest in setting of his fistula.
Surgery recommended advancing diet and discontinuing TPN on [**2104-6-6**].
His NG tube was pulled and he was started on clears, which was subsequently advanced to full liquids, and then a cardiac/diabetic diet.
Due to concern for GI losses, he was started on maintenance fluids, NS at 75 ml/hr.
Pt was transferred taken to the OR on [**2104-6-13**] with intention of performing a sigmoid colectomy and repair colovesicular fistula.
ENT was consulted and the patient was kept intubated and transferred to the ICU without surgery being performed.
He was extubated and started on clears two days later, and transferred to the floor on [**2104-6-15**].
Pt's post-extubation course was largely unremarkable with excellent pain control, nutritional support, continued dvt and pud prophylaxis, and improving physical exam and clinical picture.
One outstanding issue was blood pressure control with transient pressures as high as 170/100 which continued to be refractory to home dose metoprolol and amlodipine.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital to be evaluated for possible repair of your colovesicular fistula, an abnormal connection which developed between your colon and bladder.
Prior to your admission here, you developed a serious infection which put strain on your heart and caused a type of heart attack called a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).
Based on your medical records and evaluation in the hospital, it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would not be helpful, and that from a Cardiology perspective you would be safe for surgery.
Your recent illness also put strain on your kidneys, and caused a type of damage called Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN).
Some of your medications were stopped because they should not be used unless the kidneys are functioning properly.
You also had some kidney dysfunction after you were treated with Meropenum, an antibiotic used to treat diverticulitis.
Your blood pressure was significantly elevated when you were admitted to the hospital, and several changes were made to your BP medication regimen in order to bring it back down to a normal level.
These medication changes are also listed below.
General Surgery and Urology were consulted about repairing the colovesicular fistula.
The surgery was scheduled for Thursday [**2104-6-12**] but due to issues in the Operating Room inserting a nasogastric tube the surgery was cancelled and the ENT service performed an endoscopic examination to assess your anatomy for any abnormalities or injuries during the attempted nasogastric tube placement.
You can now be on a low residue diet and you will stay on suppressive antibiotic therapy until your elective operation which will be 3-5 months down the road as long as you remain free of any abdominal pain.
Please stop taking the following medications: STOP: Prinivil 10 mg Daily  Please continue taking the rest of your medications as prescribed on your discharge medication list.
