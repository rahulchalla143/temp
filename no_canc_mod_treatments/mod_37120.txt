Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Removal of HD catheter  History of Present Illness: 56M ESRD:PD here w/ lethargy and low blood pressure.
Pt has had fairly difficult course with multiple failed HD access as well as cath infections, recently started on peritoneal dialysis with occasional HD for fluid removal.
Combined HD/PD therapy has been instituted for the last two months, which is when patient's wife noted that he was becoming relatively hypotensive.
In addition, noted to have lower BP 60s- 100s, and notably more lethargic following hemodialysis and during hypotensive sessions.
Otherwise, was told to increase sodium intake outside of dialysis with some good effect on blood pressure, but recurrent lower extremity edema - which is primary measurement of fluid status.
ESRD: [**2-5**] anti-GBM disease, on HD since [**3-7**], then PD since [**9-9**] 2.

Once again, a right subclavian central venous line is visualized with its tip within the distal SVC.
The patient is noted to be status post cervical fusion with hardware unchanged compared to previous exam.
On Vanco (by level) for line infection; will continue on Vanco IP 2 grams with PD by level as an outpatient for a 2 week course (goal trough 15-20).
PNA- The patient was thought to possibly have pneumonia by CXR, as well as a new O2 requirement and cough; therefore he was initially treated empircally with levofloxacin then ceftriaxone ([**Date range (1) 101716**]).
However, repeat CXR was not suggestive of PNA; pt's pulmonary symptoms most likely due to volume overload; therefore ceftriaxone was discontinued.
# Hypotension/lethergy- likely due to intravascular volume depletion (despite total body fluid overload); correlates with timing of peritoneal dialysis.
