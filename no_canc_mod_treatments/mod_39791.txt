Admission Date:  [**2198-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-6-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**] Chief Complaint: 15-foot fall from ladder with sternal fx/mediastinal hematoma, R PTX, R rib fxs [**6-24**], T6-10/12 fx, L hemothorax  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-17**]: R chest tube placement [**12-18**]: L chest tube placement [**12-20**]: IVC filter placement [**12-19**]: R chest tube placement [**12-24**]: R chest tube placement  History of Present Illness: 69M s/p fall from a ladder, approximately [**9-30**] feet.
Patient was intubated and a right sided chest tube placed to evacuate the pneumothorax.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was evaluated by the Acute Care Surgery service who also consulted Thoracic Surgery to evaluate possible tracheobronchial injury.
Patient was admitted to TSICU, and blood pressures remained low despite aggressive fluid rescucitation.
A left chest tube was placed that drained 300 cc sanguinous fluid.
HEENT: Pupils: 1 and MR Resp: Intubated, coarse ventilator sounds, CTA anteriorly, unable to auscultate posteriorly due to precautions for spinal fractures.
Right sided chest tube with a 1 chamber air leak and serosanguinous discharge.
Small amount of sanguinous staining on right chest tube dressing.
Neck: cervical collar in place Lungs: R chest tube MAE spontaneously off sedation, not following commands.
CXR: Interval placement of the left chest tube.
Pneumothorax has nearly resolved with only a tiny right anterior pneumothorax remaining.
Significant right rib fractures, comminuted sternal fracture, and vertebral body fractures as described above.
[**2198-12-20**] KUB Fluoroscopic assistance was provided to the surgeon without the radiologist present.
A single fluoroscopic spot view demonstrates a deployed IVC filter with its tip at the lower edge of L2 vertebral body.
Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.4 cm above the carina.
Unchanged positions of bilateral chest tubes and endotracheal tube.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Neurosurgery recommended non-operative management with a TLSO brace which was maintained through his hospitalization.
Mr. [**Known lastname 92275**] was intubated and sedated upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
His sedation was a challenging issue, especially in the setting of weaning the ventilator and preventing harmful movements while in TLSO brace.
He was initially tried on precedex but did not tolerate well (became hypotensive and agitated, requiring intermittent haldol).
He was ultimately adequately sedated but required a multi-drug regimen consisting of clonidine, dilaudid, ativan, zyprexa, propofol.
When his acute delirium issues resolved, his regimen was tapered and he was alert and oriented x 3 and appropriate for the remainder of his [**Hospital **] hospital course.
CV: Hypotensive requiring aggressive resuscitation on arrival (7L crystalloid and 2 units PRBC on admission to ICU) with pressors in addition.
A chest tube was placed with 300 cc blood drained immediately.
Oxygenation improved and hew as weaned off of pressors on HD 3.
He remained HD stable through the rest of his course, not requiring additional pressors support.
Resp:  He had a right sided pneumothorax which was treated with a right CT placed at the outside hospital.
He had a left sided hemothorax which was treated with a left sided chest tube placed on admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU.
These remained in place, serial radiographs demonstrated resolution and they were dc'd on HD 5 without complication.
A CT scan was obtained on HD 12 to assess further and demonstrated a moderate to large amount of fluid, likely old blood, in his right chest cavity.
A chest tube was inserted at bedside and drained approximately 800 cc of old sanguinous fluid and then 250 cc the next day followed by minimal output on its third day (HD 14).
It was removed on HD 14 and post-pull CXR demonstrated a pneumothorax, prompting reinsertion of a chest tube on HD 15.
The pneumothorax resolved, the chest tube was placed to waterseal to good effect and on HD 17, the chest tube was removed without complication.
There were weaning trials post-operative from the IVC filter on HD 4 but unable to successfully wean to pressure support as he became increasingly tachypneic and agitated.
Lasix diuresis was continued over the course of the next several days and he was ultimately weaned to pressure support but continued to struggle with settings in the face of agitation and low pulmonary reserve (see neuro and above re: hemothorax).
It was determined that he would benefit from a trach for continued ventilator wean and on HD 10 he had a tracheostomy.
He failed a speech & swallow eval on HD 16 but then passed it on HD 18 at which point he was fitted for a PMV.
Was treated for a presumed VAP starting on [**2198-12-21**] (HD 5).
GI: Had an OGT initially through which was started on Replete with Fiber tube feeds on HD 3 and gradually advanced to goal.
The OGT was replaced with a dobhoff on HD 8.
Patient had a swallow study on HD 18.
GU: Foley catheter was placed to record urine output.
Lasix was used intermittently to remove excess fluid.
IVC filter was placed on [**2198-12-20**].
ID: Started on VAP bundle (vanc/cefep/cipro) for a presumed pneumonia on HD 5.
Patient completed at 14 day course of antibiotic therapy for his pneumonia.
You are now ready to continue to recover in your rehab facility.
- Continue tube feeds and flush PEG q4h with 50 cc of water.
Please gradually increase po intake and wean tube feeds - Continue your antibiotics until [**2199-1-11**]  Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
DO NOT USE THE PICC LINE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.Please keep the dressing clean and dry.
Contact your [**Name2 (NI) 269**] Nurse if the dressing comes undone or is significantly soiled for further instructions  Followup Instructions: Please follow up in 6 weeks at [**Hospital 4695**] clinic on [**2199-2-15**] at 11am for xrays at the Spine center at [**Location (un) 830**] ([**Location (un) 1385**] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building).
