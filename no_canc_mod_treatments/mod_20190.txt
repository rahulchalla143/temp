HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, COPD, status post multiple hospitalizations for this in the recent few months, new onset atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, moderate aortic stenosis, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2151-3-23**] with a COPD flare after being discharged two weeks prior with a  COPD flare.
The patient was initially treated with Levaquin for community-acquired pneumonia as well as steroids for a COPD exacerbation; however, he grew MRSA in his sputum culture on [**2151-4-12**].
He was started on vancomycin at that time.
In addition, he had new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that was treated with Diltiazem and then loaded with Amiodarone.
The patient was given Lovenox to a Coumadin bridge.
He was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2151-4-10**] for a hematocrit of 26.6 down from 36 on [**2151-4-6**].
On [**2151-4-12**], he had an episode of hypoxia with P02 66.8, PC02 58, saturating 92% on a nonrebreather mask.
COPD, status post multiple hospitalizations and flares.
MRSA pneumonia, as described in HPI.
Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Rifampin 600 mg q.d.
Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.d., day number one is approximately [**2151-4-12**].
Zovirax 400 mg p.o.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
For the patient's COPD, he was continued on nebulizer treatments.
He had completed a full course of steroids at [**Hospital3 **] prior to transfer and thus the patient was not started on IV steroid therapy.
The patient was very responsive to small doses of IV Lasix and was negative daily.
The patient was also continued on treatment of his multilobar pneumonia with IV vancomycin at 1 gram q.
The patient's hypoxia continued to improve and on the day of transfer to the floor, he was on [**4-27**] liters of nasal cannula with saturations greater than 93%.
METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PNEUMONIA: The patient began vancomycin therapy at approximately [**2151-4-12**], however, it is difficult to decipher in the transfer summary from [**Hospital3 **].
It was decided that the patient would have a 14 day course of IV antibiotics and thus a request for a PICC line was placed prior to transfer to the floor.
At the time of floor transfer, he is currently on Diltiazem 60 mg p.o.
The patient was Coumadin loaded at [**Hospital3 **].
The patient was started on a heparin drip and Coumadin was held during his ICU course with exception of one dose on the evening prior to transfer.
The patient was loaded with Amiodarone at the outside hospital and his dose was decreased in the Intensive Care Unit to 200 mg q.d.
He received three days of acetazolamide and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] repletion.
Diltiazem was also started in the setting of his rapid atrial fibrillation.
ANEMIA:  During the inpatient hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] it was noted that he had Guaiac positive stools with the need of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on pantoprazole as well as heparin drip, as above.
