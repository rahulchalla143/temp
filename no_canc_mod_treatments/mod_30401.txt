Admission Date: [**2166-6-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2166-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-2-1**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 60 year old female with three days of left sided abdominal pain worsening and associated with fever and some bright red blood per rectum, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy on [**2166-6-15**], by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for perforated diverticulitis.
She received a Hartmann pouch, descending colostomy and partial sigmoidectomy at that time.
She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] on the 16th with increasing white count and question of requiring a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
ALLERGIES:  Codeine, intravenous contrast and phenothiazine, although she tolerated intravenous contrast well during her stay.
Her previous history is also significant for exploratory laparotomy with hysterectomy, depression, gastroenteritis, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic back pain, morbid obesity, suicidal attempts on several occasions, interstitial cystitis, chronic UTIs, basal cell carcinoma status post excision, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Medication at home is Toprol XL 50 once a day.
Abdomen was extremely obese with a well healed, infraumbilical, midline incision without evidence of hernia.
Rectal revealed no masses and a posterior anal fissure, no evidence of hemorrhoids, no stool was felt on digital inspection within the lower rectal vault.
Urinalysis sent off after placement of Foley catheter was extremely positive, essentially draining pus which was positive for nitrites and white cells.
The patient was initially diagnosed with the suspicion of pyelonephritis and given wide spectrum antibiotics.
She was made NPO and fluid resuscitated.
Foley catheter was carefully monitored for fluid output.
She received serial abdominal exams as well as intravenous antibiotics.
Neurologically, the patient was initially on propofol, Ativan and morphine.
She was intubated and extubated postoperatively on the third postoperative day and she did well.
At this point we used propofol for sedation and comfort as well as morphine and Ativan.
After extubation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86**], she was eventually put back on IV Dilaudid and now p.o.
medications for pain control.
We continued her on a beta blocker and she did not have any ischemic changes or episodes that we could tell.
On [**6-24**] she suffered an episode of hypertension and tachycardia which were unexplained and presumed due to PE until workup could be conducted.
She was increased on Lopressor to 20 mg IV every six hours.
Hemodynamically remaining stable and she has continued on her beta blocker of Lopressor now 50 b.i.d.
From a respiratory point of view, the patient remained morbidly obese and incentive spirometry and out of bed were vigorously encouraged and helped with the patient.
Heparin was started empirically and continued.
From a respiratory point of view, after her successful extubation initially, she required emergent reintubation on [**6-24**].
The patient was initially nothing by mouth and continued on TPN for nutrition.
However, her ostomy started to function and she was allowed tube feeds which were stopped.
We then eventually were able to obtain a swallow study which demonstrated that she was cleared for bedside food as long as it was pureed and thickened honey nectar food.
She was too large for us to conduct a video pharyngeal radiological swallow, but she had been cleared by the speech and swallow department here for pureed and honey thickened foods.
She was receiving Prevacid and converted over to Protonix p.o.
On the 18th the patient received gallbladder percutaneous catheter placement for a positive HIDA which concerned us for cholecystitis.
This was placed by interventional radiology.
The patient received TPN until she was taking p.o.
She was diuresed gently with Lasix as needed and we are now holding her diuresis at this time on discharge for volume contraction with bicarb of 30.
Heparin was stopped and her bleeding resolved.
Heparin drip was not discontinued.
On the 14th she was changed over to vanco and ampicillin was discontinued.
She was on levo, Flagyl for broader coverage.
Fluconazole was started on the morning of the 16th for a persistently elevated white count and the A line grew out yeast as did one of her urine samples at [**Hospital1 **].
Urine sample since has been shown to be sterile.
BUN and creatinine are normal.
These were well covered by antibiotics she received at the time.
Vancomycin is being continued for presumed line infection at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from an A line which was infected as well as a sputum sample sent off at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] on the 17th which grew out MRSA.
She will receive a total of 14 days of these antibiotics and as of now she is on day 10 out of 14 with vanco and this should be discontinued on the 30th.
Levaquin and Flagyl have also been discontinued.
Her gallbladder continues to drain through the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
The patient proved to be somewhat insulin resistant, receiving insulin sliding scale and monitoring her sugars for tight blood sugar control.
The patient had a central line placed which was discontinued after a PICC line was placed on [**2166-7-3**].
She will keep this PICC line in until her antibiotics are done.
Perforated diverticulitis requiring emergency surgery.
Insulin resistance.
Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Heparin subcu 5000 units b.i.d.
Insulin sliding scale as noted starting at 120, range from    120 to 160, 2 units; range from 161 to 199, 4 units; 200    to 240, she should get 6 units; over that she should be at    the discretion of the house officer or rehab doctor    regarding tighter sugar control.
Vancomycin 1 gm q.12h., this should be off on [**7-9**].
All her diet should be pureed and honey thickened fluids nectars as well as the rest of her medications.
