woman with primary progressive MS [**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her nursing home.
Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV ventilation.
Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin, Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir.
Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given.
Hydrocortisone 80mg was also given.
Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**].
Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct.
Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for spasticity 2.
for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder.
Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to respiratory weakness 1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration 4.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: VS P 123 BP 129/73 O2Sat 97% on mechanical vent FiO2 0.50, 550, 15/5 General: older white female being mech ventilated through tracheostomy HEENT: pupils equal and reactive to light bilaterally 5-->3mm, MMM, trach site clean, attempted to bend pt's neck but remained stiff, unclear if that was volitional Chest: coarse breath sounds throughout Cardiac: sinus tach nl s1, s2, no s3, s4, no murmur appreciated Abd: soft, obese, distended +bowel sounds throughout; in RUQ, can appreciate outline of intrathecal baclofen pump, overlying skin appears mildly erythematous, feels warm to touch, but then again she feels warm to touch over the rest of her abdomen, erythema appears localized to skin overlying pump, no streaking.
Ext: cool feet, faint DPs, legs appear thin and wizened.
this could represent stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
GBS meningitis/bactermia In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on Gentamicin (for synergy).
Her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying pump in RUQ).
Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication.
Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone.
A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia.
On day #12 of gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of her treatment course.
Surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection.
She was started on vancomycin for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Vancomycin troughs should be checked often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.
That day she also spiked a temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course) and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).
She was taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
Multiple sclerosis Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal.
She continued on Baclofen 20mg qid po with an Ativan taper.
An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Respiratory status After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated.
(At baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation.
Pt placed on A/C in unit, then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask with good results.
BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids and pureed food.
She was made NPO and GI placed a PEG for feeding.
Pt should remain on tube feeds until her tracheal swelling is much improved.
