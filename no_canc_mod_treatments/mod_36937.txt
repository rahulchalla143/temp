The husband gave her some labetalol and tylenol without improvement.
She was placed on a nitroprusside drip and given haldol and ativan for agitation.
They were unable to obtain a head CT due to agitation so the patient was intubated and sedated with propofol and a head CT was performed; the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was negative for bleed.
Initially given antibiotics (Vanc/Cipro) for line infection and UTI, renal US showed signs of graft rejection, was hypertensive (up to SBP 220s) treated with labetalol and valsartan.
She was asymptomatic from the elevated BPs and underwent transplant nephrectomy on [**7-13**] without complications.
BP was 178/82 status post 10 mg IV hydralazine x 3.
After getting home dose meds (which consisted of valsartan, amlodipine, and labetolol) her BP came down to 167/78.
Labetalol was titrated up from 600mg [**Hospital1 **] to 800mg [**Hospital1 **].
Initially covered with pip/tazo and linezolid for a possible HAP, later held as not evidence of infection.
She was given 3 units of insulin for sugar of 160.
It was determined that her confusion was likely due to a combination of poor nutrition (improved with Thiamine), hypertension, hypoglycemia, and possibly hypothryoidism.

Patient was intubated for altered mental status in the ED to help protect airway.
She was agitated while intubated and was given multiple doses of haldol and ativan in the emergency room.
Neurology was consulted, and she was immediately given 4mg of intravenous ativan, after which EEG showed significantly decreased epileptiform activity.
She was immediately given two more doses of 2mg ativan intravenously and was kept on a video EEG event monitor overnight.
She was also loaded with Dilantin and started on Dilantin treatment for a couple of days.
Per Neurology recommendations, she was started empirically on acyclovir for possible HSV meningitis in addition to ceftriaxone and ampicillin for possible bacterial meningitis; of note, the patient has a listed allergy to vancomycin.
Ampicillin and Ceftriaxone were discontinued after another day.
Haldol and other antipsychotics were avoided for agitation because they have the potential to decrease the seizure threshold.
CXR was suggestive of PNA, and she had spiked a fever to 101.1F, so she was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Acyclovir/Ampicillin to cover HAP and meningitis.
On the floor, after patient was noted to be in nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the levofloxacin was discontinued because it can lower the seizure threshold.
End-Stage Renal Disease: Patient was followed by the Nephrology team and continued on Hemodialysis on her Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule.
She was continued on her home doses of sevelamer, cinacalcet, nephrocaps.
Malignant Hypertension: Patient was on nitroprusside drip in the ED.
She was started on a labetalol drip given toxic metabolites of nitropruside in the MICU.
The labetalol drip was weaned, and the patient was restarted on her home blood pressure medications, including labetolol 600mg TID, diovan 160mg [**Hospital1 **] (normally 320mg QD), amlodipine 10mg, doxazosin 2mg.
Hypothyroidism: TSH was elevated at 9.0 but was trending down from much higher level of 31 at previous check, so levothyroxine dose was left unchanged at 50mcg daily.
Clostridium difficile: Patient was noted to have a positive Clostridium difficile toxin test on [**2101-11-26**], so she was started on treatment with metronidazole.
Her total course of metronidazole will be 14 days, which will last for seven full days after her last dose of antibiotics.
Hyperparathyroidism/Hypercalcemia: Patient has history of primary hyperparathyroidism s/p surgical resection of parathyroid glands.
Her calcium level should be monitored on dialysis days; the calcium in the bath may need to be decreased further.
