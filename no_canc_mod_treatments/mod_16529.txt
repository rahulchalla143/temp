Admission Date:  [**2136-5-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-5-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NMED  Allergies: Phenytoin / Neosporin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**] Chief Complaint: seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement, intubation x two  History of Present Illness: 65 yo LH man with h/o metastatic melanoma, initially dx'd [**2134-1-8**] s/p wide local excision, recurrence in the right parotid gland, s/p radical neck dissection [**9-8**], s/p adjuvant local field irradiation from [**10-9**] to [**11-8**] and finally adjuvant alpha-interferon, [**Date range (1) 44733**].
He was initially put on dilantin but developed a rash and gradually was placed on keppra as well as decadron because MRI showed changes in the right temporal lobe consistent with radiation necrosis.
He was admitted again [**10-10**] and MRI showed no change but he was increased on his decadron.
He was kept on keppra and lamictal was added to his regimen.
He last saw Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology on [**2136-3-29**] and the plan was to remain on Keppra [**2131**] mg [**Hospital1 **] while the Lamictal was to be increased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] within one month or so.
In mid-[**Month (only) 116**] he was hospitalized with chest pain, underwent stress testing and subsequent cardiac catheterization with placement of an LAD stent.
This may have lasted 5 minutes and then EMS came and were able to give him 5mg valium iv and 1mg ativan iv.
She denies him having recent fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
CAD s/p LAD stent [**4-10**]   Social History: Social history: lives with girlfriend, she gives him all his medicines   Family History: family history of MI, no family history of melanoma  Physical Exam: On admission:  Examination: T 95.6 BP 150/100 HR 72 RR 16 98% 2l General: ill appearing in NAD, cushingoid face HEENT: MMM Lungs: CTA bilaterally CV: RRR Abd: soft, NT Ext: no pedal edema, no rashes, multiple ecchymoses.
Pertinent Results: Phenobarbital level on [**2136-7-5**] = 35.1  Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted on [**2136-5-21**] after having seizures on keppra 2g po bid, lamictal 100mg po bid and decadron 2mg po bid.
He was admitted to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] service initially but while waiting in the ED for a bed, he continued to have recurrent seizure activity (at least 3 additional ones) which were treated with ativan, and then depakote was loaded as a third anticonvulsant [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
A brief outline of his hospital course on neurology is as follows (also taken from Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 44735**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note of [**2136-6-8**]):  [**5-21**]: dexamethasone increased for 2mg to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] for temporal lobe necrosis secondary to XRT therapy, lamictal dose increased, loaded with depakote  [**5-23**]: experienced some shaking, given phenobarbital, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges over right hemisphere (PLEDS) seen on EEG  [**Date range (1) 44736**]: repeat head CT with no change from [**5-21**], no hemorrhage.
Continuous EEG showed spikes and slow waves thus patient was intubated on [**5-25**] for versed coma ([**Date range (1) **]) for burst suppression.
Patient required BP support, thus versed d/c'd.
[**5-25**]: anemic, requiring transfusions to keep hct>30 given CAD and recent stent placement in [**4-10**].
Also, spiked to 101.2 and started on ceftriax/vanco/flagyl for presumed aspiration pna  [**5-28**]: Urine growing enterococcus and sputum showing signs of infection, all [**Last Name (un) 36**] to levaquin so antibiotics changed to levofloxacin/flagyl.
[**5-31**]: vancomycin was added to levofloxacin as pt still spiking and WBC 20K.
[**6-6**]: extubated  [**Date range (1) **]: Patient started waking up (prolonged depressed mental status thought to be secondary to phenobarbital effect and post-ictal lethargy), alert, frontal signs- grasp, perseveration.
7/3-4: Still required frequent suctioning but able to follow commands, name some objects, somewhat perseverative.
7/5-6: Plastic surgery expressed a large hematoma by I/D  [**2142-6-13**]: Transferred to MICU service for persistent fevers, chronic aspirations, frequent respiratory care due to inability to handle secretions.
An infectious disease consult recommended two weeks of vancomycin and ceftazidime for MSSA nosocomial pneumonia, but this was only given for one week, starting [**6-14**] ending on [**6-21**].
[**6-17**]: (unable to find [**Month (only) 16**] from [**2143-6-16**]) Per resident's note: missed doses of keppra (8pm [**6-16**], 8am [**6-17**]), lamictal (8pm [**6-16**], 8am [**6-17**]), depakote (10pm [**6-16**], 6am [**6-17**], 2pm [**6-17**]).
The decision was made with the family's knowledge that since the depakote on top of the ASA and Plavix was prolonging bleeding time, he would be transitioned to phenobarbital, while keeping keppra and lamictal the same.
He did remain febrile, and vancomycin and ceftazidime were restarted for another week's course given that the original recommendations were for two weeks total.
Vancomycin was ultimately changed to oxacillin because of absence of MRSA organisms to finish off the week's course.
[**Date range (1) 44739**]: He was extubated [**7-3**] and remained stable, requiring only 2l nasal cannula and occasional suctioning and chest PT.
On [**7-4**], he received a PEG tube for feeding.
We verified with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] from neuro-oncology that he should stay on dexamethasone 3mg po bid indefinitely but that he will follow him in clinic along with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**] for seizures.
