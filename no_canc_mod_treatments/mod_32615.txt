Presented with lactate of 2.1, but down to 1.7 after 1 L NS resuscitation.
She was maintained at first on Bipap with sats >92% so was then weaned to NC with sats in the low 90s for most of the first hospital day.
When she fell asleep she did require CPAP with PS using full face mask set at IPAP of 15 and EPAP of 5 with 2-4L oxygen to maintain oxygen sats of 88-92%.
She was started on vanc/zosyn on [**2196-5-5**] for HCAP given that she lives in a [**Hospital3 **] and has had multiple recent hospital admission and her CXR had evidence of RLL infiltrate.
She was maintained on her home dose of lasix which was increased the day of admission (she takes 80mg PO at home and got 40mg IV here) for goal fluid balance net negative 500mL daily.
# ECG changes:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 4199**] hospital ED, patient was complaining of chest pain and given nitro paste.
She was started on asa while awaiting results of ROMI.
Aspirin was continued in place of coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
# COPD on home O2 (3-4L at baseline): On admission bicarb was at her baseline and her hypercarbia was at baseline with PCO2 of 76.
Also was on prednisone for recent exacerbation and was given 125mg solumedrol at [**Hospital 4199**] hospital.
Received scheduled Nebs and PRN for SOB.
Continued prednisone 20mg which should be tapered as she continues to improve.
# A fib on coumadin: She had a sub therapeutic INR of 1.7 on admission with good rate control with Cardizem and metoprolol.
She was continued on metoprolol for rate control.
Given the risk/benefit of coumadin in this patient, decision was made to treat with aspirin alone.
She was given 1 L NS in ED for lactate of 2.1 which improved to 1.7 after fluids.
Her CXR did not appear grossly fluid overloaded so lasix was initially held but as above over the day she had some increasing O2 requirements and she was given her recently increased home dose of lasix.
We recommend continuing with daily weights, maitain goal I/O at negative 500cc /day, titrating lasix and monitoring electrolytes as necessary.
# Chronic Aspiration - Patient should be maintain on aspiration precautions and dysphagia diet of pureed solids and nectar thickened liquids.
# hyperglycemia - In setting of steroids patient was noted to have elevated blood sugars.
A humalog sliding scale was started.
