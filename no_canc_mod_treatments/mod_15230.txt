Admission Date:  [**2170-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-7-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Sulfamethoxazole / Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / azithromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 50171**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH notable for atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, annulocalcific mitral valve disease, chronic kidney disease with recent creatinine of 1.78 ([**2170-6-6**]) who is transferred from OSH for management of fluid status and possible aspiration pneumonia.
Urology was consulted who recommended holding her coumadin briefly (later bridged with IV heparin) with IV ceftriaxone X 3 days and her hematuria resolved.
She was found to have a citrobacter UTI with sensitivity to zosyn and patient completed a course of zosyn X 7 days (finished [**6-26**]).
Cardiology was consulted on [**2170-6-27**] (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Houzen) due to intermittent episodes of dyspnea thought to be multifactorial from acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure superimposed on a aspiration vs. hospital acquired pneumonia/pneumonitis.
In addition to IV solumedrol and lengthening of zosyn course to 10 days for possible pneumonia, patient had received multiple doses of IV lasix (anywhere from 40-80mg IV boluses) due to vascular congestion.
Her weight on admission was 131 lbs which dropped to 128.6 with diuresis (weight was 125lbs on [**2170-6-6**] office visit).
She has a foley in place and denies any problems moving her bowels.

There is a left-sided pacemaker with distal lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle.
There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with the distal lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle which have intact leads.
There are again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which may represent an element of fluid overload.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ PMH of diastolic heart failure, afib and sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker placement and recent hematuria in the setting of an elevated INR who developed a possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and decompensated diastolic heart failure.
She underwent lasix diuresis to euvolemia and received antibiotics.
On further review of her history it was learned that she had undergone a barium swallow during which she had aspirated and it quite likely that the CT scan was showing this barium as the aspiration.
She came in on a [**8-14**] day course of IV Zosyn, and completed this regimen during her stay.
Her home regimen included 10mg po lasix qday.
This was likely [**3-8**] her diuresis at the outside hospital.
Nephrotoxic medications were held during her hospital stay, including her metformin, glipizide and losartan.
Her oral agents were held and she was started on ISS during her hospital stay.
#Sick-sinus syndrome/Atrial fibrillation- the patient was in Afib during this admission without any episodes of RVR or bradycardia while on monitor.
====================== MICU COURSE: On HD #3, patient developed increased respiratory distress on the floor with RR 40s (although satting in mid 90s on 3L NC).
She was started on Vanco + Levoquin to treat possible new HCAP and IV Solumedrol (presumably due to increased wheezing on exam) and transferred to the MICU for BiPAP and more intensive nursing care.
Levoquin was continued (last day [**2170-7-7**]).
CT chest was performed which showed BL patchy airspace opacities c/w pulm edema vs. multifocal pneumonia, and granular pleural opacities suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.
She remarked on numerous occasions about how miserable she was and how she did not understand the point of all of the tests or medications she was receiving as she was just going to get sick again.
On [**2170-7-6**], a palliative care meeting was held, and the patient's family made the decision to change her goals of care to comfort measures only.
