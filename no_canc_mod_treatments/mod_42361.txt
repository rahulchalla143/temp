History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer status post resection, hypertension, DVT on coumadin, and prostate disease who presented with respiratory distress.
100% oxygen face mask was administered with improvement in saturation to 75%.
He was given rocoronim and intubated due to inability to protect his airway and hypoxia.
He was also given 2 mg of narcan prior to intubation.
His initial ABG just after intubation was: 7.24, 88, 44, and shortly later was 7.32, 75, 250 on AC rate 12, PEEP 10.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated, sedated, and not responsive.
They report he was never on oxygen until his recent hospitalization.
Past Medical History: (per family and records from facility) - Stage III lung CA, non-small cell lung cancer, status-post right lower lob resection in [**2097**], chemotherapy not finished due to intolerance - Left lower extremity DVT - Fall at home - Squamous cell carcionma - BPH, status-post TURP - Hyperlipidemia - h/o MRSA - h/o colon polyps - Gall stones - History of acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, kidney stones, diverticulosis, and dehydration per facility notes - Possible silent myocardial infarction per family   Social History: Patient currently lives in a rehabilitation/nursing facility, though was living in an apartment alone prior to this.
HEENT: Tracheostomy in place, no icterus, multiple erythematous scaling plaques on face.
ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.
However, underlying lesion in the surgical bed cannot be ruled out, and followup to resolution is recommended following appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Further evaluation may be obtained with ultrasound on a nonurgent basis as indicated.
Coiled orogastric tube seen in the pharynx.
[**2102-3-1**] Abd U/S FINDINGS: Limited scan of the four quadrants was performed in order to evaluate for ascites.
He was started on antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia.
He was started on scopolamine to decrease his secretions.
Extubation was attempted twice and on both occasions he failed due to secretions and not attempting to clear them.
On [**2-15**] he developed a PNA by CXR and he was treated for a HAP.
He was originally started on vancomycin and cefepime.
His sputum grew Klebsiella ESBL and he was started on meropenem and treated for a total of 8 days.
Trach was originally delayed because of concern for the procedure so soon after his NSTEMI.
He was weaned off fentanyl and versed and placed on propofol.
He received a trach on [**2102-2-24**], an 8.0 Portex Per-Fit tracheostomy tube was placed percutaneously.
Patient was evaluated by the Neuromuscular team with EMG and it is thought that his failure to wean from the ventilator may be related to a critical care myopathy.
His urine was checked and was still positive for benzos and thus his AMS may be due to the versed still being removed from his system.
At this point, the patient should not get further haldol and zyprexa given cogwheeling on exam.
Hypertension: His BP meds were originally held given he had SBPs in the 100s.
At one point he became bradycardic to the 50s with SBP in the 60s after his ET tube was adjusted.
He required levophed for 5 minutes.
After his NSTEMI in the setting of a trial for extubation he was started on captopril and metoprolol.
Metoprolol was later discontinued as detailed below under bradycardia section.
BPH: His BPH medications were originally held given that his BP was on the low side and he had a foley in place.
He had been on heparin and coumadin for question of DVT at the OSH which was held.
His heparin and coumadin were discontinued.
He was started on metoprolol part way through his admission after he sustained his NSTEMI.
Patient was evaluated by EP and deemed that further intervention would not be appropriate given his other co-morbidites and that this was an isolated event.
The patient had been on anticoagulation for ?
DVT (see above) on transfer from OSH and subsequently started passing blood and clots in his urine.
Spoke with EP who recommended against anticoagulation given this recent bleed while on anticoagulation.
He was originally placed on an esmolol gtt but it had to be stopped due to being hypotensive in the 70s.
The b-blocker and ACE were titrated up as tolerated by his BP.
His lopressor was discontinued prior to discharge as detailed above.
He should continue to take is ASA 325 daily, Simvastain 80mg daily, and lisinopril .
FEN: He was originally NPO when intubated and was later started on tube feeds.
With [**Date Range **] in place, patient will be started on tube feeds .
PPX: heparin sc, bowel regimen, PPI .
