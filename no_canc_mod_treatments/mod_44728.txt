Repeated attempts at extraction were unsuccessful, and sphincterotomy with placement of a 5-cm by 10-Fr double pigtail biliary stent occurred.
She resumed her diet and was discharged on [**2142-2-21**] with 7-days of Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.
Her hemoglobin was reportedly 7.2 g/dL at the OSH and she was given 2L NS prior to transfer (her hemoglobin and hematocrit on discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] was 10.6 g/dL and 34.5%).
Of note, she has had a 27-lb weight loss over several months with worsening fatigue and associated decreased PO intake and nightsweats with chills.
She was given an additional 1L NS x 1 and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red cells.
Urinary incontinence (Interstim therapy in [**12/2140**]) 7. s/p appendectomy 8. s/p cholecystectomy (25 years prior) 9. s/p hysterectomy 10. s/p bilateral knee surgery [**40**].
s/p left wrist fusion surgery  Social History: Patient lives at home with daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren.
Pertinent Results: [**2142-2-22**] ERCP Procedures: Three epinephrine injections 2 cc each was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy [**Hospital1 **]-CAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy.
Complete hemostasis was achieved A 5cm by 10mm double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully.
Moderate amount of blood was noted in the second part of duodenum Three epinephrine injections 1 cc each was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy [**Hospital1 **]-CAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy Complete hemostasis was achieved A filling defect was noted at the lower CBD consistent with the previously noted stone.
A 5cm by 10mm double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully  (hemostasis, hemostasis, stent placement) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Transfuse pRBC and FFP as needed Q8hr hct checks NPO overnight until hct stabilizes and no evidence of active bleeding is noted.
A biliary stent courses along the expected route into the duodenum; there has been interval improvement in biliary ductal dilation.
The patient is status post cholecystectomy and surgical clips are seen in the gallbladder fossa.

# BRIGHT RED BLOOD PER RECTUM, FALLING HEMATOCRIT - Patient presented with rectal bleeding with hematochezia in the setting of recent ERCP that involved biliary stenting and sphincterotomy.
Hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL, hematocrit 18.3% (recent values 10.6 g/dL, 34.5%).
She received IVF and 4 units of packed red cells and 2 units of FFP, and 4 mg of PO vitamin K. She was urgently taken to ERCP ([**2-22**]) and pt was noted to have an acute arterial bleed at the recent sphincterotomy site.
The bleeeding was stopped during ERCP with epinepherine injection and electrocautery.
ERCP demonstrated 1-cm distal CBD stone which was unsuccessfully extracted and sphincterotomy with biliary stenting was performed on [**2143-2-20**].
Repeat ERCP visualized her retained stone and will need to be repeated in 1-month for further intervention.
She received post-procedural Cirpofloxacin 500 mg PO BID for 5-days from [**2-22**] (second ERCP) given her recent instrumentation.
# PANCREATIC HEAD MASS, WEIGHT LOSS - Despite her recent biliary stone obstruction with ERCP procedure, the patient also has also endorsed 27-lb weight loss over 3-weeks (on admission 69.3 kg).
Given Interstim placement for urinary issues, MRCP should be avoided.
Has also been on Ciprofloxacin for recent biliary instrumentation.
INR normalized after 2 units of FFP and vitamin K 4 mg PO.
# HYPERTENSION - Presented with diagnosis of hypertension and home regimen of beta-blocker and ACEI.
In the setting of GI bleeding concerns, her beta-blocker and ACEi were initially held.
Her blood pressure medications were resumed once her hematocrit stabilized.
# RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS - Patient reportedly has stable disease and has been on Percocet 5/325 mg PO 1-2 tabs PO Q4-6H PRN pain.
