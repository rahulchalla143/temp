In the Emergency Room, the patient was placed on a non-rebreather mask and her oxygen saturations came up to the mid 90's.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment and monitoring.
The     patient has a suprapubic catheter that is indwelling.
Neurontin, 300 mg per her G-tube in the morning, 600 mg per G-tube in the evening.
Dilantin, 125 mg G-tube b.i.d.. 3.
Protonix, 40 mg G-tube q d. 4.
Diazepam, 2 mg PO t.i.d.. 5.
Prozac, 10 mg PO q d. 6.
Thiamine, 100 mg PO q d. 7.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has known allergy to penicillin and vancomycin.
She has apparent Redman syndrome, although the patient has tolerated vancomycin in the past with slow infusion and premedication with Tylenol and Benadryl.
Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] is the health care proxy.
Her venous [**Name2 (NI) **] gas was 7.28, 64, and 52 on a non-rebreather.
Pulmonary:  The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure was deemed likely due to either a bronchitis with mucous secretions or an aspiration pneumonia superimposed on her neuromuscular dysfunction from her multiple sclerosis with poor pulmonary reserve.
The patient was treated empirically with levofloxacin for pneumonia, despite the clear chest x-ray, due to the heavy and copious secretions.
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent nebulized p.r.n..  To allow her to minimize secretions and to clear those secretions, she was treated with a scopolamine patch and with chest physical therapy.
Her mental status was due, likely, to a combination of her acute illness and the underlying multiple sclerosis, and it was deemed that her mental status was not far from [**Month/Year (2) 5348**].
The patient's Dilantin was held for a super therapeutic level and should be restarted when she has a level less than 20.
The patient was continued on her diazepam for spasm, and Prozac and Neurontin at their outpatient doses.
She was treated with levofloxacin empirically, and all the sputum, [**Month/Year (2) **], and urine cultures were still pending on [**6-15**], and the source of her low grade fevers and white cells in the urine was uncertain.
Should the patient ever have a brisk bright red [**Doctor Last Name **] GI bleed, the family would have to be notified as the patient would be extremely difficult to intubate and would need fiberoptic endotracheal tube placement for the EGD.
Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition:  The patient was continued on maintenance IV fluids through her hospital stay, and her tube feeds were restarted on [**6-15**].
