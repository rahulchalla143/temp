She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for urgent intervention due to the significantly progressive nature of this spreading erythema.
There was also warmth at the site and no obvious purulent drainage or signs of a punctum.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time, the patient was brought to the operating room for urgent intervention by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10656**] with a working diagnosis of abscess and cellulitis of the right breast.
She underwent at this time a left breast incision and drainage of the abscess with extensive debridement of necrotic tissue and skin.
Tissue from the breast was also sent for culture as well as biopsy at this time.
The wound was then irrigated and copiously packed with large Kerlix dressings with subsequent dressing changes to occur.
She was now on clindamycin, Zosyn and Vancomycin for broad spectrum empiric coverage.
She was now, at this time, able to be weaned off of Levophed on this first postoperative day.
Also infectious disease was consulted at this point due to this extensive infection and their recommendations at this point were to add Zosyn to the regimen but to continue the rest of the antibiotics until we had further data from the operating room cultures.
She was brought back to the operating room for a second debridement and to search for any other signs of infection or collection.
Concern at this point was due to the continued septic physiology and despite aggressive surgical treatment the prior day and broad spectrum antibiotics.
The plan continued to consist of aggressive resuscitation with goal to wean off the pressors that she was requiring.
At this point, we had an identification of organisms as gram positive cocci but was still awaiting speciation at this time.
The patient, at this point, was also on vasopressin per suggestion of the following general surgery team.
On postoperative day number 3, [**2-27**], the patient was started on tube feeds to provide enteral nutrition and was continued on pressors.
Infectious disease continued to follow the patient who suggested continued antibiotics unless we gained speciation, at which point they would recommend tailoring them.
On Sunday [**2-28**], the patient received a cortisone stimulation test which she did not respond to.
Hydrocortisone was started shortly thereafter at a dose of 50 mg q.i.d.
Cardiology was consulted at this point and did not suggest any treatment with anticoagulation or other additions.
She also received a Swan-Ganz catheter at this time with slightly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures.
Levophed and Vasopressin were being given at high doses.
We were unable to find any other collections to drain and it appeared that her mastitis had largely resolved with no signs of erythema, no signs of pus and adequate drainage of the wound, with continued Kerlix dressing changes.
She then was given 100 mg of Lidocaine IV at which point she went into cardiac arrest.
ACLS protocol was initiated and a code was called.
At this time, she was asystolic and after being given epinephrine IV and attempts at CPR, she developed ventricular fibrillation and was defibrillated at this time.
She was given insulin, glucose and calcium for hyperkalemia for cardiac protection.
The ACLS protocol was stopped at 5:37 a.m. and the patient was declared expired at this time.
