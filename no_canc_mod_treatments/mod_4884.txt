CT Surgery was consulted in the catheterization laboratory during the procedure for a potential coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient's catheterization was uncomplicated and he was scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft on Monday [**2125-9-10**].
Further preoperative evaluation included diuresis with Lasix as well as carotid doppler ultrasound studies, which demonstrated 60% occlusion in the left carotid artery and essentially clean right carotid artery.
The patient was given wide open fluids and a code was called and eventually Dopamine was started.
During the code a unit of packed red blood cells was ordered and begun to transfuse.
None of these measures were sufficient to sustain life and the patient expired at approximately 1:05 p.m. on [**2125-9-10**].
