At that point he was started on nitro times three, aspirin, morphine and his pain diminished to 1 out of 10.
Overnight, the patient had diminished chest pain, which resolved while he was on an addition of heparin as well as Integrilin drips.
At that time the patient was evaluated and deemed necessary to be taken to catheterization for diagnostic as well as possible intervention at that point.
At the catheterization laboratory the patient was noted to have left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex that demonstrated no disease and an obtuse marginal one that demonstrated an 80% lesion and a right coronary artery that demonstrated total occlusion.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was hemodynamically stable and brought back to the Coronary Care Unit for continued monitoring.
The patient at that point was medicated with a statin, aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker and at that point was started on Captopril for after load reduction.
