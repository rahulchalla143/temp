Anticoagulation was reversed but pt became subtherapeutic so he was started on IV heparin and coumadin.
At that time, he was started on a heparin bridge with coumadin as his subdural hematoma was stable.
He was continued on this regimen until his INR was 2.5.
The pt's INR goal will be between 2.5 and 3.0 given his valve replacement in addition to his atrial fibrillation.
He will follow up with his cardiologist on [**1-5**] for evaluation of his coags and adjustment of his coumadin dosage as needed.
He was initially on IV hydralazine in addition to his oral meds but this was changed to an oral formulation on [**1-2**] with continued good blood pressure control.
Atrial fibrillation- Pt was continued on amiodarone throughout admission.
