Admission Date:  [**2127-11-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2127-11-25**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, known coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis, status post a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2122**], secondary to three vessel disease, who presented with increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion times several months.
Additionally, the catheterization revealed his native three vessel disease and additionally an occlusion of the left anterior descending distal to the touchdown of his saphenous vein graft and an 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three.
The patient was admitted to the CCU for observation and diuresis, as well as workup for possible redo coronary artery bypass graft/aortic valve replacement.
Status post lumbar laminectomy complicated by urinary retention which is now resolved in [**2122**].

The patient had Swan-Ganz catheter in and he was diuresed with intravenous Lasix with a goal of a pulmonary artery diastolic of about 28 mmHg.
Lasix and transferred to the regular cardiac floor.
After much discussion with the patient and his family, the patient opted to defer the decision, to return home for the holidays and to decide as an outpatient whether or not to proceed with aortic valve replacement.
Ischemia - The patient had no chest pain while he was in the hospital, however, he did have worsening coronary artery disease by evidence of his catheterization and, if he had opted for the aortic valve replacement, he would likely also undergo a redo coronary artery bypass graft.
In the meantime, the patient was continued on his cardiac regimen of Captopril, Lopressor, statin and an Aspirin.
His Coumadin was held initially for his cardiac catheterization and he was therefore post catheterization maintained on a Heparin drip until the decision regarding cardiothoracic surgery was made.
Once the decision was made that he would not be undergoing the surgery during this hospitalization, Coumadin was restarted with a goal INR of greater than 2.0.
His beta blocker was titrated up with good effect.
Anemia - The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and started on iron replacement for iron deficiency anemia.
