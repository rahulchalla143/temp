He was maintained on Levaquin.
His Levaquin dose was adjusted for renal function and eventually increased from 250 mg once daily to 500 mg once daily once his renal function improved.
His oxygen requirement varied from room air to three liters by nasal cannula, however, his baseline oxygen requirement was two to four liters per nasal cannula so he was felt to be at his baseline.
Genitourinary - The patient was maintained on Proscar for the continued treatment of his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
There were no further complications and the patient will follow-up with his urologist as an outpatient for further treatment of the benign prostatic hypertrophy including possible transurethral resection of prostate.
The patient should receive a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Diarrhea - The patient was begun on empiric therapy for Clostridium difficile colitis with p.o.
Vancomycin was discontinued.
Glucose control - The patient was maintained on sliding scale insulin for glucose control and had effective control on this regimen.
After replacement of his Foley and adequate drainage of urinary bladder, the patient's creatinine gradually decreased over the rest of the hospital admission.
Neurology had recommended beginning the patient on Coumadin and/or Aggrenox and Aspirin for anticoagulation to prevent the possibility of stroke.
However, it was felt that the patient would be at more risk for Coumadin then benefit.
This was due to the fact that he had a question of gastrointestinal bleeding as well as the fact that he had had recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed and that he is a high fall risk.
Therefore, he was not started on Coumadin and was only started on Aspirin.
Therefore, the patient was made completely NPO and gastroenterology was consulted for the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed without complication and the patient was begun on tube feeds for nutrition.
He will need to be continually evaluated for improvement in swallowing function, however, if he does not show any improvement, will need to be fed through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and remain NPO.
With this normal serum viscosity, there is no need for urgent treatment such as plasmapheresis.
He is afebrile, hemodynamically stable and tolerating tube feeds.
Klebsiella urosepsis and Klebsiella bacteremia.
Finasteride 5 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Levaquin 500 mg once daily for seven days after discharge.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o.
Remeron 7.5 mg p.o.
Albuterol inhaler one to two puffs four times a day as needed.
Advair Discus 100/50 mcg one inhalation once daily.
The patient will receive physical therapy and occupational therapy at the rehabilitation facility.
He will also require close monitoring of his electrolytes as he has been requiring potassium, phosphate, and magnesium repletion due to poor p.o.
He should also be continued on his tube feeds.
He also has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of hematology for further management of his Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
