Admission Date:  [**2189-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-1-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  C-Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] is a 77 year old male who has had multiple medical problems, including severe valvular ischemic heart failure, class III to IV, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent pneumoniae and a gastrointestinal bleed.
His Lasix dose was recently decreased.
The patient was admitted on [**2189-1-9**], initially to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and initially treated for a pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl.
He has intravenous Lasix titrated to 80 mg twice a day.
He has also been on an ACE inhibitor and nitroglycerin patch on [**2189-1-10**].
During the hospitalization, he had an episode of chest pain radiating to the left arm which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine sulfate.
Sick sinus syndrome, status post DDD pacemaker in [**2179**].
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2184**] with a saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery; cardiac catheterization in [**2188-2-29**] had native three vessel disease with saphenous vein grafts occluded, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery patent.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d., amiodarone 200 mg p.o.b.i.d., metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o.b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d., spironolactone 12.5 mg p.o.q.d., Levoxyl 25 mcg p.o.q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d., Humalog insulin 24 units q.a.m.
[**2189-1-8**] at 11:00 p.m., troponin was less than 0.3; [**2189-1-9**] one troponin less than 0.3, [**2189-1-10**] two troponins less than 0.3 and [**2189-1-11**], one troponin less than 0.3  Admission chest x-ray shows resolution of right upper lobe infiltrate consistent with [**2188-12-11**], right lower extremity opacity with increased confluence, small bilateral pleural effusions, left base atelectasis, indistinct pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure; summary, pneumonia with superimposed congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 77 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, recurrent pneumoniae, significant coronary artery disease, significant congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic and valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome status post permanent pacemaker, who presents with worsening shortness of breath and symptoms consistent with worsened congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was loaded on nesiritide at 2 mcg/kg and later started on 0.1 mcg/kg/minute drip.
He also initially received intravenous bumetanide 2 mg twice a day.
The patient was placed on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily, continued on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction for his mitral regurgitation at 20 mg daily.
The patient was on a two liter fluid restriction, 2 gram sodium diet.
He refused a Foley catheter.
On [**2189-1-15**], the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for tailored therapy secondary to poor diuresis on the floor despite Natrecor therapy.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was floated without difficulty.
He was initially started on dobutamine 2.5 mcg/kg/minute and continued on nesiritide drip 0.1 mcg/kg/minute.
His dobutamine and Natrecor drips were stopped.
He had a nitroglycerin drip started and received morphine sulfate, which resolved his chest pain.
On [**2189-1-17**], the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
His Bumex was changed to PRN on [**2189-1-17**] and the Swan-Ganz was discontinued and his cordis was changed to a triple-lumen over a wire.
When the patient was discharged from the Unit, his nitroglycerin drip was changed to oral nitrates and he received intravenous Bumex as needed for diuresis.
The patient was diuresed an additional 2 mg of intravenous Bumex.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2189-1-22**]; left atrium was moderately dilated, right atrium mildly dilated, there was a catheter or pacing wire seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle, left ventricular wall thickness was normal, left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed, no resting left ventricular outflow obstruction, right ventricular free wall hypertrophied, right ventricle mildly dilated, focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle, focal calcifications of the ascending aorta, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction 30%, tricuspid gradient 50 mm of mercury, severe +4 mitral regurgitation, mild mitral annular calcification, mild thickening of mitral valve chordae, tips of papillary muscles were calcified, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, no definitive vegetations seen but this is best concluded by a transesophageal echocardiogram.
The initial plan was to have tailored therapy for congestive heart failure in the Unit and preoperatively evaluate the patient for possible mitral valve surgery but, due to complications during the patient's course that will be discussed in the infectious disease section, the surgery was deferred.
He was initially on amiodarone 200 mg twice a day.
After being discharged from the Unit, the patient was on amiodarone 200 mg daily times ten days and he was placed on a heparin drip.
He is status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
His last cardiac catheterization was [**2188-3-14**] which showed the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery patent; coronary artery bypass grafting was done in [**2184**].
The pain was relieved with 2 mg of morphine and 1 mg of Ativan, and the patient was resting comfortably in bed.
Coronary artery disease treatment:  The patient was treated with aspirin 162 mg daily, lisinopril as stated above, Lipitor 10 mg daily, and Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of NPH and Humalog, with good control.
He was also continued on levothyroxine.
Infectious disease:  As stated earlier, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit back to the c-medicine team with a right internal jugular line in place.
Two peripheral lines were placed and the right internal jugular line was pulled.
The patient was then treated with vancomycin.
The first bottle became positive on [**2189-1-21**] and the patient was dosed with vancomycin promptly.
Prophylaxis:  The patient had been on Protonix and heparin.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will follow-up and do the course from [**1-25**], including discharge diagnoses and discharge medications as well as follow-up plans.
