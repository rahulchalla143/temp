Given the time lag between the injuries, his admission elsewhere and now his transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] without neurologic deterioration, he was sent to the TSICU for Q1H neurochecks instead of repeat head CT, as initially recommended by neurosurgery.
Additionally, he was dilantin loaded and continued on 100 mg Q8H dilantin, which was planned to continue for a total 7 days and finish on [**7-1**].
No changes in his prior liver failure management were implemented and all his regular home medications were restarted prior to discharge.
Hepatology also recommended started rifaxamin in addition to his lactulose, which was done.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted for his left wrist and right ankle fracutres.
Post-operatively the course was complicated by an unwitnessed fall from his bed on [**2106-6-27**], during which he sustained no injury by his account, but his wrist was re-imaged and showed no acute fracture or change in alignement.
He was tolerating a regular renal diet and restarted on his home lactulose with the addition of colace given the intake of narcotics.
A foley was placed perioperatively and removed on [**6-27**].
His blood sugars were monitored and controlled on an insulin sliding scale.
Daily electrolytes required repletion as needed.
SC heparin was started for DVT prophylaxis on [**6-26**] as the patient was 48 hours out from his injury at that time.
This was discontinued and his home lovenox for treatment of prior DVT was restarted prior to discharge.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted for evaluation, who recommended that the patient be transferred to a rehab facilty for continued PT/OT when medically cleared.
