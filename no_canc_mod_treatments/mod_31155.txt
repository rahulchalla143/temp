Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgery service.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Timoptic, Lopressor 50 mg po bid and enteric coated Aspirin 375 mg po q d, Prednisone 3 mg po bid.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] of cardiothoracic surgery service.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in anticipation of surgery.
On [**6-18**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two with a LIMA to the LAD and a vein graft to the obtuse marginal of the circumflex.
The patient was transferred to cardiothoracic ICU with his balloon in place in stable condition.
The patient also had some bright red blood per the orogastric tube in the operating room and a consult was requested by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for the patient to be seen by medicine.
The recommendations were to treat the patient with some Protonix and follow his hematocrit and treat as needed and then possibly do an EGD when the patient was more currently stable after his bypass surgery with obvious coagulopathies to be corrected.
On postoperative day #1 the patient continued on his perioperative Vancomycin.
He was on 0.25 of Milrinone and 1.0 of [**Female First Name (un) **] with plans to wean his drips after discontinuing his intra-aortic balloon pump.
On postoperative day #2 his balloon had been discontinued, he remained on an Amiodarone drip in sinus rhythm at 0.5 with plans to switch his Amiodarone over to po.
His Foley was discontinued.
He was started on all of his oral medications and continued on his perioperative Vancomycin.
On postoperative day #3 his chest tubes were discontinued, he began Lasix diuresis, he was on nasal cannula, satting well with good blood pressure, T max of 100.4.
He remained on Amiodarone and Lopressor to keep him in sinus rhythm and sliding scale insulin for his blood sugars.
His Prednisone was restarted on postoperative day #2 and he was alert and awake.
On postoperative day #4 he had another bout of atrial fibrillation which was stopped with 10 mg of IV Lopressor.
Pending results to neurology consult, the patient could be restarted on Heparin and Coumadin if needed.
Management recommendations were conservative with therapy as needed or splint to prevent contractures and further evaluation as the patient improved from his bypass surgery.
On postoperative day #6 in the evening, the patient again went into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 123, maintaining a good blood pressure, more IV Lopressor was given which broke the patient and put him back in sinus rhythm.
He was also given repletion magnesium and decision was made not to restart Amiodarone at that time.
The patient had been started on Heparin at about approximately 1,000 units per hour and continued with physical therapy for ambulation and his radial nerve palsy.
He continued to receive chest PT and occupational therapy and continued on Heparin and continued to improve.
