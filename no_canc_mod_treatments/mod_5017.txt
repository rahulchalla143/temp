is a 79 y/o female well known to the Vascular Surgery service, discharged on [**2112-9-26**] with stable Type I endoleak of previous EVAR [**1-/2109**], presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 10/10 abdominal pain with radiation to back, nausea and vomiting, and labile blood pressure from 80 to 250 SBP.
Efforts to control Ms. [**Known lastname 13894**] blood pressure in ED were made using nipride and esmolol and were unsuccessful.
The family was informed of her diagnosis and consent for open repair of her AAA was obtained.
She underwent an open retroperitoneal AAA repair (suprarenal clamp inferior to the SMA) with a bifurcated dacron graft with distal anastomosis to endografts.
A PA catheter was placed on POD 0 in the SICU for monitoring.
She was started on empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She required a continuous infusion of Nipride for SBP management during her stay.
On POD 7, [**2112-10-4**], she was weaned from her Nipride drip and given a regular diet.
She again had several episodes of intermittent sinus bradycardia to HR 30 - 40's and a Type I block was suspected.
Her Foley was removed on this date and she voided shortly thereafter.
She was restarted on Heparin SQ.
Her antibiotics were stopped.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] was noted to have bradycardia and 2nd degree Mobitz I AV block, with intermittent worsening to 2nd degree Mobitz II AV block, so a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was placed on [**2112-10-6**].
Her metoprolol dose was increased to improve control of her labile hypertension.
