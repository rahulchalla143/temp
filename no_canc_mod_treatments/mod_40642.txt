For his community acquired pneumonia, he was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Prior to discharge, the ceftriaxone was discontinued and will be discharged on five more days of azithromycin.
For rhythm, his atrial fibrillation had been treated with coumadin and atenolol as an outpatient.
His beta-blocker was initially held due to his hypotension, and was restarted as metoprolol while he was in the ICU.
His atenolol dose should be titrated up as tolerated as an outpatient.
His coumadin dose should be watched carefully as his azithromycin will have significant effect on his INR once it is stopped.
He responded well to boluses of lasix.
On the medical service, he was given several more boluses of IV lasix for some orthopnea and shortness of breath with good response.
He was ultimately re-started on his home dose of lasix and will continue this after discharge.
He was also re-started on his standing potassium supplementation.
For F/E/N, he was kept on a cardiac diet  For prophlyaxis, he was kept on subcutaneous heparin.
