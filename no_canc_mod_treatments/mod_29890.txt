# Right and Middle lobe PNA: Patient with chronic trach, placed on pressure support ventilation on admission.
Given pt lives at home with no recent hospitalizations he was covered for CAP however due to history of MRSA PNA, as well ESBL UTI empirically covered with vancomycin and meropenem.
Sputum culture with GNRs and returned with pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas.
He should receive a 15 day course of ciprofloxacin (day [**5-22**]).
In regards to stenotrophomonas the patient was started on bactrim (day [**7-22**]) and should receive a 15 day course of that medication as well.
Pleural effusion: Evidence of loculation on chest-x-ray and CT scan.

He underwent VATs with 2 chest tubes placed.
The chest tubes were eventually discontinued and pleural fluid was without growth.
Foley was changed at OSH.
Upon presentation he required mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.
With treatment of infection, aggressive chest PT with insuflator/exsuflator we were able to wean to trach collar during day with mechanical ventilation overnight at pressure support [**6-11**], FiO2 40%.
This improved with chest physical therapy and suctioning.
