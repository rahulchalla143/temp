(Y/N) Y  PTCA COMMENTS:   We elected to treat the totally occluded proximal LAD with PTCA/Stenting using heparin and integrilin prophylactically.
A Choice PTXS wire crossed into the LAD with significant difficulty (a Wizdom SS wire and several PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wires would not cross).
An export catheter would not cross beyond the proximal LAD, but suctioning of this area resulted in minor improvement in flow.
There was significant spasm and no-reflow in the [**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] intracoronary nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were adminstered through the guide, and more intracoronary nitroprusside was administered through the lumen of a 2.0 x 30 mm Maverick positioned just distal to the second stent.

The LAD had a 70% lesion at it's origin and a 100% proximal occlusion.
Acute anterior STEMI treated with primary PCI.

She had a cypher stent placed to the LAD.
As post MI echo showed akinesis, pt was started on coumadin for a 6 month course after determining she was not a fall risk with physical therapy and with her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also found to have a UTI for which she was treated with Levaquin.
