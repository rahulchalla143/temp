He has two sisters also with the disease.
He is status post right vitrectomy.
He was treated aggressively with insulin drip, aggressive volume resuscitation, and electrolyte management, and by the third hospital day, was off of insulin drip and back on lantus and Humalog sliding scales.
Initially because of poor po intake, he was only given 10 units of Lantus insulin and his blood sugars were persistently between 200-300.
Lantus was increased to 20 units on the day prior to discharge with continuing Humalog sliding scale coverage.
Pulmonary:  Because of his anemia, which is likely secondary to his renal disease, he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on the 15th.
Following this blood transfusion and in addition to the aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation he received, the patient developed pulmonary edema, and was restarted on his outpatient dose of Lasix 80 mg po bid.
The patient continued to have an anion gap despite appropriate therapy with insulin and it was unclear if further infection was the cause of his diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient was then started on antibiotics initially given ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
Concern was briefly arranged for an aspiration pneumonia given the patient's significant vomiting, however, it was felt that he most likely had a community acquired pneumonia, and then was continued on clindamycin alone.
Upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the Medical team, his antibiotics were further changed to levofloxacin as monotherapy for his pneumonia.
The patient was discharged with levofloxacin to complete a 10 day course.
Prior to discharge on [**2155-3-17**], the patient had a right thoracentesis which removed approximately 1 liter of fluid.
The pleural fluid glucose was 146, LDH 93, and albumin 0.9.
For the local pain of the thoracentesis site, the patient was given Percocet with good relief.
Brief concern for pulmonary embolism was raised, and the patient was started on Heparin.
He was continued on his outpatient medications including Isordil, Norvasc, and hydralazine.
This cleared after reinstating his outpatient dose of Lasix at 80 mg po bid.
