[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35% (nl >=55%)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2101-12-1**] 9:11 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: lead placement  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 22 year old man with AV endocarditis s/p single cahmber pacemaker REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: lead placement CHEST X-RAY WITH PA AND LATERAL VIEWS  INDICATION: Patient is status post single chamber pacemaker placement.
Again seen is a single chamber pacemaker with lead wire in appropriate position without change.
Since there was no documented bacteria, broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated.
He was started on gentamicin (for an empiric 7 day course), Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone (for a week course of each).
A temporary pacemaker was placed initially.
This was converted to a permanent VVI pacemaker on [**2101-11-30**].
It will likely be replaced with an epicardial lead system when he is ultimately taked to the OR for an aortic valve/root replacement upon completion of his antibiotic course.
He is to be transferred to [**Hospital6 **] to complete his antibiotic course (both Ceftriaxone and vancomycin should be administered through [**2102-1-4**]).
He will then be re-evaluated for aortic valve/root replacement.
