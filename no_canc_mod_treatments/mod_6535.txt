Admission Date:  [**2171-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Allopurinol / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with a h/o symptomatic bradycardia s/p recent pacemaker placement, COPD, A.fib on ASA, vascular dementia who presented from rehab with a complaint of worsening cough throughout the day, shortness of breath, chest pain and increasing confusion per her home health aid.
CXR was done with no evidence of infiltrate, EKG with A.fib in the 100's, however given her symptoms she was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She then had a right IJ placed for SBP low of 65, and then persistent SBP's in the 70's, and was started on levophed at 0.03, with an improvement in her blood pressures to a systolic in the 100's.
Her antibiotic coverage was also broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
For fluid resuscitation she received a total of 2LNS during her stay in the ER.
Past Medical History: Symptomatic Bradycardia s/p Pacemaker Placement [**8-24**] Diabetes Dyslipidemia Hypertension Chronic noncardiac chest pain Anxiety Gait disorder Atrial fibrillation on aspirin Asthma and COPD History of CVA Dementia (multi-vascular) Diabetes mellitus type 2 Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Hypothyroidism Osteoporosis Gout Edema DJD   Social History: Denies any alcohol.
[**2171-9-25**] Urine culture- <10,000 organisms.
[**2171-9-29**] Blood culture- No growth.
[**2171-9-30**] Blood culture- No growth.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with h/o A.fib on ASA, tachybrady syndrome s/p PPM placement, COPD, hypothyroid who presented with hypotension, cough, chest pain and worsening mental status.
She was initially started on levophed but weaned off without difficulty shortly after admission.
TSH and cortisol were within normal limits.
Patient's hypotension was responsive to fluid boluses and she was transferred to the floor where she did not require any further pressure support or fluid boluses, maintaining pressures in the 130s-140s.
She was treated with vanc and cefepime as above.
At the same time, we thought a COPD exacerbation was contributing, so she was started on steroids, the [**Month/Day (2) 10540**] abx, and continued on nebulizers (xopenex, given her AF, and atrovent).
A PICC was placed for antibiotic treatment and blood draws; this was discontinued on the day of discharge.
On the day of transfer to the wards, we were less convinced of the [**Name (NI) 10540**] (pt was afebrile, without a WBC elevation, and numerous cultures negative to date), so vanc and cefepime were changed to abx for COPD exacerbation (azithromycin, as patient is allergic to levofloxacin).
On the wards, patient was sat-ing in the mid 90s on room air and was continued on this regimen (azithromycin and prednisone) for 4 days.
Diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure was restarted with IV lasix as patient sounded crackly on exam and a repeat CXR showed engorged pulmonary vasculature.
Patient was discharged home with instructions to continue her nebs as needed and to go back to her home dose of lasix 40 mg PO to continue her diuresis until she followed up with her PCP at her scheduled appointment the following week.
Given her hypotension she was started on digoxin with the goal of tapering down her metoprolol dose.
For the rest of her hospitalization, the patient was monitored on telemetry and remained largely in AF with ventricular pacing at a rate in the 60s-70s.
She was discharged with instructions to continue her digoxin, taper down and eventually discontinue her metoprolol, and follow up with her primary care doctor.
She received 1 unit PRBCs for symptomatic treatment and her hematocrit improved over the course of her hospitalization.
Patient was continued on her home levothyroxine.
# Diabetes: Patient's glipizide was held while she was an inpatient, but she was continued on her home metformin and put on an insulin sliding scale with QID finger stick blood sugar checks.
# Depression/Anxiety: Patient was continued on her home regimen of celexa/ativan.
They decided to pursue hospice after discharge and try to minimize unnecessary interventions while an inpatient.
