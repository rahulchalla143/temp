An NG tube placement was attempted but failed.
A push enteroscopy was subsequently obtained on [**5-4**], negative for active bleeding, stigmata of recent bleed or angioectasias in stomach, duodenum and visualized jejunum to 110 cm.
Her hematocrit drifted down, and she was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs on [**5-4**] and [**5-5**].
An NG tube was placed for GoLytely administration.
On [**5-6**], she became tachycardic in the setting of recurrent hematochezia, and was transferred to the ICU for further care.
After a discussion with IR and the ICU team, the patient's family expressed their wishes to avoid invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, including arteriography or further endoscopy.
She was transfused 2 additional units of PRBCs while in the ICU (last [**5-7**]).
Once again, per the patient and family, she is to be managed conservatively with transfusional support as needed, no further intervention.
She remains on Protonix 40 mg daily.
Her presentation was felt most consistent with diastolic dysfunction (documented in recent echo) and probable flash pulmonary edema, and she responded well to IV Lasix diuresis.
She was started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID on [**5-8**] for HR control, as well as Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID, which was titrated up.
She was also restarted on her out-patient dose of Lasix 20 mg daily on [**5-9**], held on [**2147-5-10**] in the setting of concentrated urine and probable mild dehydration.
Of note, during her first night on the floor, telemetry revealed intermittent bradycardia after initiation of Metoprolol, asymptomatic.
In the next 24 hours, she had no further events, and Metoprolol was continued.
She was transitioned to Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
She remains on Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID.
Please also monitor her fluid status, and consider resuming Lasix therapy at 20 mg daily.
Lasix currently remains on hold.
She completed a 7-day course of Ceftriaxone on [**2147-5-12**].
Tube feeds were started on [**5-8**] via NG tube.
Unfortunately, her [**Last Name (un) **]-intestinal tube occluded on [**5-9**], and was replaced under fluoroscopy.
She was therefore placed on a soft solids/thin liquids diet, changed to a ground solids/thin liquids diet, on which she remains.
All heparin products were held on [**5-9**].
A HIT antibody returned negative, and heparin flushes were resumed.
IV access: A PICC line was placed in the hospital, and remains in place at the time of discharge for access and blood draws.
Consider removal in the next week.
