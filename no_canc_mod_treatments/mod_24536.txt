He did receive levofloxacin x1 but was without fever or infiltrate on admission to suggest pneumonia so antibiotics were stopped.
A lasix drip was started and metolazone and spironolactone were continued for diuresis.
A dopamine drip was started for improved renal perfusion.
The patient's urine output improved with these interventions and the lasix drip and dopamine drip were tapered off.
He was started on PO lasix upon discharge.
2) Bradycardia - The patient had bradycardia down to 20s on admission probably in setting of increased BB and increased digoxin dose and acute on chronic renal failure which may have decreased clearance.
He was given atropine with moderate response.
He is not a candidate for a pacemaker due to his multiple co-morbidities.
3) Afib - On coumadin at home.
Once his INR was below 3, his coumadin was restarted (goal INR [**2-28**]).
was treated for his UTI with ceftriaxone.
6) Anticoagulation - Mechanical valve and a fib.
On coumadin on admission.
When his INR trended down, coumadin was restarted as above.
