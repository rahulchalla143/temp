CXR w/ bilateral lower lobe opacities so he was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl.
He was bolused w/ IVF, however, eventually required blood pressure support and was started on a dopamine gtt.
Patient was briefly on a heparin gtt for presumed PE but this was stopped prior to transfer.
The triple-lumen catheter had been placed in [**Last Name (un) 9888**] area; serial VBG's and the prior CTA report suggested that the triple lumen catheter was drawing blood from the in the left upper lobe pulmonary vein.
On arrival to the ICU, he underwent bronchoscopy which did not show large amounts of frank mucous.

Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube appear appropriately positioned.
Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications, unchanged.
Focal nodular areas in the right lung should be reevaluated after pulmonary edema resolves, neoplastic origin cannot be totally excluded.
Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications, unchanged.
ET tube at the carina needs to pulled back [**3-20**] cms for appropriate positioning.
**   Brief Hospital Course: Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient arrived from OSH intubated; when trying to leave the OSH he had an hypoxic respiratory event which required emergency intubation.
Additionally, patient had evidence of L --> R shunt given anomalous L brachiocephalic/L pulmonary vein anastomosis.
Patient was covered broadly with vancomycin and cefepime for his pneumonia and started on steroids, albuterol and ipratropium for COPD exacerbation.
He was treated with antibiotics for ten days.
Patient was briefly able to tolerate a pressure support mode of ventilation but ultimately had to go back on AC when he became increasingly hypoxic.
Patient was intubated for a total of fourteen days and team had multiple discussions with family about his ongoing care and prognosis.
On the day prior to extubation, patient underwent bilateral thoracenteses in an attempt to optimize his pulmonary function.
The family agreed that he would not want to undergo a tracheostomy and decided that we should attempt to extubate him with the understanding that his prognosis was poor and he may not survive off the ventilator.
Prior to his extubation, we attempted to further diurese him by starting him on a nitro gtt and giving him a combination of blood and furosemide.
He initially was able to breath on his own and maintain his oxygenation, however, he soon became tired.
His respiratory distress was managed with fentanyl and midazolam.
He tolerated the procedure with minimal complications.
As noted above, he remained on the ventilator before and after his surgery.
