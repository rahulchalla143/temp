Fortunately, all our testing was negative for the most life-threatening causes of chest pain, including a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or aortic dissection.
You also underwent a scope of your upper GI tract which showed mild inflammation and varices of your esophagus.
Although we don't have a definitive diagnosis on the cause of your chest pain, the two most likely possibilities include esophageal spasm, for which you are being treated with nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) as well as gastroesophageal reflux for which you are being treated with pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor).
And although your cardiac catheterization was negative for obstructive disease, you should still be on a life-long baby aspirin and a cholesterol lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as atorvastatin to keep your LDL cholesterol below 70.
