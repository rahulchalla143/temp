Admission Date:  [**2143-6-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-6-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2143-6-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] was born at 28 6/7 weeks gestation by cesarean section to a 29-year-old gravida V, para II now III woman.
The mother was started on prednisone for this in [**Month (only) 116**].
Soon after the beginning of prednisone, she required insulin for glucose intolerance.
Respiratory:  The infant initially started on nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure and, at approximately 13 hours of age, required endotracheal intubation for work of breathing after her chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
The intubation was difficult, and a chest x-ray after intubation showed a pneumomediastinum without evidence of pneumothorax, suggesting the possibility of perforation of the pharynx.
She was extubated to nasal cannula oxygen on day of life number three, where she remained at approximately 200 cc flow.
The infant was started on caffeine citrate for apnea and shallow breathing on day of life number three.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  She is on parenteral nutrition.
Her parenteral nutrition is 10% dextrose through a peripheral intravenous.
She has had some evidence of metabolic acidosis, requiring one bolus of sodium bicarbonate intravenously, 2 mEq/kg, on day of life number two.
Gastrointestinal:  She was started on phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity on day of life number two.
She has received no blood products during her Newborn Intensive Care Unit stay thus far.
Infectious Disease:  The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
A spinal tap done prior to the beginning of antibiotics had a white blood cell count of 10, red blood cell count of 1675, protein 174, and a glucose of 38.
She remains on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of transfer.
Gentamicin levels done after the third dose were a trough of 1.3, and a peak of 7.8.
Medications:  Ampicillin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours, gentamicin 4 mg intravenously every 24 hours, and caffeine citrate 10 mg intravenously every 24 hours.
Parenteral nutrition of total fluids 160 cc/kg/day of 10% dextrose with 3 grams/kg/day of protein and 1.5 grams/kg/day of 20% interlipids with 2 mEq/100 cc of sodium and 1 mEq/100 cc of potassium.
