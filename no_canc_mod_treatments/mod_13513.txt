The mother presented late for prenatal care at 21 weeks.
She was taken to cesarean section for breech presentation.
She was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit for treatment of prematurity.
She    managed to wean to very low ventilator settings of 16/5    and a rate of 15 by day of life #2.
She had a brief trial on    CPAP and required reintubation for apnea and increased    work of breathing.
She remained on low settings on her    ventilator, with some fluctuation, and ultimately had a    trial of Lasix and was started on Diuril around day of    life 36.
On day of life 53, she again was    transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure.
She    remained on CPAP for several days, and then transitioned    to nasal cannula O2.
She is receiving supplemental    potassium chloride 6 mEq p.o.
The baby was loaded with caffeine citrate on day of life 6.
She remained on caffeine citrate until day of life 72, when    it was discontinued.
This was at the    time that she was being treated for Staph aureus    bacteremia.
The infant was    initially NPO, had a double lumen UVC line and an    umbilical arterial catheter.
The UAC was discontinued on    day of life 7, and the UVC was discontinued on day of life 9.
At that time, a percutaneous central catheter was placed in    the saphenous in the foot.
Enteral feedings were introduced on day of life 8 after    her patent ductus arteriosus was deemed no longer an    issue.
She advanced to full enteral feedings by day of    life 15, of Special Care 20, and then caloric density was    increased to 30 cal/oz with additional ProMod.
She    required gavage feedings as she matured and showed the    ability to orally feed and adequate growth.
She is also    receiving supplemental ferrous sulfate 25 mg/ml 0.3 ml    p.o.
The infant did receive vitamin A supplementation in the first    several weeks of life, a total of 12 doses subcutaneously.
Due to symptoms of reflux, the baby was started on Zantac and    Reglan.
[**Known lastname **] required treatment for    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy, with a    peak serum bilirubin on day of life 3 of 4.0/0.6 mg/dl    direct.
She received phototherapy for approximately 10    days.
The blood culture was "no growth" at    72 hours, and the antibiotics were discontinued.
She was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.
ESR was    elevated at 60 (normal range 0-20) and C-reactive protein was    elevated at greater than 30, with a high suspicion range    greater than 0.3.
An infectious disease consultation was also obtained,    and they concurred with treatment for presumed osteomyelitis.
Treatment ultimately included 6 weeks of IV oxacillin from    first negative blood culture.
She was also treated with rifampin for the first 7 days of    treatment for synergy.
She did complete the last several days    of treatment with PO kefzol secondary to substantial    intravenous access difficulties.
Continue ad lib feedings as above.
Medications - Diuril 65 mg p.o.
