Given his pseudoaneurism, worry about erosion into bronchus, however pt evaluated by CT surgery who feel that pt is too high risk for OR.
Should he hemoptysize more, he should lie on the abnormal lung (likely L lung given CXR) in the Left lateral decubitus position w/ plans for intubation to protect the good lung.
Hct 38---31 at 1:00pm - appreciate CT surgery input - admit to ICU for BP control and closer monitoring - plan for bronchoscopy to evaluate site of bleeding - epistaxis not completely ruled out as a cause for "hemoptysis"  - plant PPD: not coughing - con't levo for h/o quinolone sensitive UTI - con't hold anticoagulants - BP control - hold antihypertensives for BP <130 given worry re: bleeding - s/p T&Cross, 2PIV's .
# FEVER - likely UTI given prior + Urine cultures for hightly-resistent pseudomonas (was only sensitive to [**Month/Day (2) **]/Gent/[**Last Name (un) **].
Finished 2 week course of Levo 250 during last admission)Was finishing course of Augmentin and Bactrium for "UTI" -Try to get cultre data at NH for this UTI - c/w Levo renal dosed.
-Lopressor 5mg IV q6 (for only BP >160) -Hold standing antihypertensive agents given hemorrage risk -Lactate normal: .
Dementia: Has h/o of "atypical psycosis" only on Zoloft 50 qd.
-Haldol 1 mg prn .
Given his poor functional status and proceedureal risk, bronchoscopy was defered.
