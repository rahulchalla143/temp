These findings are incompletely characterized without intravenous contrast.
Complex ventral abdominal wall hernia containing fat, fluid and small bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
Spirometry [**2196-11-4**]: Impression: Marked restrictive ventilatory defect with a marked gas exchange defect.
The right pigtail catheter is unchanged in position.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old male with history of paradoxical atrial fibrillation, pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic RP fibrosis presenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distension found to have DVT and with progressive chylous ascites.
This paracentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient was empirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone though he remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.
After the chylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for a malignancy given the lack of liver disease.
The second of these revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second course of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the patient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured) which completed on [**2196-11-29**].
Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with medical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low fat TPN but these were unsuccessful.
General surgery was consulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to improve lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are very small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely be as damaging as initial insult.
Case was discussed with thoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to thoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management.
Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed extensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of cisterna chyli.
As lymphangiogram and balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of success were not considered high and risk of intubation and likely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and patient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.
The possibility of disease modifying therapy for RP fibrosis was discussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be no role for the agents used (almost all of which are immune suppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these things would be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.
As he reaccumulated quickly again after that thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtail catheter, which was placed on [**2196-11-15**].
After the second thoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4L of oxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.
On [**11-26**] he desaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening infiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding TPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume overload.
3) Nutrition/Protein Loss: Initially the patient was allowed to eat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he was converted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made NPO with TPN.
Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall presumably due to losses in the chest tube.
After he became quite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal reduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications TPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for comfort.
He and his family understand he will ultimately continue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor toleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered acceptable by them.
4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to have intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent sputum.
5) LLE DVT: He was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned to be therapeutic on coumadin.
He was transferred back to heparin gtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughout his course there to make procedures feasible without needing a long warfarin wash-out.
Anticoagulation with medications other than unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not optimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.
6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of penicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement in his abdominal rash.
He then received 10 days of vancomycin as well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal rash could be a contact dermatitis.
7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around [**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his trunk in the context of receiving a dose of piperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.
This medication was stopped an his rash resolved.
This broke with diltiazem and he was restarted on this medication with good rate control.
11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family and patient about the lack of options for reversing the patient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent respiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they elected to pursue comfort focused care.
When his respiratory status deteriorated on [**11-30**] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were not pursued, and he was given morphine.
