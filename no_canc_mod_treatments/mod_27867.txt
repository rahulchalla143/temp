FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of nasogastric tube.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5 mm axial images from the skull base to the vertex were obtained before the administration of IV contrast.
Note is made of a bovine aortic arch.
Note is made of a triplicated anterior cerebral artery with a branch arising from the communicating segment of the left internal carotid artery.
There is a right-sided nasogastric tube as well as an endotracheal tube in place.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  Reason: eval for carotid stenosis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old woman with new left parietal infarct REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for carotid stenosis HISTORY: 60-year-old woman status post motor vehicle collision, presenting with left parietal cerebral infarct.
TECHNIQUE: Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
Peak systolic velocities on the right side were 92 cm/sec for the internal carotid artery, 60 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 95 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
Height: (in) 62 Weight (lb): 220 BSA (m2): 1.99 m2 BP (mm Hg): 141/73 HR (bpm): 73 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2177-2-5**] at 14:01 Test: Portable TTE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: Saline Tape Number: 2007W002-0:26 Test Location: West SICU/CTIC/VICU Technical Quality: Suboptimal     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 5.1 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.1 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 2.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.1 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.29  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
The IVC is normal in diameter with <50% decrease during respiration (estimated RAP 11-15mmHg).
No paradoxical flow is seen with saline injection at rest (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
A small left apical pneumothorax was identified, a left chest thoracostomy tube was placed; this was eventually removed.
Orthopedics was consulted for her right femur fracture, she was taken to the operating room on [**1-30**] for repair of this injury.
Her staples remain in place and they will need to be removed on [**2-13**]; she will need to follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**].
Thoracic was consulted because of her mechanism of injury with air ag deployment and subsequent development of respiratory failure.
Vascular surgery and Stroke Consults were placed because of a finding on radiographic imaging revealing a left carotid artery stenosis suggestive a dissection.
It was recommended that she be placed on Heparin drip as a bridge and placed on Coumadin with goal INR [**3-8**]; her most recent INR was 1.3.
Orthopedic spine surgery was also consulted because of a R C4-5 and C5-6 foraminal stenosis (mod-severe); there was no operative intervention, it was suggested to continue to follow her exam, which remained intact during her hospital stay.
She did require an NG tube for initiation of tube feedings early on during her ICU stay.
The NG tube was eventually removed and her diet was advanced to soft with thin liquids.
The tube feedings were stopped.
