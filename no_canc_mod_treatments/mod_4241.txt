Prior to admission, the patient had been receiving a course of PEG-interferon and ribavirin for her hepatitis C.  She was also taking Trizivir antiretroviral therapy for HIV.
Liver disease/pancreatitis:  The patient's acute liver failure was attributed to Tylenol toxicity in the setting of chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis C.  She was treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine and her antiretroviral therapy was held.
The pancreatitis was also attributed to acetaminophen toxicity by the Toxicology consult service.
She received several units of fresh-frozen plasma and was transfused a unit of packed red cells for a drop in her hematocrit to 24.2 on [**4-8**].
She was placed on lactulose with an appropriate increase in stool output and resolution of her confusion and asterixis.
The clinical picture was felt to be most consistent with cellulitis, and the patient was started on cefazolin.
As of time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12053**], the patient was on day 10 of IV Unasyn.
The ENT service was consulted and after an evaluation with laryngoscopy, they recommended administration of a proton-pump inhibitor for potential laryngeal reflux.
They also recommended starting nystatin for empiric treatment of [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.

She was diuresed and with Lasix 40 mg IV bid and spironolactone 100 mg po q day.
On [**4-19**], Lasix dose was changed from 40 mg IV bid to 40 mg po bid.
The patient received 10 mg of vitamin K q day for treatment of her coagulopathy, but continued to have INR's in a range between 2 and 3.
GI bleed:  On [**4-16**], the patient had hematemesis in the setting of drinking GoLYTELY for colonoscopy prep.
The patient received 2 units of fresh-frozen plasma, one bag of cryoprecipitate, and 1 unit of packed red cells.
The patient was continued on her proton-pump inhibitor dose to [**Hospital1 **].
The patient was placed on empiric acyclovir followed by valaciclovir.
Left lower extremity cellulitis:  The Infectious Disease service was consulted regarding management of the patient's cellulitis, which appeared to be refractory to antibiotic therapy.
A possible aspiration of this fluid to evaluate for infection was considered, but it was decided that a procedure would potentially cause more harm than benefit as the patient had a persistent coagulopathy and could potentially bleed into the space.
It was therefore decided that the patient would continue on antibiotics for the cellulitis.
She was converted to oral antibiotics (Augmentin) with plans to complete an additional two weeks after discharge.
The patient was subsequently placed on nocturnal humidification and fluconazole was added to her antifungal regimen.
Persistent coagulopathy:  As aforementioned, the patient had a persistent coagulopathy despite resolution of her elevated transaminases and the administration of vitamin K.  The Hematology service was consulted, and the impression was that the differential diagnosis for the patient's persistent coagulopathy included decreased synthetic function by the liver, DIC, and inhibitor to clotting factors.
