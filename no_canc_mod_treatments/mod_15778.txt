CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
-Blood and urine cultures: NEGATIVE on [**4-13**], [**5-21**], [**5-22**], [**5-25**], [**5-28**]  Brief Hospital Course: A 67 yo man with history of NSCLC s/p resection, EtOH, h/o DVTs on coumadin until one month PTA, recent GIB, now transferred from OSH with respiratory distress and multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He was started on LMWH, awaiting EGD/colonoscopy before initiation of coumadin.
He will continue on anticoagulation (now on heparin) until his colonoscopy/EGD.
As long as there is no active bleeding, he can be switched to coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.
He did not require benzodiazepines or CIWA scale monitoring.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia: He began spiking fevers on [**5-19**] with sputum growing GNR and staph (found to be pansensitive Citrobacter freundii, sparse Aeromonas and sparse coag+ staph).
The ventilator associated pneumonia was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for eight days; course was completed on [**5-28**].
He was treated with oral vancomycin during the VAP antibiotic course, and he should continue oral vancomycin to finish on [**6-7**].
He was restarted on anticoagulation during this admission for DVT and PE.
Plan is to continue heparin for three weeks to allow time for his pulmonary emboli to dissolve and his clinical status to stabilize, at which time EGD and colonoscopy can be done.
# Anemia: This is a macrocytic anemia with stabilization of hematocrit in the mid to high 20s.
Folate and vitamin B-12 were normal.
We have recommended for outpatient colonoscopy and EGD for further work-up.
He received one unit of PRBCs on [**6-3**].
# Nose bleed: This occurred in the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox.
Bleeding resolved after treatment with Afrin (several squirts) and holding pressure for 20 minutes.
They recommended for preventative management with aggressive blood pressure control, saline nasal spray, bactroban vaseline ointment, and humidified air.
If bleeding recurs, several sprays of Afrin can be delivered to the bleeding nostril, with pressure held for at least 15 minutes and patient leaning forward.
Albumin can be followed up as outpatient.
# Left leg pain and hematoma: He worked with physical therapy and complained of leg pain over the lateral aspect of his left thigh.
Plain films of the left hip and femur showed sclerotic lesion in the distal femur so MRI was done for further evaluation.
We have switched anticoagulation to heparin drip to allow for ease of stopping anticoagulation if the hematoma grows in size.
