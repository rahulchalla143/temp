Admission Date:  [**2136-5-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-5-11**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  ACOVE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue, who was found down at home by the EMTs on [**2136-5-1**] after life-line activation.
In the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room, the patient was seen by the Neurosurgical Service who recommended no surgical intervention at this time.
They felt that his mental status changes were more likely to be metabolic in etiology, given the patient's myoglobinemia and hyponatremia.
The patient was treated with normal saline plus 2 ampules of bicarbonate, and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for improving mental status with correction of metabolic abnormalities.
The patient had a troponin elevation of 4.3 on [**5-1**], and the patient was started on a beta blocker.
No aspirin was given to the patient given his subdural hematomas.
The patient tolerated a soft mechanical diet on the day of transfer, thought to be high-aspiration risk.

Captopril 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tongue cancer, who was found down and subsequently found to have rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia, troponin leak with EKG changes, in addition to acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
The patient, at this time, may be started on a trial of Sinemet in order to assess for a potential response.
We held off further bicarbonate and treated the patient initially with maintenance IV fluids.
We felt that the patient also had a component of cerebral salt wasting during his hospitalization as the sodium initially declined from 128 down to nadir of 122.
We treated the patient with gentle volume repletion with normal saline.
The patient was started on an ACE inhibitor for after-load reduction.
Captopril 25 mg p.o.t.i.d.
This medication is to be titrated up as tolerated.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.b.i.d.
