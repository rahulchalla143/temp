He received aspirin, plavix 600, heparin and integrillin bolus and was taken emergently to the cath [**Hospital1 **].
Heparin and integrilin were used for IV anticoagulation.
A 6F XBLAD3.5 guiding catheter provided good support.
The lesion was predilated with a 2.0x20 mm Voyager balloon at 8 ATM with TIMI 2 flow restored.
A 3.5x23 mm Cypher stent was deployed across the lesion at 16 ATM and then postdilated with a 4.0x13 mm Powersail balloon at 20 ATM.
IC Nitroglycerin and adenosine were given and normal flow in the LAD was restored.
Successful emergency PTCA and stenting was performed of the proximal LAD occlusion with a 3.5x23 mm Cypher stent which was postdilated to 4.0 mm.
PTCA of proximal LAD vessel.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a drug eluting stent.

Since previous tracing of [**2132-1-9**], no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: 58-year old white male was immediately taken to cardiac catheterization with intervention in the LAD, as noted above, transferred to CCU for post-procedure stabilization, and transferred to cardiology floor.
Due to high suspicion of STEMI, patient was initiated on a heparin and integrillin drips and the patient was emergently taken to the cath [**Hospital1 **], where a 100% occlusion was found in the LAD and successfully stented, please see note above.
From a medication standpoint, patient was treated with 80mg of a statin, aspirin 325mg, metoprol 25mg quid, plavix (post-cath) 150qd, and captopril, initally at 6.25 tid with uptitration to 12.5 tid.
On day of discharge, patient's medication regimen continued with the high dose statin, aspirin, toprolXL 100qd, lisinopril 5mg qd.
HEME:  Given risk for thrombus formation secondary to wall akinesis, anticoagulation was continued with an INR goal of 1.6 to 2.0.
On hospital day 2, pt was begun on a coumadin bridge.
Due to a small drop in hematocrit to 30, pt's anticoagulation with held with a subsequent rise to 33 with stabilization by the time of discharge.
Patient's coumadin was re-initiated at 4mg qhs, with a discharge INR of 1.3  Patient was given one dose of 80units SC lovenox prior to his discharge and given a prescription for 80 units SC lovenox [**Hospital1 **] until early next week after follow INR checks, which will be addressed by patient's PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also prescribed coumadin at 4mg qhs to be taken daily with the lovenox.
PULM: patient's respiratory status was not an active issue during his stay, as he did not require oxygen supplemenation and did not acquire any shortness of breath upon exertion.
Empirically he was initated on vancomycin and levofloxacin, with discontinuation of levofloxacin after a CXR failed to show any signs of pneumonia or infiltrate.
The pIV lines were removed secondary to tenderness and possible cause of infection.
Due to low clinical suspicion of an active clinical infection, the vancomycin was discontinued on day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions: Patient is advised to continue all medications as prescribed.
***Pt has been started on coumadin treatments for his depressed ejection fraction on his echocardiogram secondary to his myocardial infarction.
On day of discharge, pt's INR was 1.3.
Plan is to administer lovenox 80units sc prior to discharge and to write a prescription for lovenox 80units SC bid, concurrently administered with warfarin 4mg qhs saturday, sunday, and [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient is given a PT/INR prescription to be checked on [**Last Name (STitle) 766**], which has been explained to him, and to which he and his wife agreed.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will then adjust the regimen of anticoagulation as he deems clinically indicated ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 49449**]).
Also, if pt continues to bleed, risk vs. benefit of anticoagulation will have to be evaluated with PCP.
