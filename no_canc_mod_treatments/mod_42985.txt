He was treated with PRN IV Haldol for agitation and had an infectious and metabolic work-up for causes of delirium which was unrevealing.
Once Precedex was weaned (see below), his mental status improved.
He remained intubated and required intensive sedation with Midazolam and Propofol infusions, as well as Fentanyl for comfort.
Diazepam was started via his OGT as well.
Multivitamin, folate and thiamine were all started on admission.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY CONCERNS - Intubation for behavioral issues, ventilating well, with copious brown liquid being suctioned from ET tube initially; given these findings, there was some concern for aspiration in the setting of seizure or peri-intubation.
Given his increased sedation requirements, he required mechanical ventilatory support.
He was antibiosed with Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia coverage given his sputum culture gram stain demonstrating gram positive cocci and gram negative rods; speciating commensal organisms only.
He was maintained on heparin prophylaxis without issue.
Once identification was confirmed, his medication reconcilitation was performed.
