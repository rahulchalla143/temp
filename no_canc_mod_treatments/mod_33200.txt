Three separate areas were scanned including the left calf posteriorly, anterior to the shin, and the upper inner thigh on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with PMH of achondroplasia, morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary hypertension and right sided congestive heart failure presenting with sepsis, including fevers, hypoxia/elevated respiratory rate, and elevated WBC count requiring ICU level care.
Given the clinical severity, surgery was called for concern of necrotizing fascitis and clindamycin was added.
Slowly, the infection regressed on vancomycin and clindamycin.
He was discharged on a regimen of linezolid 800mg [**Hospital1 **] to be continued for another 8 days for a 14 day course.
While in the ICU, he was started on Vancomycin, levofloxacin and Tobramycin (unusual HCAP regimen due to multiple drug allergies).
He was given standing nebs with albuterol and ipratroprium.
He was also placed on droplet precautions, respiratory viral panel was ordered and Tamiflu was started empirically, however these were discontinued when his viral screens came back negative.
His respiratory status improved and he was weaned off levofloxacin and transferred to the medical floor.
On the medical service, he reported his breathing was back to baseline and he required BiPAP only at night and occasional 1-2 L NC, which is his baseline due to COPD.
INACTIVE CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Hypertension: Initially held home metoprolol and losartan given borderline pressures, however these were restarted prior to discharge.
His BP was actually borderline high on discharge, may consider increasing losartan dose as an outpatient.
# BPH: Initially held terazosin and tamsulosin while blood pressures were borderline low, however these were restarted prior to discharge.
# Diabetes mellitus: Held home metformin at home and started on lantus with ISS while inpatient.
