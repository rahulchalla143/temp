Initially, UA positive, and urine culture grew out Citrobacter koseri which is sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftaz which she was double-covered on for the first 5 days, and then will complete a course of levofloxacin to complete a 10-day course for her urinary tract infection, to which the Citrobacter is sensitive to.
CONSTIPATION:  The patient was constipated initially, likely secondary to her morphine that she gets for dressing changes.
She is status post an anal disimpaction, and continued on an aggressive bowel regimen, to which she is to continue at her nursing home to prevent further constipation.
DEMENTIA:  The patient was stable, at baseline mental status, per her son, and she was continued on depakote here.
STAGE 3 LOWER EXTREMITY ULCER:  This was stable, followed by the plastic service, and continued on [**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry dressings while in-house, and continued on frequent turns, Podus boots, and air bed to help and to optimize nutritional status, in hopes to help her ulcer heal.
The patient was seen by the plastic surgery who are now recommending transition to qd wet-to-dry dressing changes, and continue to await granulation tissue and revitalization.
However, no plans for skin graft at this time, as would like be more complicated than continuing dressing changes at this time.
