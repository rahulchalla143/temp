Admission Date:  [**2146-12-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-12-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-5-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for pericardial effusion, hypotension, pending tamponade.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes diet controlled, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with unknown CAD presents to [**Hospital3 3834**] after one week of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
Of note, the patient recently had DDD [**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed on [**2146-11-4**] for sick sinus syndrome and A-V block.
Patient treated with subQ vitamin K 2.5 mg, 3 units of FFP, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Course was complicated by hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 70s, given 200 cc/hour IV fluids, and dobutamine 2 mg/kg/minute.
Dobutamine stopped and bolused 500 cc of normal saline x2.
Refractory hypertension, peripheral dopamine started at 5 and increased to 8 mcg.
Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated diastolic RV collapse with INR of 4.7, 4 units of FFP infused, as well as 5 mg of IV vitamin K.  An atrial line was placed which demonstrated inspiratory variation.
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, 97.6, blood pressure 82/60, dopamine 5 mcg, rate 63, ventricular paced, respirations 18, and 93% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.2, hematocrit 30.7 status post 2 units of packed red blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation recently placed pacemaker, subacute pericardial effusion of unclear etiology likely hemorrhagic, workup viral, malignant physiology.
Patient is taken to Catheterization Laboratory for therapeutic diagnostic drainage.
Pericardial centesis performed removal of 1,050 cc of hemorrhagic pericardial fluid.
Patient's pericardial drain remained in place, on hospital day one drained 300 cc of bright red blood.
Elevated PA diastolic pressures of 22 post procedure suggest volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation during periods of hypertension.
EP evaluation was obtained to assess proper lead placement suspicious for LV lead position on chest x-ray.
Patient remained off aspirin and anticoagulation in the setting of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Drain was discontinued on hospital day #3.
Was transferred to the floor, where she underwent Physical Therapy with continual shortness of breath.
Autodiuresis post procedure significantly improved creatinine.
Pulmonary:  Stable PCWP 30 at time of catheterization, likely volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid rehydration.
Continue with diuresis of Lasix 20 IV q.d.
At time of discharge, sodium normalized to 136.
Potassium repleted.
Heme:  Coagulation reversed in setting of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with 4 units of FFP, 5 mg IV of vitamin K.  Hold on anticoagulation for at least one month.
No aspirin for at least one month.
Patient desires continual care at [**Hospital1 69**].
