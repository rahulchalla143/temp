[**2191-7-7**]  teeth extraction   History of Present Illness: This is a 49 year old male with history of severe mitral regurg originally presented to OSH w/ 3 months of constitutional symptoms including "leg heaviness" and 5 days of N/V/anorexia.
Initial labs demonstrated acute renal failure w/ hyperkalemia and HCT 18 requiring PRBC transfusion.
He was concurrently diagnosed with bladder outlet obstruction after foley catheter placement was attempted and failed multiple times.

A left-sided PICC line is also unchanged, terminating in the SVC.
The patient is status post sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.

The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive  infusions including epinephrine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine.
A well-seated mechanical bileaflet valve is seen in the mitral position  with normal leaflet motion and gradients.
Aorta is intact post decannulation 5.
Intravenous antibiotics(Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone) were given per ID recommendations.
Given markedly depressed right ventricular function and severely depressed cardiac indeces, he required placment of an IABP along with Dopamine for hemodynamic support.
He eventually underwent a mitral valve replacement on [**6-20**].
Inotropic support was weaned without difficulty.
He remained on intravenous antibiotics per ID recommendations, and a PICC line was eventually placed for long term antibiotics until [**7-29**].
Unlikely to be post-obstructive etiology given only 750cc urine drained after supra-pubic tube placement.
A tunnelled catheter was placed on [**6-28**] without complication.
His supra-pubic tube was eventually removed on [**7-1**].
Started on Epogen and was transfused with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit over 25%.
Postoperatively, he remained anemic and continued to require PRBC with hemodialysis.
4)HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Diagnosed in the postop period, initially required intravenous anticoagulation with Argatroban.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 3.0.
Determined to require infected teeth extraction by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] to be done this admission.
Underwent this procedure on [**7-7**] while coumadin held.
Coumadin restarted while on argatroban and cleared for discharge on [**7-14**] Coumadin INR to be followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3003**]/[**Hospital3 **] Clinic.
