He received aspirin 81mg x4, heparin bolus and drip, integralin bolus and drip, plavix 600mg po, nitro bolus and drip.
The proximal stent placement resulted in profound no reflow with acute worsening of the ST segment elevation in the anterior leads.
This was treated with nitroprusside 200mcg with near complete reslution of the angiographic reduced flow but persistance of the ST segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension  2.

# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - The patient had an STEMI with ST-elevations in the anterior leads and 100% occlusion of the mid-LAD and the RCA on admission.
He underwent placement of two bare-metal stents to the LAD.
He was treated with [**Month/Day/Year 13860**] for 18-hours, heparin drip until his procedure was completed, [**Month/Day/Year **], Plavix load and then Plavix 75 mg PO daily for at least one month given his stent.
He initially received Nitroprusside in the cath lab for the no reflow abnormality and then came to the CCU on a Nitroglycerin gtt, which was weaned off.
He was started on Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Captopril (until he was transitioned to Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily).
He was maintained on an ACEI, beta-blocker and statin prior to discharge.
# HYPERTENSION - The patient's home medications included Metoprolol, Lisinopril and we maintained him on these agents on dsicharge following his procedures.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We changed Simvastatin to Atorvastatin high dose for optimal statin utilization in the setting his known coronary disease.
# URINARY RETENTION, INCONTINENCE - We continued the patient on his home regimen of Oxybutynin, Finasteride and Terazosin.
He will need to take Aspirin and Plavix every day for at least one month and probably longer to keep the stents from clotting off and causing another heart attack.
Switched his Simvastatin for high dose Atorvastatin in the setting of coronary ishcemia this admission.

Do not stop taking aspirin and plavix or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you that it is OK.
