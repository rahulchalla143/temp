Subsequently, patient was admitted for carotid angiogram and percutaneous intervention by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Patient has had numerous cardiac catheterizations including cardiac catheterization in [**2140-10-23**] status post distal RCA stent placement, cardiac catheterization [**7-/2140**] status post proximal OM-1 stent for 70% proximal stenosis, cardiac catheterization on [**10-23**] which showed an ejection fraction of 68%, right dominant system.
RCA was 30% mid stenosis and distal RCA and obtuse marginal stents patent.
Erectile dysfunction status post penile prosthesis.
Glaucoma surgery, laser surgery three years ago.
Aspirin 325 po q day.
Lipitor 40 mg po q hs.
Plavix 75 mg po q day.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg po prn.

Isosorbide mononitrate 120 mg po q day.
Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
Folic acid 800 mg po q day.
Carotid angiogram:  Left carotid angiogram showed 90% distal occlusion of the common carotid artery and 90% occlusion of internal carotid artery with ulceration, Percusurge wire was used and two stents were placed in ACA and MCA.
Ophthalmic artery was visualized and was patent, but patient did develop blurry vision after the stents were placed.
Patient was started on Neo-Synephrine drip, with which a target blood pressure goal was achieved.
Subsequently over the course of the night and the next day, Neo-Synephrine was being weaned off.
Patient was given one dose of atropine with resulting heart rate posttreatment in the 60s and systolic blood pressure at goal.
Over the course of the next day, Neo-Synephrine was titrated off in order to maintain the goal systolic blood pressure of 140.
The patient was given several boluses of normal saline to 150 cc to maintain systolic blood pressure at goal.
Renal:  Patient maintained stable creatinine and electrolytes, and excellent urinary output.
Ophthal/Neuro:  Patient had dilated ophthalmologic examination by Ophthalmology service on the day of admission, which did show a cholesterol embolus at one of the branches of retinal artery and edema surrounding it, which was not consistent with ischemia or optic neuropathy, but rather an occlusion of a retinal artery branch with cholesterol embolus.
Patient was started on Alphagan as well as eyeball massage.
Patient maintained good oxygenation with home MDI regimen.
Prophylaxis:  SubQ Heparin was administered to the patient while the patient was unable to ambulate being due to status post carotid angiogram.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Carotid artery stenosis status post right carotid artery stent placement.
Atorvastatin 40 mg po q day.
Plavix 75 mg po q day.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
Alphagan as well as outpatient MDIs.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to hold and not to take his blood pressure medicines until discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] upon discharge.
Patient in the meanwhile is to still continue Alphagan and follow up with an ophthalmologist sooner if visual changes persist and do not improve.
