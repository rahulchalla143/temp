HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, Evans' syndrome, endocarditis, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve and tricuspid repair, and a recent history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection after lymphocele drainage who presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] with a fever of 104 and hypotension.
The patient has a history of endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**], status post aortic valve replacement and repair of her mitral and tricuspid valves with an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 55%, and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Her recovery from this endocarditis and surgery was complicated by a left-sided cerebrovascular accident in [**2196-1-25**].
The patient was home for a period of one month or two after rehabilitation from this surgery when she returned to [**Hospital6 1708**] where she received all of her care for drainage of bilateral groin lymphoceles which were found to be infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus, and corynebacterium.
She began a prolonged course of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2196-10-17**] on a course of linezolid and vancomycin.
She was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 70s in the Emergency Department and received 3 liters of normal saline with an increase in her systolic blood pressure to the 90s.
She was given levofloxacin and Flagyl and stress dose steroids.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of sepsis as well as monitoring for gastrointestinal bleed and was noted to have a heme-positive rectal examination and decreased platelet count in the Emergency Department.

However, given the patient's history of valve repair and recent treatment times one month for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after lymphocele drainage with recurrence of bacteremia and sepsis, the patient will continue on a long-term course of antibiotics for at least six weeks.
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended vancomycin 1 g q.12h.
