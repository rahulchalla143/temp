HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2119-9-12**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**], where she underwent repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm.
She had a #32 Hemashield placed and tolerated the operation well.
She arrived on milrinone, Nipride and propofol.
At that time, she was loaded with amiodarone and was started on Lopressor for rate control.
Her wound culture grew out Pseudomonas and at that time she was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin.
On postoperative day #8, a PICC line was placed and her central venous access was discontinued.
Her radial arterial line was also discontinued and the culture of the tip of that line grew out Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Her sternal wires were removed and replaced.
Again the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
Following the re-exploration, the patient was again slow to wean from the ventilator.
Over several days postoperatively from her re-exploration, she was again diuresed and slowly weaned from full ventilatory support to pressure support ventilation with decreasing amounts of PEEP and pressure support.
On postoperative day #16 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #6 from her re-wiring, the patient had a bump in her white blood cell count.
For that reason, her central venous access line was discontinued and a new left subclavian triple lumen catheter was placed.
Unfortunately, the patient developed a pneumothorax immediately following placement of the left subclavian line.
For that reason, a left chest tube was also placed.
A chest x-ray following placement of the left chest tube showed a resolved pneumothorax.
On postoperative day #19 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #9 from her re-exploration, the patient was again extubated.
She tolerated the extubation well and, over the next several days, remained in the intensive care unit to monitor her respiratory status while she continued to be diuresed and weaned from her oxygen support.
On postoperative day #23 from her aneurysm repair and postoperative day #13 from her re-wiring, a second PICC line was placed and the patient was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
On postoperative day #26 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #17 from her re-exploration, it was deemed that the patient was ready for transfer to a rehabilitation center for continuing rehabilitation and postoperative care.
