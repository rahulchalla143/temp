A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area.
Post CPB: The cardiac output is 7 L/min on epinephrine infusion.
The aortic valve area is 2.0cm2 using the continuity equation; Vmax 212cm/s, peak gradient 19mmHg, mean gradient is 9mmHg.
Ground-glass opacities are seen in a somewhat patchy distribution in the right hemithorax, in the upper greater than the lower lobes, and to a lesser extent, on the left.
However, whether these representing a hyperdense/hemorrhagic cysts, versus vascular mass cannot be determined on this examination without intravenous contrast.
Recommend attempt at fine-needle aspiration should be considered, although may be difficult due to the calcifications.
Colonic diverticulosis, cholelithiasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2133-8-19**] for surgical management of his coronary artery and valvular heart disease.

On [**2133-9-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels, redo aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, left atrial ligation and MAZE procedure.
He remained intubated until postoperative day two when he was successfully extubated.
He had some respiratory difficultuy requiring Bipap with good effect.
Coumadin and Amiodarone were resumed for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
