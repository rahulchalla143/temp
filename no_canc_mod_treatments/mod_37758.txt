Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x2 central line placement tracheostomy G-J tube placement PRBC transfusion echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] is a 67 year-old gentleman with a history of HIV (last CD4 273, VL<50), as well as a history of DM type 2, CAD status post CABG and RCA stent, PVD, CRI, GERD, CHF, TIA and history of large cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy in [**2189**], who now presents with worsening SOB and low-grade temperature.
He was last seen in clinic on [**2200-12-30**], at which time crixivan was increased and Nevirapine was added for increased CSF penetration.
Marginal improvement in SOB with escalating doses of Lasix to 40 mg PO BID.
By the patient account, he had some left arm pain yesterday, which was relieved with NTG X 1.
He was placed on 100%NRB, with saturation 98-100%.
He received Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 as well as CTX 1 gm IV + Vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1.
CAD, s/p 2-vessel CABG in [**2194**] and RCA stent in 10/[**2198**].
History of large cell lymphoma (liver and periaortic Lymph nodes) s/p 6 rounds of chemotherapy in [**2189**] 5.
Baseline creatinine variable.
Status post anterior disc excision and fusion C7-Ti in [**2189**].
12. h/o resp failure requiring intubation [**7-7**] (x7 days) with "double PNA" and resp failure in [**State 33977**] in [**5-7**] 13.
Family History: Sister died of CAD and CVA Brother has h/o CAD Mother has h/o CAD  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITALS: T 101.2, HR 95, BP 140s/80s, RR 22, Sat 100% on NRB GEN: Emaciated man, hard of hearing, in NAD.
The patient is status-post median sternotomy with cervical hardware identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Complex patient with HIV, CAD s/p CABG and PTCA, diastolic CHF, DM type 2, presenting with worsening SOB, low-grade temperature and nausea.
-- Patient was treated with 14 day course of levofloxacin for presumed CAP.
He was also treated with 10 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for presumed nosocomial/vent-assoc PNA given diffuse b/l infiltrates found during hosp course after intubation.
-- LENIs were done x2 and no DVT found; bedside TTE on [**2200-2-8**] showed no evidence of RV failure in setting of acute decompensation -- A PA catheter was placed on [**2-12**] to better evaluate volume status given ?
The patient was felt to be volume overloaded and attempts were made at diuresis, initially with nesiritide but unsuccessful and low dose lasix was administered on an as needed basis with good effect.
-- Tracheostomy performed at bedside on [**2-13**] due to failure to wean.
-- He was weaned down to PSV 10/5 and was using Passy Muir valve by time of discharge with periods of trach collar without difficulty.
-- as he had +urine eos and crystals, his HAART (indinavir) was held x3 days, but no significant change occured and his ARF was not felt to be secondary to med side effects -- creatine improved and patient was able to have good post-ATN diuresis with assistance of lasix.
Shock: hypotensive on admission, responded to dopamine and weaned off within 24 hrs.
he was later found to have guaiac positive stools after he had continuous diarrhea and a rectal tube was inserted -- hemolysis labs(-) x 3.  retic 3.4% and 1.7%.
iron studies with low iron and TIBC, but elevtaed ferritin after transfusiuons- like anemia secondary to iron deficiency and chronic disease and HAART medications.
-- Mr [**Known lastname 106212**] has prevously had EGD and C-scope in [**2198**] and [**2194**] which showed gastritis but otherwise WNL.
as his drop in hct was not critical, it is reasonable to follow up with outpatient EGD if it continues to be an issue -- ID did not feel his HAART medications were contributing to his anemia * 5.
Intubated after trial of BiPAP secondary to hypercarbia.
His blood pressure was monitored and he was maintained on metoprolol, amlodopine, hydralazine and isordil with as needed doses of lasix.
CAD: CAD s/p CABG s/p stent [**10-6**] - no active signs of ischemia and EKG unchanged - Ruled out for MI with 3 neg CE's twice - increased trop likely secondary to ARF - FLP checked and LDL 60 - continued on asprin and [**Year (2 digits) 4532**] * 8.
Diarrhea: significant loose stools requiring placement of rectal tube.
DMII- insulin drip initially and transitioned to sliding scale insulin with [**Hospital1 **] NPH with reasonable glucose control.
post pyloric feeding tube attempted x2 by IR, but unsuccessful.
-- PEJ tube placed [**2200-2-19**] and TFs restarted.
-- he was fitted with a Passy-Muir valve which he started using on [**2200-2-21**].
-- eval by speech and swallow at bedside inconclusive as aspirated on thin liquids, but able to tolerate thich custard without difficulty.
-- reglan has been used in past with success and should be attempted if problems develop -- continue lansoprazole for reflux * 11.
Prophylaxis: continue subcutaneous heparin until ambulating regularly * 13.
Dispo: discharge to rehab for further trach care and weaning, further assessment of swallow and physical therapy.
