She received ciprofloxacin and flagyl with improvement in her fever, liver function tests, and all of her symptoms.
She underwent an MRCP that same day, which demonstrated 2 large stones in the CBD with intra and extra-hepatic dilitation.
She underwent an [**Name (NI) 48373**] PTC placement on [**6-29**] after 1 day of being pre-medicated due to a contrast allergy (hives).
The ERCP team attempted a rendezvous procedure on [**6-30**] using the PTC, however, they were unable to access the ampulla.
She underwent an IR guided procedure for stone extraction on [**7-4**] which was successful but was complicated with hypoxia and respiratory distress.
She was initially placed on BiPap but was weaned latter to 2 L nasal cannula.
Hypoxic respiratory distress was from decompensated CHF and flash pulmonary edema as well as her COPD/asthma exacerbation and improved with diuresis and bronchodilators.
She also received diltiazem for several episodes of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate and her beta blocker dose was increased.
However, Metoprolol was inadequate to treat her atrial fibrillation.
Digoxin was added with excellent contol (HR of 65-70) and avoidance of excessive hypotension.
Coumadin was held due to procedures but she was started on lovenox 70 mg SC BID since will need a repeat outpatient IR procedure (PTC) soon (appointment was scheduled).
She underwent thoracentesis for diagnostic purpuses to rule out parapneumonic effusion and effusion related to subdiaphragm process.
She was finally discharged to LTAC as her fluid analysis showed no infection.........Before discharge, she was started on Augmentin to treat mild infection of biliary drain exit site...... .
The external drain was capped on [**7-9**] with no recurrence of her symptoms despite eating a normal diet.
