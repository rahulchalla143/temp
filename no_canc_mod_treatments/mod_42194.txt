POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2178-6-8**]):       Test cancelled by laboratory.
Numerous acute inflammatory cells and macrophages.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical mycobacterial infection, sarcoidosis, lymphoproliferative disorder, and less likely Kaposis sarcoma.
CXR [**2178-6-14**] NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.
Rigid bronchoscopy with flexible bronchoscopy with removal of endobronchial thrombus and blood but with no active bleeding seen on the right sided airways.
Double lumen ET tube exchanged to a single lumen ET tube.
Two days later on [**2178-6-8**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the thrombus and blood; no active bleeding was seen in right side of the right lower lobe with purulent secretions removed.
She completed a course of Vancomycin/Cefepime ([**Date range (1) 112256**]) and Azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 112257**]), with WBC decreasing to 9.1.
After diuresis to optimize her oxygenation status, on [**6-11**] she was able to be extubated without issues and she was weaned to room air on the medical floor.
Aspergillus fumigatus in sputum: likely not pathogenic.
Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative, so less likely to have invasive Aspergillosis and there is no need for Voriconazole treatment per discussion with Pulmonology.
Atrial fibrillation: s/p [**Last Name (STitle) 5509**], on Warfarin with NEW INR GOAL OF 2.0-2.5.
(a) Rate She was continued on sotalol 80 [**Hospital1 **].
She went into AFib with [**Hospital1 5509**] on MICU day 6 so she received IV diltiazem and was transitioned to PO diltiazem, which she is being discharged on as a new med.
(b) Anticoagulation Warfarin was initially held and INR reversed with FFP as above, and after discussion with Pulmonology it was restarted on [**2178-6-15**].
While her home Warfarin dose is 5mg daily, she is being discharged on 4mg daily due to the risks associated with over-anticoagulation.
While intubated, she was on tube feeds and upon extubation was evaluated by Speech Therapy who felt that she was an aspiration risk.
She was re-evaluated on [**2178-6-15**] and was felt to be safe for a diet with observation; she did well and her NG tube was removed.
Her Aspirin 81 mg was restarted once her Hct remained stable.
Initially her Warfarin was held but was restarted [**2178-6-15**] (please see above regarding Warfarin and new INR goal).
Patient became hypertensive once bleed resolved, so she was initially placed on Captopril 37.5 TID, then was transitioned back to home dose Losartan which she should continue as an outpatient.

You were intubated (had a breathing tube in) and underwent bronchoscopies (diagnostic procedure with a scope) that showed that the bleeding was probably from your known bronchiectasis as well as pneumonia in the setting of having thin blood from Warfarin.
You were stabilized and extubated (breathing tube removed), and are being discharged to rehab to regain your strength.
Note that while you were here, you were evaluated by Speech and Swallow therapy and have been cleared for a regular diet.
Also note that while you were admitted you had an episode of atrial fibrillation with a fast heart rate; for this, you have been started on a new medication (Diltiazem) and your heart rate is controlled.
Change Warfarin dose to 4mg (rather than 5mg) with new INR goal of 2.0-2.5 2.
Start medications you can take for constipation: Docusate, Senna, and Miralax as needed.
