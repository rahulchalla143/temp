HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 55-year-old white male with a history of severe diabetes mellitus, status post living-related renal transplant plus immunosuppression who presented on [**2139-3-16**], with a 2-day history of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased p.o.
The patient was started on azithromycin at that time for presumed atypical pneumonia.
Over the course of the following three days, serial chest x-rays revealed a progression of the infiltrative process, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Levaquin.
In addition, on [**3-21**], his respiratory status continued to deteriorate with a decline in oxygen saturation of 89% on 3 liters to 91% on 4 liters.
On [**3-22**], he was satting 87% on 3 liters and 90% to 92% on a nonrebreather.
A chest x-ray at that time revealed a worsening interstitial process (congestive heart failure versus acute respiratory distress syndrome), and the patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
He was also started on ceftriaxone for gram-negative coverage.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   His past surgical history is notable for his living-related renal transplant in [**2131-1-9**].
He is also status post lymphocele drainage and ureteral  reimplantation in [**2131-5-10**], and he is also status post nephrostomy tube placement in [**2131-5-10**].
The patient was continued on a regimen of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
On day three post transfer, no nebulizer treatments were necessary.
It is important to note that the patient is at increased risk for infection given his current immunosuppressive regimen of prednisone and cyclosporin given his LLRT (i.e.
CARDIAC:  The patient's blood pressure was managed effectively with Procardia and Pravachol.
On admission, given the abnormalities noted on the patient's echocardiogram, he was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for further cardiac management given the findings consistent with mild congestive heart failure on chest x-ray in addition to the abnormal findings on echocardiogram.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  With regard to infectious disease issues, on post transfer day two, the patient was on day 7 out of 10 for Levaquin, and his ceftriaxone was discontinued at that time.
RENAL/FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:   The patient's electrolyte balance was managed with repletion as needed.
His Foley was discontinued on transfer day two, and the patient produced good urine output.
He will be continued on cyclosporin and prednisone as immunosuppression for his transplant.
Renal consultation recommended Lasix for the patient's mild left lower extremity edema, and the patient does note however that he follows his edema closely and currently takes Lasix 20 mg q.d.
Per infectious disease consultation, the patient was treated on an outpatient basis with levofloxacin for 10 to 14 days.
Cyclosporin 200 mg p.o.
Prednisone 5 mg p.o.
Midodrine 10 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.
Pravachol 40 mg p.o.
Procardia-XL 60 mg p.o.
Neurontin 300 mg p.o.
Niferex 150 mg p.o.
Bicitra 30 cc p.o.
