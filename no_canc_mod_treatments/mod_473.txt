He was transferred to the CCU team for further management of his hypotension and ARF   Past Medical History: 1 non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy w/ EF 20% Echo [**7-4**] EF 20% left ventricular ejection fraction is slightly increased; the tricuspid regurgitation is also increased.

He received some fluid resucitation on the floor after the elective surgery at the time of hypotension, but was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, and with poor UO (5cc/hr).
We started him on dopamine gtt to increase his renal perfusion and held beta-blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and lasix (given rising Cr).
We continued monitoring his I/Os, and he was able to have good UOs without lasix or fluids, we gradually weaned him off the dopamine gtt.
On his second day at the CCU, his BP continued to remain within normotensive range, and he was started on Coreg 12.5mg PO bid, and he was transferred to the step down unit on [**2175-9-1**], his Blood pressure continued ranging between 102-117/63-80 on the floor.
He was told to hold off [**Last Name (un) **] intially, and check BP regulary, start with low dose [**Last Name (un) **] and check with PCP and cardiologist for adjustment of meds.
Chronic A.fib with intermittent RVR, rate up to 140s prior to transfer to CCU, has been off coumadin prior to surgery.
Upon transfering to the CCU, we put him on tele, initially held betal block and coumadin, which was restarted on [**2175-9-1**], and continued monitoring his INR.
He was intially started on Digoxin 0.25mg po qday which was decreased to 0.125mg given ARF.
Unclear etiology, very rapid rise in Cr on the floor post elective hernia repair, sodium avid by urine lytes (Na <10, FUrea 4%) suggesting severe prerenal state.
He was started on dopamine gTT to help renal profusion and hypotension intially.
Patient has been off coumadin prior to surgery, renal u/s showed echogenic kidney suggesting medical renal disease, no evidence of renal arteries stenosis, unable to evaluate renal vein thrombosis.
He continued to have good UO at the CCU, and we gradually wean him off the dopamine gtt, his Cr continued to trend down 3.2->2.0->1.6->1.3 which is his baseline.
