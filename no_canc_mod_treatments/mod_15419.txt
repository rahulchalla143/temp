NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient's neurological examination improved slightly to the point that his eyes were open and he appeared to be awake, although he did not track visual stimuli including examiner's faces.
The patient was on a multitude of blood pressure lowering medications including Clonidine, Norvasc, Lasix, Enalapril, and metoprolol.
He was eventually switched over to simplify the regimen to just labetalol and Enalapril and probably could increase the doses of those medications should his blood pressure not stay well controlled under systolic blood pressure of 160 or less.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient still remains ventilated and had received a tracheostomy on [**2146-4-20**].
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on Lasix standing 20 mg b.i.d.
Furosemide was discontinued to allow the patient's fluid status to re-equilibrate.
In part, this is probably likely due to anemia of chronic disease; however, iron studies are still pending at this time.
He finished a course of ceftriaxone for this.
As mentioned, he had a coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection in his blood for which he was on vancomycin for a total of 14 days.
