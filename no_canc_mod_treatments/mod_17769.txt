Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 76425**] was admitted with an NSTEMI with a course complicated by A Fib with RVR and CHF.
She was DNR/DNI and had no invasive procedures, including cardiac catheterization.
She was continued on 48 hours of heparin upon hospitalization, as well as aspirin and atorvastatin.
Echocardiogram was deferred as it was felt that the results would not change management given her goals of care.
She was pharmacologically cardioverted with procainamide on [**2201-2-11**] to sinus rhythm with HR 50 - 60's.
She was noted to have pauses with hypotension when she converted from AFib to SR.  She was started on amlodipine 100 mg QD and taken off all nodal agents, including metoprolol.
On [**2201-2-13**] her blood pressures were fairly high and she was restarted on lisinopril 20 mg QD (half of her home dose of 40 mg QD) with hydralazine PRN for breakthrough SBP > 170.
She was also placed on magnesium oxide 400 mg PO QD.
Chest x-ray showed a questionable opacity, and she was started on a seven day course of cefpodoxime for a possible pneumonia.
She likely had some degree of ARF from poor forward flow in the setting of AFib with RVR and CHF, and her creatinine improved to 1.0 with better rate control.
Patient however returned to AFib with RVR and became hypotensive and progressively lethargic.
