An NGT was placed with hurricane spray and pt aspirated.
Post intubation film confirmed the NGT well within the stomach, which was decompressed, and appropriate positioning of the NGT.

Minimal residual debris at site of prior pigtail drain without evidence of reaccumulated or new focal abscess.
She arrived from [**Location **] intubated/sedated on mechanical ventilation.
In brief, we were unable to wean her from the ventilator but her mental status normalized and her gut tolerated tube feeds.
Repeated attempts to wean pressure support were limited by tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia.
Once apparent she would likely never wean from the vent, she underwent tracheostomy [**2153-5-12**].
GI: She arrived with an NGT in place given her sedation and risk for aspiration.
Tube feeds were started [**5-7**].
Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed on [**5-12**] and feeds were begun the following day.
FEN: She required few IV boluses.
She was started on TPN [**2153-5-1**] and continued until could tolerate tube feed nutrition.
She was transfused 2 units PRBC on HD 4 and required pressors and was not responding sufficiently to crystalloid resuscitation.
However, once adequately rescusitated, the patient was weaned off of pressors, and did not require additional blood transfusions.
Possible fungal reservoir include heart valves, which would require amphoteracin treatment.
On HD2, she underwent IR-guided drain placement of the pelvic abscess.
This drain was removed after 8 days and CT pelvis showed resolution of abscess.
Her antibiotic therapy changed frequently based on recommendations from the Infectious Disease consult team and her culture data.
Of note, all [**Female First Name (un) **] growths were fluconazole sensitive and Klebsiella was pan-sensitive.
