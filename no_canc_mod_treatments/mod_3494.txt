The patient had multiple sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief of pain and presented to outside hospital three days prior to admission, was placed on heparin and Integrilin, Nitroglycerin drip, aspirin, beta blocker, with relief of pain.
On hospital day number two, he developed abdominal pain and was given Maalox with minimal relief.
No intervention was performed at this time.
The patient was scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft.
Heparin drip.
Nitroglycerin drip.
Atenolol 100 p.o.
Lasix 40 p.o.
Integrilin drip.
Protonix 40 q. day.
ALLERGIES:   The patient is allergic to penicillin and statins.
SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient's social history is remarkable for, as mentioned above, the patient is a Jehovah's Witness with strong belief that prevents him from receiving blood products.
Heparin drips were going at 100 Units per hour, Nitroglycerin gtt.
The site of his balloon pump was without ecchymosis or oozing.
In short, this is a 52 gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors and known three-vessel disease presenting with breakthrough pain while on nitrates and heparin drip awaiting elective coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient underwent diagnostic catheterization again without intervention and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
Plavix held secondary to increased risk of bleeding with potential for surgery in the near future.
The patient was on heparin drip, Nitroglycerin drip as well as an intra-aortic balloon pump.
The patient had recurrent chest pain requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and Nitroglycerin drip.
Thus, the patient was maintained on a balloon pump and nitrates until such time as he could be taken to Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, where he underwent successful percutaneous intervention with rotational atherectomy to his l eft anterior descending and stents times two to his left anterior descending with no residual stenosis.
Following catheterization intervention, the patient was able to be weaned from the balloon pump and nitrates and was pain free at the time of discharge on a long-acting nitrate.
The patient was maintained on intra-aortic balloon pump to increase afterload reduction until after his catheterization, at which time he was weaned from the balloon pump.
A beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were titrated as tolerated and the patient was diuresed as necessary.
Following his cardiac catheterization interventions, his hematocrit decreased to a nadir of 28.0.
The patient was started on Epogen subcutaneously 300 units three times a week, in hopes of boosting his hematocrit to the point where he would be able to undergo cardiac surgery at some point in the near future.
Endocrine:  The patient was a known diabetic and was maintained on Regular insulin sliding scale during the course of his admission.
Infectious Disease:  The patient spiked fevers several days after admission to a temperature maximum of 101.5 F.  He was pan-cultured and started on empiric antibiotics of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
No source of infection was localized, nevertheless, it was decided to treat the patient with Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Status post intervention to the left anterior descending coronary artery with stent placement times two.
