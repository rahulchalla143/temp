He was intubated in the ED and went into afib with RVR and dropped his BP, so dilt gtt was started as well as peripheral dopamine.
He was noted to have a K of 7.3, was treated with CaCl, NS IVFs, and kayexcelate.
He was given a total of 4L NS and cefepime 1gm and levofloxacin 750 mg.  A Femoral CVL was placed.
He was transported via ambulance on propofol 20 mg IV prn, dopmaine 40 mg/kg/min, and cardizem 10 mg/hr.
He was intubated and sedated, thus there was no more history available.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient being on a ventilator.
Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
Respiratory failure and pneumonia: Initially intubated and admitted to the MICU where he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors.
Antibiotics continued for HAP and complicated by aspiration.
Received 14d course vancomycin and cefepime and 6 days of Flagyl.
Respiratory status was complicated by a component of volume overload and received several doses of IV lasix with good results, which was continued for a daily dose of 40mg PO Lasix.
Tube feeds were also adjusted for a lower volume so that aspiration risk is minimized and Hyoscyamine was started to decrease secreations.
Started on a diltiazem drip  and eventually hemodynamics normalized.
Likely exacerbated with dopamine used as initial pressor.
After weening of vasopressors, restarted on home metoprolol amd amiodarone doses with good effect.
On day of discharge, metoprolol was decreased from QID to TID for HR in the 60s.
On coumadin for anticoagulation with INR 1.9-2.1.
Started on lasix as above with good effect.
Continued on Aspirin and statin.
Given IV D5W and adjusted free water flushes in tube feeds.
At time of discharge, sodium normalized, but should be monitored with free water adjusted accordingly.
Etiology likely prerenal given it improved quickly with IVF and resolution of septic shock.
unknown baseline for patient, peaked at 3.2 but improved rapidly to 1.3 after IVF and resolution of shock .
# DM - Well controlled on basic sliding scale and home latus 18qHS.
Likely combination of anemia of chronic disease and dilutional effect with copious fluids given throughout hospitalization.
The decision was made to make patient DNR/DNI although antibiotics were continued for a full course.
