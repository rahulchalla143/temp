CONCISE SUMMARY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  An 80-year-old woman with chronic low back pain status post laminectomy in the past as well as nerve block to L3 on [**2182-4-5**] who presents with increasing low back pain.
The patient, therefore, was consented for and underwent open neurosurgical biopsy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**].
Pathology and cultures from that has been unrevealing so far with Gram stain showing only 2 plus polymorphoneutrophils.
At the time of discharge, cultures were still no growth to date including AFB and fungal.
Infectious Disease followed the patient throughout her hospital stay and given the lack of signs or symptoms or definitive evidence of infection, antibiotics were not administered.
If the culture continues to be negative, the plan is to continue to hold off antibiotics and radiologic finding was likely due to chronic degenerative disk changes.
The patient was initially, prior to the open biopsy, treated with Dilaudid p.r.n.
Her OxyContin was changed to methadone.
