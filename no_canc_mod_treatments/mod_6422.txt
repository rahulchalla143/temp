Patient was recently seen here at [**Hospital1 18**] for possible overdose attempt with Soma on [**2107-12-22**] and admitted to [**Doctor First Name 1191**] for inpatient treatment for 3-4 days.
Currently receiving outpatient treatment at a day program at [**Doctor First Name 1191**].
Per previous [**Hospital1 **] summaries and also on this admission, patient admits to taking medications such as Soma in order to help with 'sleep deprivation' and never directly acknowledges any SI attempts.
Patient was noted to have declining mental status during her ED stay, became non-responsive to sternal rub, and was intubated immediately afterwards for airway protection and obtundation.
She eceived fentanyl, midazolam, CFTX IV x1 for a presumed UTI, Naloxone, and neosynephrine  boluses x2 peri-intubation.
VS prior to transfer were 98.3 106/96 15 100% on AC vent ssettings.
Past Medical History: Depression (recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] Psychiatry Unit in [**7-/2108**]) Anxiety EtOH Dependence (in remission X 20 years) Benzodiazepine Dependence (abuse of Ativan in the past) chronic trapezius strain Left fractured distal radial head (wrist) injury ~5 weeks prior to DOA.
Has abused soma and valium and ativan in the past.
Pertinent Results: CXR - [**2108-1-7**]: Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal tube has been  placed with the distal tip approximately 5.6 cm from the carina in adequate position.
A nasogastric tube is also introduced and coils presumably within the gastric antrum with the tip directed back to the fundus and the side hole situated within the gastric body.
IMPRESSION: Support tubes as described above.
Obtundation: Likely in setting of medication overdose, given previous history.
Likely mixed ingestion as clinical presentation does not fit one particular ingestion (dilated pupils but hypotensive and bradycardic) and husband states many of her psych meds at her bedside but no completely empty bottles, indicating patient may have potentially taken some of everything.
Medications patient possibly could have ingested include clonidine (causes pinpoint pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, coma, apnea), provigil (CNS stimulant with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, insomnia, agitation, tachycardia and anxiety with elevated CPK), hydroxyzine (anti-cholinergic), gabapentin (GABA-ergic with somnolence, AMS, dizziness and tachycardia), parnate (MAOI -> Serotonin Syndrome), resteril and Temezepam (benzodiazepines, respiratory depression).
Patient noted to overdose on Soma in the past as well to 'get sleep', and to abuse Ativan, and with high levels of lorazepam in her urine toxicology screens on past admission, and was noted to have access to Temazepam and Rozerem (Rameltron, a sedative hyponotic that affects melatonin receptors, can cause dizziness, somnolence, and depression).
Toxicology consulted and recommended serial EKGs for widening QRS >100.
Bicarb drip (3amps/h) was started with resultant narrowing of QRS.
Pt was intubated and sedated with fentanyl and versed.
Required 4 L IVF resuscitation in the ED.
Likely in setting of medication overdose, although unclear which medication could contribute.
Psych consulted who recommended inpatient treatment.
