She was found to have severe mitral regurgitation, and had a mitral valve repair in [**2099-7-21**].
She describes the surgery as being very difficult, requiring a repeat operation the same admission.
Postoperatively, she developed atrial fibrillation and was managed with amiodarone for about a year.
She was diuresed and kept on lasix for some time, but eventually tapered off.
Her lasix was restarted, with some improvement of her symptoms.
Echocardiograms performed recently had revealed mitral stenosis, and she is now referred for a mitral valve replacement.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Ejection fraction 68%, left ventricular end diastolic pressure 14, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 33, pulmonary artery pressure 63/26, mitral valve area 0.65, mitral valve gradient 19 mm.
She was kept overnight, and the following day she was taken to the operating room, where she had a minimally-invasive mitral valve replacement.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken intubated to the Intensive Care Unit.
She did require some support with milrinone overnight, and also received two units of Hespan.
The following day, she remained in the Intensive Care Unit, and required a bit of a nitroglycerin drip.
Her chest tubes were discontinued in a normal fashion, and later that day she was transferred to the floor.
She required a total of 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor in order to convert back to a sinus rhythm.
A couple of hours later, she had another episode of rapid heart rate and required another 20 mg of intravenous Lopressor.
The decision was made to load her with intravenous amiodarone and replete her electrolytes.
She was then converted to oral amiodarone, which she will likely need to be on for some time.
She continued to be diuresed, and her pacing wires were discontinued.
