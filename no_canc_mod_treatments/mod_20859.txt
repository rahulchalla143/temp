The patient similarly denied any new medications or changes in her medications.
The patient was given 1 gm intravenously of Solu-Medrol and was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].
Seroquel 75 mg q.h.s.
Topamax 100 mg. 3.
Mirtazapine 15 mg. 4.
Verapamil 80 mg p.o.
Echinacea started one month ago.
Chemistries, sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 104, bicarbonate 28, BUN 38, creatinine 1.2, glucose 158, anion gap of 14, ALT 18, AST 46, alkaline phosphatase 120, amylase 33, total bilirubin 2.2, lipase 35, albumin 3.6.
Urinalysis:  Red, protein over 300, trace glucose, moderate bilirubin, red blood cells over 50, white blood cells [**3-1**], few bacteria.
A hematology and transfusion medicine consult was obtained and the patient was initiated on plasmapheresis for idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
During the patient's sixth plasmapheresis she experienced hives on her face and upper chest which were treated with Benadryl and steroids.
On the following day, during her seventh plasmapheresis the patient was premedicated with Benadryl and Tylenol.
The patient was given an additional intravenous dose of Benadryl and 200 mg of Hydrocortisone and was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air.
The patient was placed on 5 liters of nonrebreather and her oxygen saturations increased only to 93%.
Respiratory therapy was called and gave the patient a Combivent nebulizer treatment and the patient began coughing up pink frothy sputum.
The patient was urgently transported to the Emergency Department where she was intubated for respiratory failure.
The patient's platelet count subsequently increased with subsequent plasmapheresis.
In addition, her other markers of hemolytic anemia including LDH, total bilirubin and haptoglobin improved.
Respiratory failure - As noted earlier, the patient became acutely short of breath with expiratory grunting and paradoxical breathing patterns during her seventh plasmapheresis and was urgently transferred to the Emergency Department where she was intubated.
The patient was initiated on pressure control ventilation with several recruitment maneuvers and was paralyzed due to continuous difficulty oxygenating and ventilating.
Over her stay in the MICU the patient's oxygenation and ventilation improved and she was eventually switched over to assist control ventilation which she tolerated quite well.
Over her MICU course, the patient's driving pressures and positive end-expiratory pressure as well as her FIO2 were titrated down.
The patient was continued on unprotected ventilation for adult respiratory distress syndrome.
With large volume diuresis with CVVH the patient's respiratory status improved dramatically and at the time of dictation, the patient is tolerating pressure support, ventilation of [**5-1**] and oxygenating quite well.
Septic shock - The patient was noted on transfer to the MICU to be in septic shock requiring pressors and large fluid boluses.
The patient was placed on Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Flagyl and Levofloxacin for broad empiric coverage.
She received a even day course of steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency.
Once stable, the patient was taken for a chest and abdominal computerized tomography scan on [**2120-3-26**] for continuing low-grade fevers.
Otorhinolaryngology was consulted and removed the nasal packing and the patient was started on Afrin for subsequent oozing from her nares.
On transfer to the MICU the patient's Apache score was calculated at 31 and a trial of Xigris was considered but was eventually not used secondary to the patient's DIC.
Cardiovascular - In the setting of the patient's Trali and septic shock her cardiac enzymes were noted to bump.
As noted earlier, the patient was acutely hypotensive in septic shock and was placed on Levophed and Vasopressin for maintenance of her blood pressures.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started on tube feeds on her second day in the MICU which she tolerated at goal.
The patient was placed on a calcium gluconate drip with frequent ionized calcium checks given the citrate in her plasmapheresis and multiple blood transfusions.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as well as her discharge medications and follow up plans will be dictated at the time of discharge.
