Findings could reflect multifocal infection, or drug reaction, combined with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Marked osteopenia with multiple stable vertebral body compression fractures and old rib fractures.
Hypoxia, fevers:  She was found to have possible multifocal pneumonia on CXR, she was initially treated broadly with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin, which was then narrowed to Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and changed to Levofloxacin and Cefpodoxime before dischage (planned last day [**1-15**]).
She was treated with nebulizer treatments and a short course of prednisone for possible contribution of her underlying asthma.
Patient was originally started on Tamiflu but then tested negative for influenza and her tamiflu was stopped.
Somnolence:  She had somnolence initially on presentation that was thought to be related to a toxic ingestion given her past history of drug abuse in conjunction with verbal report from ED that patient went to restroom and came back to ED room much more somnolent.
She was treated with standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, her home regimen of monteleukast and advair.
She was also treated with a prednisone taper.
It seemed that the patient's chronic respiratory sxs might not be due to asthma (overall low lung volumes and does not require chronic steroids like she has as a child) but to other chronic lung disease.
The patient was presented at the pulmonary conference and she will need outpatient pulmonary follow-up.
However, in the setting of joint prosthesis, she will need cautious monitoring off of antibiotic therapy.
Opiate addiction: She was continued on a methadone taper.
She had a Code Purple called for aggressive and agitated behavior and was given Ativan and Seroquel with good effect.
