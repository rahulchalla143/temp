The patient states that he was visiting from [**Country 16465**] for a conference.

He was given Lopressor 5 mg IV x1, 25 mg po x1, and Lasix 20 mg IV x1, as well as nitropaste.
Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
Glucophage 500 mg po q day.
Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and no known coronary artery disease who presents complaining of intermittent episodes of substernal chest pain x2 days associated with diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and fatigue concerning for unstable angina.
He was admitted continued symptoms to rule out myocardial infarction as well as workup for his increased creatinine of 1.7.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**6-10**], which revealed mild left atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a resting basal to mid inferior akinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis and akinesis, RVH, right ventricular cavity dilatation, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure and volume overload, mild aortic and mitral and tricuspid valve thickening, mild-to-moderate AR, mild MR, moderate TR, left ventricular inflow consistent with pseudonormal pattern with increased left sided filling pressures and impaired left ventricular relaxation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and an ejection fraction of 55%.
Chest pain/rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient was started on aspirin, beta blocker, Heparin and Integrilin given the fact that he had active chest pain.
As a result, Heparin and Integrilin were discontinued.
Pulmonary artery hypertension:  The workup mentioned above under the procedure section was performed to elicit a cause of the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
