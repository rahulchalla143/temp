No peripheral edema, weight gain, medication noncompliance or dietary indescretion.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and in less than 2 weeks, respiratory status and CXR had returned to baseline.
Patient was treated for presumptive CHF exacerbation with nitro gtt, lasix with resultant 2L urine output.
Patient was able to be weaned transiently from BiPAP to 6LNC but desaturated to mid 80%.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ([**10/2195**]-LVEF 20%, LVD 6.4  cm, mild RV dilation, borderline function, 1+ MR) - hepatitis C antibody positive - MRSA pneumonia (requiring trach) - COPD - Substance abuse (cocaine) - Tobacco abuse - schizophrenia  Social History: - history of multiple incarcerations (>6 months in [**2193**]) - lives with sister - walks w/ cane due to right sided foot drop - Tobacco history: current smoker, 1 cig per day - ETOH: denies - Illicit drugs: crack cocaine three days ago   Family History: - Father: pacemaker, deceased  Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS: T=98.1 BP=124/89 HR=110 RR=31 O2 sat=91% on BiPAP 8/5 GENERAL: A+O x3.
BiPAP mask in place.
The distribution of disease is nearly identical to the prior CT; however, it is noted that there was interval resolution of these abnormalities (see chest radiograph [**2195-12-30**]).
# DIFFUSE, BILATERAL LUNG OPACIFICATION AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY DECOMPENSATION - His initial presentation was concerning for pulmonary edema vs. multifocal pneumonia vs. hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Per the ED, he improved symptomatically on BiPAP, Nitroglycerin gtt and a Lasix gtt which made a component of decompensated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy a likely superimposed diagnosis.
He was weaned from a non-rebreather to 1L of oxygen via nasal cannula - ultimately on room air upon discharge.
He was treated with Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 with resultant hyperglycemia, and was therefore managed without steroids thereafter.
Antibiotics were also deferred given his rapid clinical improvement.
Did receive pulse steroids for hypersensitivity pneumonitis concerns (as noted above), with resulting hyperglycemia, requiring an insulin gtt briefly.
He was quickly weaned to his home Lantus regimen without concern.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes was consulted during her insulin gtt period, and agreed with return to his home regimen.
Admitted with some chest discomfort, EKG changes with non-specific ST changes and Troponin elevation to 0.05-0.06 with flat CK-MBs x 2.
He was admitted to the CCU initially and started on a Nitroglycerin gtt with Lasix gtt for presumed volume overload in the setting of dietary indiscretion and poor compliance with diuretics, leading to CHF exacerbation component (as noted above).
We continued his Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily, Metoprolol succinate XL 100 mg PO daily, maintained his home dose of Furosemide 40 mg PO daily and kept him on a fluid restriction of [**2183**] mL daily.
He was monitored with daily weights, monitored I/Os, and his goal for diuresis was 0.5-1L daily.
# HYPERTENSION - managed as an outpatient with ACEI, beta-blocker - requiring Nitro gtt on admission briefly.
Discharged on home regimen without changes.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued Atorvastatin 20 mg PO QHS.
Social work consultation was provided and motivational support was offered; he may benefit from outpatient addiction program assistance.
LFTs: AST 29 and ALT 13 with T-bili 0.4 this admission.
Will need follow-up as outpatient for AFP, serial ultrasounds, candidacy for possible anti-viral therapy (likely poor candidate) given his hepatitis C infection.
