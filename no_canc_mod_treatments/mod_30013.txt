She got a central line placed and started on dobutamine prior to transfer.
Of note, she was recently started on levothyroxin on [**10-29**] for TSH of 17, also reportedly was having continous congnitive decline for the past year.
She had a recent INR of 8.3, pt was taking her pills incorrectly.
She was noted to have hypothyroidism with TSH of 17, told to start levoxyl 75 and titrate.
UA was positive but she denied sxs, she was given a short course of cipro for this.
Her brother manage her medication at home.
Exam was notable for A&Ox1-2, warm extremities, b/l at bases, swelling of b/l LE 1+ with chronic skin changes.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin  Anemia  Hypothyroidism  Memory loss/Dementia  Congestive Cardiomyopathy  CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)  Pure Hypercholesterolemia  Pulmonary Embolism  Chronic Renal Failure baseline Cr.
Dedicated CT Sinus imaging can be considered after routine ENT consult.
She required vasopressors to maintain MAP >60.
She initially required norepinephrine in the range of 0.15-0.22 mcg/kg/min and dobutamine was subsequently added in the range of [**4-17**] mcg/kg/min.
A cordis was placed with the goal of performing a right heart cath to better differentiate distributive vs cardiogenic shock.
Given that worsening CHF and cardiogenic shock were though to be the cause of her hypotension, she was started on a Lasix drip which was titrated up to 30mg/hr and was also started on metolazone 5mg daily in order to achieve effective duiresis.
A right heart cath was not performed because the patient declined further invasive procedures and this was determined to not be consistent with her goals of care.
Her Cordis was discontinued prior to discharge with satisfactory hemostasis.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin/Zosyn/Azithromycin).
MS was likely worsened by her hypotension and potential infection, which were treated with pressors and antibiotics, respectively.
Diuresis was attempted in order to optimize her hemodynamics given her severe CHF.
# Afib with LBBB - Her rate remained well controlled, she was not on beta blockers at home and none were given during this admission [**1-10**] hypotension.
She is anticoagulated at home on Coumadin, INR was supratherapeutic to 4.1 at admission and Coumadin was held.
She will not be didshcaged on Coumadin given that she is going to hospice.
She received 2 units of FFP prior to central line placement.
There was concern for liver dysfunction/congestion given her severe CHF, but LFTs were normal and albumin was normal, suggesting adequate synthetic function.
Her INR may have increased because of the broad spectrum antibiotics started during this admission.
Dermatology was consulted and it was thought to be from skin tension related to her significant edema.
This was treated with topical muprocin.
She was continued on levothyroxine 75mcg daily.
#Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on simvastatin during admission, which will be stopped at the time of discharge because of her transition to hospice.
#Goals of care - Family meeting was held and it was decided that no further invasive procedures would be performed.
