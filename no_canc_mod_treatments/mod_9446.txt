Last surgery was 2 days ago.
On presentation, GI was consulted and GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] for decompression and initiation of tubefeeding.
CT scan of the abdomen showed intussusception of her duodenum into her stomach, with gastric outlet obstruction.
An NG tube was placed with 1300 cc of bilious output, and IR was notified to emergently reposition the tube.
She was taken for fluorscopy again on [**8-31**] with repositioning of the tube.
This alleviated her acute pain, and she remained on NG tube to suction for 24 more hours.
She was treated with IVF, zofran, compazine, ativan, reglan for nausea.
Her reglan was titrated down and compazine was discontinued to avoid dyskinesias.
Her protonix was increased to twice daily, and she was started on sucralfate.
Hospital course was also complicated by C difficile colitis, diagnosed on [**8-31**] and treated with Flagyl and later vancomycin.
In the ICU respiratory distress increased requiring mechanical ventilation on [**9-9**].
More likely etiology was suspected to be aspiration with resultant chemical pneumonitis given severe gastroparesis; tube feeds were stopped.
Patient was intermittently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem.
