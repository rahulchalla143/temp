He takes coumadin for carotid stenosis with prior cerebral infarct and he was given vitamin-K and FFP x 2 units upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].

Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as described in detail above.
Discharge labs:  Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with history of Afib/flutter on coumadin, HTN, stroke in [**2121**], and known carotid stenosis s/p fall on [**12-27**] where he suffered a left intraventricular hemmorhage with a hospital course c/b HCAP, atrial flutter with RVR and presumed C. diff.
Active Issues:  #Intraventricular hemorrhage: Pt's INR was corrected to 1.2 with FFP and Vitamin K for 3 days total after admission.
A Cervical MRI was obtained and ruled out ligamentous injury and his collar was removed on [**2123-12-28**].
He was continued on Aspirin 325mg daily and heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which was acceptable according to the neurosurgery service.
His warfarin was held during this admission and will be stopped at discharge.
There was concern for aspiration and speech&swallow was consulted and there was note of silent aspiration with thin liquids on subsequent video swallow.
He received an 8 day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia given that he was int he hospital over 72 hours when the pneumonia was diagnosed.
This improved on subsequent CXR with antibiotics and did not require thoracentesis or drainage.
On the afternoon of [**12-29**] he developed HTN with SBP>170 and tachycardia not responsive to metoprolol IV or fluid boluses.
After transfer to the medicine his HR remained difficult to control while on PO diltiazem and PO metoprolol, HR was consistently in the 120-130s with flutter in 2:1 block.
Electrophysiology was consulted who felt that in the setting of medical illness, his atrial flutter would be difficult to control and he was transtioned to metoprolol XL 200mg daily, diltiazem was discontinued.
He may be a candidate for an ablation procedure in the future once he is able to be anticoagulated.
This was initially managed with metoprolol/diltiazem which was later switched to metoprolol XL/lisinopril after EP consult.
He had one episode of hypertensive emergency, SBP was in the 210s with chest pain, headache and pulmonary edema.
He was trasnferred to the MICU at this time when he was placed on a diltiazem drip and subsequently transitioned to the PO metoprolol/PO diltiazem with improvement in SBP to <160 and resolution of symptoms.
He was also gently diuresed with Lasix for his pulmonary edema.
He will be discharged on metoprolol XL 200mg daily and lisinopril 10mg daily.
Vascular surgery was consulted who felt that he might benefit for an intervention once he was able to tolerate anticoagulation.
He received aspirin 325mg daily during this admission, which was acceptable to the neurosurgery service.
Given that he had recently received broad spectrum antibiotics, he was empirically started on oral vancomycin 125mg PO q6h.
He will continue a total 14 day course of PO vancomycin after discharge.
#Dysphagia: Patient was evaluated by speech and swallow who noted silent aspiration on two video swallow evaluations.
He was maintained on a puree solid diet with thickeed liquids.
Given increased stooling he was started on treatment for clostridium difficile.
#Code status this admission: DNR, OK to intubate (confirmed with patient and daughter/HCP)  #Transitional Issues: -Goal systolic BP is 90-160, if SBP consistently >160, he will need uptitration of lisinopril or an additional antihypertensive -Pt will follow up with neurosurgery in one month, at which time CT scan of the head should be done and he should be considered for re-initiation of anti-coagulation therapy -Pt will follow up with vascular surgery regarding his carotid stenosis -Will need repeat CTA of neck in 1 month from discharge to reassess carotid stenosis -Control of his heart rate and atrial flutter should be re-evaluated as an outpatient, he may benefit from a A.flutter ablation once he is able to be anticoagulated -At discharge, he will remain on ASA 325mg daily but his warfarin has been stopped until he is seen by neurosurgery in follow-up -Lisinopril was changed to 10mg PO daily at discharge, this will need further titration at rehab according to his BP -Patient had urinary retention on day of discharge.
Insertion of foley catheter and urology follow-up may be necessary.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],       It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 69**].
We therefore stopped your Coumadin and monitored you closely in the neurosurgery intensive care unit.
We controlled your heart rate with medications and treated you for pneumonia with IV antibiotics.
They recommended that you follow up with vascular surgery in four weeks to discuss the possibility of a surgery to open up this vessel.
There was also concern for a GI tract infection called C. diff, which can occur after treatment with powerful antibiotics.
At discharge, you will continue to take this oral antibiotic for a total of 14 days.
You should not take any coumadin until you are evaluated in one month by neurosurgery.
PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES: -STOP Coumadin -STOP Atenolol -START metoprolol XL 200mg daily -START lisinopril 10mg by mouth daily -START vancomycin 125mg by mough every 6 hours for 10 more days  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 674**] Specialty: INTERNAL MEDICINE Location: [**Location (un) 2274**] [**Location (un) **] Address: 2 [**Location (un) **] CENTER DR, [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 29936**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79695**] **Please discuss with the staff at the facility the need for a follow up appointment with your PCP when you are ready for discharge.
