SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2119-8-1**] and was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Postoperatively, he was transported from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition on nitroglycerin and propofol drips.
On the night of surgery, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and successfully extubated.
He was begun on diuresis and beta blockade.
His chest tubes and epicardial wires were discontinued on postoperative day two.
He had begun ambulation and cardiac rehabilitation at that time.
Over the next few days, his oxygen was weaned off and on room air had an adequate saturation of above 94 percent consistently.
Ultimately, his Lasix was discontinued and he was placed on intravenous nesiritide for approximately 48 hours.
The lower extremity noninvasive study was read as partially occlusive thrombus in the right greater saphenous vein; however, his right greater saphenous vein has been entirely harvested as conduit for his coronary artery bypass procedure up to the femoral region.
Initially with the [**Location (un) 1131**], the patient was placed on heparin but this was discontinued the following morning when it was determined that this vein had been removed.
