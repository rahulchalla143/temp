She was given vancomycin while in the hospital and cephalexin on d/c for a total of one week of antibiotics due to the pacemaker placement.
Her pacemaker was interrogated and felt to be working well.
Her bp was initially supported with dopamine, and she was given lasix as tolerated to a wedge of 20-22.
She was begun on a heparin gtt, placed on ASA and statin.
She was weaned off the dopamine by HD3.
Once she was off dopamine, she was placed on an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker as her bp/pulse tolerated.
She was diuresed with lasix prn, and sent home on Lasix 20 mg po qd with potassium supplementation.
She could be a candidate for coumadin given her low EF and WMA, but given her guaiac pos stool and hx of falls, it was felt to be too risky.
ARF:  Felt to be due to hypoperfusion of kidneys while she was hypotensive.
Also, there was a report from the OSH that she had possibly aspirated and so was covered with levaquin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pna.

Her heparin gtt was discontinued.
