EMS gave Valium 10 mg intravenously x 1, and Haldol 10 mg intravenously x 1.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital6 4299**], where he was noted to be agitated, hypotensive, received librium 100 mg x 4 over eight hours, and a CIWA scale during the day of [**2-24**].
The patient got a total of 50 mg of intravenous Valium over the course of eight hours, and 5 mg of Haldol intravenously x 1.
Ethanol abuse, multiple prior hospitalizations for withdrawal and detoxification; no known history of delirium tremens in the past 2.
Ethanol gastritis 3.
Obesity  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1.
Zestril 3.
Recent stressors in the patient's life include granddaughter's surgery and financial difficulties.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   For five to six days prior to admission to [**Hospital6 8283**], the patient reportedly drank five to six gallons of hard alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 101.4, pulse 113, blood pressure 171/70, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
Skin:  Positive ecchymosis over left shoulder.
Neurology:  The patient's ethanol withdrawal and delirium tremens were treated with increasing doses of Ativan and Haldol.
Eventually the patient was put on Ativan drip.
Additionally, the patient was put on a propofol drip briefly for help with his withdrawal.
However, due to hypotension, propofol was discontinued.
His agitation decreased over the course of his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was given thiamine, folate, and multivitamins with his intravenous fluids.
Pulmonary:  The patient was briefly intubated secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure from narcotics.
The patient was subsequently successfully extubated and his respiratory status remained stable with supplemental oxygen via face mask.
Post-extubation and post-weaning of the Ativan drip, the patient became hypertensive and his Zestril and Lopressor were slowly added to his medical regimen, with adequate control of his blood pressure.
Initially his fevers were thought to be secondary to alcohol withdrawal, however, in light of increased white blood cell count and questionable left lower lobe opacity, the patient was briefly treated with a course of vancomycin.
However, in light of resolution of left lower lobe opacity and decrease in his white blood cell count, the patient's antibiotics were subsequently discontinued.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was continued on intravenous Protonix given his history of alcohol-induced gastritis.
