DOXYCYCLINE AND MINOCYCLINE sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]          [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are again demonstrated, and a central venous catheter entering via an inferior approach and terminating in the right atrium is again unchanged.
Note was made of intermittent cardiac arrhythmia around 18:01 alternating between one sinus beat and one wide-complex ectopic beat lasting several seconds.
The femoral line and brachiocephalic stent are unchanged in position.
Uncomplicated and successful replacement of a tunneled left femoral hemodialysis line.
ABDOMINAL PLAIN FILM KUB [**2117-5-20**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: Single supine abdominal radiograph demonstrates G-tube balloon in the region of the gastric antrum.
The femoral line and brachiocephalic stent are unchanged in position.
G-TUBE REPLACEMENT BY IR [**2117-5-22**] IMPRESSION 1.
Successful placement of a 14 French post-pyloric [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] GJ tube by conversion of existing 14 French MIC G-tube access.
The tube is ready for immediate use for tube feedings and medications.
Hypodense areas as described above in the left occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, partly seen on the prior study.
[**5-24**] EEG: PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: 83F with complicated medical history of subdural hematoma and intracranial hemorrhage in [**2114**] now bedbound, ESRD, multiple serious infections including endocarditis and osteomyeltis, now admitted with fever, found to have LLL infiltrate and to be in status epilepticus.
She was given atropine (for bradycardic arrest), followed by epi x 2, amp of calcium, and defibrillated twice (for V fib and then VT), with ROSC after ~40 minutes of CPR.
In conjunction with the family's wishes (specifically, the patient's sister and HCP [**Doctor First Name 5464**], was decided that CPR would not be indicated in this patient given her steady drop in BP while on max dose pressors.
Neurology consulted and she was loaded w/fosphenytoin and ativan and transferred to the MICU for airway monitoring in the setting of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
AED med management was especially difficult on/after [**Year (4 digits) 2286**].
By the morning of HD 6, EEG no longer showed status or seizures but continued to demonstrate epileptiform spikes.
Extensive discussions were had w/HCP re: pt's goals of care, given need for multiple AEDs at high, sedating doses, making the necessity of intubation a real possibility.
After intubation, her EEG improved, no longer showing epileptiform activity and her AEDs were able to be weaned with discontinuation of fosphenytoin and benzodiazepines and then valproic acid.
The morning of [**5-25**] she did have a seizure, however this was 30 minutes before her arrest and no further med changes were done.
Found to have LLL infiltrate vs atelectasis on chest xray, also seen on lung cuts of CT A/P.
Received levofloxacin/vancomycin in the ED.
Levo changed for cefepime on admission, then transitioned to ceftazidime on HD3 for ease of dosing with HD.
Thus cefepime was stopped and tobramycin was started (chosen based upon past micro data showing multiple MDR bacteria).
Intubation was uncomplicated.
ID was consulted who felt monotherapy with gentamicin QHD would be appropriate - she should complete a 10 day course - last day on [**5-28**].
Given the patient's mental status, it was felt she would not be extubated readily so a trachestomy was peformed by Interventional Pulmonology.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis on [**5-23**] in setting of worsening leukocytosis despite therapeutic-dosing gentamycin showed stable (not improved) L lung base consolidation).
# TUBEFEEDS - HIGH RESIDUALS The patient was noted to have high residuals from her tube feeds as well as occasional vomiting.
In addition, Gentamycin peaks/troughs rechecked and found to be in-range.
WBC was down-trending on discharge and she was continued on vancomycin PO.
Continued sevelemer and renagel.
Antiepileptic dosing was particularly challenging around HD sessions, as pt's levels fell more than expected prior to HD and seizure activity spiked in that setting.
The patient's line stopped working so on [**5-20**] she underwent replacement over a wire with IR.
Home amlodipine was increased from 5 to 10 mg QD.
She also required intermittent 1x doses nifedipine to keep SBP <150.
# Hyperthyroid TSH checked, as there was concern that hyperthroidism might contribute to AMS.
