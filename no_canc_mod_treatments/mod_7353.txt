He was initially stabilized with 4L of NS boluses, but hypotension persisted to 70's systolic.
A respiratory code was called, and he was intubated by Anesthesia.
His culture data only revealed gram negative rods in his urine, and Vanc, Levo and Flagyl were continued.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
His hypoxemia may have been due to acidosis and v/q mismatching.
He had moderate secretions and received aggressive chest PT, but maintained adequate O2 sats on shovel mask.
Additionally, he was started on low dose beta-blocker for hypertension and treated with free water boluses for hypernatremia.
had not been receiving SC Heparin because of his known subdural hematoma and risk for increased bleeding and mass effect, and a decision was made not to anti-coagulate him, even given the doppler results.
was pulsed with 7 days of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone.
During his CCU stay, he was started on tube feeds.
He was about 8 L positive on day of transfer, and had been receiving Lasix QD.
Pt was started on Morphine drip titrated to comfort.
Repeat CT last: unchanged subdural hematoma/hypodense collection, unchanged/persistent mass effect on right cerebelar cortex, minimal right to left midline shift.
Neurosurg was re- consulted but unable to say whether burr hole procedure will reverse mental status changes, drainage in ~ 4 weeks is still recommended, once acute events stabilized.
# UE DVT - hold off on anticoagulation for now given SDH .
# FEN: NGT, tube feeds were continued until pt was made CMO; supplemented with IVFs D5 1/2NS with 20 K.  # Full Code: Family met with the providers and decided to make CMO.
