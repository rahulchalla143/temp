Her neurosurgical issues were nonoperative; she was loaded with Dilantin and continued on a scheduled dose for 10 days; serial head CT scans were followed and were stable.
She was taken to the operating room for repair of her extensor tendon and STSG.
During her ICU stay she was receiving Haldol and Ativan and required 1:1 sitters.
It was recommended that these agents be placed on hold as could have been contributing to her delirium.
Speech and Swallow were evaluated early on during her hospital stay; initially she did not pass her bedside swallow; a Dobhoff tube was placed and tube feedings were initiated.
She was re-evaluated by Speech several days later once her mental status improved; her diet was upgraded to nectar thick liquids and soft solids.
Her tube feedings were cycled; she was also placed on calorie counts.
Because of the dramatic improvement in her mental status it is expected that the Dobhoff will be very short term and she will eventually have her diet upgraded with continued evaluation by SLP once at rehab.
Case management initiated this process and she was accepted by [**Hospital1 **].
