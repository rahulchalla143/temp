His PNA was treated and oxygen was weaned down and he tolerated walking around floor with nasal cannula, though he wore face tent at baseline for comfort.
He was initially treated for CAP but because he works in a health-care setting and considering the extent of PNA with hypoxia he was treated for HCAP coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
He was discharged on a 10-day course of levofloxacin & linezolid, to cover ensure coverage of both MSRA and other usual CAP organisms.
He was treated with a 10mg/hr Dilt drip and spontaneously converted to sinus and he remained in sinus rhythm throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
The aspirin was held due to intermittent hemoptysis/blood streaked sputum, but Dr. [**Known lastname 23**] was advised to discuss reinitiation of aspirin as an outpatient.
He was told to discuss reinitation of aspirin with his PCP when his hemoptysis ceases.
