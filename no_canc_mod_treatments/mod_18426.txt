On [**11-20**] the patient was noted to have 3 seizures consisting of an uncontrolled movement around her mouth, "tic-like" fast muscle movements.
Her dilantin level was increased to a goal of 15-20 and she was started on Keppra.
On [**11-30**], Ms. [**Known lastname 57098**] family decided to make her comfort measures only.
On the evening of [**12-1**] the patient's family notified the primary team that they were not aware that comfort measures only meant no nutrition and a morphine drip to keep the patient comfortable.
At that point, the family decided that they were amenable to insertion of a feeding tube if necessary and that they no longer wanted to make the patient comfort measures only.
However, the respiratory therapist was not comfortable putting the patient on Bipap on the floor.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 75987**] family decided that it would be okay to consent to a temporary intubation at this point and a Code Blue was initiated for respiratory distress.
After having a long discussion with the family, they decided that she would remain intubated for a temporary amount of time with the intention of extubation in the near future.
The were adamant about not having heroic measures including using a defibrillator or performing chest compressions, however they were amenable to using vasoactive agents to get her cardiac function back to normal.
On [**12-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] spoke to Mrs.[**Known lastname 75987**] family, in addition to palliative care and representatives from the ICU team, regarding her prognosis after she had been off of the ventilator for 24 hours from [**11-30**] - [**12-1**].
The family was made aware that the patient had little chance of survival and the premise of comfort measures only was thoroughly explained.
The family made the decision at that time to extubate the patient and make her comfort measures only which was explained to them as putting the patient on a morphine drip, with IV boluses of morphine as necessary for incidental pain, dyspnea or agitation; ativan as necessary for agitation and a scopolamine patch for increased respiratory secretions.
