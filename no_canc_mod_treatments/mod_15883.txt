He presents as a transfer from the [**Hospital6 18075**] for a semi-urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9995**] was started on Levaquin and Flagyl at [**Hospital6 18075**] and watched clinically.
The patient was watched clinically over the weekend but then was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for semi-urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography when he began to have symptoms of fever and respiratory distress.
Conscious sedation was attempted but the patient was uncooperative with the examination and was subsequently intubated for general anesthesia.
The patient had recently bee4n admitted and treated at the [**Hospital6 2561**] for pneumonia with Levaquin in early [**Month (only) 956**].
History of a colectomy secondary to a severe gastrointestinal bleed.
MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT: Aspirin 181 mg p.o.
Propanolol 10 mg p.o.
Nifedipine XL 30 mg p.o.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: In addition to the above, he was on Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
q. day and Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
On neurologic examination, the patient was sedated, responsive to noxious stimuli and moving all extremities.
The patient was immediately evaluated by the interventional radiology service for a percutaneous biliary drain.
He immediately went for this procedure shortly after arrival to the Intensive Care Unit.
At that time, he successfully underwent placement of a percutaneous drain into the hepatic duct as well as a drain placed from the common bile duct into the duodenum so that he could drain dually.
Over the next three hours, the patient's sedatives and pressors were weaned and he was successfully extubated shortly afterwards.
He was started immediately upon arrival on Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin for empiric coverage of possible cholangitis.
Hematocrit did subsequently remain stable and did not require any transfusions.
He was continued on Proton pump inhibitor for prophylaxis throughout his hospitalization.
However, the severity of the thrombocytopenia raised the possibility of a second process, such as medication.
To that extent, a heparin induced antibody was sent and the patient was not started on any heparin or H2 blockers.
His initial blood cultures which were drawn on admission subsequently grew Enterococcus which was then revealed as Vancomycin resistant.
He was additionally felt to possibly benefit from an ace inhibitor in a low dose.
Captopril was started on hospital day number three as well.
Aspirin was held throughout the hospitalization given his thrombocytopenia.
IN approximately three to four weeks, the patient is tentatively planned to return back to [**Hospital1 1444**] to have a second endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography attempted with the presence of IR for possible stone extraction as well as a sphincterotomy.
It is felt that the patient will most likely need a cholecystectomy in the future; however, given his obvious bacteremia and cholangitis, it is felt that he should most likely wait until these issues become more stabilized.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Nasalilid 600 mg intravenous q.
Captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Protonic 40 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to have the percutaneous drain remain in place with cap, to allow internal drainage.
He will return to [**Hospital1 69**] in three to four weeks for an attempt at a repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
He will also be evaluated by the surgery team at [**Hospital6 2561**] for potential cholecystectomy in the future.
He additionally will be evaluated by the cardiology service at the [**Hospital6 18075**] for maximization of his cardiac regimen prior to a potential open operative procedure.
