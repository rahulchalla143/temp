However, the mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins are not compressible with absent color flow, consistent with thrombus extending from the calf veins to the mid superficial femoral veins.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: There is normal compression and augmentation of the common femoral, proximal superficial femoral, mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins.
A circum-aortic left renal vein was better demonstrated on prior contrast CT.
Brief Hospital Course: 53yoM w/ h/o SMA thrombosis s/p partial small bowel resection, possible protein C deficiency, asthma and hemochromatosis who presents with a 2 day history of persistent left leg pain and swelling, now found to have DVT of his left leg and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Given his h/o SMA thrombosis, clots in both arterial and venous systems suggest considering Protein C def/ antiphospholipid antibody syndrome as a unify etiology of his emboli.
Patient was started on a heparin drip and transitioned to Lovenox.
-Bridging to Coumadin 5 mg daily (discuss dosing with pharmacy)  -Consider IgG and IgM anti-?????
