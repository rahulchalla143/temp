Bystanders commenced cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency medical technicians placed an AAD and shocked her at 200 joules, which converted her to a normal rhythm.
The patient was stabilized at the outside hospital and transferred on Lopressor, Lidocaine drip, nitroglycerin paste, morphine, Ativan and levofloxacin.
The left main coronary artery was diffusely diseased with 80% ostial stenosis, left anterior descending artery 70% origin, and the mid and distal left anterior descending artery were small and diffusely diseased.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was correctly placed.
Borderline diabetes mellitus, recently discovered.
She was ventilated with SIMV 600-17-0.7 with a PEEP/pressure support [**5-20**].
General:  Intubated and sedated but responded to voice.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2125-7-17**] for coronary artery bypass grafting times three.
Grafts included left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
The procedure was performed without complication and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on postoperative day number one and the patient was successfully weaned from drips and extubated.
She was converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous Lopressor.
Oral doses of Lopressor and amiodarone were progressively increased.
Clindamycin was started for a two week course for treatment of this possible infection.
She was tolerating an oral diet and her pain was under good control.
