Was intubated for airway protection and started on vancomycin/zosyn.
Required increasing pressor support with dopamine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.
She also had been taking ciprofloxacin prior to her arrival to [**Hospital1 **] for a UTI.
She has completed a 7 day course of vancomycin and 8 day course of zosyn.
Pressor support was gradually weaned and patient was extubated on [**2196-1-15**].
Her MICU course has been complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR, for which she was initially given dilt IV and dilt PO without improvement in her rate (100s-110s).
She was started on an amiodarone load approx 36 hours after atrial fib onset and converted to sinus rhythm 6 hours later.
Transition off of pressors was performed with albumin volume resuscitation.
Due to development of pedal edema and findings of mild interstitial edema on chest xray, patient was started on lasix gtt for volume removal which was transitioned to lasix IV boluses with goal removal of negative 1L daily.
Started on IV metronidazole on [**2196-1-17**].
1+ pedal pulses.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
Endotracheal tube tip 2.5 cm from carina.
Left PICC line can be traced as far as the mid SVC.
Discharge labs: 2.9>32.2<244 PT 40.6, PTT 37.8, INR 4.3 147/3.6/107/32/24/1.6<94 Ca 8.8, Mg 2.4, Phos 3.3   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old Caucasian female with history of hypertension and urosepsis, admitted to the MICU with sepsis secondary to URI, with hospital course complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR in setting of pressors, ARF, pulmonary edema attributed to volume resuscitation, and c. diff colitis.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with altered mental status, found to have a positive UA, hypotension, bradycardia, and was started on vanco/zosyn as well as dopamine for BP support.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-1-10**] due to persistent hypotension and bradycardia, and she was intubated for airway protection.
It was felt that her bradycardia was likely due to rention of atenolol in setting of acute kidney injury as well as hyperkalemia.
Initially in the MICU, she was on dopamine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin for BP support.
Of note, she had been taking ciprofloxacin prior to her arrival to [**Hospital1 **] for a UTI.
During her MICU course, she was weaned off pressors, and eventually was extubated on [**2196-1-15**] though was still kept on norepinephrine for BP support.
Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of pressors, ARF, pulmonary edema secondary to aggressive volume resuscitation, and C. difficile colitis following a 7 day course of vancomycin and 8 day course of zosyn.
Initially she was given diltiazem IV and PO without much improvement in her rate, which remained in the 110s.
She was started on an amiodarone load approx 36 hours after the initiation of her afib, and converted to normal sinus rhythm 6 hours later.
IV diltiazem was given without significant effect and patient was started on diltiazem gtt.
Digoxin 0.125mg PO daily was initiated and diltiazem gtt was stopped.
Warfarin 2mg PO daily and heparin gtt were started.
Patient started on amiodarone with load however remained in afib.
She had successful cardioversion to NSR on [**1-29**].
She was anticoagulated with and INR >4 at discharge with coumadin being held X1 dose on [**1-28**].
A lower dose should be started such as 1.5 or 1.0 with frequent monitoring.
Her amiodarone will be continued as an outpatient with plans for pulmonary funciton testing.
Patient was transitioned off pressors, with albumin volume resuscitation but found to develop mild pulmonary edema on chest radiograph.
She was started initially on lasix gtt for volume removal, and then transitioned to lasix IV bolus with net removal of approximately 1L per day.
Due to elevated sodium and creatinine and suspicion that patient was euvolemic upon reaching the floor, further diuresis was discontinued upon reaching the general medicine floor.
Lisinopril and atenolol were held.
Following aggressive diuresis in the MICU, creatinine remained at 2.0.
Upon reaching the floor, diuresis was discontinued and creatinine improved.
Likely in the setting of lasix diuresis.
Will need daily sodium checks and should encourage PO free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
Following completion of vancomycin and zosyn, patient developed diarrhea and found to have positive stool studies.
Started with IV flagyl on [**2196-1-17**] (but first day off of antibiotics is [**2196-1-19**]) and will complete 14 day course (last day on [**2196-2-2**]).
Foley was placed in the MICU to aid with strict I's and O's.
After failing second voiding trial, foley was replaced.
Noted to have hematuria, possible secondary to traumatic foley placement in the setting of heparin prophylaxis.
Foley was continued and urology was consulted, who recommended keeping foley in place for 2-3 days to allow detrusor muscle to regain form.
Will need to follow up with primary care physician as an outpatient to begin hematuria workup should symptoms persist.
Originally presented to the hospital with hyperkalemia which was reversed with calcium, resin binding.
Potassium was repleted PRN.
Given home prescription for daily potassium, hypokalemia may be chronic in nature.
She was placed on aspiration precautions with observed feeding.

You have completed a course of IV antibiotics.
You needed medications to sustain your blood pressure and needed to be placed on a breathing machine when you first arrived.
You also developed diarrhea due to an infectious cause and were given medication to help you clear this infection.
You also developed some fluid in your lungs that improved with diuretic medication.
Finally, you have developed some difficulty urinating, and will need a foley in place for several more days (until you see the urologist) to allow your bladder to regain its former shape.
You had a cardioversion on [**1-28**] which made your heart beat regularly again.
You had to start on a medication called Coumadin to keep your blood thin.
- STOPPED atenolol - STOPPED potassium chloride - STARTED flagyl three times a day.
Please continue this medication with last dose on [**2196-2-2**].
You were taking 2mg daily and your INR was high, so you will have to have this closely monitored and you will likely need a lower dose when you restart it when your INR is less than 3.0 - START Amiodarone 400mg twice a day through [**2-2**].
- START Metoprolol XL 25mg daily .
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62230**] should refer you to a cardiologist within 1-2 months after your discharge.
You will need to have your INR checked daily until your INR is less than 3.0, then restart coumadin and continue to have your INR checked regularly.
You will need daily sodium checks and should drink free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
