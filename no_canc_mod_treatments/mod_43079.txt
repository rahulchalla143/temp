She weaned from inotropic support without difficulty and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one.
On postoperative day two, she developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade.
She emergently returned to the CSRU where she underwent intubation and resuscitation.
Amiodarone was discontinued.
She required pressors and was profoundly acidotic with an elevated lactate, low bicarbonate and high white count.
On [**2120-12-5**], an exploratory laparotomy, liver biopsy and cholecystectomy was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
She returned to the CSRU for further invasive monitoring and medical management.
She was kept intubated and sedated while broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.
Her urine output and hyperkalemia gradually improved with intravenous Lasix and Diurel.
Pronestyl and Procainamide therapies were eventually started in attempts to maintain a normal sinus rhythm.
She was eventually started on tube feedings for nutritional support.
By postoperative day 10, she weaned from sedation and was re-extubated without incident.
She remained neurologically intact and weaned from pressor support without difficulty.
Warfarin was eventually initiated.
Tube feedings were eventually discontinued and her diet was slowly advanced as tolerated.
Medical therapy was optimized and Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR around 1.5 - 2.0.
She continued to work with physical therapy and make clinical improvements.
Due to poor IV access, a double lumen PICC line was temporarily placed in her right upper arm.
Her sternotomy and laparotomy incisions appeared clean and dry while her bilateral lower extremity incisions appeared moderately erythematous and slightly warm to touch.
Given concern for wound infection/cellulitis, the lower leg staples were removed just prior to discharge and she will need to continue on antibiotic therapy.
In addition, Warfarin at discharge will continue to be on hold for a supratherapeutic INR.
