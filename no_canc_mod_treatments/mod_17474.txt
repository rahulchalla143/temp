MATERNAL HISTORY:   The baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] to a 37 year old Gravida 1, Para 0-2-0-1, with unremarkable prenatal screens, with maternal blood type O negative, received RhoGAM, DAT negative, Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown.
Pregnancy history:  Estimated due date was [**2136-12-31**], for an estimated gestational age of 36-1/7 weeks on the day of delivery [**2136-12-4**].
Rupture of membranes three hours prior to delivery with clear amniotic fluid, intra-partum antibiotics given for 7.5 hours.
HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA:  The peak bilirubin was 11.1 treated with phototherapy with discharge (rebound) bilirubin of 9.2.
Bilirubin:  Phototherapy was deferred given the baby's age and negative Coombs antibody status.
We continued to hold off on phototherapy as the child has probably peaked.
Continue to monitor temperature.
Monitor jaundice clinically; no additional bilirubin levels should be needed unless increase in jaundice is noted.
