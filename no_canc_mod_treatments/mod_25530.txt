She was complaining of SOB, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, and fatigue.
In the ED, she was bolused and started on diltiazem gtt for MAT and diuresed with IV Lasix for her CHF.
She was started on levaquin for +U/A.
She was on neo and vasopressin gtts until [**2189-1-25**] AM.
Her abx were expanded to Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin and hydrocortisone, currently weaned to 50 q8 (despite [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim of 50.7->73->67.3).
INR went from 2.1 to 6.5 on [**1-25**], which is now down to 1.35 after vitamin K. She had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallbladder and CBD sludge v. stone v. mass and associated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.

NECK: Rt IJ dialysis catheter in place without erythema.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with common duct measuring up to 2.8 cm.
Right inferior and superior minimally-displaced rami fractures of unknown chronicity, with evidence of healing.
If clinically indicated, ultrasound could be considered since these could represent small fluid collections in the left lobe.
Gallbladder stones and sludge with CBD stent and mild extrahepatic biliary dilatation; no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: *** see attending d/c letter for attending note:  following is by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18582**]  A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2, schizophrenia who presented with E. coli sepsis, requiring vasopressors initially, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP given increasing total bilirubin.
A 7cm by 7FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully to establish effective biliary drainage, which later become dislodaged and was removed.
She went to IR for PTC drain on [**2189-1-29**], which was later switched for a larger drain, 10 french, given her thick bile.
The drain needed to be revised multiple times for biliary sludging.
Since the biliary drain was not a longterm option, she underwent ERCP on [**2-19**] for stone extraction, sphincteroplasty, and sphincteromy.
She tolerated the procedure well and her biliary drain was removed.
She will be continued on Cipro/Flagy post-procedure for 1 day after discharge.
The patient was started on CVVH in the intensive care unit and then switched to ultrafiltration on the medicine floor to remove volume.
Furosemide 160 mg [**Hospital1 **] was tried to remove fluid on non-dialysis days, however, it was unsuccessful.
She was continued on dialysis on a schedule of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
She underwent dialysis for fluid removal.
She underwent an ultrasound of her right arm which was negative for DVT (she remained anticoagulated on heparin SC during her hospitalization) .
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II:  Pt was moderately controlled on insulin SS.
As she increases her PO intake, she might need Lantus at night.
In addition, can also consider starting on oral medications.
She was later switched to linezolid and meropenem and cleared her blood cultures.
If she continues to have massive amounts of diarrhea, requiring a rectal tube, she should be further evaluated.
She was started on Loperamide on [**2-20**] to slow its progression.
The patient had a flexiseal placed on [**2189-2-2**].
She remained hemodynamically stable during these tachycardic events.
She received dilt x 2 without change and was thus started on amoidarone.
She was loaded with amiodarone and continued on a maintainence dose of 200 mg daily.
She remains on aspirin for anticoagulation.
Aspirin was stopped after her ERCP procedure and should be started on [**2189-2-26**].
The initial etiologies were due to toxic/metabolic effects, use of sedatives during intubation and renal/hepatic failure.
She was started on CVVH in the ICU.
She was initially on rifaxamin and lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopaty (had elevated ammonia), but it was stopped.
Her home Celexa, Trazodone and trifluphenazine were held since they can alter mental status.
She completed a ten day course of vancomycin and zosyn.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient was on high dose steroids during her stay in the ICU.
She was transferred to the ICU and started on high dose steroids and nebulizers for treatment of COPD exacerbation.
She was quickly tapered off of her steroids and her last day was [**2-15**].
She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and had no signs of respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Pt was electively intubated for ERCP and remained intubated afterwards for somnolence.
She was transferred to the ICU where she was diuresed, started on treatment for COPD, and started on antibiotics for hospital acquired pneumonia.
The pancytopenia was likely multifactorial and related to linezolid, other medications and infection.
Her home trifluphenazine and celexa were held on discharge.
If warranted, she can start these medications as an outpatient.
She received one dose of fluconazole on [**2-10**] and it improved.
She was continued on topical antifungals .
As an outpatient, might need anticoagulation with Coumadin for atrial fibrillation 2.
Diabetes: Will likely need lantus based on insulin needs 3.
Aspirin: 81 mg daily should be started on [**2189-2-26**] 5.
Antibiotics: the patient will need IV antibiotics for one day after discharge  Medications on Admission: Home Medications: Captopril 50 mg q8 glyburide 10 mg daily Neurontin 300 mg q8 Trifluoperazine 5 mg daily Abilify 20 mg daily Celexa 30 mg daily Trazodone 100 mg qhs omeprazole 20 mg daily Zantac 300 mg daily Beclomethasone diproprionate HFA 40 mcg inh daily Zyrtec 10 mg daily Spiriva 18 mcg inh daily Advair 100/50 mcg [**Hospital1 **] ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily vitamin D 50,000 units q Friday .
