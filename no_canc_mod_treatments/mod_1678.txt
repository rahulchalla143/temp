Admission Date:  [**2144-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2082-1-26**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old female with a complicated medical history including sarcoidosis, hepatic cirrhosis, Grade II esophageal varices, hypertension, multiple orthopaedic procedures to her left hip, right hip and right knee, who presented with left thigh recently admitted to Surgery for ventral hernia repair, which had caused an ileus and ascites, which required two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.
These drains were recently removed.
Per the Emergency Department record, the patient appeared to have received 1 gram of vancomycin, 100 mg of hydrocortisone, 10 units of regular insulin, 1 amp of dextrose, and 2 mg of intravenous dilaudid.
Sarcoidosis diagnosed in [**2137**], with pulmonary and hepatic involvement, on chronic steroids 2.
Status post ventral hernia repair on [**2144-2-29**] 3.
Status post right total hip replacement and right total knee replacement 5.
Status post open reduction and internal fixation of her left hip 6.
Choledocholithiasis 9.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily, Aldactone 15 mg twice a day, Actigall 300 mg three times a day, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, prednisone 10 mg by mouth twice a day, Aleve 220 mg by mouth twice a day.
General examination revealed a lethargic patient, who became alert and oriented x 3 after Narcan administration.
Pupils went from 1 mm to 3 mm after Narcan administration.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   After being found hypotensive with hyperkalemia, the patient was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin and D-50, as well as hydrocortisone for stress dose steroids.
The patient received a total of 12 liters of normal saline within 24 hours' time prior to producing any urine output.
The patient was also started empirically on clindamycin for antibiotic coverage.
The patient's hypotension resolved with aggressive intravenous fluid hydration and a brief course of pressors.
Her hyperkalemia began to resolved after insulin and D-50 treatments.
The patient's initial tachycardia on admission resolved after intravenous fluid hydration.
At this time, the patient was on clindamycin and vancomycin as her antibiotic coverage.
The patient also received a right internal jugular centrally-placed catheter on [**2144-4-20**], for access.
On this date, the patient had continual hypotension requiring aggressive fluid hydration, and also low-dose dopamine to be added via her central catheter.
The patient's hypotension was improved and was able to be weaned off dopamine on [**2144-4-21**].
On this date, she was also started on Fluconazole for yeast in her urine.
On [**2144-4-22**], the patient was no longer requiring pressor support, and her creatinine had decreased to 2.0.
She was started on levofloxacin by mouth for this infection.
Her Foley catheter was removed on this date.
She was also started on prednisone for her sarcoidosis.
As the patient has had stable blood pressure up until now, and has had peripheral edema due to saline resuscitation, the patient received a low-dose diuretic, and her urine output increased.
Her left thigh pain was much improved at this time, with no requirement of narcotics for pain control.
After arrival to the floor, the patient received a PICC line placement in the morning of [**2144-4-24**].
Her right internal jugular vein central catheter was therefore removed.
The patient was continued on her levofloxacin and vancomycin.
After much discussion with the Infectious Disease team and the patient's primary doctor, Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], it was determined that the patient should be treated for a total course of eight weeks with vancomycin.
She was diuresed with initially 20 mg of lasix by mouth, with minimal effects.
She received intravenous lasix after that, with better responses.
The patient received a trial of 250 cc of saline bolus, and her heart rate decreased from 120 to 108.
Her lasix was therefore discontinued.
After discussion with Surgery and Orthopaedics, it was determined that this fluid collection needed to be drained, with the placement of a pigtail catheter.
The patient had purulent fluids drained from her left thigh fluid collection.
The patient was thought to have low-grade atelectasis, and was encouraged to take deeper breaths in.
The patient has been using an incentive spirometer ever since admission to the Intensive Care Unit.
On the morning of [**2144-4-28**], the patient experienced an episode of spontaneous drainage of most likely the subcutaneous fluid collection seen on MRI in her abdomen.
The scab was later on covered with dry dressing.
The patient did require frequent dressing change, and had persistent leakage of clear-looking fluid from this site.
They recommended dry dressings frequently.
Due to the physical characteristics of the fluid drained from the patient's left thigh fluid collection, she was started on levofloxacin by mouth for broadening antibiotic coverage until this fluid culture returns.
