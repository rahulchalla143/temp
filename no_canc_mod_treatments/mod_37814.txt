SHOULDER MRSA PT WAS ON VANCO,MEREPENIM,& KEFZOL.
Admitted from [**Hospital1 756**] after found to have UTI and altered MS and transferred here at request of daughter and found to have L shoulder dislocation, reduced 1 at [**Hospital1 112**] and 2 at [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Patient's mental status improved significantly with IV antibiotics with some baseline waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Would recommend appetitite stimulants, possible anti-depressants at discretion of physicians at [**Hospital1 **] to help with mentation.
**Most importantly, patient will need continued vanco for MRSA until [**2123-7-29**] and meropenem Enterobacter Cloace until [**2123-8-24**].
Shoulder dislocation: s/p debridement, open anterior reconstruction, and aspiration of her left shoulder joint now in sling.
Patient's course has been very complicated, with multiple dislocations, now a chronic dislocation and severe pain.
Ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] feels that continued surgical options are limited and recommend sling, with good pain control.
Gentle diuresis of Lasix 20 mg PO every other day has kept her in good fluid balance.
Not on coumadin secondary to Gi bleed.
Had intermittent Chest pain on [**7-12**] with ECG demonstrating t-wave inversions in anterior leads.
Per cards fellow, patient was not ruled out, ASA held due to bleed.
She will likely need further eval by orthopoedics, possibly at [**Hospital6 **] for further care of shoulder dislocation.
