He was started broad spectrum coverage with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for multifocal pneumonia and diuresed with significant improvement in his respiratory symptoms.
In total he received 6 days of vancomycin and flagyl and 8 days of cefepime.
Effusion reaccumulated on HD10, drained (2L) with pigtail catheter placed.
Once patient was made comfort measures only, dyspnea was managed with oral morphine as needed.
#Critical Aortic stenosis- EF 20%, maintaining BP.
The patient was started on milrinone in the setting of decling renal function which resulted in an EF increase to 25%.
CT surgery was consulted and felt that the patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention.
His milrinone was discontinued as was CVVHD, and patient was symptomatically managed for volume overload with lasix and morphine.
Per renal recommendations patient was started on CVVHD via a R IJ dialysis line with marked improvement in his mental status and uremia.
His IJ line was removed as there was no further plan for dialysis.
# AMS/Agitation: Patient's initial agitation was controlled with standing haldol 1mg PO TID.
Patient was started on CVVHD and mental status markedly improved.
He was continued on PRN haloperidol 0.5 mg PO, with increasing frequency.
Dialysis was discontinued to respect his wishes and his HD catheter line was removed.
It was agreed that since patient is not a candidate for surgery and had requested that dialysis be stopped, that it was appropriate to change his goals of care to focus on comfort measures only.
INACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # HTN: Patient's home prazosin and metoprol were initally continued.
His pressure was labile throughout admission requiring a short period of pressure support with phenylephrine.
His home metoprolol and prazosin were held during this period and pressures improved.
He subsequently resumed his home dose of metoprolol, but prazosin was not restarted.
Patient was continued on ASA 325mg daily.
# DM: Patient's blood sugars were controlled with home glargine and sliding scale of insulin.
Patient frequently refused fingersticks and insulin, and so when he was made comfort measures only, glargine and insulin were discontinued as were fingerstick checks.
