A central line can be seen within the left subclavian vein.
IMPRESSION: ET tube is seen approximately 5 cm above the carina.
There is hyperinflation of the ET tube cuff.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 84 yo woman with history of hypertension, high cholesterol, heart disease status post pacemaker, and "borderline diabetes," who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center after being found down in the bathroom by her daughter with a left facial droop and slurring her speech.
She deteriorated in the ambulance ride on the way to the hospital, requiring intubation when she arrived in the emergency room.
She was found to have a very large subcortical hemorrhage (>100cc) with subfalcine herniation and effacement of the basilar cistern.
Neurosurgery at the time felt that the prognosis was very poor and that surgical intervention was not indicated.
She was extubated and taken off pressors at 3:20PM and expired shortly afterwards, at 3:46PM.
