Stable post left upper lobectomy scarring.
Redemonstration of diffuse ground glass opacities in the right lung of uncertain etiology.
In the MICU she was placed on heparin which was shortly thereafter discontinued as there was not a clear indication for anticoagulation.
LP was done to screen for vasculitis and showed no pleocytosis, glucose and protein were normal, CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, and CSF ACE level and CSF lyme are still pending at time of discharge.
She was started on high dose steroids, Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd for presumed vasculitis.
She steadily began to improve with steroid treatment.
Brain biopsy was not done since she had been treated with steroids for 5 days and therefore the procedure would be low yield and would not likely change the course of treatment.
She was started on Cytoxan on [**1-8**].
She will continue treatment with Cytoxan for 6 months at which time she should have a repeat cerebral angiogram.
She will continue to receive steroids until the cytoxan is therapeutic per rheumatology.
