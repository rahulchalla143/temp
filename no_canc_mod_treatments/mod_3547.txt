This stenosis was felt to be the cause of his current acute on chronic weakness.
He was seen by the neurosurgery service and the patient elected to have surgical decompression of the area.
In addition, his ASA and plavix had to be stopped before surgery, but were restarted on [**5-31**] and [**6-1**] respectively.
He was kept well hydrated before surgery to decrease his risk of cardiac complications from the procedure.
He was kept on O2 (4l), restarted on ASA and beta blockers immediately.
On POD1, he was restarted on Plavix, Heparin SC.
He was treated with vanc, levo, flagyl for a multi-focal pneumonia, and required face mask for oxygenation.
His respiratory distress and hypoxia improved over a couple of days with this treatment without the patient requiring mechanical ventilation.
The plan was to persue maximal medical therapy with antibiotics, steroids, nebulizers, realizing that the patient would at this point almost certainly requre a prolonged recovery of days to weeks with the aid of mechanical ventilation.
The patient decided that he did not wish to be intubated and put on mechanical ventilation.
The patient and family demonstrated that they understood the implications of this decision and the plan was to pursue comfort care, stopping all medical treatments other than comfort treatments.
The antibiotics as well as other medications were discontinued.
There is a history of CAD s/p PCI in '[**72**].
Metoprolol, lisinopril, ASA, Plavix were continued until the status change to CMO.
