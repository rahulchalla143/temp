Patient was intubated at OSH, extubated [**5-28**] - total of 11 days.
History of Present Illness: 29 year-old male patient with a history of DM2, obesity, OSA and pericarditis (6 months ago) who presented to [**Hospital1 14360**] on [**2178-5-16**] with chest pain, back pain, fevers, chills and shortness of breath for one day.
His pain was described as sharp, worse with inspiration and on laying supine and relieved by sitting and leaning forward.
He was treated with NSAIDS at a hospital in [**State 3914**].
He was given a diagnosis of percarditis, treated with Motrin 800mg tid, and admitted to teh ICU.
Dopamine was used for BP support and the patient was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress.
He was found to be in DKA with blood glucose in the 600's and ketones in the urine.
100mg of lovenox was given empirically and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Renal did not feel that there is an acute need for HD at this point and agreed with IVF and pressors.
They recommended changing azithromycin to doxycycline.
OSA on BiPAP 4. h/o Pericarditis 6 months ago  Social History: Patient is married and has a 12 year-old daughter.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: VS: Tm 103.7 Tc 101.4, BP 112/68 (88-122/62-88), HR 123 (125-150), RR 24 97% on Vent: AC: Tv: 700 x 24, FIO2 0.4, PEEP 10 -> PIP 35, Plateau 29, ABG 7.34/30/99, 7.32/28/130 CVP 23, CO 8.5, CI 2.63, SVR 687, MVO2 76 GEN: morbidly obese young man intubated and sedated HEENT: ETT in place, mmm Neck: large neck but no JVD appreciated CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no m/r/g PULM: mechanical breath sounds appreciated, crackles at the bases bilaterally ABD: obese, NABS, NT/ND Ext: cool extremities, no c/c/e, 1+ DP and PT b/l Neuro: intubated, sedated Derm: no rashes noted.
LV inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure  ECHO [**2178-5-25**]:  Conclusions:  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Additionally, his cardiac output was elevated (though difficult to use those numbers which were from CVP and not swan).
Source of septic shock was initially unclear and included multifocal pneumonia, pericarditis/myocarditis, atypical organism in setting of exposure to rodents.
In terms of BP, pt was appropriately switched from Dopamine to Levophed which was quickly titrated down, and discontinued more than a week before discharge.
He was treated with Zosyn and Vancomycin for a total of 13 days, and Azithromycin for a total of 5 days.
He completed a 5 day course of doxycycline, followed by a 5 day course of azithromycin as it was thought the doxycycline may have contributed to his pancreatitis.
By the time of discharge he had completed a 13 day course of vancomycin and zosyn, as well as a 5 day course of azithromycin and was afebrile.
His BP was stable and heart failure and fluid retention was treated with CVVH.
His potassium gradually increased and his volume status worsened and he was started on CVVH on [**5-21**].
He remains HD dependent, and had a HD tunneled line placed on [**6-3**].
He will receive HD as an outpatient and will follow-up with nephrology for further treatment adjusments.
*Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated at the outside hospital in setting of respiratory distress and DKA.
There was no evidence of ARDS on imaging exams and he did well on the ventilator.
He had bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on CT scan, and was started on vancomycin/zosyn, as well as doxycycline for atypical coverage, as above.
He was eventually weaned to PSV and then extubated on [**5-28**] without complication after almost 2 weeks of intubation.His O2 Saturation remained stable after extubation, 96-98% on RA, no drop in O2Sat on ambulation.
He was treated effectively with an insulin drip.
His sugars were well controlled on an insulin sliding scale.
It was noted that the enzymes trended up shortly after restarting propofol for sedation, and that this had happened once previously.
His amylase and lipase both began to trend down after propofol was discontinued again.
There was a thought that doxycycline could also have contributed, and this was changed to azithromycin.
On the floor he complained of transient LUQ pain on two occassions for which he did not require any treatment or further work-up.
He was treated with beta blockers (labetalol drip peri-extubation, with transition to PO metoprolol).
He was noted to have ventricular bigeminy just after starting HD on [**5-27**].
His bigeminy resolved with calcium supplementation (his free calcium was noted to be low).
Pt's blood pressures were well controlled on metoprolol.
He did not require pain medication for that during the days prior to discharge.
On the day of discharge pt has some nausea and was treated with prochloperazine.
