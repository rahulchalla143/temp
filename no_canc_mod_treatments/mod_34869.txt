Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: 80 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for emphasema, hypertension, and recent subdural hematoma s/p right craniotomy who was transferred to the medicine intensive care unit from the neurosurgery service for respiratory distress.
The patient was intubated at the OSH, then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-13**], and underwent an emergent right craniotomy for SDH evacuation.
The patient underwent a hiatal hernia repair and g-tube placement [**2153-7-18**].
Tube feeds were started [**7-19**].
After starting G-tube feeds and being positive 1.5L, the patient was found to be in respiratory distress with thick white secretions suctioned.
The patient was given 20mg lasix iv, then another 20mg lasix iv with minimal improvement in respiratory function.
Patient was trialed on CPAP in an attempt to avoid intubation.
Past Medical History: Emphysema HTN Bilateral hip replacements Hyperlipidemia Osteoporosis   Social History: resides in [**Hospital3 **] facility.
Head CT([**7-14**])->Post-evac NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval right frontal craniotomy with evacuation of the previously seen right subdural hematoma.
There is also a new focus of either intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe, measuring 2.5 x 1.8 cm (2:7) - previously there was a small amount of blood products in this region and this new finding may represent blooming of a contusion.
C-Spine CT([**7-13**]) IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course on Neurosurgery service: ([**Date range (1) 79637**]) SDH: Patient was admitted and emergently underwent a left craniotomy for an acute right SDH.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the SICU intubated.
Hyponatremia: She was initially fluid restricted for a sodium nadir of 120, which gradual increased to 135 without the need of hypertonic saline or further fluid restriction.
C-spine: On [**7-15**] she was extubated successfully, and her c-spine later cleared clinically.
FEN/GI: A Doboff feeding tube was attempted unsuccessfully on [**7-14**].
On [**7-16**] a nasogastric tube was again attempted unsuccessfully under fluoroscopic guidance.
On [**7-18**] she underwent GTUBE placement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and transferred to the step down unit in stable condition.
Tube feeds were begun 24 hours post-op.
A nutrition consult recommended probalance TFs at a goal rate of 50cc/hr.
80 y/o female HTN, emphysema, s/p craniotomy for SDH evacuation intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress, now with pneumonia (etiology likely multifactorial -- aspiration PNA/pleural effusions) and urinary tract infection.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt suffered from an aspiration PNA 2' to TFs.
She was initially covered broadly for for HAP/VAP/aspiration PNA (received 4 day course of Vancomycin (start date 7.21), 3 day course of Zosyn (start date7.21), and 2 day course of Cipro (start date 7.22).)
Her respiratory distress was also likely complicated by layering pleural effusions, followed by CXR and treated w/ intermittent Lasix diuresis.
COPD exacerbation was less likely, but pt had a 3 day prednisone burst that was completed on 7.20. she was also continued on Qvr and nebulizers (albuterol as needed and iptratropium standing.)
She was extubated successfully on 7.25 and was suctioned aggressively and given robitussin to thin her secretions.
She was weaned to 2L NC and transferred to the floor.
Speech and Swallow consulted on the patient after extubation, and recommended a video swallow study.
She passed and can drink thin liquids and pureed solids and crushed pills.
Heparin SC was d/c-ed, pt was typed and crossed, and 1 U PRBCs transfused.
Less likely PE, although patient has been in hospital off heparin due to SDH.
ST improved w/ Haldol administration.
She was not given ASA given hct drop.
She was started at low doses of home B-blocker at TID-QID intervals, which was gradually increased to Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **].
Albuterol was used whenever possible over iptratropium to decrease non-specific B1 antagonization and increased tachycardia.
She was continued on Keppra 1500 mg IV BID.
Her ABGs were followed and her diuresis goals were decreased as tolerated.
She also received oral prednisone again starting on [**2153-7-30**] for recurrent wheezing and improved.
# Left Hand Avulsion Laceration:  Plastics recommended xeroform dressing changes [**Hospital1 **] .
Metoprolol increased to home dose of 50 [**Hospital1 **] prior to d/c from ICU.
Switched from IV keppra to PO keppra.
Treated with 500 cc bolus and increased metoprolol to 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Also stopped albuterol and started zolpidex to avoid additional B agonism in light of her tachycardia.
If taking sufficient POs, can readdress tube feed amounts and adjust as caloric needs call for.
# Pt also was weaned off her NC oxygen and was saturating fine on RA.
