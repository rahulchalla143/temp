She hasn't been using her nebulizers often because they make her cough.
It was felt that she may eventually need a pleuroscopy for diagnosis but the decision has not been made given her "respiratory frailty and DNR status."
Past Medical History: COPD on home O2 Recent exudative pleural effusions Chronic sinusitis with secondary nasal drip and chronic cough.
XR CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY) Study Date of [**2193-1-6**] 9:20 AM Right and left chest decubitus were obtained.
Decompensation [**1-6**] requiring precautionary ICU transfer for consideration of BiPAP but did not necessitate this.
Improved with new regime including morphine IR after palliative care consult.
Right Pleurex drain was inserted [**1-11**] for symptomatic relief of effusions.
She was treated with QID ipratropium and albuterol nebulisers, prednisone 40mg po daily and azithromycin.
She was then started on IV ceftriaxone to cover for possibel infection although her WBC were notelevated, she remained afebrile and had no radiographic evidence of infection.
As a precautionary measure, she was transferred to the ICU for consideration of BiPAP but this was not required.
In the ICU she did not receive NIV and improved with nebs and lorazepam.
The patient coped on baseline O2 requirement saturating well but was very anxiou regarding er breathing which was relieved by lorazepam.
Sh was seen by palliative care on [**1-8**] who recommended oral IR morphine 7.5mg Q4 PRN to as treatment of her anxiety regarding her pulmonary symptoms.
She was seen by her pulmonologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] on [**1-10**] who felt that a Pleurex drain may be of value to symptomatically treat her effusions as these effusions essentially excluded her best functioning lung tissue and were a considerable reason to account for her symptoms.
She agreed to drain insertion and interventional pulmonology inserted a right Pleurex catheter on [**1-11**] and post procedure there was no evidence of pneumothorax on CXR but she did note pleuritic chest pain.
She was discharged to rehabilitation on [**1-11**] and her leurex drain can be drained 3x/week.
She agreed to Pleurex drain insertion on [**1-11**] and this was inserted in teh right chest.
She had pain at the site and this was relieved by oxycodone and a lidocaine patch can also be used.
She was treated with IV fluids, her breathing settled following anxiolytics and regular nebs and this fell to normal.
Glaucoma: we continued home brimonidine and latanoprost eye drops.
Anxiety and Palliative Care: We continued home mirtazepine and increased lorazepam to 1mg PRN Q6H and she was seen by palliative care on [**1-8**] and they followed her during the rest pof her admission.
They recommended adding morphine sulfate IR 7.5mg Q4H for anxiety regarding breathing.
She had a Pleurex drain placed on [**1-11**] for symptomatic relief of recurrent exudative effusions of unknown cause.
