He was taken to [**Hospital6 3105**], where he received an NIHSS of 9 (breakdown not available on the provided notes) and his head CT did not show acute infarcts by report.
Patient is on coumadin which was stopped on Tuesday due to an elevated INR.
He was therefore not an IV rTPA candidate, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible IA rTPA.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**] had 2 cataract surgeries, over the last 2 weeks and has been taking the coumadin on and off.
NIHSS by neurology was 12 (1 for best gaze, 2 for visual palsy, 4 for left motor arm, 4 for left motor leg, and 1 for dysarthria).
Past Medical History: -AFib s/p ablation (on coumadin) -Hyperlipidemia -Essential tremor -CAD s/p angioplasty (no h/o MI, only prior angina) -Carotid ultrasound obtained day prior to admission.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**] is an 81 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia, a-fib s/p ablation currently on coumadin, essential tremors, who presented to an OSH after he fell in the bathroom and had severe left sided weakness.
# NEURO: Patient's initial CT at OSH was normal.
Given the infarct progression and finding on his head CT, he was also not a candidate for IA intervention as the risks outweighed the benefits.
His coumadin was stopped because embolic stroke despite being on coumadin for afib indicated coumadin failure.
Of note, the MRI also showed some hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke, but regardless it was decided to continue anticoagulating patient as his neuro exam was stable.
Once his INR drifted below 2, he was started on therapeutic Lovenox 70mg SC BID.
Plan is for him to stay on Lovenox until INR <1.5, and then switch to Pradaxa 150mg [**Hospital1 **].
His home cilostazole should also be continued, as patient has CAD and requires anti-platelet therapy.
He was also started on Fluoxetine, which has been shown to help with motor recovery after cortical strokes.
He continues to require a dysphagia diet on discharge.
# CV: patient's home propranolol 120mg PO daily (for essential tremor) was temporarily decreased to 1/2 dose during hospitalization due to need to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure after stroke.
Restarted on home dose at discharge.
===================== TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - please D/C Foley when pt arrives to rehab facility, and check post-void residuals - please HOLD morning dose of Lovenox until INR is checked on [**2186-8-2**].
If INR is >1.5, give AM dose of Lovenox and recheck INR on [**2186-8-3**].
If INR is <1.5, STOP Lovenox and START Dabigatran.
