HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old female who has had recent multiple admissions to the hospital for shortness of breath who was admitted on [**2140-1-16**], from rehabilitation with listlessness and a blood pressure in the low range of 100/60.
She had some wheezes on examination and was given Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers and Lasix 40 mg intravenously.
Dopamine drip was started for blood pressure support and the patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and given two liters of normal saline.
She was noted to be 88% in room air and got antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
She was placed on an eight liter face mask and had an arterial blood gases of 7.30 with a pCO2 of 47 and a pO2 of 58.

Dyspnea, hypoxia - She was much improved after getting fluids in the Intensive Care Unit without any diuresis.
It was determined by chest x-ray that she was dry and had possible infiltrate and was treated with antibiotics, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin.
The Vancomycin was discontinued, however, she remained on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia.
Upon transfer to the Medicine floor, she was found the next day to be in significant respiratory distress requiring respirator care and nebulizers.
She was given 20 mg intravenous Lasix and had good urine output and was saturating well.
She then became very lethargic and was given intravenous fluids as it is noted in the past the patient responds very well to intravenous fluids, becoming more alert and aware of her environment.
It was recommended that the patient start Diltiazem for rate control without using beta blockers to exacerbate any potential bronchospasm.
The patient did well on Diltiazem and was continued only on Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Her previous Imdur and Lopressor were discontinued.
Hypotension - It was unclear whether the patient was overmedicated with blood pressure medications upon admission or was over-diuresed.
Her previous hospital stay had actually cut down her previous Lasix dose so it is unclear whether this had anything to do with her hypotension.
However, while in house, the patient's blood pressure remained well without Lopressor or Lisinopril at 20 mg.  At the reduced Lisinopril dose as well as the Diltiazem, the patient did well.
She was restarted on her Lasix 20 mg p.o.
