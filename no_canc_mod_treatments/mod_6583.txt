- He responded well to diuresis with Lasix 40mg IV and PO.
His home dose of Lasix was switched to 40mg once daily from 20mg twice daily.
He was also advised to follow a low salt diet and give himself an extra dose of Lasix 40mg if his weight increases 5 pounds above his baseline dry weight.
- He will also be discharged on his home dose of olmesartan 40mg, spironolactone 25mg daily was started, digoxin 125mcg every other day was continued.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  He is currently back in atrial fibrillation, s/p recent cardioversion [**2118-8-23**].
His INR remained therapeutic on his home Coumadin dosing.
His initial rate in atrial fibrillation was up to the 120s so his metoprolol dosing was increased to 50mg twice daily and his home digoxin was continued.
His rate then improved to the 70s, but it is unclear whether his rate would have improved with diuresis alone.
- He will continue his anticoagulation with alternating coumadin 2 mg and 2.5 mg daily with a goal INR [**2-22**].
- His digoxin will continue at 125mcg every other day and he will be put on metoprolol succinate 100mg daily for rate control.
- He will continue his amiodarone per the loading dose schedule that was given to him by his outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- He will undergo a repeat cardioversion in [**3-23**] weeks after amiodarone has reached steady state wit Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
- His simvastatin dosing was decreased to 20mg given the interaction with amiodarone.
- ASA at 81 mg daily should be considered after warfarin dose is stable on full load of amiodarone.
Spironolactone 25mg daily was newly started in house and he will continue as an outpatient.
He will be discharged on metoprolol succinate 100mg daily, olmesartan 40mg daily, spironolactone 25mg daily.
His home amlodipine will not be continued as an outpatient.
He received 1 dose of vancomycin and levaquin in the ED, but his antibiotics were not continued in the CCU.
# DM2:  On metformin and glyburide at home.
Metformin was held in the setting of ARF and lactic acidosis, glyburide was also held.
He had QID FS and his sugars were covered with ISS.
# hx PE:  given subsegemental nature, plan was to continue anticoagulation for 3 months, but he will benefit from long term anticoagulation for his PAF anyway and has tolerated the medication well.
Currently therapeutically anticoagulated and he will continue his coumadin at home dose.
Plan was for outpatient follow up for PET CT and possible bronchoscopy with biopsy vs mediastinoscopy for tissue diagnosis.
