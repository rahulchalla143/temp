SOMNOLENCE/ASTERIXIS:  After withholding the patient's medications overnight, she was increasingly alert in the morning.
Her medications were slowly restarted but her MS Contin was held.
She was urged to keep careful track of her medications as she is on numerous psychiatric and pain medications which may be sedating.
For treatment of this, she was begun on a regimen of inhaled Tobramycin for 28 days which will alternate with an inhaled dose of [**Doctor Last Name **] for 28 days indefinitely.
CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE:  She will continue on home CPAP, home 02, home nebulizers including Albuterol, Ipratropium, and Mucomyst as well as outpatient chest PT.
