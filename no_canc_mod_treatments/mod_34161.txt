There is bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty.
MRI Head [**3-17**]: TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was obtained through the brain prior to and following administration of contrast.
FINDINGS: As detailed on the recent CT, multiple postoperative changes are noted following a bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty.
Status post resection of ethmoidal mucocele with no evidence of residual mucocele.
Head CT [**3-17**]: FINDINGS: As on [**2102-3-15**], postoperative change including a bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty is again noted.
Head CT [**3-19**]: Since prior exam, a right frontoparietal approach, EVD drain is in place with its tip terminating along the inferior aspect of the falx in the region of the third ventricle.
Status post new right- sided EVD with interval increase in pneumocephalus due to interval procedure.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**3-15**] to undergo resection and reconstruction of skull base mucocele.
Drain placement was successful, however on POD#2, the drain ceased to work and was subsequently removed.
On [**3-19**], he underwent stereotactic placement of external ventricular drain to further treat the CSF leak, and such that intrathecal antibiotic therapy could be initiated.
On [**3-21**], flurosceine contrast was instilled, while ENT surgery observed with the use of a scope intranasally for CSF leak.
On [**3-24**] his external ventricular drain was removed, and two staples placed to approximate the wound.
