Admission Date:  [**2129-9-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-10-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-11-5**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese gentleman who came to the hospital in the setting of cellulitis of the left leg with hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and desaturation.
On [**2129-9-4**], he awoke with fever, chills and rigors and went to [**Hospital3 4527**] where he was noted to have a temperature of 104 degrees and also appeared to be uncomfortable and short of breath.
His saturations were 92% in room air and improved to 97 to 98% with four liters nasal cannula.
For the left leg cellulitis, he was started on Vancomycin, Clindamycin and Levofloxacin.
His blood pressure subsequently dropped to 80 systolic and the patient was started on Neo-Synephrine infusion and had aggressive fluid resuscitation.
The left leg cellulitis seemed to improve and the Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.
He was placed on CPAP and then a nonrebreathing mask but the saturations were still in the low 90s with arterial oxygen tension of 62 to 74 mmHg.
Oxygenation seemed to improve with assist control ventilation and the FIO2 was gradually weaned from 80% to 60% oxygen.
Quadriceps tendon repair in [**2125**].
Status post hydrocele repair which was complicated by postoperative cellulitis.

ALLERGIES:  Cephalosporins and Morphine Sulfate.
After intubation he was ventilated on pressure support of 20 with a PEEP of 10 and he was on 100% oxygen.
He was sedated with Propofol and Lorazepam.
Creatinine kinase was 96 and troponin was negative.
Cardiac - Hemodynamic instability requiring inotropics initially.
Pulmonary - The patient required awake fiberoptic intubation for control of airway.
During this two to three week period, the oxygenation was labile and this was treated by intense physical therapy and nebulizers.
Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2129-9-27**].
Adequate oxygenation was maintained over the tracheostomy mask with 40% oxygen.
Renal - Aggressive diuresis during the MICU stay.
The patient was treated with Lasix 20 to 80 mg p.r.n.
There was one episode of prerenal failure which improved spontaneously and he did not require dialysis or hemofiltration during his stay in the MICU.
Gastrointestinal - Due to the long-standing diabetes mellitus, he was prone for recurrent gastroparesis.
There was one episode of coffee ground vomitus but the patient had a stable hematocrit and therefore did not need an endoscopy.
Hematology - The patient's hematocrit has been stable during his MICU stay and he did not require any transfusions during the hospital stay.
This is being treated with Flagyl at present.
Nutrition - The patient required prolonged parenteral nutrition due to the gastroparesis but now he has a postpyloric tube and he is on enteral feeds.
Prophylaxis - He is on Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d., on Protonix 40 mg intravenously once a day.
Flagyl 500 mg nasogastric b.i.d., today is day 17 of a 21 day course.

Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as required p.r.n.
Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d.
Half strength Respalor plus 80 grams ProMod as tube feeds with a goal of 70 cc/hour.
The patient is comfortable with tracheostomy mask with 40% oxygen.
The tracheostomy tube was not changed for fenestrated tube due to anatomical difficulty and relatively young tracheostomy tract.
It is very essential to check the position of the feeding tube tip periodically and be certain that it is postpyloric.
The patient was assessed for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement or jejunostomy tube placement, but these procedures could not be performed either by gastroenterology or interventional radiology because of the body mass.
