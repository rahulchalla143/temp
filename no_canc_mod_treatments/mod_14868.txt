[**2111-12-10**] TSH 1.8  <br> Imaging: ECHO [**7-7**] from d/c summary: "This reveals normal EF of 65%.
<br>  HCT [**2111-12-3**] shows subacute infarct of right parieto-temporal region, as well as more chronic infarct.
<br>  CAROTID ANGIOGRAM [**2111-12-5**]: PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room.
The right common femoral artery was accessed using a Seldinger technique and a 6 French vascular sheath was placed in the right groin.
This was connected to a continuous saline flush.
Therefore, we decided not to pursue any aggressive interventional strategies.
The vascular sheath was left in place since the patient was heparinized and removed later in the recovery room after the heparin was stopped for 2 hours.
The right external carotid artery has about 80% stenosis at the origin.
IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 23203**] underwent cerebral arteriography for possible right ICA and right middle cerebral artery stenting, however the right MCA was seen to be chronically occluded and the right ICA did not have significant stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This 66 year old gentleman with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2 and recent right MCA stroke, was readmitted for right MCA stroke on [**12-3**].
He was started on a heparin gtt and coumadin post angio for stroke prevention, after which he developed a right groin hematoma.
His hematoma has been progressively enlarging and heparin gtt was discontinued; he received 5mg PO vitamin K. Vascular surgery was consulted and right groin U/S revealed pseudoaneurysm.
He received only approximately 150cc prbcs on [**2111-12-9**] after which time transfusion was stopped due to fever (no rash, hives, etc).
He received 10mg IV diltiazem x2, then 60mg PO diltiazem.
He then received 5mg IV lopressor to which his HR responded-->80s-90s.
He received 10 IV lopressor and started on oral diltiazem.
He was given 3 units pRBC and the following morning underwent repair of R femoral pseudoaneurysm by vascular surgery.
He received an additional 2 units of pRBC post-operatively.
He remained in the MICU for two more days, at one time requiring IV diltiazem to control an episode of AF with RVR.
This, along with his hypertension, was further controlled with PO diltiazem and metoprolol .
He underwent, now found to have expanding right groin hematoma and hct drop after initiating heparin gtt; also with new a. fib w/ RVR on the floor.
If a. fib persists beyond acute illness, CHADS2 score 4 w/ HTN, DM2, stroke and would warrant anticoagulation.
He was monitored in the MICU and continued on oral diltiazem, using IV lopressor PRN.
Rate stabilized and rapid a-fib did not recur except briefly on [**2110-12-15**] for several minutes on the floor (responded to IV lopressor 5mg).
He was given PRBCs x 2 units and hematocrit increased.
Coumadin was felt to be indicated, and despite thigh hematoma, was restarted on [**12-16**], the day of discharge at a very low dose of 2.5mg/day after deemed safe by vascular.
# Hct drop: No other clear source of bleed beyond known right groin pseudoaneurysm and marked hematoma extending from groin to distal anterior thigh.
Had previously only received 2Units prbc prior to today, now s/p addtional 2units (total 4Units prbcs thus far).
Aspirin was restarted after several days.
# Right groin hematoma: Management as above (pseudoaneurysm repaired by vascular surgery).
Hematocrit remained stable, and vascular surgery felt it was resafe to start low-dose coumadin with NO heparin on [**12-16**].
# S/P recurrent Right MCA stroke: MRI/MRA to have severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery as well as severe narrowing and irregularity of the basilar artery, right middle cerebral artery inferior division without evidence of hemorrhage, small bilateral occipital lobe infarctions suggesting basilar artery disease, likely embolic to the top of the basilar.
As above, his infarcts were felt to be embolic, and considering the new diagnosis of afib, coumadin was felt to be strongly indicated.
After several days of aspirin following repair of the pseudoaneurysm, coumadin was resumed at discharge - this should be followed closely considering his bleeding risk.
Patient does not have previous echo in our system.
This should be repeated after several months of coumadin therapy.
# Hyperlipidemia: Statin was continued.
# HTN: Home dose labetalol has been held in the setting of his significant hct drop.
He should be continued on insulin SS  at discharge.
# PPx: Bowel regimen, famotidine given CVA, pneumoboots.
# Code Status: DNI, chest compressions okay, wife thinking about whether shocks okay.
Discussed with patient's wife that in code situations oftentimes these go together; will need to continue further discussion.

We are starting coumadin at a low dose, but this dose will be adjusted by the inpatient facility based on the INR.
