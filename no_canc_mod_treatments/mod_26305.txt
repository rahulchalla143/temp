History of Present Illness: Patient is an 82 male who underwent a large bowel resection [**4-25**] for a sigmoid vulvulous at the [**Hospital6 6689**].
On [**2103-8-21**] the patient returned to the OR for an abdominal exploration with debridement of abdominal wound and fascia and wound closure with insertion of Sergisis.
The fistula was closed with a chromic stitch with fibrin glue.
A full thickness skin graft was laid over this.

Past Medical History: Pacemaker Loop colostomy Small bowel resection Take down of fisutla Prior J-tube placeement fx Ri shoulder Appendectomy   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**] was admited to the general surgery service under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**].
He was made NPO and TPN was started.
On [**2104-1-3**] he was taken to the operating room for (1) Exploratory laparotomy, (2)lysis of adhesions (3.5 hours), (3) Enterectomy, (4) enteroenterostomy, (5)colostomy, (6) closure of 2 enterotomies, (7) feeding jejunostomy, (8) component separation and (9) placement of Vicryl mesh to reinforce the closure.
Over the next week his tube feeds were advanced daily, he was diuresed as needed, and he was placed on agressive pulmonary toliet.
On [**2104-1-6**] he proved to be positive for heparin-dependent antiboties; he was diagnosed with heparin induced throbocytopenia thus all heparin products were discontinued and prophylaxis was continued with venodynes on at all times.
On [**2104-1-6**] he also spiked a temperature.
On [**2107-1-10**] he tested positive for Cdiff and he was given appropriate antibiotics to treat all of these infections.
Gastrograffin study on [**1-13**] demonstrated passage through small intestine and into colon easily, and the patient was begun on soft mechanical diet.
He demonstrated questionable ability to eat without coughing and a swallow study was obtained that demonstrated overt aspiration signs with all consistencies.
Nutrition was therefore continued with TPN and tube feeds alone.
While examining the patient he spiked temperature to 102, became tachycardic to 120s and was not able to follow commands.
Tube feeds were held and on [**1-28**] a gatrograffin enema was obtained that showed no colonic stricture/obstruction however was not quite normal due to apparent mucosal and anastamotic abnormalities.
Tube feeds were re-initiated and a video swallow showed evidence that patient could tolerate thin liquids and pureed diet without significant aspiration risk.
He tolerated this diet for several days with 1:1 feedings, however on [**2-3**] he had an aspiration event and was transferred back to the intensive care unit after emergent intubation for respiratory distress.
On [**2-6**] his sputum grew ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII sensitive to gent, imipenem and tobramycin and he was started on imipenem.
He was weaned from the ventilator over several days and extubated on [**2-7**].
Antibiotics, TPN and tube feeds were continued and the patient was very gently diuresed over the next week.
He is being transferred afebrile, tolerating tube feeds (half strength impact with fiber at 40cc/hour) and has completed a 14 day course of imipenem for an acinetobacter pneumonia.
He was transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital in stable condition and with instructions to remain NPO with TF for nutrition.
Instructions were given to continue pulmonary toilet with nebulizer treatments.
