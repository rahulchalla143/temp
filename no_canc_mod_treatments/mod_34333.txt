She completed a course of Vanco and Zosyn on [**2-2**].
While at rehab, she was continued on Lasix 40 mg daily and her Creatinine was noted to steadily rise.
On [**2-5**], she was found to be coughing so was started on Avelox (completed [**2-13**]) for empiric PNA treatment.
On [**2-8**], Her BUN was 34 and Cr 2.5 and so her lasix was lowered to 20 mg daily.
Her lasix was ultimately stopped on [**2-13**] when she was found to have a BUN of 43 and Cr of 3.2.
In the ED, she was hypotensive to the 80s transiently, but responded to IVF boluses.
Her CXR was difficult to interpret but showed LLL opacity with effusion and she was treated for PNA with Vanco and Cefepime.
She was seen by surgery who felt her presentation was not consistent with cholectysitis (no abdominal pain, fevers) and therefor did not recommend surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - Hypothyroidism - Obesity - Iron deficiency anemia - Thoracic aorta aneurysms - H/o gallstones - H/o pancreatic pseudocysts and radiographic evidence of pancreatitis without clinical symptoms (noted [**2125-1-26**]) - Recent LLL CAP with planned Vanco/Zosyn course to end [**2125-2-2**] - H/o renal failure in [**Month (only) **] due to "accidentally taking too much lasix"  Social History: Patient currently residing at rehab facility after hospitalization for PNA.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2125-2-19**]: IMPRESSION: The constellation of cholelithiasis, peri-pancreatic fluid, and lab evidence of pancreatitis is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of hypodensity that could represent pseudocysts, although these are not well delineated given lack of IV contrast.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2125-2-21**] and one liter of transudative fluid was aspirated.
She was placed on Vanco, Cefepime, and Flagyl to cover both pneumonia and cholangitis.
LLE DVT found and heparin gtt started.
Post-pyloric feeding tube was placed because of pancreatitis.
This was thought to be due to PE for which she was treated with a heparin gtt.
She was intubated and sedated.
She required pressors for hypotension and amiodarone for paroxysmal afib.
She had a dobhoff tube placed and was fed enterally.
She was maintained on a heparin gtt for DVT.
She got an IVC filter placed on [**3-14**].
She was maintained on multiple abx: aztreonam for pna, flagyl for empiric cdiff, and fluconazole.
The patient was relatively stable at the end of her hospitalization, but due to her significant illness and vent dependence and poor prognosis, she made the decision to come off of ventilator support on [**2125-3-21**].
Gallstone pancreatitis without abdominal pain: Post-pyloric feeding tube removed when patient demonstrated that she could eat orally without problem.
The patient underwent IR placement of pseudocyst drain on [**3-8**] which returned approx 1800cc of fluid.
On antibiotics for pneumonia.
As needed lasix for CHF.
Therapeutic thoracentesis as indicated.
Patient reintubated on [**3-7**] and ultimately underwent bedside tracheostomy.
She was started on CVVH in the TSICU due to uremia and acidosis.
Abnormal UPEP: Heme-onc performed bone marrow biopsy on [**2125-2-23**].
LLE DVT: Heparin gtt  #.
After the patient underwent a tracheostomy and was able to communicate, it became apparent that the patient did not wish to continue her life on a ventilator in the ICU.
The patient decided that she did not want to be on a ventilator, even if to be off the ventilator would lead to imminent respiratory arrest.
The ventilator was detached on the night of [**2125-3-21**] and the patient soon passed away due to respiratory failure on [**2125-3-22**] at 1:40am.
The surgical team took over patient's care [**2125-3-4**] for further managment of her gallstone pancreatitis.
[**3-4**]: She as started on flagyl and continued on vancomycin.
Hepain was continued with a goal of 60-80.
[**3-5**] TPN was started, PT was consulted.
Patient was noted to be in ATN with nephrology activley following along.
Hypotensive post intubation, requiring dual pressors.
With worsening acidosis and elevated Cr, temp HD line placed in case dialysis.
Patient transiently required dual pressors but levophed was weaned off and she remained on neosynephrine.
Improved acidosis while intubated and on bicarb gtt.
Remains on pressors [**3-10**]: Maintained CVVH and kept I/O even during AM.
[**3-11**]: Transient hypotension on CVVH, minimal improvement after albumin.
KUB obtained with dilated loops-continues to stool, primary team aware.
PICC discontinued and cultured [**3-13**]: Stopped CVVH.
Plan for drain in AM.
Continued tube feeds and resumed coumadin.
[**3-14**]: Perihepatic Perc drain placed by IR-1400 drained, cultures sent.
IVC filter placed by IR.
Right HD catheter removed secondary to contamination, tip sent and blood sent from site, left subclavian discontinued secondary to erthyema.
Cultures form peritoneal fluid negative, as well as thoracentesis.
Luekocystosis presumed to be secondary to h/o PNA during hospitalization, persistent leukocytosis likely from pancreatic and splenic artery compression, also Positive for MM in UPEP/SPEP with s/p bone marrow biopsy indicative of reactive (not malignant) bone marrow [**3-17**]: Petechial rash on forearms-heparin stopped in AM.
Back on AC overnight for tachypnea [**Date range (1) 72705**] Significant family discussions RE withdrawal of care.
