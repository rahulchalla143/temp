Left carotid endarterectomy via eversion technique.
Right common femoral to proximal anterior tibial artery bypass with a lateral superficial tunnel using non reversed saphenous vein graft, intraoperative angioscopy and valve lysis.
History of Present Illness: 57yo F with prior CVA with residual right sided numbness s/p right CEA on ASA, Plavix as well as DM Type II, HTN, h/o PVD, who was found down at home with dysarthria, and R sided weakness.
Neuro consult found the pt to have right pronator drift and right facial and some comprehension problems (which essentially resolved with treatment of hypotension.
In the ED, the pt was found to be initially hypothermic (T: 93) then febrile (T: 100.8), tachycardic (HR 106), hypotensive (BP: 84/49 -> 60/30) and Hypoxic (85% on 2L NC -> 97% 2L NC).
IVF (total 4L of NS) and pressors (DA then levophed, both off at time of transfer from ED) were given for hypotension and cultures were drawn.
MICU Course: While in MICU pt was not initiated or maintained on pressors throughout her course.
Her ASA, Plavix have been held.
Per Cards fellow, tachycardia thought to be rate related LBBB and recommended supportive care with IVF hydration and start low dose BB.

The pt was never continued on pressors when admitted to the MICU.
Pt was then worked up for TTE and TEE echo for assessment of clots as well as carotid U/S.
Pt was restarted on her ASA and plavix, ok'd per GI in setting of no further BRBPR.
She was continued on Cipro/Flagyl for emperic GI coverage.
She remained HD stable and did not require blood transfusions.
Her MRI/MRA of head was done on [**2173-3-31**] since pt was so tenuous w/BP in MICU.
Underwent Carotid U/S, TEE echo for further evaluation of source for embolic brain lesion.
Pt also started on low dose ACE-I per Neuro rec to prevent furhter ischemic brain damage with good BP control.
Etiology thought to be rebound tachycardia in setting of holding all antihypertensive medications while pt was initially hypotensive.
HTN: Pt initially presented with hypotension and all antihypertensive medications were held.
Per neuro was also started on ACE-I as her BP tolerated well.
Her home metformin was held as she was NPO, clears and started diet slowly.
ASA, Plavix initially held due to complication of GIB.
BB and CCB were initially held given recent hypotension, however after 24 hours she was stable and re-started BB.
She tolerated the procedures well.
