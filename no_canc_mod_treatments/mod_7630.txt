HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 35080**] is a 64-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, mitral valve stenosis with recent admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, requiring mitral valve replacement, however, was deemed not a surgical candidate who underwent an attempted valvuloplasty at [**Hospital6 1129**].
Her postoperative course is complicated by failure to extubate, hypotension requiring pressors, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone.
At [**Hospital3 **], the patient received digoxin for rate control, noted to have a temperature of 106 with blood cultures drawn.
Coronary artery disease, 50% mid right coronary artery, 100% mid left anterior descending artery, 90% D1, 80% distal circ.
Mitral valve stenosis, valve area of 0.7 cm with history of valvuloplasty x2.
Breast cancer status post radical left mastectomy in [**2153**] with treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.
C section x2 and gout.
MEDICATIONS AT REHABILITATION CENTER: 1.
Vitamin K. 3.
Digoxin 0.125 mg IV q day.
Ativan 1 mg IV prn.
ALLERGIES:  Heparin causing thrombocytopenia, and pork, and clams.
Her mitral stenosis was evaluated by emergency echo was found to be severe, despite prior effort at percutaneous valvuloplasty at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Here, formal surgical consultation was obtained  and again she was determined to not be a candidate for surgery given her history of radiation treatment in the chest, her anatomic abnormalities with a kyphoscoliosis, and generalized deconditioning, and sepsis.
She underwent evaluation for any other improvement in cardiac hemodynamics including cardiac catheterization with shuntogram which demonstrated trivial left to right shunting from a perforated atrial septum.
Her aortic stenosis was deemed mild.
She was maintained on Neo-Synephrine for hypotension with eventual switch to Levophed.
She maintained normal sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization, was maintained on amiodarone.
Pulmonary:  The patient required full ventilatory support through [**2182-4-25**].
She was persistently febrile with initial sputum samples demonstrating MSSA pneumonia.
She was maintained on Vancomycin throughout hospitalization as well as Zosyn.
On [**4-25**], she was essentially able to be successfully extubated, however, continued to require significant levels of Morphine for tachypnea.
The patient underwent significant diuresis initially.
However, she developed severe contraction, alkalosis at this level of diuresis without significant improvement in her hemodynamics or pulmonary function.
Then gently allowed to equilibrate and further treatment of her congestive heart failure included therapeutic drainage of her bilateral pleural effusions.
Neurologic:  Patient was initially, alert and appropriate and following commands, however, on approximately [**4-20**], she began developing tremors.
Patient's Versed and Reglan were discontinued at this time as they were felt to be possible contributors.
On [**4-25**] at time of extubation, patient's family made the decision to continue her care at comfort measures only given her poor long-term prognosis.
She was continued only on Morphine drip.
Her medications at this time with discontinuation of any further congestive heart failure management and antibiotics.
