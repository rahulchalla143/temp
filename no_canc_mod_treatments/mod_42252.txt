Further identification is pending to determine if it is a contaminant of the same organism that was present in his osteomyelitis.Initially had wanted to have his Hickman pulled, but per IR this would be a very difficult and involved procedure and they prefer to treat through the line if possible.

Daptomycin 400 mg IV daily for 10 more days, then vancomycin 1g IV qod.

Will hold off on pulling Hickman at this time and will need to be pulled if fungal BCx comes back positive after 6 weeks.
