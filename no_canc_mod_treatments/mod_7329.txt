Until recently, he has been in good health despite his cirrhosis and displayed Child's A function.
He sustained a motor vehicle accident on [**2118-12-31**], which resulted in a right hemothorax sternal fracture and was complicated by acute decompensation of his hepatic function which required an admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] with hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice with a rise in his total bilirubin count from 3.9 to 5.7, and acute renal failure with a creatinine rise from 0.5 to 2.1.
He was discharged following this admission and readmitted on [**2119-2-3**], for persistent encephalopathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distention.
He was transferred from the floor the surgical intensive care unit for liver dialysis on [**2-16**] without much benefit.
Subsequently, he vomited his tube feeds while on the floor and developed a cough followed by decreased mental status and hypoxia.
He was started on antibiotics for a presumed diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis.
He was subsequently transferred the surgical intensive care unit again, on [**2-20**], for management of hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy.
He was also intubated and ventilated at this point and was further resuscitated with fluids.
He was placed on the hepatorenal protocol and was given Octreotide and Midodrine.
His renal function also deteriorated, and he was upgraded to a 2-A transplant status.
There was also end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient of the donor and recipient bile duct with T-tube insertion.
During the intraoperative course, the patient received 13 units of packed red blood cells, 10 units of platelets, 18 units of fresh frozen plasma, 7 liters of Cell [**Doctor Last Name **], 20 units of cryoprecipitate, and 5.5 liters of crystalloids.
The patient was started on Solu-Medrol taper and CellCept for immunosuppression.
In the immediate postoperative period was fairly uneventful, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] required minimal further transfusions.
He was hemodynamically stable, and by postoperative day two his ventilator support started to wean down.
His Swan-Ganz catheter and left chest tube were removed on postoperative day two.
A pigtail catheter was also inserted under ultrasound guidance into the right chest to drain the right pleural effusion.
He received some further packed red blood cell transfusions, and Zosyn was started after he was noted to be febrile.
Antifungal medication was also started at this time.
By postoperative day four, rapamycin was added to his immunosuppressive regimen.
His fever was worked up with pan cultures, and he was started on acyclovir, and central lines were changed and tips sent for cultures.
His blood and sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he received double coverage with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin.
Once again, the previous central line was removed, and a fresh right internal jugular line was established.
The right chest pigtail catheter was also removed.
His biliary drainage through the T-tube had also diminished.
He thus received a 500-mg Solu-Medrol pulse on postoperative day seven.
At this stage, his immunosuppression consisting of prednisone 20 mg once a day, rapamycin 5 mg once a day, and CellCept [**Pager number **] mg twice a day.
As he continued to have thick purulent secretions from his lung which required very frequent suctioning, and this was preventing weaning from the ventilator, we decided to give him double coverage with antibiotics and add gentamicin to the meropenem that he was already on.
He also received a T-tube cholangiogram on postoperative day eight.
Based on sensitivity results, gentamicin was changed to tobramycin, and the vancomycin which he received for a few days was discontinued.
In view of his prolonged intubation and ongoing aggressive pulmonary toilet needs, he underwent an percutaneous tracheostomy on postoperative day 16.
On postoperative day 17, bilateral lower extremity deep venous thromboses were noted, and he was anticoagulated with heparin infusion.
He received further bronchoscopies at intervals of three to four days for pulmonary toilet for recurrent right lower lobe collapse.
So, again, he was changed to IV Zosyn and tobramycin.
His CellCept was discontinued, and he was started on Prograf at 2 mg p.o.
On postoperative day 24, a PICC line was inserted.
By this stage, he had completed his course of Zosyn and tobramycin and subsequent surveillance blood cultures were all negative.
IV antibiotics were therefore stopped at this stage, and he was switched tobramycin nebulizer treatment for his tracheobronchitis.
By postoperative day 29, that is on [**3-29**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was four weeks out from his orthotopic liver transplant with ongoing issues of pseudomonas, tracheobronchitis, and persistently elevated liver function tests which appeared to be secondary to sepsis-related cholestasis.
His immunosuppression at this stage was prednisone 20 mg once a day, rapamycin 5 mg once a day, Prograf 6 mg twice a day.
From a respiratory standpoint, he had a tracheostomy in place.
He continued to require aggressive pulmonary toilet in the form of suctioning and chest physical therapy.
He had not required bronchoscopy for pulmonary toilet for several days now; however, he was physically very weak and had myopathy from his prolonged illness, immunosuppression, and ventilator dependence, and cannot generate good spontaneous coughing.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, he had been on Lopressor for several weeks to manage his tachycardia and had been stable.
From a gastrointestinal point of view, he had a postpyloric feeding tube to which he was being fed.
From an infectious disease perspective, he had no further positive cultures from his blood, and he is currently on tobramycin nebulizer for his pseudomonas tracheobronchitis, and has not had any fevers for a while.
Also, he was being therapeutically anticoagulated with Coumadin to treat his deep venous thrombosis.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable with tracheostomy requiring less ventilator support but close monitoring and physical therapy.Patient is very deconditioned and weak but medically stable with excellent graft function and no evidence of rejection.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  A 47-year-old Caucasian male, status post orthotopic liver transplant for hepatitis C related cirrhosis with pseudomonas tracheobronchitis, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and persistently raised liver function tests secondary to sepsis-related cholestasis.
