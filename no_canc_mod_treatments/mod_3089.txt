DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9987**] Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2189-8-10**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: intraoperative TEE for AVR.TVR Height: (in) 74 Weight (lb): 327 BSA (m2): 2.68 m2 BP (mm Hg): 115/53 HR (bpm): 56 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2189-8-10**] at 09:52 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW1-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Suboptimal     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *7.5 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient: 6 mm Hg Mitral Valve - Pressure Half Time: 125 ms Mitral Valve - MVA (P [**1-13**] T): 1.7 cm2 Tricuspid Valve - Mean TS Gradient: 9 mm Hg  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA.
MITRAL VALVE: Mechanical mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Due to co-existing AR, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true area.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area.
A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present.
Initial views of the prosthetic aortic valve were poor.

DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6888**]                 Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to cardiac surgery preoperatively for IV heparin.
On [**8-10**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a Redo AVR/TVR (Mechanical) and replacement of her permenant A & V leads and generator.
He remained sedated and ventilated overnight.
His sedation was then weaned and he was found to have right hemiplegia and to not follow commands.
