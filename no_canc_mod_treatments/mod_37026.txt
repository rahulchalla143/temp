He is an 81-year-old white male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a pneumothorax, status post a bronchoscopy with multiple biopsies on [**1-9**].
He had acute shortness of breath five minutes prior to the end of the procedure and required nebulizers.
He received albuterol times three and Atrovent times one with improvement, and a subsequent x-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax.
The pneumothorax was noted and attempted conservative management with nebulizers and high-flow oxygen.
At that point, he failed conservative treatment, and a right-sided chest tube was placed for respiratory distress.
Albuterol 2 puffs four times per day.
Atrovent 2 puffs four times per day.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.25 mcg p.o.
Quinidine 324 mg p.o.
Lasix 10 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination revealed temperature was 97.4, blood pressure was 128/60, heart rate was 72, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 90% on face mask and 95% on room air.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  Status post bronchoscopy complicated by a pneumothorax.
The pneumothorax was initially attempted conservatively, but conservative treatment failed and a right-sided chest tube was subsequently required to relieve respiratory distress.
The chest tube resolved the pneumothorax, and the patient's respiratory distress was much improved.
He was continued on his outpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications including albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.
At 4 p.m. on [**1-12**], the patient stood up and the chest tube was accidentally discontinued.
An occlusive Vaseline gauze dressing was applied with minimal air leak.
The patient was maintained on oxygen over the course of the next night without any respiratory distress or other symptoms.
The patient had been stable for greater than 24 hours status post the discontinuation of the chest tube.
He was restarted on his home medications of digoxin and quinidine on [**2195-1-12**].
He was only requiring Pneumo boots while in bed.
