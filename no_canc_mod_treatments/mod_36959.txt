She was placed on Bipap and was initially agressive, but became progressively more somnolent.
Family decided to make patient DNR/I, with decision to treat with antibiotics, but without central lines, pressors or invasive procedures.
Patient received 1 L NS, Vancomycin 1 g IV x1, Zosyn 4.5 g IV x1, and Vitamin K 10 mg IVx1 for an elevated INR at 12.

A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present.
IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral and aortic valve mechanical prostheses.
Pneumonia: Patient with R infiltrate on CXR with relative leukocytosis and recent AMS which may secondary to infection/PNA.
Initially treated broadly with vanco/zosyn and then narrowed to CAP treatment with CTX/Azithro.
However, ultimately BiPAP was stopped [**1-8**] facial skin breakdown.
Given the patient's poor clinical appearance at that time, her antibiotics were broadened back to HCAP and aspiration PNA coverage, with vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro.
Was kept at goal oxygen saturation of 88-92% in setting of chronic CO2 retaining.
We were preparing for transfer to ICU for re-initiation of bipap but due to lack of ICU beds, she was kept on floor with nasal cannula increased to 6L O2.
After discussion with family, all antibiotics were discontinued.
ACS seemed less likely as EKG was at baseline, but troponin was mildly elevated in the setting of renal dysfunction.
Mental status transiently improved somewhat after patient received trazodone to help sleep but thereafter worsened upon onset of respiratory distress (see above).
Respiratory acidosis: Likely acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, given delta pH inappropriately small for change in CO2.
No prior ABG was available for comparison but we started albuterol and ipratropium nebs for possible obstruction.
Goals of care: On presentation, family aware that patient had acute on subacute decline, and understood that patient would not want artificial life support for extended period of time.
However, clinical status deteriorated and upon discussion with family and palliative care consult, family decided to make patient comfort measures only.
All antibiotics, anticoagulation, labs, and vitals were stopped at that time.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Patient had been placed on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
Received 10mg IV vitamin K in the ED and subsequently INR decreased to 2.2 which was subtherapeutic for her AVR and MVR.
She was then started on heparin drip for bridging and coumadin was re-started.
Cr improved to 1.0 with IV hydration.
Patient's broad spectrum antibiotic regimen for pneumonia would have also covered urinary pathogens.
# CHF: Patient had been off lasix for several weeks.
Lasix was initially held during hospital course because she appeared dry on exam and had history of minimal po intake.
On [**2126-6-7**], telemetry showed several runs of V-tach (the longest run being 18 beats) but HR remained in the 80s and no intervention was pursued at the time.
