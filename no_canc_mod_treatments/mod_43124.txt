Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] several weeks prior to admission for treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
She was given IV fluids, had a line placed and was started on Neo-Synephrine with stabilization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has coronary artery disease, status post MI in [**2188-8-1**], status post angioplasty and stent to the RCA.
Patient is also status post v-fib arrest, status post AICD placement in [**2191-5-2**].
The patient was initially started on dopa to help increase her blood pressure, but became tachycardiac.
Was then changed to Neo-Synephrine and eventually weaned off as blood pressure tolerated.
It was unclear whether any component of hypotension was secondary to pacer malfunction.
Patient had pacer interrogated by electrophysiology with an increase in her lower rate from 60 to 70.
Patient also had decrease in random cortisol and she was started on prednisone 60 mg.  2.
She was started on ceftriaxone 1 gm q.24 hours.
She was originally thought to have a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray, however, there was decreased suspicion for this after her admission.
She was started on both prednisone and Florinef.
She was continued on IV ceftriaxone.
While she did not need to remain on this IV medication, given that she would intermittently refuse her medications, we decided to keep her on this.
Also given Streptococcus in her urine, which was a rather mild bug, it was unclear that she needed full strong coverage.
However, in the setting of her likely urosepsis, it was felt we would continue treatment with antibiotics for this.
She was continued on aspirin, beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
She was covered with regular insulin sliding scale and continued on NPH.
She was continued on prednisone for her adrenal insufficiency.
She was also on Florinef in conjunction with the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.
Patient was placed on vitamin D and calcium carbonate for osteoporosis prevention, given her high dose steroids and her age.
Only issue on discharge was that patient was slightly dry and we continued to give her IV fluids and encouraged her to drink more fluids.

In terms of antibiotics, patient has a sensitivity to Levaquin, but she tolerates [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she will be discharged on [**First Name3 (LF) **] and will be treated for a total of 14 days.
In the hospital patient received treatment from [**2-6**] through [**2-11**], so she will receive nine more doses of this.
