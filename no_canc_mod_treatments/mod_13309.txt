Stenting of LM and LCX with Xience 4x28mm stent posted to 4.5 mm in left main ostium.
Groin closure with Mynx device.
She remained with borderline BP for several hours and a repeat HCT went from 26 to 19.
The decision to explore the patient initially was based on continued hemodynamic instability requiring pressors.
Hct remianed 20 despite total of 8 units of blood transfused over approximately 4-6 hours.
Soon postop, her JP drain began to put out large quantities despite attempts to correct coagulopathy.
Groin was opened and small arterial puncture site just under the lower edge of the inguinal ligament (no sign of Mynx closure device) was repaired with single prolene stitch.
She was able to wean off of most pressors and eventually all pressors by 48 hrs after she was cardioverted out of Afib.
We had discussion about Plavix / ASA and this was restarted by consensus 24 hours postop.
Oliguria / ATN renal failure attributed to recent dye load and shock.
CT showed bilateral pneumonias as only potiential source for infection.
Resuscitation efforts were stopped when echo showed no heart movement (~15minutes total).
