Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Magnesium Oxide 400 mg p.o.
Tylenol 650 mg q6hours p.r.n.
Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius were not tested.
Neurologic - A magnetic resonance scan was done with stroke protocol that showed extension of restricted diffusion in the left parapontine region with new restricted diffusion in the left cerebellum and a minimal restricted diffusion on the right.
He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with Heparin drip and was Coumadinized initially.
The patient has been kept anticoagulated for neurological reasons through Heparin drip and has been tried to be Coumadinized to goal at multiple times.
At times, the Coumadin has been stopped either because the patient needed an interventional radiology procedure or needed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube to be placed.
At this time, he is still on Heparin drip with Coumadin being administered to goal.
After an episode of pulmonary edema on the morning of [**2109-2-5**], after administration of fresh frozen plasma to reverse supratherapeutic INR that will be described below in the cardiovascular section, an angiogram was done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37461**] to determine possibility of angioplasty of posterior circulation, however, on this angiogram, there was evidence of total occlusion of the basilar artery with evidence of collaterals being formed from the PICA and possible collateral blood flow from the left meningeal vasculature.
Given this situation, there was no indication for any further intervention and no angioplasty was done.
From a neurological point of view, we are going to manage him conservatively with gentle challenge of his posterior circulation by increasing the inclination of his bed and hoping he does not get any symptoms.
There have been talks of possible involvement of neurosurgery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] to ask whether there would be any neurosurgical procedure that could be done that would enhance blood flow to the posterior circulation.
A stat cardiology consultation was called and this was felt to be flash pulmonary edema due to the fact that he had recently been transfused with one unit of fresh frozen plasma for an supratherapeutic INR of 5.2.
He was managed in the Cardiac Unit for a day and was transferred after being given intravenous Lasix and diuresed.
He did pretty well from a cardiac standpoint and we used p.o.
Lopressor 12.5 mg from time to time to control his blood pressure.
We also had started Midodrine 10 mg t.i.d.
He was again found to be diaphoretic with tachypnea in the 40s and systolic blood pressure 220/110.
He was initially managed with a Nitroglycerin drip and he is going to be transferred back to the floor with Lopressor 37.5 mg b.i.d.
and Nitroglycerin patch 0.2 mg between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. and Lasix 20 mg q.o.d.
FEN - A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed through which he has received tube feeds, Promote with Fiber.
The patient had significant morbidity from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, having subcutaneous emphysema that took a couple of weeks to resolve.
The patient had two episodes of bleeding from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site and hemostasis was achieved by surgicel on both occasions.
it is presumed that because of this intermittent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site bleed into the stomach through the tube, he has been guaiac positive.
The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was advanced to a jejunostomy tube because there was some concern that he may be aspirating.
Psychiatry - The patient was started on Citalopram 20 mg q.d.
Lopressor 37.5 mg b.i.d.
Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
Citalopram 20 mg q.d.
Colace 100 mg t.i.d.
Lasix 20 mg q.o.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 150.
Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
Nitroglycerin patch 0.2 mg between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., take off for systolic blood pressure less than 150.
Tube feed Promote with Fiber 20 cc/hour, at goal 80 cc/hour.
Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d.
