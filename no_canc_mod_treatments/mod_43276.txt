Admission Date:  [**2157-8-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-8-19**]   Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2132**], who presented to an outside hospital with episodes of left scapula and arm pain.
On [**8-4**] the patient had another episode of this chest pain for which he took one sublingual nitroglycerin tablet with good affect.
The patient went to the Emergency Department of an outside hospital where he had another episode of chest pain which was relieved when he was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2132**].
Status post open cholecystectomy.
Status post right inguinal herniography.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
He was started on aspirin 325 mg p.o., intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous heparin, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d., and Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
It was felt that his electrocardiogram changes were consistent with his prior inferoposterior/apical myocardial infarction, and that he was now presenting with a troponin-negative unstable angina.
The plan was to continue his intravenous heparin and beta blocker with the intent to send him for a cardiac catheterization on [**8-9**].
The decision was therefore made that the patient should undergo an elective coronary artery bypass graft.
On [**8-11**] the patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass times three with left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, and reversed saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the left anterior descending diagonal coronary artery, and reversed saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the first obtuse marginal coronary artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Intensive Care Unit, intubated, and in satisfactory condition.
Cardioversion was attempted at 100 joules without effect.
Amiodarone was bolused with a drip started resulting in immediate cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 60s.
He was atrially paced to support his cardiac index and blood pressure with improved hemodynamics.
On postoperative day one amiodarone was switched to p.o., but he was unable to be weaned off of his dobutamine.
He began his Lasix at 20 mg b.i.d., and his diet was advanced as tolerated.
On postoperative day two he was tolerating p.o., making good urine, and his Foley catheter was removed.
Captopril was increased to 50 mg t.i.d.
Attempts were made to wean off his dobutamine, but his index required him to continue with this.
His Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
The dobutamine was discontinued, and the heparin was weaned as he began taking his Coumadin.
On postoperative day five, his epicardial wires were removed.
with adequate oxygen saturation on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
His Lopressor was decreased to 12.5 mg b.i.d., and his Coumadin was at 2 mg with an INR of 2.4.
He failed a voiding trial, and his Foley needed to be reinserted.

Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
