Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead projects over the expected course to the floor of the right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, DM2, HTN, COPD on home O2, and schizophrenia s/p fall, admitted to the MICU w/ and somnolence.
Hypoxia/respiratory distress: This was thought to be copd exacerbation (The patient is on 4L O2 NC at home at rest.)
She ruled out for an MI and interrogation of ICD showed no SVT or VT.  She was treated with a five daz course of azithromycin and a prednisone taper.
She had a nasal congestion which originally may have been secondary to her URI but was exacerbated by her self medication with Afrin nasal spray even after her medication was discontinued.
She developed these episodes of desaturation to 68% while on her nasal Bipap mask which was thought to be secondary to a central sleep apnea along with some question of her not being able to tolerate the nasal bipap mask secondary to her nasal congestion.
When she desated her O2 sats were restored by placing the patient on a 24% Venturi mask and 6L of O2.
She was seen by pulmonary who recommended incresaing her nocturnal bipap for obstructive sleep apnea to 14/12 (from 14/8) and continuation of progresterone for respiratory stimulation.
She was continued on bipap as above (and encouraged to use it during the day as well as she is suspected of having OSA during day time during naps).
She was also diuresed with IV lasix with good effect.
She was also continued on standing albuterol and atrovent nebulizers.
She was continued on ASA 325mg daily, lipitor and toprol XL.
CHF: She has CHF with an EF 40% secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
She was continued on an ACEI for afterload reduction.
She was started on iron supplementation.
We suspected that her unsteadiness might have been secondary to visual problems in dark - pinpoint pupils from psych meds preventing accomodation.
She was initially started on ceftriaxone while in the ICU and upon discharge to the floor her repeat U/A was negative and the ceftriaxone was discontinued.
DM type 2: Her glyburide was increased to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] and she was started metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] .
HTN: Her blood pressure was well controlled on her outpatient dose of Toprol XL.
