Interval placement of a right chest tube with interval decrease in size of right pneumothorax, now small, and with decreased shift of the mediastinum.
Multiple pelvic fractures including right superior and inferior pubic rami with extension into the right acetabulum and a right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture.
Due to his rib fractures and uncontrolled pain, he had a paravertebral block placed for pain control which also helped his pain from a right chest tube placement for pneumothorax.
Subsequently a continuous infusion of ropivacaine was used through the paravertebral catheter which effectively controlled his pain.
He was transfused with a total of 4 units of packed RBC's during his hospitalization.
He was placed on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis as well.
His aspirin and Plavix were then resumed.
His chest tube was removed on [**2175-10-14**] and a post pull film showed no pneumothorax or effusion.
His oxygen was weaned off easily and he was able to participate in limited physical therapy due to his injuries.
Following removal of his paravertebral catheter his pain was controlled with Oxycodone effectively.
He continued to work with Physical Therapy and was able to stand and pivot from bed to chair with 1 assist.
