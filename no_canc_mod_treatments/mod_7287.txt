CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2101-12-11**] 4:54 AM The tip of the ET tube is in satisfactory position approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.
An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying stomach.
Was initially treated for sepsis and empirically on Levaquin for posssible sepsis, however no evidence of sepsis.
Psychiatry was consulted, as he was on so many baseline psychotropic medications.
Seratonin syndrome was suspected in the setting of an elevated fluoxetine dose interacting with other medications, and all serotonergic medications were discontinued, including fluoxetine, buspirone, asacol and hysocamine.
This required ICU transfer and patient was intubated for airway protection.
He also received an initial dose of cyproheptadine, which did not impressively change his mental status.
Significant number of red cells seen (likely traumatic), but patient empirically placed on Acyclovir for possible HSV meningoencephalitis.
He was ultimately restarted on diazepam and risperdal.
This improved with hydration and was back to baseline level on discharge.
Hct was as low as 28, however patient received significant IV fluid for decreased bp.
Depression/Anxiety/Mild mental retardation:  See above regarding medication changes.
Crohn's:  home medications were held.
These medications can be restarted as an outpatient.
LFTs should be monitored as an outpatient and lipitor can be restarted if LFT remain normal.
Metoprolol was held.
It was discussed with him at length that manual compressions alone would rarely be effective without the other aspects of CPR eg shocks, mechanical ventilation etc.
Per her, the patient has mental retardation and will need further detailed neuropsych assessment to determine if the patient has capacity to make his medical decisions.
Upon my discussion with patient today, he had minimal recollection of the events during the hospitalization and could not tell me details about his hospital stay except that he had "hypothermia".
The patient will need formal capacity testing to determine if he can understand and make his own decisions about medical care and code status.

You subsequently had a change in your mental status, likely from an interaction of your medications (serotonin syndrome).
You subsequently were placed on a medication, Acyclovir that resulted in worsening of your kidney function.
Since your spinal fluid test for HSV was negative, this medication was stopped.
Due to the reaction you had that caused the change in your mental status, many of your psychiatric medications (Fluoxetine, buspar, and lamictal) were held and your Crohn's disease medications (hycosamine and mesalamine) were stopped as well.
Your Lipitor was held because there was an elevation in your liver enzymes.
Your Metoprolol was held due to low blood pressures.
