Esophogram: Very limited examination as described above.
Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling as noted on prior studies.
A catheter is seen in the right atrium.
[**2118-9-1**] MR C/T Spine: Post-surgical changes from level C5 through T1, with prevertebral soft tissue swelling along cervical spine, and anterior dural enhancement from C5 through T1 with no definite evidence of epidural abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year-old M with no significant PMHx who presented to an outside hospital with posterior neck and shoulder pain, was found to have prevertebral and ventral epidural abscesses of the C-spine and transferred here for management .
# Prevertebral/Epidural abscesses: The patient was found to have ventral epidural, prevertebral, and bilateral longus coli abscesses.
At first, it was believed that the patient could be treated medically with antibiotics and supportive care.
He was started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics that were narrowed once blood culture data returned (see below re: bacteremia).
There he also had C6-C7 anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion with allograft placement and plating.
Post-operatively the patient was continued on intravenous antibiotics and given aggressive fluid hydration.
Thoracic Surgery was consulted out of concern for mediastinal involvement.
He underwent a second surgical procedure by Neurosurgery in which he had re-evacuation of the abscesses, removal of the prior hardware, full corpectomy of C6/C7 with adjacent diskectomy C5-C6 and C7-T1, microscopic evacuation of epidural abscess, and placement of a Globus cage and anterior plating.
His blood cultures from the outside hospital and on presentation to our facility grew coag + staph aureus, for which he was started on intravenous vancomycin and nafcillin.
He underwent a number of antibiotic changes throughout his hospital course, but importantly, nafcillin was discontinued secondary to a drug rash.
The patient was continued on intravenous vancomycin, which he will receive at home via PICC for at least 6 weeks from his last surgical debridement.
The PICC was removed and the patient was started on a heparin gtt, without bolus, to treat the DVT.
His INR was theraputic for 24 hours prior to discontinuation of the heparin gtt and discharge from the hospital.
His course of coumadin will be at least 3 months and he will follow up at the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Company 191**].
His hepatitis and HIV serologies were negative.
# Dysphagia: The patient experienced dysphagia on presentation and after his surgical procedures.
Speech was consulted and the patient had a video swallowing study, which showed laryngeal penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids but no aspiration.
# Voice Hoarseness: Following the second surgical procedure the patient had evidence of voice hoarsenss, which slowly improved.
He will follow up with ENT a few weeks after discharge to evaluate for vocal cord damage, should his symptoms not resolve.
# Social Work, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy were consulted during his hospital admission.
He will be discharged with home services for intravenous medication administration and continued occupational therapy to regain strength and dexterity of his upper extremities.

You were recently transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] for management of an abscess (collection of infection) near your spine.
We have treated you with intravenous antibiotics and you improved.
You will need to continue these antibiotics at least until [**10-7**] and follow up with the Infectious Disease specialists, who will decide whether to continue antibiotics after that.
You were placed on a blood thinner to help the clot dissolve.
You will need to have frequent lab work to monitor your INR to adjust your Coumadin dose as needed.
The following changes were made to your home medications: - Intravenous (IV) Vancomycin 1250 mg was STARTED, to be taken every 8 hours (course length to be determined by the Infectious Disease specialists) - Coumadin was STARTED, to be taken every day for at least 3 months.
- Flexaril (cyclobenzaprine) was STARTED, to be taken as needed for muscle pain - Oxycodone was STARTED at 5-10 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
You will need to call the neurosurgery office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] to make an apptointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in for 1-2 weeks for a clinic appointment as well as a Cervical Spine CT, non-contrast.
