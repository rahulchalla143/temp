Admission Date:  [**2163-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Gluten / Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1646**] Chief Complaint: Fever and diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible sigmoidoscopy PICC line placement and removal Tunneled Line Placement ERCP [**2164-1-9**]   History of Present Illness: 85 year old man with history of refractory celiac disease, hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, cystic pancreatic lesions, and osteoporosis who presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and lethargy.
An ERCP during this admission showed a small stone and sludge was extracted and a stent was placed.
The plan was for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an elective outpatint cholecystectomy in [**2-4**] months and for repeat ERCP in [**5-8**] wks for stent removal, balloon sweep, and pancreatic duct evaluation.
Of note he finished a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin on [**2163-12-8**].
Per the pt's report he was started on flagyl at rehab which was discontinued due to increased liver enzymes.
The pt was given IV Flagyl, Vanco, and Zosyn as well as PO Vanco.
Surgery did not see a need for surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - Refractory Celiac Disease; currently getting TPN four nights a week, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] fib-diagnosed in [**11-10**] -occipital embolic CVA in [**12-11**] while off AC -?lymphoma per prox ileal bx in [**2158**] -Gallstone pancreatitis s/p recent ERCP and stent placement -small bowel resection for SBO ([**2148**]) -ulcerative ileojejunitis ([**2150**]) & LOA in [**2158**] for SBO - Severe hypertension - Iron deficiency anemia - RLL pulmonary embolism - incidental finding after a CT scan was performed for evaluation of possible pancreatic mass.
On coumadin x six to seven months, stopped recently.
[**1-26**] TSH 1.4 HIV neg RPR NR .
[**1-24**] c-diff neg [**1-25**] c-diff neg stool O&P neg X2 stool cx neg, including crypto/micro/cyclo [**1-23**] cath tip cx neg All blood cx neg to date .
This area could not be appreciated on the most recent prior study due to lack of intravenous contrast.
Immunostain for CMV is negative for viral inclusions, with satisfactory controls.
Evidence of a previous biliary sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand wire guided technique.
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully extended in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
One stone and sludge/debris was extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.
Based on the clinical presentation, recent Abx course, there was a high suspicion of C. diff colitis, although other etiologies such as other infectious etilogies, ischemic colitis given atrial fibrillation, cholangitis, refractory celiac disease were considered.
The patient was pan-cultured and started on antibiotic regimen including PO Vanco, Flagyl, and Zosyn.
Aggressive fluid resuscitation was given.
C. diff toxins were negative x 4 and PO Vancomycin was discontinued on [**12-18**].
The patient was seen by GI service, who recommended continuing Abx treatment with IV Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl and contacting ERCP to discuss follow-up of the biliary stent placed on [**11-22**].
The ID team was consulted to discontinue Zosyn given that his picture was consistent with colitis.
He was empirically changed to PO vancomycin for concern of severe C diff and started on ganciclovir for empiric CMV coverage.
Though all C diff and CMV studies have returned negative, a decision was made with GI and ID teams' input to continue both oral vanco and ganciclovir treatment, though Vancomycin PO was d/c'd on [**1-2**] as cdiff was negative X6.
With the completely negative infectious results, there was also some strong concern that this event may have been ischemic colitis as the patint also has evidence of embolic infarcts in his brain and has atrial fibrillation, so the decision was made to restart the patient on coumadin with a heparin bridge.
He was started on IV PPI and changed back to home medication on [**1-2**].
A repeat Flex sig [**2164-1-19**] showed good healing of the colonic lesions so anticoagulation was restarted.
He was started on loperamide for symptomatic improvement which worked well and should be titrated to [**3-8**] BM's per day.
At the time of discharge the patient had been receiving loperamide and was down to 1-2 BM per day, but was having some increasing abd distention.
IV Vanco started and PICC line discontinued [**2163-12-19**] for suspicion that it was the source of the infection.
He had a new PICC line placed on the right UE on [**12-22**].
PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth.
He received a total of 4 weeks of Vancomycin per the ID team, and completed this on [**1-17**].
His discharge was held for a day b/c of a clogged line which cleared with TPA held in the line for 2 hours then drawn out.
Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time on [**12-30**].
The ID recommended discontinuing ciprofloxacin [**1-3**] since the enterbacter had cleared and did NOT want to treat the enterococcus (VRE), since this is likely now a colonizer (UA was negative).
Due to the ongoing need for PICC line for TPN as well as other indications for anticoagulation (Afib with hx embolic strokes), heparin gtt was entertained, but was not started given his falling Hct and guaiac positive stools.
* Acute on chronic kidney disease (Stage II): On admission, creatinine was noted to be 3.8 up from baseline of 0.6.
* Supratherapeutic INR on admission - Secondary to both coumadin and poor PO intake.
Vitamin K given in ICU and coumadin/ASA was held given diarrhea and guaiac positive stools.
The patient received additional IV Vitamin K as INR on the day of callout was 4.5.
There is strong indication for re-anticoagulation to be initiated at lower dose and carefully monitored.
Anticoag held until repeat Flex Sig was done [**2164-1-19**], and tunnel line placed [**2164-1-20**] then restarted.
His goal INR should be [**3-7**] with ideal range 2-2.5 given his high bleeding risk.
* Atrial fibrillation with hx embolic strokes: On admission, his ASA and coumadin were held.
He was restarted on coumadin at [**Hospital1 **] at 5mg QHS but had supratherapeutic INRT.
On admission, ASA and coumadin were both held.
He was started on Diltiazem on [**1-1**] then changed to his home metoprolol on [**1-2**].
As above, coumadin restarted [**2164-1-20**] and INR should be check frequently.
would no restart aspirin at this time.
Of note, pt had  biliary stent placed [**2163-11-23**] and after further discussion with ERCP was removed.
* Celiac disease: Has refractory disease and had been on TPN for the past 4 years per his outpatient GI attending.
The patient will require that all medications be confirmed with the manufacturing company that they are gluten free before he will agree to take them.
* Benign hypertension:  Some of his BP medications were held in the setting of septicemia picture in the ICU.
The calcium channel blocker and ACEI was no longer needed.
* History of PE:  S/p course of coumadin in past, but now back on anyway for AFib reasons and h/o embolic phenomenon.
* Anxiety disorder:  stable  Medications on Admission: metoprolol 100 mg po bid captopril 50 mg po tid felodipin 5 mg daily levothyroxine 125 mg po daily coumadin ?dose ondansetron 4 mg IV q6h prn omeprazole 20 mg po daily vitamin E 800 units daily vitamin A B12 1000 mcg daily vit D2 50,000 units Mon/Thurs citracal +D  315-200 units [**Hospital1 **] aspirin 81 mg daily albuterol 1-2 puffs q6h prn folic acid 1 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
