The [**Hospital 228**] medical management included aspirin, Plavix, simvastatin, metoprolol and ezetimibe.
She will be on Plavix for the rest of her life.
Do not stop Plavix without first speaking to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
Although cardiac catheterization showed high filling pressures, she has appeared euvolemic with no signs of fluid overload and has not required standing diuretics.
she should have daily weights and close monitoring of her fluid status.
She is on very low dose metoprolol for MI prevention  but this can be discontinued if HR cont to be an issue.
Decision made to treat with ASA and Plavix only given hx of falls and likelihood that EF will increase in the long term.
She will need to have stress dose steriods for any medical procedures.
# DM: The patient was kept on an insulin sliding scale.
Her blood sugars were quite high with stress dose steriods but are now normalizing on a slightly decreased lantus dose.
# Depression: Continued home escitalopram.
Given that she was intubated on multiple occasions, however, she instead received IV levothyroxine at the same approximate dose for several days, now back on PO dosing.
# Hypertension: SBP was somewhat low so her Imdur and Norvasc was not restarted and her Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg daily.
# Dyslipidemia: Continued home dosing of simvastatin and ezetimibe.
# Neuropathy: Continue neurontin but dose [**Month (only) **] to 300 mg daily.
Vicodin was restarted at discharge at home dose per family.
# Delerium: Noted after extubation and thought to be related to sedation, ICU stay and UTI.
Would recommend freq reorientation, avoidance of benzos (tiny home dose of Aprazolam d/c'ed) and night time interruptions.
