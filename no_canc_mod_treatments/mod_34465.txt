The patient tolerated this procedure well, however pain management for this patient was a challenge and the acute pain service was consulted.
The patient's pain was managed with PCA narcotics as well as an epidural.
The patient ambulated the [**Hospital1 **] postoperatively and pain was controlled on PO medications after discontinuing the epidural and PCA however return of bowel function was prolonged.
On POD 4 after her colostomy takedown, the patient was noted to be tachycardic to the 160's on a VS check.
She received multiple doses of IV metoprolol with transient improvement in HR to 80s and drop in BP to 108.
She then received IV diltiazem with HR improvement to the 80s and SBP to the 120s.
During her ICU course, her regimen of PO diltiazem was adjusted.
She was also started on PO metoprolol.
Initially, when given PO metoprolol and PO diltiazem, ECG showed atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction.
Doses were adjusted, and she eventually converted to sinus rhythm.
She was started on aspirin while she was in the ICU.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin was also discussed and should be further addressed by the patient's PCP.
The patient did not have any recurrence of rapid atrial fibrillation and remained rate controled on the regimen of Dilitiazem and Lopressor.
The patient was started on an aggressive bowel regimen and was able to have a bowel movement prior to discharge.
The patient should continue therapy with anal dilation device after discharge.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient during her inpatient stay and recommended a rehabilitation facility to increase the patient's strength and maintain safety.
