She also had some bradycardia and hypertension along with transient high-grade heartblock.
Her ST segment elevation resolved and the patient was painfree and kept on intravenous heparin.
She was emergently given fresh frozen plasma and Protamine for heparin reversal.
Neurosurgery was consulted and placed a ventriculostomy with drainage tube to monitor her intracranial pressure.
Intracranial pressure was monitored and on [**9-19**] with the intracranial pressure 1315, the ventriculoscopy drain was removed.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:  Nitroglycerin drip at 20 mcg; Lopressor 5 mg intravenously q.
12 hours; Enalapril 1.25 mg q.
6 hours; Protonix 40 mg intravenously q. day; Ancef 1 gm q.
8 hours; Zocor 20 mg q. day  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 100.6, blood pressure 193/99, pulse 88, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 100% on FIO2 of 30%.
Endotracheal tube in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment and plan - A 71 year old Vietnamese female with inferior myocardial infarction who received thrombolytic therapy at an outside hospital and then presented with an intracranial hemorrhage with bleeding into the ventricles, now comatose.
Transferred from outside hospital for critical care management.
Intracranial hemorrhage - The patient with intracranial hemorrhage following thrombolytic therapy.
The patient seen by Neurosurgery and is status post ventriculostomy drain placement at outside hospital.
The ventriculostomy tube was removed prior to transfer given normal intracranial pressure.
Inferior myocardial infarction - The patient originally presented to the outside hospital on [**9-14**] with inferior myocardial infarction and she was started on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and statin at the outside hospital along with a Nitroglycerin drip.
Upon admission at [**Hospital6 649**] she was weaned off of the Nitroglycerin drip and was transitioned over from intravenous to p.o.
She was started on Metoprolol, Captopril and continued on Simvastatin.
She was not given aspirin or any other anticoagulation in the setting of her acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Fever/meningitis - The patient presented following low-grade temperatures at the outside hospital where she was on Ancef.
Initially antibiotic treatment was held as the patient had no clear source of infection.
The patient continued to spike temperatures and was started on antibiotic therapy on [**9-22**].
She was initially started on Ciprofloxacin and Ceftioxide for her nosocomium infection.
She continued to spike on this regimen and suspicion grew for a possible meningitis or other intracranial infectious process, particularly given her recent proceduration.
The patient was placed on a higher dose of Ceptaz that would cover firm meningeal infection and Vancomycin was also added.
The plan was to continue high dose antibiotics of Ceptaz and Vancomycin for ten days, intravenously.
She was quickly switched over to pressor support and weaned down on pressor support.
Anemia - Hematocrit was low on admission, thought to be due to intracranial hemorrhage, although baseline hematocrit was unknown.
An orogastric tube was placed and confirmed.
She was then started on tube feeds which were quickly advanced up to a goal of 50 cc/hr of Promote with fiber which was well tolerated.
Groins - The patient was admitted from the outside hospital with a right groin triple lumen catheter and arterial lines.
She had peripheral intravenous lines placed and then on [**9-25**], a PICC line was inserted into the left arm to provide longterm intravenous access.
She also was kept on Venodynes for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
No subcutaneous heparin was given in the setting of her acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Metoprolol 75 mg per nasogastric tube t.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 120 or heartrate less than 55.
Ceftazidime 2 gm intravenously q.
Vancomycin 1 gm intravenously q.
Nystatin oral suspension, 5 ml p.o.
Captopril 25 mg p.o.
Hydralazine 10 mg intravenously q.
Lansoprazole oral suspension 30 mg per nasogastric tube q. day 8.
Simvastatin 10 mg per nasogastric tube q. day  FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Follow up with primary care doctor within one week.
Take all medications as directed.
