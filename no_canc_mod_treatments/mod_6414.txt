Echocardiogram, large fibrinous pericardial effusion, thickened pericardium 2 to 2.5 cm in diameter, lateral/apical with 1 cm.
Two chest tubes were placed.
PATHOLOGY RESULTS:  The patient had 2 specimens sent to pathology from his procedure on [**2150-7-15**].
One included mediastinal cyst walls as well as pericardium.
Mediastinal cyst wall was interpreted as fragments of detached highly atypical keratinizing squamous epithelium and also a foreign body giant cell reaction.
Pericardium fibroadipose tissue with local fibrin deposition and reactive mesothelial reaction.
The patient was taken to the operative room on [**2150-7-23**] for a left video-assisted wedge resection, a biopsy and lysis of adhesions as well as an insertion of a chest tube and bronchoscopy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with 50 cc of blood loss.
Once back on the floor, the patient was noted to have a persistent air leak and as his medical, oncological, and vascular issues stabilized and the only remaining problem remained his chest tube, he was transferred to the Thoracic service where we followed him almost exclusively for the management of his persistent air leak.
During this period, the discharge from his chest tube diminished such that on [**2150-8-4**], his chest tube put a 120 cc of fluid.
Physical Therapy evaluation was that the patient continue physical therapy 2 to 4 times a week and that he ambulate 3 to 4 times a day with assistance.
