SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old male with end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension who presented on [**2146-7-23**] for a cadaveric renal transplant.
The patient was placed on a dopamine drip running between 2 mcg/kg and 5 mcg/kg per minute with minimal resolution of hypotension and anuria/oliguria.
The patient was eventually weaned off both the Neo-Synephrine and dopamine.
The patient was started on thymoglobulin, CellCept, Solu-Medrol, and the usual prophylaxis with Bactrim and Valcyte.
The patient remained in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit during dialysis for closer monitoring given his cardiac enzymes which were sent.
The patient was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day as well as aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient's urine output was carefully monitored as well as his electrolytes.
The patient was requiring 2 liters to 3 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula daily to maintain saturations in the 90s.
We sent the patient home on Lasix 60 mg by mouth twice per day.
Given his saturation of 72% on room air with ambulation, the patient was discharged with oxygen as well as pulse oximetry with teaching provided by Respiratory Therapy.
This antibiotic was discontinued by the time of discharge, and his chest x-ray showed marked improvement.
The patient received five doses of thymoglobulin as well as a Solu-Medrol taper.
He was discharged on tacrolimus at a dose of 6 mg by mouth twice per day and CellCept [**Pager number **] mg by mouth twice per day.
To improve his pulmonary condition, chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet were provided.
The patient's urine output continued to improve, and he did not require any further dialysis.
On postoperative day six, the patient was thought to be stable for discharge with home oxygen and pulse oximetry.
Status post cadaveric renal transplant; delayed graft function with marked improvement by the time of discharge.
