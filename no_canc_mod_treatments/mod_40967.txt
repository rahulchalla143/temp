NG tube in proper position within the stomach.
-KUB ([**2101-1-29**]) - The NG tube tip is coiled at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be further advanced.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease s/p inferior myocardial infarction, infarct-related cardiomyopathy with LVEF 25-30% and [**Company 1543**] ICD implantation in [**2096**] for primary prevention who presents to the emergency department with non-specific symptoms found to have intermittent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with appropriate ICD shock.
# Ventricular tachycardia - After ICD interrogation, it was found that he had many episodes of NSVT, some of which required antitachycardia pacing and eventually shocks.
He was initially started on a lidocaine drip in an attempt to suppress the VT.
He subsequently underwent a VT ablation.
They were unable to induct any VT during the procedure but a substrate ablation was performed in the area of scar from his prior MI.
Antiarrhythmics were held after the procedure, he was only continued on metoprolol.
He was started on warfarin at discharghe.
For bridging, he was initially on a heparin gtt which was transitioned to Lovenox 100mg sc q12h, which he will continue until his INR is therapeutic.
# Nausea/vomiting - At presentation, he had some mild nausea, some of which was attributed to the lidocaine drip which was started at admission.
This was presumed to be a post-anesthesia ileus, he had a similar reaction after his AAA repair which required decompression with an NGT.
The tube was removed after 48 hours when his KUB showed resolving gastric dilation.
He was continued on aspirin and his beta blocker was changed from atenolol to metoprolol.
# Hyperlipidemia - Continued on home dose of atorvastatin .
#Transitional issues - Will continue on Lovenox 100mg sc q12h until INR is therapeutic - Started on coumadin with subtherapeutic INR at discharge, will have INR checked on Tuesday [**2101-2-1**] - Atenolol was changed to metoprolol during this admission - Should follow-up with the device clinic after discharge, will need to call for the appointment as he was discharged on a weekend.
