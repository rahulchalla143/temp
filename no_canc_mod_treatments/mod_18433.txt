Type 1 endoleak with infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 46 x 39 mm, previously 37 x 34 mm as described above.
He underwent a Left open aortofemoral limb thrombectomy with abdominal aortogram, left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomies, bilateral aortoiliac Endograft, left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
