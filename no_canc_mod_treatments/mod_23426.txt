Her neuro status improved and she tolerated extubation on [**6-8**].
She was following commands and had full and equal strength.
She was ultimately weaned from this requirement  and was transferred to neuro stepdown.

The drain was opened for a couple days then second trial was tolerated.
The drain was discontinued on [**6-19**], with repeat head CT stable.
