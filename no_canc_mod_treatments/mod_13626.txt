PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mother has a history of depression and a suicide attempt in [**2142**], with a Tylenol overdose.
She also has been treated for her depression throughout the pregnancy with Zoloft 50 mg daily.
The mother was treated with betamethasone 48 hours prior to delivery.
ABDOMEN - was remarkable for initially being taut and distended.
DELIVERY AND NEONATAL COURSE:  Delivery was prompted by worsening fetal ascites and some spontaneous fetal heart rate decelerations.
Delivery was by cesarean section with epidural anesthesia.
Intubation was attempted with 3.0, then 2.5, then 2.0.
However, there was obstruction to passage of the endotracheal tube beyond approximately 1 cm.
Bag and mask ventilation were continued, with placement of a UVC and treatment with epinephrine, ultimately 4 doses, and a volume of 20 ml/kg of normal saline and 4 mEq of sodium bicarbonate.
The baby was then intubated with an 8.0 suction catheter successfully and bag and mask ventilation was initiated with good improvement of heart rate and auscultation of breath sounds.
Two attempts at abdominal paracentesis were made without removal of any fluid in the delivery room.
Further attempts to intubate with a 2.5 tube were unsuccessful by ORL.
A 2.0 tube was then ultimately successfully placed.
Venous blood gas in the delivery room prior to intubation with a 2.0 tube was 6.92, 200 and 52.
Abdominal paracentesis was performed on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and approximately 50 ml of serosanguineous fluid were removed.
Maternal viral studies were sent on [**Hospital3 2974**] night - CMV, parvovirus and toxoplasmosis.
UVC, UAC and endotracheal tube were in good position.
Plan is for an abdominal, cranial ultrasound and echocardiogram in the next day.
