Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 70202**] was admitted on [**2113-2-13**] for an elective Right common iliac to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6-mm PTFE graft and reimplantation of inferior mesenteric artery into infrarenal abdominal aorta.Pre-operatively, she was consented, prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the PACU for further stabilization and monitoring.
While in the SICU she recieved aggressive pulmonary toilet.
She progressed with physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility.

Intestinal ischemia can cause pain and make it difficult for your intestines to do their job.
Undetected and untreated, intestinal ischemia may be fatal.
Depending on the cause of your intestinal ischemia, treatment options may include medications, surgery or a procedure to open your arteries.
Most of the time, acute intestinal ischemia is due to a blood clot that forms in your heart and then travels to one of your intestinal arteries.
If damage is severe enough, infection and gangrene may result.
If untreated for long, intestinal ischemia can be fatal.
What causes diminished blood flow to the colon isn't always clear, but a number of conditions can make you more vulnerable to colon ischemia:  Atherosclerosis:  Dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) associated with congestive heart failure, major surgery, trauma, shock or life-threatening infection in your bloodstream (sepsis)  A blood clot in an artery supplying the colon  Bowel obstruction caused by a strangulated hernia, scar tissue or a tumor  Heart, blood vessel, intestinal or gynecologic operations  Other medical disorders that affect your blood, such as inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis), lupus or sickle cell anemia Some medications, especially those that constrict blood vessels, such as some heart, migraine or hormone medications  Cocaine or methamphetamine use  Vigorous exercise such as long-distance running  Acute mesenteric ischemia:  This type of intestinal ischemia usually affects the small intestine.
Ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis  Occasionally, a blood clot will develop in a vein draining deoxygenated blood away from your intestines.
Blockage of the vein causes intestinal congestion, swelling and bleeding.
These factors include:  Age (older than 50) High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes Elevated levels of blood lipids or fats Smoking Your risk is also higher if you have a history of atherosclerosis that affects blood flow in other areas of your body, such as your heart (coronary artery disease), legs (peripheral vascular disease) or the arteries serving your brain (cerebrovascular disease).
Risk factors for ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis include extended bed rest, obesity, certain types of cancer, birth control pills, smoking, and a history of high blood pressure or heart disease.
A delay in treatment may make successful treatment more difficult.
