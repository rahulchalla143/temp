ABNORMALITY #2: Intermittent brief bursts of moderate amplitude mixed theta and delta frequency slowing were noted in a generalized distribution.
HISTORY: 52-year-old female with a complicated course following ORIF for ankle/fibular fracture.
Under continuous videofluoroscopy, barium in various consistencies was administered orally to the patient.
One abrupt episode of aspiration was identified with thin liquid sipped from a straw.
Aspiration with thin liquids with the head upright.
Moderate-to-severe reduction in bolus formation and control.
Brief Hospital Course: 52F h/o hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for R ankle ORIF, post op course c/b ARDS [**1-13**] influenza requiring intubation and trach/PEG.
Pt had been difficult to oxygenate, s/p paralysis & switch to APRV mode.
Decision made to switch from fent/midaz to propofol [**1-13**] large dosing requirements and unsatisfactory levels of sedation.
Pt was extubated without incident, and received a tracheostomy as well as PEG.
She has been off of the ventilator for over one week prior to discharge and tolerating PMV as well.
# ID: During her ICU course she had an period of hypotension requiring pressors and findings of dilated colon.
C difficile workup was negative, she was thought to have ileus and patient responded to empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
While on levofloxacin and Flagyl she developed fever.
She received a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin on [**3-8**], antibiotics were subsequently held given negative microbiologic workup and she defervesced.
She underwent trach and PEG placement on [**3-8**].
On [**3-13**] she was restarted on Vancomycin and Cefepime in the setting of mild GB wall edema on U/S,  CT of the sinuses was positive for extensive sinus disease, and sputum culture with GPC (eventually reported to be OP flora).
Although her fever curve improved she developed increase in her WBC to > 20 and she received several doses of Flagyl on [**3-15**].
Patient was started on Acyclovir for HSV encephalitis treatment and subsequently HSV PCR came back negative and acyclovir was disontinued.
The patient completed an empiric course of cefepime and vancomycin for meningitis in setting of instrumentation (had VP shunt).
Flagyl discontinued after multiple negative c.diff a and b toxins negative.
All were trending down or back to normal at time of discharge  # SVT with aberrancy: Pt had recurrent SVT with aberrancy, and was loaded with amiodarone and metoprolol.
Rate control was later changed to flecainide and metoprolol with good effect.
EP was consulted on [**3-9**] and recommended continuing flecainide x 1 month and following up with them in late [**Month (only) 6111**].
She was maintained on pneumoboots instead of heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and was also given amicar for the LP and VP shunt taps.
She will need repeat ORIF for fracture re-alignment in the near future.
She was evaluated by neurology who recommended a repeat EEG and MRI head/spine.
On day of discharge she was oriented x 3, she continues to have waxing [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status with some episodes of paranoia and anxiety attributed to ICU delerium which continue to resolve as pt recovers.
Oxygenating well on trach mask.
