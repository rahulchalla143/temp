Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placed in left circumflex.
Intraaortic balloon pump Swan-Ganz catheter  History of Present Illness:   Mr [**Known lastname 45820**] is a 52-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with STEMI, [**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**], cath.
He described sub-sternal chest pain, weakness and nausea.
He was given aspirin 162 for a total of 324 mg, plavix 600 mg, SLN x 2, lidocaine 100 mg IV, 50 mcg fentanyl, heparin bolus 3600 units IV.
He continued to vomit and likely lost some medication, so another 600 mg of Plavix was given.
He was given Zofran (8 mg) prior to [**Location (un) **] arrival for evacuation to [**Hospital1 18**].
On [**Location (un) 7622**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45820**] [**Last Name (Titles) 43254**] again, was given 100 mcg more of fentanyl with chest pain dropping from [**4-3**] to [**12-4**].
He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] and was taken directly to the cath lab where one bare metal stent was placed in the almost completely occluded proximal left circumflex.
RCA was approximately 50 % stenosed at its narrowest point and branches of the left anterior descending, septal perforators and diagonals, were tightly stenosed.
Opening blood pressure was 124 mmHg systolic, but decreased by the end of the procedure to 80s systolic.
Dopamine drip was started and a baloon pump placed.
Given that atrial fibrillation was thought to be new and was likely contributing to hypotension, the patient was further sedated with successful electrical cardioversion.
He received 4.5 L of IV fluids in total.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for (+) chest pain, without dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: inferoposterior STEMI cad chest pain ventricular fibrillation  PROCEDURE: Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure catheter, advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing sheath.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an introducer sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 40cc wire guided catheter, inserted via the right femoral artery.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using placement of bare-metal stent(s).

A 3.0x18mm Vision bare metal stent was then deployed at 16atm.
Post-dilation was performed with 3.25x15mm and 3.5x15mm Quantum Maverick balloons at 21 and 20atm, respectively.

There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 38mmHg on dopamine gtt.
The cardiac index on dopamine was preserved at 3.17 l/min/m2, it declined to 1.58 l/min/m2 when dopamine was weaned off because of continued ventricular ectopy.
Following the placement of the IABP the cardiac index improved to 2.3 l/min/m2.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed sheathed via the right femoral artery, with MAP 77 mmHg on [**11-25**] counterpulsation.
Because of low blood pressure in the presence of rapid atrial  fibrillation, cardioversion to NSR was performed with a single shock of 360 joules after the patient was sedated with the help of a member of the anesthesia department.
Successful placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
Successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.
A bare mental stent was placed in the proximal left circumflex culprit lesion.
The patient will take Plavix and other CAD regimen for one month, allowing for endothelium to appear within stent, before elective CABG, given extensive CAD.
Coronary Artery Disease   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and LCx disease and had a stent placed to the LCx.
He was given integrillin for 18 hrs.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and it was decided to defer this surgery by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within the LCx stent.
The patient was given a dose of prasugrel for rapid onset of purine receptor block, followed by Plavix.
He is being discharged on plavix [**Hospital1 **] for one week then Q day, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and full dose aspirin.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for cardiac surgery and with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**] for cardiology.
Due to low blood pressures, beta-blocker was initially avoided and patient was loaded with amiodarone and started on an amiodarone gtt.
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed to prevent triggering arrhythmias.
The ventricular ectopy decreased, and after discussion with EP, low dose metoprolol was initiated and amidarone was stopped.
He was also briefly on dopamine in the cath.
Supported by diff with minimal bands and evening cortisol of 26 at presentation.
