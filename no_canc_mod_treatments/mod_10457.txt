She was rate controlled with Diltiazem effectively and transferred to ACOVE unit for further medical management.
She was soon after hospitalized for a leg cellulitis.
Unasyn was at that point switched to Zosyn and Levofloxacin was added for concern of hospital acquired pneumonia.
She was also given one dose of Linezolid for sputum growing VRE, although this was subsequently felt to be a contamination and Linezolid was discontinued.
She was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2136-1-20**] and Levofloxacin and Zosyn, but it is unclear if she finished her course of Zosyn at [**Hospital3 2558**] or did not get this medication there.

She has a grade two decubitus on her buttocks.
She had been evaluated and prepared for thoracentesis of her bilateral pleural effusions, which are felt most likely secondary to her congestive heart failure, although also possibilities include a peripneumonia effusion.
A chest x-ray on the floor demonstrated continued bilateral pleural effusions, stable congestive heart failure and worsening left lower lobe infiltrate.
She was administered 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with urine output of 1200 cc.
With respiratory therapy given some chest physical therapy, some increased cough, nebulizer treatment and with the diuresis of 1200 cc the patient began to saturate 100% on the 100% nonrebreather, but was still transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for more close monitoring.

We have been unable to receive a sputum sample as the patient is not coughing up anything of substance.
We will also continue day number three of Flagyl for possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
Pleural effusion likely secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (which was in the setting of a pneumonia), right decubitus film initially without significant layers, but will repeat today.
The patient may need thoracentesis to alleviate the large fluid burden on her lungs.
Will continue dressing changes, have started zinc and vitamin C and is having good coverage of potential cellulitis pathogens with her current regimen of Vancomycin and Ceftazidime.
