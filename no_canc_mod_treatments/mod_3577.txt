Patient initially covered with Zosyn, ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
Antibiotics were subsequently discontinued on [**12-15**] per Hepatology recs.
Antibiotics were d/c'ed again on [**12-18**] because of the thought that her tachycardia and hypotension was due to her abdominal pressure, relieved after the paracentesis.
Her fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension returned and antibiotics were restarted [**12-19**].
