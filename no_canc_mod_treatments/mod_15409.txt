HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old male with known coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2131-10-7**] and in [**2132-2-6**], who presented to an outside hospital with 10/10 chest pain with electrocardiogram changes of ST depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5 with T wave inversions.
The patient reportedly continued to have unstable angina despite being on an heparin and nitroglycerin drips.
The patient did recently have a cardiac catheterization and stent in [**Month (only) 404**] but did not undergo operative management at that time secondary to improvement of his symptoms.
The patient is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for management in the Coronary Care Unit setting and possible revascularization procedure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted for management of his unstable angina and coronary artery disease.
The patient was transferred directly the Coronary Care Unit on heparin and nitroglycerin drips.
Revascularization was initially planned for the day of transfer (on [**2132-3-19**]) but because of a recent infusion of Integrilin with Plavix, the decision was made to delay the surgery until [**3-21**].
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and without events until his surgery was performed on [**2132-3-21**].
At that time, the patient was to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, diagonal, and descending right coronary artery.
The patient also had a 28-mm mitral ring placed for his failing mitral valve.
He remained AV paced in the 90s with an underlying rhythm in the 50s.
His floor stay was unremarkable, and the patient continued to work with Physical Therapy in order to regain his strength.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Ultimately, the patient was discharged to home on postoperative day five; tolerating a regular diet, in adequate pain control on oral pain medications, and having no further anginal symptoms.
