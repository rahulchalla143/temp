Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's dementia who presented to the ED with altered mental status and hypotension, found to have a leukocytosis, positive UA, hypernatremia to 171, and ARF.
At the MICU, she was started on vancomycin and cefepime while awaiting urine culture results.
She was also on levophed to maintain MAP > 65.
With treatment of her infection and with IVFs (see below), she was able to be weaned off the pressor and was transferred to the medical floor.

She was continued on memantine and mirtazapine.

She continued to spike low grade fevers, so was transitioned back to cefepime and ultimately transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day total course on [**2176-10-17**].
She is on ciprofloxacin for UTI (above) and will complete course on [**10-17**].
