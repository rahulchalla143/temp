Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo female with h/o bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
Respiratory cultures grew out pansensitive MSSA, and initial broad coverage with vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin pared down to zosyn and then to nafcillin.
# Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled per PCP records with concern in past that pt may have been abusing medications for weight control.
She last filled her prescription for armourthyroid in [**12-12**] per her pharmacy.
Given synthroid with loading dose of 300, then 75mcg IV daily.
Utox positive for methadone and benzos; pt did receive narcan at OSH.
Her home psych meds of topiramate and divalproex were restarted, her seroquel, clonazepam, provigil, and zolpidem were initally held pending improvement.
Seroquel and clonazepam subsequently restarted at lower dose per psych recs.
Seroquel was then d/ced as pt's home psychiatrist confirmed pt was no longer on this medication and it appeared to lengthen her QT.
Agitation was treated initially with haldol but because of her improving mental status and lengthening QT, this was changed to occasional prn ativan 0.5mg which had good effect.
Would definitely AVOID haldol and seroquel in the future.
Pt was started on asa 81mg, though cardiology may decide to discontinue.
Placed on bowel rest with OG tube to suction with aspiration of feculant matter.
Resolved after several days with aggressive bowel regimen.
Pt discharged on reglan which pt should be able to discontinue as her hypothyroid resolves.
# FEN/SWALLOW EVAL: Pt initially received tube feeds.
Speech and swallow did a video evaluation which showed some aspiration risk so pt was started on thickened liquids and pureed solids.
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin .

You were also found to have very low thyroid hormone as you had not been taking your thyroid medicine at home.
You were also started on a cream for yeast infection (which you were found to have) and daily aspirin.
We aren't sure what happened right before you came to the hospital, and you can't remember either, but it is possible that you took too much of one of your medicines or perhaps took medicines that had been prescribed for someone else.
It is very important that you take your medicines exactly as prescribed and that you do not take any medicines that were prescribed for anyone but you.
We are going to have you see a cardiologist and are also starting you on a baby aspirin per day.
When you see the cardiologist he or she may want to stop the aspirin or change your medicines.
For now, you should drink thickened liquids and eat pureed solids.
Your rehab will reevaluate your swallowing abilities and hopefully you will be able to eat normal food very soon.
