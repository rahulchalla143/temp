INDICATION: 81-year-old female status post thrombectomy of right femoral- peroneal graft.
FINDINGS: A left-sided PICC with tip projecting over the mid SVC is unchanged compared to the prior examination.
There has been interval removal of a Swan- Ganz catheter, however, right internal jugular venous line is present with tip projecting over right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to dR.[**Doctor Last Name 5695**] Vascular Surgery Service on [**2108-6-8**] for management of her right groin wound infection.
She was immediately placed IV antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl), wound cultures were went, and wet-to-dry dressings were started.
On HD 2, she was transfused 1 unit of PRBC for a decrease in her hct to 24.2.
On HD 3, she was transfused an additional 1 unit PRBC for a hct of 24.9.
She continued to have low grade temperatures and surveillance blood cultures were sent from both her PICC line and a peripheral site.
Her initial admission blood cultures grew multi-resistant pseudomonas and she was placed on tobramycin on HD 4.
With the continued low grade fevers and poitive blood cultures, a CT A/P was performed on HD 5, demonstrating a right groin fluid collection and a thrombus in the fem-fem bypass graft.
A VAC dressing as then applied to the left groin wound infection site.
She was also started on a heparin drip for the thrombosis within her fem-fem bypass graft.
In the ICU, her cultures continued to be positive for pseudomonas and she required desensitization to meropenem per infectious disease consult recommendation.
On HD 7, surveillance blood cultures continued to be sent with blood cultures for HD 8 still positive for pseudomonas.
She was ctoninued on the heparin drip and IV antibiotics.
She underwent an excision of distal portion of left axillobifemoral graft and replacement with interposition left axillary profunda bypass and left axillary to mid cross-femoral bypass with 8-mm PTFE and debridement and closure of left groin wound on [**2108-6-19**].
She had a single JP drain in her left groin which continued to have minimal output and was d/c'd on POD 2.
While in the CSRU, she was found to have a yeast infection and was started on fluconazole in addition to her previous IV antibiotics.
Her blood cultures remained negative beginning on HD 9.
On POD 4, she was restarted on coumadin forher grafts.
The fulconazole was discontinued on POD 6 and the linezolid was discontinued on POD 7.
She was continued on PO vancomycin, meropenem, and tobramycin per infectious deisease recommendations.
A tunneled line was placed by interventional radiology on POD 7 for administration of IV antibiotics and she was deeemed stable for discharge to a rehab facility.
She will continue on the meropenem for a total of 12 weeks, tobramycin for 2 weeks, and PO vancomycin for 2 additional weeks after the meropenem has been discontinued.
