He underwent an ileal resection and was recovering when he developed severe back pain and presented to the outside hospital emergency room.
Upon arrival, he did not have the CT scans with him so we repeated the CT scan, and again the finding was seen in the ascending aorta but I was suspicious that this was not a dissection since the so-called flap was irregular in nature and was very limited and I could not follow it up the aorta as in the case of a usual dissection.
