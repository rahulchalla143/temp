Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Diabetes Mellitus (on U-500 insulin) - recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] for hypoglycemia 3) Diabetic retinopathy 4) Bipolar Disorder 5) Chronic Back Pain 6) Right eye blindness 7) Hyperkalemia from ACE-inhibitor 8) Depression 9) Bilateral cataracts  Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: unmarried, unemployed -Tobacco history:  unknwn -ETOH: -Illicit drugs:  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on admission: GENERAL: Intubated obese caucasian male, sedated wearing C-collar HEENT: small abrasion on R forehead; Anisocoria R>L pupil size NECK: cervical collar in place CARDIAC: very distant heart sound, No apparent m/r/g.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-2**], the tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper clavicular level, approximately 6.8 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube again extends into the stomach.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT Study Date of [**2130-9-3**] FINDINGS: Single view fails to show the uppermost portion of the abdomen and the course of the nasogastric tube.
Deep left subclavian catheter extending into the right atrium, withdrawal by 5 cm to position at the cavoatrial junction is recommended.
There is mild degenerative disease with a bridging osteophyte seen at C3-C4 level.
Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube are seen within the trachea and esophagus respectively.
The left upper lobe is completely collapsed with a low-density material seen in the bronchi (the appearance of "drowned lung").
The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in right lower lobe pulmonary artery and to secure its position in the main pulmonary artery should be pulled back approximately 8 cm.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
The ET tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina.
Evaluation of the patient with bronchoscopy is highly recommended for therapeutic and if necessary diagnostic purposes since the obstruction might be either mucous plug or endobronchial neoplasm (less likely but cannot be entirely excluded).
Slightly too distal position of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over proximal right pulmonary artery.
NG tube is within non-distended stomach, tip out of view.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-9-9**] FINDINGS: There is an OG tube with the tip in the proximal stomach.
There is a left subclavian line with tip in the SVC.
The ET tube is in similar location to prior.
He was intubated, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for cooling s/p cardiac arrest.
He was cooled per Arctic Sun cooling protocol and antiarrhythmic therapy with Amiodarone was used.
Dopamine drip was used for BP support.
Renal status improved and pt was able to come off CVVH for CT of Head, C-spine and Chest.
However, Chest CT showed an obstruction of the left main bronchus, approximately 4.2 cm from the carina by a lesion of low density; the left upper lobe was completely collapsed with a low-density material seen in the bronchi (the appearance of "drowned lung").
Per family, pt was in the habit of biting of the top of insulin pen prior to injection.
It was hypothesized that the patient inhaled and choked on the insulin cap and in the process injected himself with insulin becoming both hypoxic and hypoglycemic, causing the PEA arrest.
DM managed on U-500 insulin and probable cause for hypoglycemia.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendation pt was placed on insulin drip for glucose management and then transitioned to regular ISS.
He was intially started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, then transitioned to Vancomycin and Unasyn due to concern for anaerobic bacteria.
Antibiotics were stopped after cap was removed.
We had trouble weaning him from the ventilator secondary to agitation.
Acute injury possible secondary to poor cardiac forward flow in setting of cardiac arrest.
His urine output was low, creatinine was increasing, K+ was increasing and he did not have much response to NS boluses.
Therefore, CVVH was started and continued for several days.
GU: poor urine output and anatomy restricting use of conventional foley cath.
Likely hypospadias - require small catheter sized for urethral meatus.
GU consult for assistance with foley cath placement.
Bipolar disorder: home divalproex acid initially was held in setting of hypothermia protocol.
Psychiatry recommended small standing PO dose of haldol at night for agitation as well.
The patient improved on the new regimen on long acting depakote and haldol and was much more alert during the daytime and his agitation resolved.
Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Patient may have had mild HITT secondary to heparin as platelets normalized after heparin stopped.

At this time, they needed to shock your heart with a defibrillator to regain your heart beat, put a tube down your throat to help you breathe, and start medications to maintain your blood pressure.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a special treatment called Artic Sun Cooling Protocol, in which we cooled your body temperature to help prevent damage to your brain and heart after cardiac arrest.
You also required dialysis for your kidneys, as they experienced temporary dysfunction during hospitalization.
We performed a procedure called bronchoscopy in which we put a camera down into your lungs, and discovered you had aspirated into your lungs the cap to your insulin vial when you had your cardiac arrest.
The following changes were made to your home medications: - Your metoprolol was replaced with labatolol for high blood pressures - Lisinopril was increased to 10 mg daily - Your insulin was changed to 53 units of Glargine and a humalog sliding scale.
- Aspirin was increased to 325 mg daily - Divalproex was changed to a long acting dose at 10pm - Oxycontin was decreased to 10 mg daily - Amlodipine was added for blood pressure control - Haldol was added to decrease your confusion at night - Calcium carbonate and Pantopriazole were added to treat heartburn type symptoms.
- colace was added to prevent constipation - Tylenol was added to treat your back and chest pain.
- Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued.
We also recommend follow-up with an endocrinologist for management of your high insulin requirements.
Please check your blood sugars when you wake up, before lunch, and before bedtime, and keep a journal for your doctor so that s/he can adjust your insulin adequately to prevent future hypoglycemic episodes.
