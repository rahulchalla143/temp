Hypoxemia secondary to hypersentivity pneumonitis secondary to crack-cocaine exposure 3.
Diabetes, type I uncontrolled with complications 4.
Schizophrenia       Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] presented to the ED with acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and extensive pitting lower extremity edema several days after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for a previous episode of crack-cocaine induced pneumonitis.
Given the degree of his hypoxemia, he had to be placed on NIPPV and was sent to the medical ICU for close monitoring.
His carvedilol was increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and he was aggressively treated with lasix.
He was put on Lasix 40mg po qd and remained euvolemic throughout the remained of his hospital stay on a non fluid restricted diet.
Given the very low suspicion for acute bacterial pneumonia his antibiotics were stopped after one dose.
He was treated with high dose steroids which dramatically improved his breathing.
He was started on a 20 day course of tapered prednisone starting at 60mg x5 days, 40mg x5 day, 20mg x 5 days, and 10mg x 5 days.

He also has a prescription for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 2025**].
