At that time, the patient had a stent placed in the left subclavian artery.
Peripheral vascular disease status post left subclavian stenting.
Status post right salpingectomy.

q.d., Toprol 75 mg p.o.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] and was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**2116-1-28**], for coronary artery bypass grafting times two, with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine and Milrinone infusion.
On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation.
The Milrinone was weaned to off, and the Neo-Synephrine was subsequently weaned off.
Over night, on postoperative day #1, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone and given extra beta-blockers.
A pigtail catheter was inserted with complete resolution of the pneumothorax.
Vascular Surgery continued to follow the patient for her known abdominal aortic aneurysm and recommended obtaining a CTA with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm protocol for evaluation of her abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well arterial ultrasound duplex of her lower extremities to rule out popliteal aneurysm.
On postoperative day #4, the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous Lopressor.
The patient subsequently remained in sinus rhythm without further ectopy on Amiodarone and Lopressor.
On postoperative day #4, the patient ambulated with Physical Therapy and completed Level 4.
