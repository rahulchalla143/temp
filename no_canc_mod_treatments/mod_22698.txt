INTRAOPERATIVE FLUIDS:  4 units of FFP, 1 unit of packed cells.
After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, an infraumbilical incision was made.
A midline laparotomy incision was made.
We dissected through subcutaneous tissues and then lengthened the opening in the fascia to the xiphoid process all the way down to the pubic symphysis.
A GJ tube was then advanced through the anterior abdominal wall, positioned in the stomach.
The jejunal portion of the tube was then advanced through the pylorus into the fourth portion of the duodenum.
The pursestring sutures were tied down.
The tube was everted.
The stomach was then tacked up to the anterior abdominal wall and once this was done, the balloon was inflated and the sutures were tied down.
The disk was secured in place with a series of interrupted 3-0 nylons and a 0 silk suture.
The ileostomy was matured in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] fashion using interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.

He was confused and was started on haldol.
A dobhoff tube was placed as he was high risk for aspiration  as he could not manage his secretions.
He was started on amiodarone and then digoxin and heparin and seen by electrophysiology for atrial fibrillation.
Sputum culture grew GNR/GPC and he was started on zosyn and vanco.
Bronchoscopy after intubation showed large amounts of secretions.
He was started on dopamine.
His dopamine was dc'd, and he was started on levophed.
He was taken to the operating room on [**5-20**] where he underwent a Exploratory laparotomy, intended right colectomy with takedown of hepatic and splenic flexure, cholecystectomy and gastrojejunostomy tube.
His ostomy began functioning and He was started on tube feeds through his GJ tube on [**5-26**].
He underwent tacheostomy on [**5-28**].
He was started on fluconazole for yeast in urine and sputum.
Zosyn was changed to ceftazidime.
He was positive for cdiff and was started on flagyl and PO vanco.
His ventilatory support was slowly weaned.
The superior aspect of his abdominal wound opened and a VAC dressing was placed by the general surgery team.
He was weaned from his pressors and ventilator over the next several days.
On POD 30/22/14 he was started on Ceftriaxone and Vanco for VAP/tracheobronchitis.
