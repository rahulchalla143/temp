She was admitted for a diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis and further work up.
# Sciatica status post back surgery x2   Social History: The patient has currently quit smoking for 2 weeks.
OR THERAPEU  Reason: DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC paracentesis please send cell cou  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with hep B/ETOH cirrhosis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC paracentesis please send cell count and differential, fluid for culture PARACENTESIS ON [**12-29**]  CLINICAL HISTORY: ETOH cirrhosis.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: A full discussion of pertinent risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure was performed, informed consent was obtained.
Using aseptic technique and ultrasound guidance, a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**] centesis catheter was passed through anesthetized tissues in the left flank, to the peritoneal cavity from which approximately 1 liter of clear, straw-colored fluid was removed and sent for the requested labs.
Hemostasis was then obtained, patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate post-procedure complications.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2157-1-1**] 5:41 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for loculation  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with cirrhosis with large ascites, tap with only 1L removed, assess for loculation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for loculation CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: not needed  INDICATION: 52-year-old female with cirrhosis and large ascites with recent 1 liter of fluid removed via paracentesis.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with IV contrast.
An ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed but could only drain 1L.
She was placed on a fluid restriction and her diuretics were held.
In an effort to mobilize her fluid, she was adminstered 50g of albumin daily followed by IV lasix.
She was titrated up to albumin 25g [**Hospital1 **] followed by lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] 30 minutes after giving albumin, and she began to respond with increased urine output, increased sodium, and decreased creatinine.
Her nadolol, lactulose, and midodrine were continued.
The team attempted to aggressively diurese her with albumin cover, and was successful; unfortunately she then went into renal failure, and was oliguric.
HD (ultrafiltration) was attempted in order to take off more fluid but her blood pressures did not tolerate much fluid loss.
Eventually after much discussion with the team, the patient, and the patient's family, we decided to send the patient to the MICU where she could get CVVH and potentially be able to tolerate a greater degree of fluid removal over 24 hour fluid removal cycles.
She did not tolerate the CVVH secondary to hypotension and after further family meetings she was made comfort measures only and transferred back to the medical floor for placement in an inpatient hospice setting.
In terms of pain and discomfort, morphine solution was given with good effect.
Once she was made comfort measures only her labs were no longer obtained.
Given she did not tolerate CVVH she was made comfort measures and was comfortable on time of discharge.
#:Anemia: Patient reported chronic BRBPR since her hemmorrhoid surgery 1 month ago, and she ocntinued with brbpr here.
She received 1 unit prbcs he day of admission, and received 2 units of prbc's a week later.
# Goals of care: the patient became more discouraged during this lengthy admission, and frustrated by the experience of waiting for an uncertain and potentially grim outcome.
She decided to change her code status and a family meeting affirmed her decision to be DNR/DNI in the presence of her children, ex-husband and current partner.
