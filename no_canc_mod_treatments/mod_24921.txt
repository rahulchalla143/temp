History of Present Illness: This is a very nice [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with COPD on 2-4L of oxygen at baseline, presents with SOB.
SHe received albuterol and dounebs, doxycycline 100mg, Rocefin 1gm IV, and solumedrol 125mg.
The patient was given albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
She also got Nitroglcyerin gtt, and 40mg of IV furosemide thinking that the HTN lead to pulmonary edema.
She was placed on bipap briefly but did not tolerate it well.
When the BNP returned at 100, they re-evaluated the pateint and discontinued Bipap and Nitro Gtt thinking that pulm edema was not the etiology.
Baseline artifact in precordial leads.
Ground-glass opacification in bilateral lungs may represent infectious process such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
The differential for increased destruction includes ITP, DIC, TTP, and heparin induced.
Prednisone was continued at 1 mg/kg for one week, after which it was tapered per hematology at a rate of a decrease of 20mg every week.
Patient has been started on vitamin D and calcium for bone health; in addition, she has been started on Inhaled pentamidine once every month for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Patient was treated with prednisone, as above, in addition to levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (course now completed) and standing bronchodilator nebulizers.
She was discharge with 4L NC with 93%sat level.
With respect to pulmonary edema, she was diuresed initially with intravenous Lasix and was quickly switched back to her home dose of 40 mg daily orally.
However, her lasix was stopped prior to discharge given a slight rise in creatitine.
She was not discharged on Lasix but her volume status needs to be monitored.
Ultimately, it was felt that risks of anticoagulation outweighed any benefits especially given negative bilateral LE u/s.
# Hemoptysis: during her hosptial stay, she was noted to have mild occasional hemptysis (streaks and dime sized) dark maroon blood.

You were watched in the Intensive care Unit and you were treated with steroids to increase your platelets and treat your COPD exacerbation.
You remain on 4L of oxygen and have some increased difficulty when walking secondary to shortness of breath.
These issues are thought to be the result of old bleeding that occured while your platelets were low.
Your hematocrit (a measure of your red blood cell level) remained unchanged and even though you had several small episodes of coughing up dark clotted blood, we were not concerned for ongoing bleeding.
Continue on 20 mg even after [**10-10**] until you have discussed the plan with your hematologist.
- Insulin Sliding Scale as noted in the discharge - Heparin (while you are in rehabilitation) - Calcium/ Vit.
