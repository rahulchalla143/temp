Interval decrease in the size of a peripancreatic tissue and air collection, with three drains in appropriate position.
Open wound in the mid upper abdomen, with significant amount of oral contrast leakage, suggestive of direct fistulous communication between the wound and stomach, possibly from the G tube site, or less likely loop of bowel, fluid collection with additional connection to the bowel loops.

The Vancomycin and fluconazole were stopped on [**11-20**] after 30 and 41 days respectively.
Acute Renal Failure: Has had long SICU course complicated by wound dehiscence requiring multiple "wash-outs" and mesh placements.
Current issue is mesh disintegration secondary to Pseudomonas infection for which the patient was initially placed on gent+amikacin, and then colistin, all of which caused nephrotoxic ATN.
