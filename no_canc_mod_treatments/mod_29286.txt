You underwent numerous surgeries to fix your injuries.
Because you have had so many injuries, you will need close follow-up with the physicians caring for you, as well as rehabilitation to help you regain your strength.
Currently, you are not allowed to bear weight on your legs because you have new skin grafts; you may dangle your legs for approximately 20 minutes, but most of the time your legs should be elevated.
