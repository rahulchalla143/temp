Admission Date:  [**2104-11-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-11-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-11-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is 46-year-old Spanish speaking male with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease who on admission was postoperative day number 11, status post mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement after having been ruled out for infectious endocarditis.
This was first noticed on postoperative day number one with rapid atrial fibrillation at 140 with left bundle branch block and the patient was started on amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d.
The patient was then discharged to home five days prior to admission, and then three days prior to this admission, the patient presented to his primary care physician complaining of palpitations and was directed to decrease his amiodarone to 400 mg b.i.d.
EMTs suspected beta blocker overdose, gave glucagon which resulted in stabilization of heart rate to the 60s.
The patient was presumptively treated with antibiotics after being ruled out for endocarditis by blood cultures and echocardiography, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatic heart disease diagnosed at age 15, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement on [**2104-10-22**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d., Coumadin and Lopressor 75 mg b.i.d.
Patient has recently moved from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] for his valve surgery and lives with his wife and children.
Note that this echocardiogram was obtained prior to his mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement.
Patient was deemed to need to continue treatment with amiodarone and beta blocker and thus it was decided that he would need a DDD pacer since he was exhibiting sensitivity to amiodarone and Lopressor in terms of his AV node function.
Once the patient's INR was less than 1.5, the patient underwent pacemaker implantation on [**2104-11-7**].
The patient tolerated the procedure without event and his heart rate remained AV paced in the 70s with blood pressures 100-110 systolic/50s-60s diastolic throughout his admission.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells to keep his hematocrit above 25% during this admission.
By chest x-ray, there was no evidence of infiltrate or other abnormality and it was suggested that this patient has post pericardotomy syndrome with a pleural pericarditis that would explain the friction rub, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high C reactive protein and intermittent subjective fevers.
The patient was briefly treated with Motrin 800 mg times two doses which caused an elevation in his creatinine from 0.9 to 1.7.
The patient was given one liter of normal saline intravenous fluids.
Urinalysis was consistent with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs toxicity, positive for eosinophils.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by hematoma in the pacer pocket in the setting of heparin and Coumadin.
The hematoma was observed, immobilized with a pressure dressing and stabilized on [**11-11**] with an INR of 2.3.
Goal INR because of this patient's mechanical valves is 2.5 to 3.5.
It was also noted during this hospital stay, that this patient's heart rate is extremely sensitive to beta blockers and it is recommended that his Atenolol dose not be increased above 25 mg po q.d.
Heart block, status post pacemaker implantation.
3   Rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement.
Zestril 10 mg po per day.
Coumadin 3 mg po per day with target INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
3   Amiodarone 400 mg po per day.
Atenolol 25 mg po per day.
FOLLOW-UP:  Patient will need follow-up with [**Hospital 197**] Clinic and it was recommended that he have VNA visits for a few days after discharge for medication teaching and pacer pocket follow-up.
