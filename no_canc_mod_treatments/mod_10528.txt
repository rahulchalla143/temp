Progressed to spontaneous vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia with reportedly precipitous second stage.
No intrapartum antibiotics administered.
Baby was ultimately extubated and demonstrated increased work of breathing after extubation and required reintubation.
He was placed on the high frequency ventilator with a MAP of 8 and a delta-P of 18 and about 38 to 40% oxygen.
Chest was needled for 40 cc of air and ultimately, a chest tube was placed for continuous leak.
After the chest tube was removed and it was demonstrated there was no reaccumulation of air, the baby was transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure.
On day of life six, he was transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen.
He did not require methylxanthine treatment.
He did have a desaturation to 77 on day of life 15 with a feeding secondary to discoordination.
He required blow-by oxygen.
At the time of discharge, he has been feeding well with good coordination and free of desaturations for greater than 36 hours.
His chest tube site is healing nicely.
Cardiovascular:  Baby initially required a normal saline bolus during transition for marginally low blood pressure.
He did not require pressor support.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The baby was initially started on peripheral intravenous fluid.
He received parenteral nutrition.
Enteral feedings were introduced as his respiratory status stabilized, by day of life six.
He was started on phototherapy for a peak bilirubin of 15.8/0.8 on day of life six.
HEMATOLOGY:  Baby did not require any blood products during this admission.
He was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
Blood cultures remained negative, however, because of his clinical course and respiratory status, he received seven days of Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
Spinal tap was unremarkable.
He did not require a head ultrasound based on gestational age greater than 32 weeks.
