Gastrointestinal:  The patient presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit of 29.9, melena left lower quadrant pain and coffee grounds with red tinge on nasogastric lavage.
She was on supportive therapy with Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
She was transferred to the MICU where she received 6 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets.
Two more units of red blood cells were transfused to increase her hematocrit to at least greater then 30.
She received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells.
Some hematologic workup was done to look for other causes of continued bleed, which was negative for GIC, hemolysis and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease.
Two of five studies (epinephrine and arachidonic acid) for platelet aggregation were abnormal so she was given Desmopressin intravenous times two doses ([**6-24**] and [**6-27**]) and one bag of platelets, which did not help stabilize her hematocrit.
A total of 5 units of fresh frozen platelets were also given, because of multiple red blood cells could have diluted the concentration of her clotting factors and less likely, because of the possibility that she had a coagulopathy given one PTT value.
Her vital signs remained stable with a blood pressure in the 140s/80s and heart rate in 80s until hospital day five when she started having sinus tachycardic 100 to 130s.
She was given normal saline intravenous to lower the heart rate to the 110s.
When it rose again to 120 to 130s or the patient was symptomatic with palpitations, administration of normal saline intravenous helped control the tachycardia.
After the precipitous hematocrit drop on hospital day fifteen, the patient's cardiac enzymes were checked and they revealed a mild enzyme leak with CK 118 and 128, MB 8 and 9 and troponin 0.9.
Pulmonary:  During the MICU stay, where she was given 6 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets she developed dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion.
She was given 2 doses of Lasix 20 mg intravenous after which her dyspnea improved.
She was treated with Levofloxacin 500 mg once a day for eight days.
