Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was referred to Cardiac Surgery for a redo CABG and was evaluated and accepted for transfer to the Cardiac Surgery Service.
On [**2194-10-14**], the patient underwent a redo CABG times three with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, and saphenous vein graft to PDA, bypassing occluded disease of previous graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Immediately, in the postoperative settings, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit intubated and on IV nitroglycerin drip with two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube, two ventricular and two atrial epicardial pacing wires and an A line and a Swan-Ganz catheter intact.
Not too long after arrival to the CSIU, the patient was successfully extubated without any problems and did well on postoperative day number one without requiring any need for epicardial pacing and was stable with hemodynamic parameters.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
The blood pressures were stable off of all drips.
