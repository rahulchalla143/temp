Complete collapse of the left lung due to intubation of the right mainstem bronchus.
PATHOLOGY: None   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on [**2182-5-28**] for management of traumatic injuries sustained s/p fall in the setting of possible syncope.
Imaging was obtained in emergency department showing cervical spine fractures.
Patient admitted for supportive care and observation.
Ortho spine consulted for cervical fractures and recommended c-collar which was implemented.
Patient's mental status improved and she was following commands by time of discharge.
Pain control was primarily via IV narcotics per ICU protocol.
Metoprolol dosing was titrated up while in the ICU with no further events of bradycardia or hypotension.
Pulmonary: She was intubated as above.
She showed promise in weaning off the vent early, but exhibited persistent neck/face/tongue swelling such that extubation was not feasible.
A tracheostomy was performed [**6-6**].
Her trach showed minor sanguinous secretions until discharge, easily managed with intermittent suction.
She was weaned off mechanical ventilation and was oxygenating well on 40% trach mask.
GI/GU: She was found to be intravascularly depleted on arrival to the ICU so was given several boluses of crystalloid followed by albumin.
On ICU day 3 we began diuresis with IV furosemide, moving to a Lasix drip for ICU days [**2-27**].
She was started on erythromycin and reglan ICU day 4.
Her tube feeds were advanced when appropriate, which was tolerated well.
The additional free water from the Replete tube feeds should be helpful in reversing that trend.
She was started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement.
A PICC was placed [**2182-6-2**].
Prophylaxis: She received subcutaneous heparin during this stay.
