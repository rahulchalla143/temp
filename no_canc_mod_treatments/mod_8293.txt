PULMONARY:  The patient's oxygen saturation remained stable on a 100% face mask and shovel mask.
He was therefore treated with intravenous fluids and Levophed was weaned.
He was also evaluated by the cardiac electrophysiology service for an episode of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia as well as for the question of whether the patient would benefit from cardioversion given his atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
The electrophysiology service elected not to place a defibrillator secondary to the patient's do not resuscitate wishes.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was continued on vancomycin and Flagyl for treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
Flagyl was discontinued on hospital day #5.
He was corrected to a value of 2.6 with vitamin K.  His coagulopathy was thought likely secondary to his decreased nutrition.
