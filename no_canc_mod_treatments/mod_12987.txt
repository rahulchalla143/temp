RESPIRATORY:  The patient was promptly intubated in the    delivery room and placed on mechanical ventilation until    day of life two, at which point he was transitioned to    continuous positive airway pressure of plus 5 mmHg on room    air.
At this time, he was re-intubated    and placed on mechanical ventilation and remained on    mechanical ventilation until [**2191-10-24**]; at which    point he was transitioned back to continuous positive    airway pressure.
Maintained on mechanical ventilation until [**2191-11-7**] at which point he was extubated and placed on nasal prong continuous positive airway pressure.
