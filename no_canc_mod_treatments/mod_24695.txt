PICC placement [**5-22**]: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 French single lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
Discharge Labs: Na 141 / K 4.1 / Cl 103 / HCO3 29 / BUN 20 / Cr 1.5 / 85 Ca 8.6 / Mg 1.9 / P 3.2 CBC 7.2 / Hgb 9.9 / Hct 31.3 / Plts 257 / MCV 94  Brief Hospital Course: #) Hypothermia.
The patient was given a Bair-Hugger and temperatures were persistently 95-97F.
A stress dose of steroids was administered on [**2142-5-12**] and continued throughout hospitalization with tapering to home level of 5mg Prednisone daily by time of discharge.
Endocrinology recommended increasing levothyroxine to 75mcg/day and keeping baseline prednisone at or above 5mg/day.
Antithyroglobulin and Anti-TPO antibodies were ordered - those results are pending.
Neurology noted that vital signs abnormalities could be [**12-19**] to autonomic dysfunction or a parkinson-plus type syndrome, but that further work-up would likely not change management and that work-up would also be difficult [**12-19**] to patient's demented state.
Other possibilities considered were adrenal insufficiency, volume depletion, cardiogenic, autonomic dysregulation.
Two IV fluid boluses for blood pressure elevation were given and broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pna were administered(vancomycin and Levofloxacin) in the ICU.
Antibiotic therapy was discontinued.
# Bradycardia:Pt presented with significant bradycardia but after treatment in the ICU his heart rates came back up into normal range.
One set of cardiac enzymes were negative and pt was placed on ASA and ACS dose of a statin for precautionary reasons.
ID was asked what to do about this finding and recommended putting back on Vanco until initial cultures at [**Hospital6 2910**] and F/U culture form [**5-18**] at [**Hospital1 18**] came back negative.
ID recommended switching to PO Linezolid in replacement of vanco until culture results obtained.
Although ID was suspicious that these cultures were both contaminants, they recommended antibiotics (either Vanco or Linezolid) be continued to finish a 14 day course from the 7/2 blood culture (finishing day [**5-31**]).
Pt was discharge on Vancomycin when sent home to nursing facility as a PICC line had been placed later in his admission and the nursing facility was inclined to use Vanco over Linezolid for cost-efficiency reasons.
#) Hypothyroidism, s/p pituitary resection: The patient was continued on his home dose of Synthroid until endocrine recommended that the dose be increased from 50mcg -> 75mcg each day.
AntiTPO and Anti Thyroglobilin antibodies were ordered but were pending at time of diagnosis.
Given iron studies (Ferritin 895, TIBC 213, TRF 164) and clinical picture, his anemia is likely a mixed picture of anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, and hemodilution.
However, enzymes and clinical situation did not indicate any ACS type event so patient was returned to home Zocor dose at discharge.

Secondary Diagnosis: - Dementia (Alzheimer's) - Hypothyroidism - Far-advanced pituitary adenoma s/p resection in [**2135**] - History of CVA - Renal insufficiency - Anemia - H/o syphilis - Prostatic enlargement - Depression - Hyperlipidemia - GERD - Amputation of fingers of left hand   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
At [**Hospital6 **] you were given steroids, warm IV fluids, antibiotics, and warming blankets.
Antibiotics were started and you were warmed with a Bair hugger.
Your blood pressure was maintained with IV fluids and as you improved we were able to give you food which you tolerated.
Although they were briefly stopped, we re-started you on antibiotics because two different blood cultures grew a bacteria called coag negative staph.
The infectious disease team helped us manage your antibiotics and you will be sent home with an antibiotic called vancomycin to complete a 14 day course (ending on [**5-31**]).
Your temperatures came back up to a low/normal range where they stayed for the rest of the admission, with occasional hypothermia into the 94 degree range.
Endocrinology increased your levothyroxine dose to 75mcg each day and recommended your prednisone dose stay at or above 5mg each day.
A PICC line was also placed in your R arm to allow IV access because it is difficult to achieve IV access on your veins.
This PICC line can be used to complete the course of your IV antibiotic.
New Medications to take at discharge: - Vancomycin 1000mg IV Q12 - Levothyroxine 75mcg PO daily - Prednisone 5mg PO daily - ASA 81mg PO daily .
