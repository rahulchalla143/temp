Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo woman with H/O atrial fibrillation on Coumadin transferred from an outside hospital after she was found to have an elevated troponin in the setting of chest pain consistent with an NSTEMI.
Her home aspirin was increased to 325 mg.
Her home Crestor was changed to atorvastatin 80 mg. She was additionally started on Plavix and a heparin drip.
Beta-blockade was held in the setting of bradycardia, and ACE-inhibitor was held due to renal function.
Troponin-T peaked at 1.04 on [**2142-11-7**] with CK-MB remaining normal.
She was given vitamin K 5 mg PO, and INR fell to 1.5.
Two drug eluting stents were placed with 0% residual stenosis.
She was restarted on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] as her heart rate tolerated.
At the time of discharge, she was prescribed on daily doses of ASA 325 mg, metoprolol succinate 25 mg, Plavix 75 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg. She remained chest pain free throughout her hospitalization and will follow-up with her PCP and primary cardiologist.
# Groin Hematoma - After removal of the patient's femoral arterial sheath post-catheterization, a large hematoma formed.
A clamp was placed and hemostasis achieved.
Her Hct fell from 27.8 to a nadir of 21.6, treated with transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells with appropriate increase in her hematocrit.
She was started on her home dose of furosemide 20 mg PO with little response.
She was given furosemide 20 mg IV once, and her oral dose was increased to 40 mg daily.
The patient was not started on an ACE-inhibitor due to her renal function (SCr beginning at 2.1, rising to 2.6, consistent with stage acute kidney injury); she should follow-up with her primary cardiologist regarding starting an ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] for secondary prevention in the setting of CAD, tiny NSTEMI, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient should follow-up with her primary cardiologist regarding the need for ongoing nitrates (since her flow-limiting CAD was revascularized, and she was begun on beta-blockade).
She was given vitamin K 5 mg po in preparation for cardiac catheterization.
Her Coumadin was held in the peri-procedure period in the setting of a groin hematoma as above.
Her home dose of Coumadin was restarted on HD 6.
She will follow-up with her PCP regarding INR [**Hospital1 7941**] and titration of her Coumadin dosing.
Elevation was attributed to volume depletion from diuresis and perhaps poor oral intake.
She received one dose of levofloxacin and was started on ciprofloxacin on admission from [**11-5**]- [**11-8**].
Antibiotics were discontinued as the patient was denying any further urinary symptoms.
# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive on admission with SBPs in to 180s requiring a nitroglycerin gtt.

Her furosemide dose was increased (see above).
Additionally she was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for post-infarct secondary prevention.
# Dyslipidemia: Patient's home Crestor was changed to atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
