This fluid resuscitation made it somewhat more difficult to wean the patient from the ventilator as she needed to be aggressively diuresed before she could be extubated.
After her diuretic regime was scaled back the patient's creatinine level began to return more toward her baseline, it was 1.2 on the day of discharge.
