The pt was restarted on metoprolol and verapamil to increase her LV filling time.
Her metoprolol was titrated up to 37.5 mg po bid and she was discharged on Toprol XL 75 mg po qd.
The pt was discharged on verapamil 80 mg po bid.
The pt was not started on ACE-inhibitor as we will defer to her outpt cardiologist to start this (per OMR notes, it seems pt had been on ACE in the past and it was stopped for some reason).
Hypoxic respiratory distress: The pts initial presentation (CP, SOB, hypoxia, hypotension) was extremely concerning for PE and the patient was started on heparin drip but CTA was negative for clot.
Per OMR notes, the pt has been followed for an irregular heart rhythm in the past, and there has been concern for anticoagulation given fall risk.
Her need for anticoagulation can be further evaluated on an outpt basis.
Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine .
She was maintained on aspirin, metoprolol.
The pt was not initially on a statin, so her cholesterol levels were ordered for risk stratification.
The pt was started on low dose atorvastatin 20 mg po qd.
The pt was also not on an ACE inhibitor on admission, but again, we will defer to her outpt cardiologist to start this medication (OMR notes are unclear if pt was on an ACE inhibitor before and it was stopped for some reason).
Concern for anticoagulation given fall risk --will discuss with outpt cardiologist re anticoagulation .
