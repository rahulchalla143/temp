HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with a complicated medical history including type 1 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled with triopathy), coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] where he was intubated for congestive heart failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient was in respiratory distress and also required emergent dialysis (acute renal failure for initiation of hemodialysis for volume overload) and anemia (requiring recent transfusions) and discharged home on [**2166-12-2**] without outpatient Nephropathy and Cardiology appointments.
He was given prednisone for possible gout as well as Vicodin by his primary care physician.
Morphine sulfate 2 mg times four was given.
Oxacillin 2 grams times one was given.
He also received intravenous fluids.
(a)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2147**].
Status post carotid endarterectomy in [**2163-5-7**].
Peripheral vascular disease; status post revascularization on the left times two and on the right times three.
Anemia; status post transfusions in [**2166-11-5**].
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 51% on echocardiogram in [**2166-11-5**] and 40% on Persantine MIBI in [**2166-11-5**]).
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Hydralazine 100 mg q.6h.
Imdur 30 mg by mouth three times per day.
Atenolol 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Glargine insulin 8 units subcutaneously at hour of sleep.
Humalog sliding-scale.
Prednisone 20 mg by mouth once per day (recently decreased); this was started two weeks ago for gout.
Vicodin as needed.
Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day (recently restarted).
FOOT ISSUES:  The patient was started on oxacillin for treatment of his cellulitis.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization, but given his foot infection on [**12-28**], ciprofloxacin was added given his diabetes and prednisone was held.
The patient was kept with leg elevation, nonweightbearing, and multipoultice boot.
Therefore, oxacillin was discontinued and vancomycin was started given the recent hospitalizations and therefore at increased risk of having a resistant bug.
This showed widely patent left-sided femoral-tibial bypass graft; however, it did show high-grade stenosis within the medial portion of the patient's jump graft on the right at approximately the gastrocnemius level.
However, Flagyl was added for further coverage.
The patient remained requiring narcotics for pain control.
The patient was maintained on these antibiotics dosing vancomycin by levels and given 1 g intravenous times one every day if level was less than 15.
His ciprofloxacin was renally dosed as was his Flagyl.
On [**1-7**], it was decided that because of the possible spread and seeding of further tissues the patient needed to go to the operating room for incision and drainage and exploration.
The patient had an incision and drainage of the left ankle under local anesthesia and MAC anesthesia.
During this procedure 10 cc to 15 cc of purulent discharge was found and cultured as well as liquefying necrosis being found.
Dressing changes were done twice per day (per Podiatry recommendations), and the patient remained nonweightbearing with foot elevation and multipoultice boot in place.
The patient's pain was well controlled using Tylenol 1 gram q.6h., oxycodone as needed, and intravenous morphine only for breakthrough pain.
Swabs from the bedside incision and drainage on [**1-4**] showed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain but grew nothing on culture.
Therefore, the patient was changed from vancomycin to oxacillin.
At this time, in discussion with the Vascular Service and Podiatry Service, we will repeat noninvasive studies of the left leg to assess left leg blood flow all the way distally, and the patient may need further operating room debridement depending on how the wound does.
The patient received Lasix 20 intravenously, and his oxygen saturations improved.
His standing Lasix had been discontinued secondary to increased creatinine, and Lasix was then dosed as needed secondary to his creatinine and clinical fluid status.
At that time, secondary to his acute-on-chronic renal failure, it was felt prudent to start Natrecor rather than use Lasix to attempt diuresis.
Therefore, Lasix was added to the Natrecor starting at his outpatient dose.
His Lasix was titrated up as was his Natrecor which was increased to 0.015 mcg/kg per minute.
However, despite this, it was felt urgent and necessary to take the patient to the operating room on [**1-7**] for debridement of his infection to help prevent spread and further seeding.
The patient received a total of Lasix 200 intravenously in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and was able to be weaned to nasal cannula oxygen and return to the floor.
Additionally, the recommended fluid restriction as had been done and to continue the Lasix at 80 intravenously twice per day.
Fractional excretion of sodium was calculated at 0.8, but the patient had been on Lasix as an outpatient.
The patient did receive some Lasix given his congestive heart failure.
The patient's creatinine during this hospitalization was 4.4 and after that his creatinine was noted to trend down and stabilize between 2.5 and 3.1.
Dialysis was considered to help with the heart failure; however, given that the patient was having good urine output to Natrecor and Lasix, it was decided to hold off on the initiation of dialysis.
However, it was discussed with the family and the patient that he may require dialysis in the upcoming months.
Additionally, the Transplant team (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) was consulted to start discussing access for dialysis with the patient, and venous mapping was done.
All medications were renally dosed, and nephrotoxic medications were avoided as much as possible.
Therefore, given the significant iron deficiency, Epogen was stopped and the patient was given five days of intravenous iron gluconate and changed to by mouth iron.
He also received transfusions to keep his hematocrit above 28.9.
It was felt that this was more likely due to blood loss from phlebotomy and procedures such as incision and drainage, open wound, and peripherally inserted central catheter line in the setting of anemia of chronic disease.
Epogen 4000 units subcutaneously twice per week was restarted.
At the time of this dictation, the patient had received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells during his hospital course.
The patient will likely need an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for surveillance if this has not been done.
DIABETES ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet, and glargine at hour of sleep as he was on as an outpatient, and a Humalog insulin sliding-scale.
However, the patient was given 6 units of NPH and was followed closely q.4h.
with a Humalog insulin sliding-scale.
A Medical Intensive Care Unit consultation was called for the possible need of intravenous insulin; however, the patient did not require Medical Intensive Care Unit care.
He was followed closely with his glargine and Humalog insulin sliding-scale.
It was thought that perhaps this was secondary to pain and missed medications prior to admission.
Therefore, medications were titrated up.
The atenolol was changed to labetalol 200 mg twice per day.
The patient's systolic blood pressure remained high, so nifedipine-CR 30 mg once per day was added.
At first it was felt that this was exacerbated by morphine, and his medications were changed.
The patient's nausea improved somewhat, and he was maintained on Phenergan and Zofran as needed.
Additionally, Reglan 5 q.a.c.
Protonix was added since the patient had symptoms of heartburn at home.
This was discussed with the patient as it made his absorption of iron decrease, but it was decided given his nausea seemed to worsen off the Protonix and improve on the Protonix to continue it for now.
However, his alkaline phosphatase and glutamyltransferase were noted to be elevated with an alkaline phosphatase of 327 and a glucose tolerance test of 241; however, this had been chronically elevated since [**2166-2-5**].
PAIN ISSUES:  The patient had significant pain on admission and was put on a morphine patient-controlled analgesia.
However, he felt that he became confused on the patient-controlled analgesia as well as feeling an increase in his nausea.
Pain medications were changed around, and the current regimen that seemed to be working the best was Tylenol 1 g q.6h.
with oxycodone as needed.
Additionally, he was receiving rate morphine for breakthrough pain.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were avoided given his acute renal failure.
Therefore, ciprofloxacin was changed to Levaquin to broaden coverage.
Initially, the patient had been on vancomycin and Flagyl for coverage.
It was felt that the most likely etiology of the fluid was total volume overload, and the patient had previously had a graft harvested from that arm.
It was treated with elevation and total body diuresis, and the swelling seemed to improve.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a bowel regimen, subcutaneous heparin, Protonix, and incentive spirometry.
