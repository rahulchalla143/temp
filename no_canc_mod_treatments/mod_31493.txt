Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 96013**] is a 70-year-old gentleman who presented to the care of General Surgery with a month long history of treatment for biliary duct obstruction at an outside hospital.
Shortly after his arrival here, the percutaneous transhepatic tube was inadvertently removed from the patient.
Subsequent to this, he developed evidence of systemic infection and subsequent multi-system organ dysfunction.
toxin positivity 4 days prior to this procedure, although his clinical course did not suggest overwhelming infection in that he did not have major diarrhea, nor was his colon inflamed on CAT scan.
Given all of these findings and the patient's instability without improvement with maximal support, he was taken to the operating room on [**2104-2-15**] with the goal of performing a total abdominal colectomy for fulminant C. diff.
The patient's family and health care proxy wished to intervene with this procedure in order to sustain Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 97518**] life, but they understood the extreme risks of this operation with his cardiac and respiratory instability as well as the slim likelihood that there would be a positive ultimate outcome.
The procedure was performed as planned on [**2104-2-15**] (please see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for full details).
Post-operatively the patient continued to present with a precipitous SIRS picture with multi-organ dysfunction including renal failure, cardiovascular failure with pressor dependence, and ventilatory dependence.
