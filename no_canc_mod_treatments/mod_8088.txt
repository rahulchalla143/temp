Admission Date:  [**2141-12-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-1-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-11-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25800**] is a 23-year-old male with a past medical history significant for admission to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**2141-12-18**] to [**2141-12-23**] for bilateral pulmonary emboli status post TPA administration.
The patient was discharged to home on Lovenox and Coumadin.
Patient received a hypercoagulable state work up during this admission which was notable for an anticardiolipin antibodies and a heterozygosity for a prothrombin gene mutation.
Patent foramen ovale, prothrombin gene mutation.
Anticardiolipin antibodies.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Coumadin 10 mg q. day.
Lovenox 100 mg b.i.d.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 4, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 19, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 103, calcium 9.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 4.0.
Scan again concerning for pneumonic consolidation versus area of infarct secondary to difficulty of reversal Lovenox at which time patient was started on heparin.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient also received bronchial arteriogram which showed take off at the right bronchial artery at the level of T4, T5 which showed a bronchial artery to lower right pulmonary artery shunt.
Discussion with Medical Team, Thoracic Surgery Team and family was then held discussing options of:  1) Coil embolization with possible consequence of right lower lobe infarction, 2) a right lower lobe lobectomy or 3) a conservative approach of gentle anticoagulation with the hopes of continuing and low dose thrombolysis would promote natural closure of fistula.
In the setting of elevated right sided pressures in the setting of patient's pulmonary emboli, embolization and lobectomy were felt to possibly impose significant risk to patient at this time.
Thus in consultation with Thoracic Surgery and family, a conservative approach was decided upon, though CT Surgery had initially recommended right lower lobe lobectomy with subsequent anticoagulation for the patient.
The patient was then started on Lovenox with Protamine at bed side.
Serial hematocrits showed no drop in patient's hematocrit status post argon beam therapy.
Consultation with Hematology and Interventional Pulmonary Service felt that the patient would benefit from three weeks of Lovenox prior to transition to Coumadin secondary to greater ease of reversal of Lovenox than Coumadin.
At the time of discharge, the patient was given a Lovenox injection instructions.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox 100 b.i.d.
