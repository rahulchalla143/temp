He had been placed on a pantoprazole ppi on admission, octreotide gtt was started.
Given history of grade 1 varices (no history of bleed) and hypertensive gastropathy, patient was started on ceftriaxone, and transferred to ICU for closer monitoring and EGD.
# Anemia: Chronic, transfusion dependent.
Colonoscopy recommended as outpatient when hip fracture healed.
We managed his low hematocrit with transfusions as above.
A therapeutic thoracentesis was performed and 4.5L of fluid was removed.
He was given 37.5g of albumin after this procedure and another 50g of albumin the morning after.
This was felt due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys due to low hematocrit.
His creatinine responded to transfusions and trended down.
diuretics initially held pending evaluation of GI bleed and subsequently hematemesis.
While inpatient he was started on Ceftriaxone for presumed SBP.
He is to go home and resume his home dose of Ciprofloxacin 250 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth for prophylaxis.
# DJD of hip: He was continued pt on home regimen of Oxycodone PRN.
