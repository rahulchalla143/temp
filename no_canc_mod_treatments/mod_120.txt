The endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm above the carina.
The nasogastric tube terminates in the body of the stomach.
IMPRESSION: 1) Satisfactory position of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
He was intubated, started on pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the MICU.
His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).
Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question of ventillator associated pneumonia.
On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.
Given the known suseptibility of his pneumococcus he was started again on IV levofloxacin 500mg daily and cefepime and vancomycin were discontinued.
He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and was therefore switched to PO regimen.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to document clearance of his infection.
He was started on narcotic pain medications, which somewhat controlled the pain.
They suggested adding methadone and a lidoderm patch, with ibuprofen if tolerated, with plan to taper off of oxycontin.
However after discussion with the team, it was felt that he had a legitimate reason for pleuritic pain, so he was kept on both oxycontin and methadone for optimal pain control, in addition to lidoderm patch.
He may be maintained on the oxycodone as needed for long-term pain control.
At the time of discharge he was also re-started on Neurontin for his chronic neuropathic leg pain.
Therefore, he was given a 7 day of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.
He did have a subsequent transient episode of low blood pressures to 80's systolic, felt likely to increased pain medications and volume depletion to poor PO intake.
He responded well to NS IVF boluses, and remained HD stable the remainder of his course.
ANEMIA The patient is s/p an extensive prior workup.
His HCT was generally in the low to mid 20s, and he was given a unit of PRBCs with an appropriate HCT bump.
He has been off HAART medications given significant depression and suicidality at times.
He continues to be on dapsone prophylaxis for PCP.
Depression The patient is not currently on treatment for his depression and did not express any suicidal ideation during this inpatient stay.
