Pt ultimately received 6 units of IVF and is maxed is on neosynephrine and levophed was started.
Patient was given dexamethasone per septic protocol.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A small amount of low-density fluid layers into the pelvis.
There is a Foley catheter within the decompressed urinary bladder.
She received 3 liters of IVF in the ED.
Neosynpherine was maxed out in the ED with SBP still in the 80s.
Pt was also started on the sepsis steroid protocol.
She received empirically vancomycin, levofloxicin, flagyl, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
She develloped bilateral pulmonary infiltrates during her hospitalization consistent with ARDS.
She continued to have poor oxygenation despite high FiO2 and PEEP settings.
Patient was unable to maintain sats unless, and with paralysis/neuromuscular blockade was able to maintain saturations.
On the night of [**3-9**] to [**3-10**] she went into PEA arrest, which resolved with 60 seconds of CPR, one round of epinephrine and one round of atropine.
During this point in time her antibiotic coverage was broadened to Meropenem and Vancomycin to cover possible gram negative respiratory nosocomial infections as well as Flagyl to cover colonic anaerobes as pt was noted to have dilated colon on xrays, and likely illeus.
On [**3-10**], given patients worsening ARDS, and recent extubation it was felt that her lung function might improve if she was started on prone ventilation.
Immediately following her transfer to the prone bed, pt developed hypotension to the SBP of 50s while receiving maximum levophed and neosynephrine.
CPR was started, many rounds of epi and atropine were given.
