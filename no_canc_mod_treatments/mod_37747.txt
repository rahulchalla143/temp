HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease (status post a coronary artery bypass graft with one thrombosed graft as of [**2184**]) who presented with multiple episodes of coffee-grounds emesis at his nursing home on the day of admission.
A nasogastric tube lavage was done with one liter of coffee-grounds and bloody fluid that never cleared with lavage.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2176**].
Status post pacemaker placement.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications upon admission included digoxin, Lasix, Lopressor, Procardia, Coumadin, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
He was rate controlled with diltiazem initially and then with a beta blocker.
He needed about five units of fresh frozen plasma to reverse his coagulopathy due to Coumadin.
He only needed one unit of packed red blood cells.
Later he was just placed on levofloxacin and Flagyl for his pneumonia.
This was thought due to Foley trauma.
He was given a voiding trial with the Foley and restarted on his Flomax so that he could void more easily.
PULMONARY EDEMA:  With his new ejection fraction, the patient had pulmonary edema and was diuresed gently with his standing dose of Lasix of 80 mg p.o.
He had an oxygen requirement of approximately 2 liters to 3 liters of oxygen which decreased by the time of discharge.
HEART FAILURE:  The patient was started back on his ACE inhibitor as his renal function improved.
He was also on his beta blocker.
Any aspirin or Coumadin was held at this time, and was just restarted on his Lasix standing dose.
He was also kept on his digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o.
DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had episodes of fasting hypoglycemia; and accordingly, his evening dose of NPH was titrated down to achieve a satisfactory glucose in the morning.
Captopril 25 mg p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
NPH 22 units subcutaneously in the morning and 8 units subcutaneously in the evening.
