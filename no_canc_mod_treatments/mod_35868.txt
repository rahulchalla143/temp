He was then transferred to the Angiography Suite where he underwent embolization of a right hepatic artery which was bleeding from three different sites.
He had low-grade temperatures.
He underwent CT-guided drainage of these collections on [**2136-5-14**].
By that time, he had completed multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics and his only positive cultures were from his sputum and those were growing Pseudomonas which was progressively becoming more resistant and for which he was covered.
From that time on, the abdomen remained open and he underwent abdominal washouts every other day for a period of almost two weeks.
At that point, the washouts were stopped in the open abdomen and underwent daily dressing changes with wet-to-dry dressings.
On [**2136-6-1**], it was decided to place a right chest tube due to a growing right pleural effusion.
This procedure was complicated by significant bleed from a vessel over the thoracic wall.
The chest tube incision was opened and the vessel was found and ligated.
Around this episode, he required multiple blood products.
The Pseudomonas from his sputum was resistant to many antibiotics including Imipenem in which he was on and multiple other antibiotics.
The ID Service was following him throughout his stay and adjusted treatment accordingly.
Status post liver embolization.
Status post chest tube placement bilaterally.
Status post exploratory laparotomy.
