Patent hepatic vasculature with a patent umbilical vein and midline varices.
Patent hepatic vasculature with a patent umbilical vein and midline varices.
An appropriate spot was marked in the right flank for subsequent paracentesis by the clinical team.
CXR ([**11-19**]): SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the thoracic inlet, terminating approximately 8.3 cm from the carina.
The nasogastric tube tip is within the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in standard positions.
CXR ([**11-20**]): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new nasogastric tube.
The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach, at the lower aspect of the image.
CXR ([**11-21**]): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.
The endotracheal tube is not visualized and might have been removed in the interval.
There is interval progression of bilateral pleural effusions, small-to-moderate and bibasilar consolidations, highly concerning for infectious process.
KUB ([**11-22**]): IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo M with PMH of alcohol abuse, Class B Childs Cirrhosis, known esophageal varices on Nadolol who presented with hematemesis, intubated in ED for airway protection due to significant vomiting, s/p EGD without intervention, with a hospital course complicated by abdominal distention and HCAP.
He was initially treated with octreotide and protonix drips.
The patient was switched to protonix IV.
He was given SC Vitamin K for INR 1.9 and hepatic dysfunction.
His plavix and aspirin were held.
Patient required electrolyte repletion during recovery from ileus, likely due to high stool output.
Therefore, his antibiotic coverage was expanded from cipro to Vanco and Zosyn.
Tobramycin was added on [**11-24**].
Two days later, IV antibiotics were discontinued and he remained on oral Levaquin for a planned 14 day course.
# Intubation for Airway Protection: The patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection.
Lactulose and rifaximin held for ileus, restarted with return of stool output.
He was treated with a banana bag, thiamine, folate, MVI .
Transitional Issues: - Blood culture pending final result - Patient required repletion of electrolytes due to high stool output.
He was discharged on his home dose of potassium repletion, which may need to be adjusted as his intake and output normalize.
- The patient's nadolol was held for relative hypotension.
