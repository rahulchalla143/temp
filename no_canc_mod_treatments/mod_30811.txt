At the time, she was admitted for pain control and monitoring of hematocrit (34.6-->31.9).
Past Medical History: CAD LVEF > 50% s/p CABG '[**95**] and stents AVR '[**95**]; MV ring-annuloplasty HTN Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism [**12-31**] iodine tx for [**Doctor Last Name 933**] dz Depression with psychosis Discoid lupus PTSD H/o carcinoid s/p resection in '[**73**] COPD TAH b/l SBO Hemolytic anemia [**12-31**] AVR Migraine T9-T10 disk herniation  Social History: no ETOH, smokes 1ppd.
2+ distal pulses.
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o female with CAD, mechanical AVR, MVannuloplasty, on coumadin, who was admitted for pain control s/p fall with hospital course c/b hypotension and hematocrit drop of unclear etiology requiring [**Name (NI) 153**] overnight observation.
However, of concern is that she normally has poorly controlled hypertension and she remained with low systolic BP's off all anti-hypertensives.
It was suspected that her hypotension might be secondary to opiate analgesics she recieved on admission, therefore opioid analgesics were discontinued.
SBP decreased to the 80's-90's and she was given NS prn boluses to maintain BP >100.
During her hospitalization, her BPs remained on the low side and required prn NS boluses.
Patient awake/alert but diaphoretic and given 250cc NS bolus.
Right femoral line placed and given 2L NS but SBP remained in the 80s with good UOP (1000cc after foley placed).
CXR showed vague RLL infiltrate, and she was started on empiric vancomycin/levofloxacin pending culture data.
Vancomycin was discontinued and she will complete a seven day course of levofloxacin on [**2-24**].
Her hct drop may have been dilutional secondary to recieving aggressive IVF repletion with her hypotension.
Following her transfusion in the ICU, her hematocrit remained stable at 30 and she required no further transfusions.
Mechanical AVR-Given her risk of thrombosis, in setting of no obvious bleeding, she was re-started on anti-coagulation.
She was started on IV heparin since her INR was sub-therapeutic and she was continued on this until her INR was greater than 2 on coumadin.
CAD- Known CAD s/p CABG with recent Cath in [**9-1**] with stents X 4 to RCA/RPDA.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and low-dose oxycodone prn.
She was taken off vancomycin at that point and should complete her 7th day of levofloxacin on [**2-24**].
