Admission Date:  [**2153-6-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2153-6-8**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 81 year old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and an AV pacemaker, who was admitted for elective septal ablation.
She is fully functional and walks approximately one mile per day and uses a stationary bike, swims about 20 minutes per day and  She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting associated with exercise, however, she complains of mild increasing fatigue with exercise over the last few months.
Her cardiac history includes a catheterization in [**2146**] which showed no significant coronary artery disease outside of a 50% lesion at the origin of D1 and mild narrowing of the left circumflex at its origin.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2153-5-1**], showed an ejection fraction of 65% along with moderate to severe aortic stenosis, one plus aortic regurgitation, four plus mitral regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation with a gradient across the aortic valve of 48.
Post-procedure, the left ventricular outflow gradient at rest and with provocation decreased markedlyto 20 with an aortic valve gradient unchanged at 25 mmHg, compared with pre- procedure.
There were no complications of the procedure and the patient was transferred to Cardiac Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and post myocardial infarction precautions.
DDD pacemaker placed in [**2145**] secondary to tachy/brady     syndrome.
Dilatation and curettage times two.
ALLERGIES:   Vancomycin which causes itching and a rash; cephalosporins which cause GI upset; Clindamycin which causes a rash as well as lip swelling and penicillin which causes swelling.
Verapamil SR 180 q. day.
Lipitor 10 q. h.s.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
Prednisone 5 q. day.
Protonix 40 q. day.
Premarin 0.3 mg q. day.
Iron 325 three times a day.
Folate 1 mg q. day.
Vitamin E 400 Units q. day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination on admission to the Cardiac Care Unit was temperature 96.9 F.; blood pressure 135/70; heart rate 70 which was ventricular paced; respiratory rate 17; oxygen saturation was 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
On chest examination, her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly (the patient was laying flat due to femoral catheter in place).
She had two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior pulses bilaterally.
She is admitted to Cardiac Care Unit status post elective alcohol ablation with good results.
She was started on aspirin and Lipitor as well as heparin at 650 units per hour  Heparin was continued for 24 hours.
She was restarted on her outpatient anti-hypertensives which included Cozaar, Verapamil and Hydrochlorothiazide.
Hydrochlorothiazide was later held due to the patient's hyponatremia.
Her DDD pacemaker was capturing well with a heart rate of 70.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   On presentation, the patient was hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, which was partly at baseline, but additionally attributed to a large amount of intravenous fluids received in the catheterization laboratory.
She was switched to normal saline with supplementation of potassium and her electrolytes normalized.
Hydrochlorothiazide was held due to electrolyte abnormalities but will be restarted upon discharge.
Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
Losartan 50 twice a day.
Verapamil SR 180 q. day.
Lipitor 20 q. day.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
Prednisone 5 mg q. day.
Folate 1 mg q. day.
Protonix 40 q. day.
Premarin 0.3 mg q. day.
The patient had current medications at home, and therefore is not discharged with any prescriptions.
