She was transferred to the [**Hospital3 28116**], receiving Lopressor IV times one and Heparin drip.
She clinically appeared to be in failure, and she was placed on [**Location (un) **] the CK-MB and troponin were positive with CK of 189, MB of 8.1, and the troponin of 2.09.
Aggrastat was started for unrelenting chest pain with good result, and she also received Morphine sulfate.
Lopressor 50 p.o.b.i.d.
Isordil 60 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Lasix 80 mg p.o.q.d.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 8072**], [**State 350**] with her daughter, son-in-law and grandson.
She ultimately had a four-vessel CABG followed by persistent lower extremity wound infections, acute renal failure, and persistent anxiety.
The patient developed recurrent angina while receiving nitroglycerin and an antiplatelet drug, IV Aggrastat, was started.
Attempt was made to place an intra- aortic balloon pump in the left femoral artery.
Hypovolemia shock ensued, and the patient required infusion of three units of packed red blood cells.
It was decided to take the patient to the operating room and simultaneous repair of the left femoral artery performing an aortocoronary bypass graft.
The patient received a four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was maintained on milrinone and nitroglycerine drip.
She remained intubated and sedated in the ICU.
Throughout the remainder of her hospital course, her creatinine remained elevated ranging from approximately 2.0 after her Intensive Care Unit stay up to 2.4.
Aggressive diuresis was initially attempted, and she was maintained on 120 mg of IV Lasix b.i.d.
The Renal Consultation service felt that this likely represented a new stable endpoint for her and that the point of maximum diuresis had been reached.
Her Lasix dose was decreased to 80 mg IV q.d., with resulting I&Os approximately even.
Wound infection.
The patient's coronary artery bypass graft required the dissection of the saphenous vein from bilateral lower extremities with a wound incision from approximately upper thigh through lower calf.
She was started on empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Flagyl to cover the possible MRSA or skin pathogens or possible anaerobic organisms.
The Plastic Surgery Service was also consulted for further assistance with wound closure and care.
The Plastic Surgery Service recommended changing the antibiotic regimen to Levofloxacin, on which patient was continued for the next several days.
At this point, the patient was started on Ampicillin empirically and the Infectious Disease Service was consulted.
It was suggested at this point by the Infectious Disease Department that the patient be started on Vancomycin and the oxacillin be stopped.
Over the course of her subsequent stay, both of her lower extremity wounds continued to heal, with decreasing erythema surrounding the wound edges and gradual closure and scar formation.
However, the large necrotic area, which had previously been noted, required the placement of the wound VAC to assist in closure and healing, which is in place at the time of this discharge summary.
During her stay it was also noted that the left groin site, where she had had the fistula repair performed was actively exuding purulent material.
The Plastic Service again was asked to comment, as was Cardiothoracic Surgery, and it was felt that with appropriate wound care, dressing and expression of the material, as well as the continuation of the Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, the wound would not require further debridement.
At the time of the discharge summary, the patient remains on IV Vancomycin and oral Levofloxacin.
Her left and right saphenectomy wound sites are continuing to heel and her left groin site is healing well.
She will need to continue levofloxacin and vancomycin through [**2177-9-16**], which is two weeks after the time of her last major debridement.
Her vancomycin is dosed for levels.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient remained with subjective and objective signs of shortness of breath, notable for an oxygen saturation rate ranging from approximately 92 to 96% on an average of two liters of oxygen by nasal canal.
There was a question of bilateral pleural effusions, which probably remained after her cardiothoracic surgery and it was felt that these effusions would gradually resolve over time, and that there was no role for chest-tube drainage.
Her vital signs remained stable and she did not require transfusions to maintain hematocrit of 30%.
Throughout the course of her stay, the patient had intermittent episodes anxiety requiring the administration of benzodiazepines usually 0.5 mg of Ativan for control of her symptoms.
They felt that the patient would benefit from Haloperidol p.r.n.
for control of her symptoms and that the use of benzodiazepine should be minimized to prevent acute confusion.
She also complained of depressive symptoms, and she was started on Paxil 10 mg p.o.q.d.
The Nutrition Service was consulted and felt that her wound healing could be improved by the addition of protein in the form of supplement shakes.
By the end of her stay, her nutritional status was improving and she was taking full meals along with the nutritional supplements as described above.
The oral antiglycemic medications were stopped, and she was continued on a regular Insulin sliding scale.
As her nutritional status improves, it is felt that she will probably need to be started on her oral antiglycemics.
Due to the patient's long hospital course, she has become severely deconditioned, and she has been working with physical therapy and occupational therapy to improve muscle strength and her ability to perform her activities of daily living.
The patient had a vaginal bleed in the setting of her anticoagulation on coumadin.
The source of the bleeding could not be localized on speculum exam.
