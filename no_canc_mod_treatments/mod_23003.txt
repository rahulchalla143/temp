He had been intubated in the field for airway protection following a prolonged extraction from the vehicle.
Orthopedics was consulted who recommended full weight bearing status with an air-cast which was provided to the patient prior to discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was discharged with oxycodone 5mg q4h, total 20 pills for pain.
# Leukocytosis: Upon admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have leukocytosis to 19.1, but without a source of infection, and recent use of prednisone for a COPD exacerbation, infection was not seen as the most likely cause (negative UA, Clear CXR, no evidence of skin/soft tissue infection, and negative blood cultures).
By the time that the Serratia was found on culture, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a resolving white blood cell count (13.1 from peak of 19.1) without treatment with antibiotics, and the decision was made not to treat.
On day of discharge, WBC had declined to 9.1 without antibiotics and Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained afebrile throughout admission.
Oral steroids were not continued in light of injury to Left ankle.
# Afib: Warfarin therapy with 8mg (Sun, Tues, Thurs, Sat)/6mg (Mo, Wed, Fri) was continued, but in light of borderline elevated INR to 2.7 on day 4 of admission, warfarin was kept at 6mg daily.
# CAD: ASA 81mg was continued while Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted.
The medical team was wondering why he was not maintained on a beta blocker as an outpatient.
Nicotine replacement therapy was given with patch therapy, and he was given a prescription for a patch to use as an outpatient.
