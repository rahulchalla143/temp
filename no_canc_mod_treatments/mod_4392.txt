Erythema, congestion and friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Ulcers seen in the stomach, likely with recent bleeding.
This is unlikely to account for degree of hct drop and BRBPR, so would still pursue colonoscopy in AM.
Suggest: - cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] or drip x 72h total, then protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] until repeat EGD.
- repeat EGD in [**6-2**] weeks - check HP serologies and treat if positive - cont to hold coumadin - d/w cards re need for this medication - clear diet OK today  Assuming plans to call out of ICU today, anticipate [**Last Name (un) **] tomorrow: - MOVIprep this afternoon - strict NPO after 2AM (inlc no prep) w plan for [**Last Name (un) **] in AM  COLONOSCOPY [**2106-5-28**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Medium internal hemorrhoids with stigmata of recent bleeding were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 33323**] is a 70 year old female with a history of Afib on metop/dilt/coumadin and dCHF who presented to the ED with diapheresis and had a frankly bloody bowel movement while in the ED.
Initially on protonix drip and transitoned to po PPI.
3 peripheral lines were established.
Was reversed with 5mg iv vitamin K, 5mg po vitamin K, and ffp in setting of GIB.
Will need heparin bridge after procedure to be placed back on coumadin but at a lower dose w/close follow-up of INR on [**Date Range 766**] of next week.
Restarted amiodarone at home dose, restarted diltiazem at 30 mg IV QID, and initially held beta blocker given concern for repeat bleed.
Plan made to resume atrial fibrillation medications with hemodynamic stability.
Coumadin and [**Date Range **] held as well in presence of GIB.
Once stablized, cards had hoped to cardiovert pt but decision was made to hold off as placing pt on heparin drip and performing cardioversion at this time did not seem prudent.
Pt had aspirin held but restarted lower dose of coumadin prior to discharge after no further evidence of bleeding.

You had a significant drop in your red blood cell count and required transfusion of blood.
Your condition improved with blood products and your bleeding resolved.
Because cardiology hopes to cardiovert you in the near future because of your atrial fibrillation, the decision was made to restart you on a lower dose of coumadin but to hold aspirin after a discussion with cardiology.
You will also need to take protonix 40mg twice a day until your repeat endoscopy, and perhaps longer.
If you go back to taking aspirin, you will need a daily proton pump inhibitor (protonix or equivalent) indefinitely thereafter (even assuming the ulcer heals).
We also noticed that you may have a urinary tract infection, and recommend you take an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin twice daily for the next 3 days.
The following changes were made you your medications: - Please START taking Pantoprazole 40 mg every twelve hours.
- Please CONTINUE taking coumadin at a lower dose of 4mg.
- Please START taking ciprofloxacin twice daily (antibiotic for UTI) - Please continue to take all of your other home medications as prescribed.
