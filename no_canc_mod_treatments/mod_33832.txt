Findings are most suggestive of an acute infection superimposed on a chronic interstitial fibrotic lung disease.
This could represent pneumonia, especially with superimposed dense consolidation and effusion at the left base.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion..   Brief Hospital Course: 78 man with history of bronchiectasis, recent left knee replacement and treatment for community acquired pneumonia presents with hypoxic respiratory failure.
He had a CXR in the ED that showed LLL consolidation and treatment for healthcare acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn were started.
Initially there was some concern for acute on chronic congestive heart failure as a cause of his respiratory distress, diuresis did not improve his symptoms, BNP was not elevated and echo was unimpressive.

Pt was given fluid to maintain CVP 18, and was on pressors for 2 days.
He was weaned off pressors and then became hypertensive, home propanolol and amlodipine were restarted with good effect.
He was started on low dose glargine in addition to a sliding scale which provided adequate glucose control.
# Hypernatremia:  Two days after initiating tube feeds his serum sodium became elevated, likely secondary to decreased free water intake, improved with increased free water boluses.
#Anisocoria-pt was noted to have uneven pupils on HD 3, concern for ICH given anticoagulation with lovenox but given unstable clinical status head CT was delayed.
He was anticoagulated with heparin sc.
