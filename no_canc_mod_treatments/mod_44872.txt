Carotid massage was performed without effect on tachycardia, she was treated with IV metoprolol and diltiazem which did not affect rate however did lower blood pressure from 140's to 100's systolic.
She was treated with adenosine and conduction rate slowed and clear atrial flutter waves were seen.
She was increased on her dose of metoprolol and started on digoxin on [**2111-5-21**], both of which she should continue, but her rate did not respond nor did her rhythm get out of atrial flutter.
Electrophysiology was consulted, and with further discussion with family, it was decided to pursue TEE with cardioversion with 1 month of anticoagulation with Pradaxa.
Initially family was hesitant given fall risk, but given the fact that she would only need 1 month of Pradaxa and given that risk:benefit ratio is clearly in favor of cardioverting her, arrangements were made for cardioversion (likely [**2111-5-26**]) and anticoagulation.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and stool studies sent and were unremarkable.
She completed 4 days of treatment of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
She was treated with IV haldol and restraints on HD 1.
The following morning she appeared more lucid and oriented however became agitated again on the evening of HD 2.
Tolterodine was discontinued as anticholnergic properties may have been contributing to mental status changes.
She was treated with Pantoprazole for ulcer prophylaxis .
