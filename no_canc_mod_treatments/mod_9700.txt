An abdominal CT was performed which showed irregularly distended loop of distal bowel in the pelvis with questionable pneumatosis and with numerous foci of adjacent extraluminal gas which tracks into a right-sided anterior pelvic wall hernia.
He was taken the same day to the OR for Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of  adhesions, small bowel resection and rectal resection with end ileostomy and removal of a large amount of fecal peritonitis.
He was started empirically on Cipro and Flagyl.
He received 2 units pRBCs, and home immunosuppression regimen was continued initially.
Urine output was very poor, and after a renal consult was obtained, a temporary dialysis line was placed and the patient was started on CVVH-D.
Blood and urine cultures were sent, (no growth on either culture) and due to the large amount of fecal peritonitis, the antibiotic coverage was broadened to Vanco and Zosyn.
The patient remained hypotensive and on HD 3 was still requiring pressors and was given 2 units pRBC's.
On [**8-14**] the patient was taken back to the OR as he was still having pressor requirements and elevated WBC.
When the original resection was done it was thought that the distal rectal segment was in continuity, (i.e., a Hartmann [**Month/Year (2) 42265**]), however, it was noted that both the distal ileum and the distal transverse colon had been stapled off during the original surgery, leaving a blind [**Last Name (LF) 42265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was taken back to create a mucous fistula.
On [**8-18**] HD 6 (POD 6 and 4)the determination was made that the already failing kidney transplant would not be salvageable.
Cyclosporine was d/c'd, leaving him on prednisone and low dose MMF.
A tunneled hemodialysis line was placed in IR with uncomplicated placement of a 23 cm 15.5 French hemodialysis tunneled catheter via the right internal jugular vein with its tip in the right atrium.
Hemodialysis has been continued on an intermittent basis (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday) The initial incision area was opened due to drainage.
It has been packed with NS wet to dry dressings and has improved in appearance, the base of the shallow wound has pink granulating tissue.
A dobhoff was placed for tube feedings as patient oral intake has been poor.
He has been tolerating the tube feeds without diarrhea or nausea/vomiting.
Urine output has improved to greater than one liter daily, however creatinine continues to rise between hemodialysis treatments.
The patients failed LUE AV graft will be referred back to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42267**], who created the access on [**8-9**].
