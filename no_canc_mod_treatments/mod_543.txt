He received 6 liters of intravenous fluids, Ancef, and Unasyn and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient presented with fevers, hypotension, right lower extremity pain, and septic physiology responsive to intravenous fluids.
He was initially started on Unasyn, as the patient is a diabetic, and gentamicin was added to cover Pseudomonas.
General Surgery was consulted, and vancomycin was added to the regimen for his cellulitis.
Another line was placed prior to discharge.
He will be discharged on seven days of Unasyn and then by mouth Augmentin for seven days.
It was thought that this may have been secondary to discontinuation of his beta blocker because of his low blood pressures.
Unasyn 3 gram intravenously q.6h.
Augmentin 500/125 one tablet by mouth three times per day (times seven days); starting in one week.
Normal saline flushes 10 cc before and after each Unasyn dose.
Heparin flushes 2 cc after each Unasyn dose.
