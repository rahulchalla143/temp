He was recently treated for MRSA endocarditis at [**Hospital1 **].
He was sedated on fentanyl and versed.
He was given profilnine, and vit K and FFP to reverse INR.
Patient underwent a CTA/CTV of the head (though suboptimal in quality due to lack of peripheral access) and CT of torsal.
Obesity s/p gastric bypass surgery 2.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, on NPH insulin 3.
Atrial fibrillation on warfarin and amiodarone 4.
Obstructive sleep apnea--has not tolerated CPAP 8.
Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis--was treated with steroids, however stopped due to weight gain, psychosis, and hyperglycemia, now on methimazole 9.

CTA/CTV was not performed due to lack of IV access.
Suboptimal evaluation due to hand injection of IV contrast.
Umbilical and right-sided inguinal bowel-containing hernias without evidence of obstruction/incarceraction.
An echo was done and the patient required 4 pressors in order to keep MAPs in the 60s.
The patient was started on stress dose steroids given his long standing h/o steroid use.
His home medications for HTN and Afib were held in the setting of hypotension, and cultures were taken for the possible infectious cause.
His abx coverage was expanded to linezolid, cefepime, and flagyl while on the floor to cover broadly.
Ultimately, after much of the workup could be completed, the patient's wife opted for comfort care, and he was taken off of the four pressors and made comfortable.
&#9658; ENDOCARDITIS (VISA): was on synercid at OSH due to Lsided lesion, and as above, his coverage was increased to broad spectrum abx.
&#9658; ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: likely due to hypoperfusion of the end organs given elevated lactate.
Bicarb was given given the increasing trend, and IV hydration was maintained for perfusion pressures.
&#9658; SEIZURE vs STROKE: imaging suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage, not for surgical intervention.
The patient was continued on the phenytoin on the floor as he was loaded with dilantin in the ED.
# Ventilation: The patient was kept sedated while mechanical ventilation was used.
&#9658; ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) on Coumadin with high INR - given subarachnoid bleed, he was reversed with profilnine, vitamin K, and FFP.
We held any anticoagulation and decided to trend INR.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was made CMO after this conversation and expired shortly thereafter.
