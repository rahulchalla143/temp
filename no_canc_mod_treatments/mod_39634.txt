She was given labetalol 10mg IV and Vit.
K 10mg and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]  On arrival her GCS was 14, her SBP was >210 and she was given nicardipine gtt as well as profilnine for rapid reversal of INR.
Her family has apparently indicated that she is full code and they request all possible interventions at this time.
Prominent ventricles and sulci are compatible with global age-related volume loss.
There is air and dense contrast within these vessels, likely from attempted opacification during IVC-gram performed the same date.
Thickened, trabeculated bladder wall with Foley catheter in place.
MRI was ordered to look for metastases with her history of breast CT. Neurology was consulted and they agreed with our current BP control and imaging plans.
She was continued on her home Dilantin and a level was drawn on [**3-12**] This was 7.9.
On [**3-13**] the patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] to confirm medications and PMH.
She had a L LE DVT in [**4-/2101**] and has been on coumadin since.
Because of her bleed, however, coumadin is contraindicated, so patient was given an IVC filter on [**3-13**].
Of note, she has been on dilantin for [**Doctor Last Name 11332**] mal seizures since [**2086**].
After reviewing her MRI it was discuess that she could benefit from a craniotomy and evacuation of the hemorrhage, however, after discussion with the family, it was decided to postpone surgical intervention.
She met with physical therapy who confirmed that patient would benefit from returning to her facility.
