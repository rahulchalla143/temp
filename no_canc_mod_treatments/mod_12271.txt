Here, the patient underwent a right femoral thrombectomy by Vascular Surgery.
The procedure was successful in restoring flow.
For the above problems, the patient was sent to the MICU after having been found to have a postoperative .................to greater than 50, hematocrit 24.5.
She was transfused with 5 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of FFP and heparin and was discontinued.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI times two in [**2142**], three vessel disease, not a candidate for CABG or PTCA, based on a catheterization in [**2143**], left main 70%, left circumflex 95%, LAD 80%, RCA 100%.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Imdur 50 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
Levoxyl 25 micrograms p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  On presentation, the patient had a temperature of 97.9, pulse 82, blood pressure 134/62, saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On presentation to the MICU, the patient had the following laboratories:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit 33.2 after the 5 units of red blood cells, platelets 186,000.
Albumin 2.4.
She underwent a successful thrombectomy with restoration of flow, the etiology of the thrombus was thought to be an embolic event, likely from the heart, although it was not seen on echocardiography.
The patient was initially treated with heparin which was to be continued after she had the GI bleed and the hematocrit dropped to 24.
Subsequently Vascular Surgery recommended that the patient be started on Warfarin as prophylaxis for further embolic events.
This was done so on [**2145-6-26**], but it was unclear if this would be continued given her continued heme-positive stools needed to be resolved on the day of discharge.
The patient was treated with a beta blocker, aspirin, and Imdur in addition to her Atorvostatin.
She was not deemed a candidate for cardiac catheterization and again the heparin was deemed too risky given the GI bleeds and the falling hematocrit.
She should be considered for restarting her Lasix and Aldactone as an outpatient.
The hematocrit was more or less stable in the MICU after receiving 5 units of packed red cells in the PACU.
She was continued only on the aspirin and the Warfarin for anticoagulation.
The patient was also given Boost supplementations for a low albumin.
She was treated with six days of levofloxacin and had no fevers and her white count remained normal during the hospital stay.
She continued a regular insulin sliding scale.
In addition, she was continued on Synthroid for hypothyroidism.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has a history of depression and was continued on her Sertraline.
The patient is apparently on home hospice care for her coronary artery disease and dementia at home.
No further intervention was taken for her neurologic status.
Embolus to the right femoral artery with subsequent elevations in CK.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Aspirin, enteric-coated, 81 mg p.o.
Warfarin 5 mg p.o.
q.d., to be checked with Vascular Surgery prior to discharge.

Sertraline 50 mg p.o.
Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg p.o.
Insulin sliding scale.
