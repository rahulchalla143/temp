She was transferred to the ICU [**2178-3-3**] with hypotension (BP 65/40) and treated for urosepsis after E.coli grew in her urine.
She was treated with initially ceftriaxone and then aztreonam.
Hypotension was treated initially with Neosynephrine, and then levophed.
She then developed a MRSA bacteremia.
No vegetations were seen on TTE [**2178-3-1**], but she was treated for endocarditis with vancomycin/gentamicin.
She was transferred on Levophed via PICC line in left A/C vein.
She denies headache, dizziness, confusion, vision changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.

A left PICC catheter terminates in the upper SVC.
Cholecystectomy clips in the right upper quadrant.
We treated her supportively with lactulose, rifamixin.
We held her propranolol given her hypotnesion requiring pressors.
A diagnostic paracentesis was unsuccessfully attempted.
She was also started on pentoxyfylline for presumed EtOH hepatitis, as well as octreotide and midodrine for possible HRS.
Nevertheless, given her multiple issues, she continued to decompensate.
She was [**Hospital 22626**] transferred to the liver service after a final decision was made to make her comfort measures only.
ARF on CKD:  Her baseline creatinine was unknown but per report creatinine was 1.0 prior to initiation of gentamicin.
She had been hypotensive requiring pressors, including vasopressin, raising the concern for pre-renal azotemia vs ATN.
MRSA bacteremia: Her source was unknown but was being treated for endocarditis given persistant bacteremia despite therapeutic doses of vancomycin at OSH.
Her antibiotics were stopped once the patient was made CMO.
Sepsis, severe infection, ESLD were thought involved.
She was maintained on levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin during her MICU stay.
Octreotide and midodrine were also started (see above).
However, these interventions were stopped once she was made CMO.
MS changes: Patient was not oriented, and she was unclear that she understood who made decisions for her.
She remained disoriented, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and ARF.
It improved with fluid restriction .
She was put on a morphine drip and appeared comfortable.
