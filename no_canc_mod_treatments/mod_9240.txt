He was washing his bus today when he noted the onset of severe left-sided chest pain (like "knives"), diaphoresis, and nausea.
He received aspirin, nitroglycerin, heparin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for percutaneous coronary intervention.
He was briefly hypotensive during the procedure and was given dopamine until an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient has just completed a 6-month regimen of chemotherapy and steroids; alternating months).
Possible nephrotic syndrome (lower extremity edema, protein in urine).
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included lisinopril b.i.d., tizanidine, Lasix 20 mg p.o.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history positive for coronary artery disease; his sister was deceased at the age of 58, status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
His right groin catheter site was soft and without hematomas or bruits.
His neurologic examination revealed alert and mentating well with dysarthria.
Arteries revealed left anterior descending artery with diffuse 30% proximal lesion, 100% mid lesion, 90% origin first diagonal lesion.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  As above, the patient had 2-vessel coronary artery disease and had four stents placed in his left anterior descending artery.
The patient was treated with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, captopril, and metoprolol status post myocardial infarction.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was maintained on an intra-aortic balloon pump for one day following his percutaneous coronary intervention.
The balloon pump was weaned without event.
He had an echocardiogram on day three status post myocardial infarction which revealed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction; comprising septal, anterior, and apical akinesis.
The patient was placed on heparin for this akinesis; which was converted to warfarin prior to discharge.
They elected to see the patient in one month when his course of Plavix was completed and he was at less of a risk of bleeding.
His hematocrit remained stable around 30 to 31 after that initial drop, and he did not receive any blood transfusions.
Status post left anterior descending artery stents.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol-XL 150 mg p.o.
