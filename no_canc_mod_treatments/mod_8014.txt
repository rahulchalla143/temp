The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/VRE dialysis catheter infection and status post Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidural abscess of L2 to 3, status post incision and drainage in [**2144-7-15**].
The patient was given Tylenol for his back pain which did not help.
The patient was given one gram of Kefzol and 80 mg of intravenous Gentamicin and sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department.
At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was given 1 gram of Vancomycin and 2 grams of ceftriaxone.
The patient received about a liter of intravenous fluids.

Chest:  Left sided Quinton dialysis catheter without any surrounding erythema or exudate, nontender.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 63 year old Spanish speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of recurrent dialysis catheter infections with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and VRE, and history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidural abscess, who now presents with fever, lethargy, back pain and headache.
The patient was kept on a regimen of Vancomycin and Gentamicin for broad coverage.
Of note, the patient's blood cultures from his dialysis center were found to be positive, growing four out of four tubes of Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
This was found to be overall pan sensitive, only resistant to penicillin, Ampicillin and tetracycline.
However, the MIC was only low for oxacillin at a level of 0.25.
For this reason, the patient was switched from Vancomycin and Gentamicin to intravenous Oxacillin at a dose of 1 gram q. four hours.
His Quinton dialysis line was pulled after dialysis was started with his left AV fistula.
The patient was unable to have a right sided PICC line placed because of the extensive network of clots in his right internal jugular, subclavian and brachiocephalic veins.
However, a midline catheter was successfully placed on [**11-4**].
The patient was continued on intravenous Oxacillin.
Even though this is not the area where the patient was having pain, it was decided that the patient should be treated for presumed osteomyelitis for a total of six weeks on antibiotics.
Given that the patient was bacteremic with Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, there was also concern that he may have seeded his heart valves.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was planned for [**11-4**], but during the procedure, the patient was unable to tolerate the tube and therefore it was aborted.
The Quinton catheter was taken out after the AV fistula was tested and found to be usable.
A midline catheter was placed in the right side for intravenous antibiotics.
As a temporary measure, the patient received a central line for dialysis through his left sided EJ.
Transplant Surgery's recommendation was to leave the AV fistula alone for one to two weeks following the angioplasty and then to retest it.
The patient was kept on his regimen of aspirin, Plavix, Lopressor, and Enalapril for cardiac health.
The patient also received a Nitroglycerin patch.
Because of all the interventional procedures performed, the patient was mostly off of Coumadin, but was kept on a heparin drip towards the end of his stay.
We were just waiting for his Coumadin to become therapeutic.
He received hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
There were no further complications during hemodialysis including fever, hypotension, or volume overload.
Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.
Calcium carbonate 1000 mg p.o.
Oxacillin 1 gram intravenous q. four hours, to be taken until [**2145-12-13**].

Colace 100 mg p.o.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o.
Lantus 15 units subcutaneously q. a.m. 22.
The patient will continue to receive hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
The patient will also need to be seen for removal of his temporary external jugular dialysis catheter once his AV fistula is retested and working again.
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, now resolved.
Coronary artery disease, status post left circumflex stent.
