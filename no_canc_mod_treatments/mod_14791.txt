Alcohol withdrawl: Pt acutely desatted in ED, was started on propofol, intubated for airway protection due to hypoxemia and somnolence, and then tranferred to the ICU.
It was unclear if this hypoxia was due to sedating meds taken prior to presentation.

Once extubated, he was started on Valium 20mg PRN CIWA scale as well as seroquel 100 TID.
He was initially recieving roughly 160 mg QD total and then subsequently weaned down valium to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] and Seroquel QHS by the time he left the hospital.

Ortho was consulted and recommended a splint/hard shoe to prevent him from bending his toe and possibly displacing it.
He was treated with indomethacin for 2 days.
