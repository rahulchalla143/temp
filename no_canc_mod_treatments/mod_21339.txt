She was born to a 25 year old Gravida 1, Para 0 to 1 mother with prenatal screens, B negative, antibody negative, Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown.
There was induction of labor but delivery was performed by cesarean section for fetal indications.
The baby was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of hypothermia.
One spuriously elevated blood pressure was noted on the day of discharge, but not confirmed by repeat and 4-extremity blood pressures.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   She was initially started on intravenous fluids, but started on enteral feeds the day after admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
She was initially able to take most of her enteral feeds of 80 cc per kilo per day mostly p.o., but subsequently required some gavage feeding.
She was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin until blood cultures remained no growth for 48 hours.
We attempted to wean her to an open crib on day of life two, but she was unable to maintain temperature and was returned to an air isolette.
