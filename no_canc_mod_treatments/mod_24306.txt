She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with a diagnosis of toxic megacolon following colitis which required a total colectomy and end ileostomy.
The patient had a protracted course at this hospital requiring tracheostomy placement as well as percutaneous gastrostomy patient for persistent respiratory failure and nutritional support.
It was found that her gastrostomy tube had become dislodged from her stomach.
She was draining tube feeds from her stomach into her perineal cavity.
The patient's G-tube was removed at [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital.
Vital signs were stable with a somewhat low blood pressure of 85/36, saturating 100% on some ventilatory support via her trach.
She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was treated initially with caspofungin which was later changed to fluconazole based on ID recommendations.
The patient received supportive care with ventilatory support as well as antibiotic coverage of her fungemia.
A nasojejunal tube was placed to initiate nutritional support.
The wound care nurses evaluated the patient for her multiple wound care issues, including a large sacral decubitus ulcer, stage 4.
This was treated with VAC dressing.
Her midline abdominal wound was also treated with a VAC.
I should also note that the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 **], 2 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed through the inferior aspect of her wound to drain any persistent collection which had developed from her gastric leak.
The patient was then evaluated again by the wound care nurses for her continued wound care issues.
She was also evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy to attempt to improve the mobility of this very debilitated patient.
This was a very difficult task given her morbid obesity and extreme debilitation from her several months of prior illness.
She was treated with aggressive nutritional support with 2 grams per kg of protein per day to assist with her wound healing.
However, she continued to have slow healing of her wounds, including her midline abdominal wound, her sacral decubitus wound, as well as wounds in her axilla which were felt to be hydradenitis.
The patient completed her course of antibiotics and continued to show slow improvement with diuresis.
Eventually her tracheostomy tube was removed.
Her [**Last Name **] problem remained wound care and poor wound healing despite aggressive nutritional support.
Increasing her mobility was very difficult due to lack of patient motivation as well as her extreme debilitative state, as well as morbid obesity in addition to her extensive wound care issues.
She was resuscitated with IV fluids.
She was initially started on fluconazole.
This was later switched to caspofungin due to fluconazole resistance of her candidal species that grew out of her urine.
She required volume resuscitation as well as pressor support to support her blood pressure.
After several days of antibiotics she was weaned off pressors and stabilized.
She remained in the ICU for an extended period of time primarily due to her wound care issues.
The nurses on the regular [**Hospital1 **] felt that her wound care issues simply required too much time and involvement for which to adequately care, so she remained in the ICU for wound care.
She continued to receive nutritional support with tube feeds via nasojejunal tube.
This was noted when tube feeds began to drain from her JP drains which were still in place through the lower aspect of her abdominal wound.
The tube feedings were stopped.
The nasojejunal tube was replaced under fluoroscopic guidance.
Tube feeds were reinitiated.
On hospital day #86 the patient was noted to be requiring increased fluid support to support her urine output.
The patient required an emergent trip to the operating room for intubation under fluoroscopic guidance for ventilatory support for respiratory failure.
She required pressor support with Levophed.
She was again placed on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem.
These ultimately were changed to Bactrim, tobramycin, vancomycin and Flagyl due to the multi resistant nature of this organism.
The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate, requiring increased pressor support in a worsening metabolic acidosis.
A discussion was held with the patient's sons, who agreed with a short course of aggressive therapy to see if this patient would respond.
A follow-up family meeting was held on [**7-20**] when a decision was made to discontinue with aggressive therapy and make the patient comfort measures only.
