Admission Date:  [**2173-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-5-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-8-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: MSSA endocarditis, nafcillin desensitization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pars plana vitrectomy [**2173-5-10**] Intravitreal antibiotic injection, [**2173-5-7**] & [**2173-5-10**] Transesophageal echocardiogram, [**2173-4-24**] & [**2173-4-29**]   History of Present Illness: 60F w/ ESRD on HD, DM she was transferred from OSH ICU for further management of endocarditis and MSSA bacteremia.
She was intiially at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was started on Vanc/Gent and TTE revealed thickened mitral valve with vegetation.
At [**Hospital1 2177**] ICU, she was desensitized to PCN and started on nafcillin.
She had some loose stools, was empirically started on flagyl, but then C. dif neg X 1 and flagyl stopped.
Past Medical History: ESRD on HD T/Th/Sat CAD s/p IMI DM2 HTN hyperlipidemia s/p CCY  Social History: -Lives at home, independently -never smoked -no EtOH -no drug use   Family History: father with prostate CA  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM VS: afebrile, SBP 90-100s GENERAL: very flat affect, NAD HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
IMPRESSION: Large mitral valve vegetation consistent with endocarditis.
Ill-defined low-attenuation in right more than left periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic microvascular infarction.
___________________________________ MRA/MRI of brain [**2173-4-28**] IMPRESSION: Multiple infra- and supratentorial foci of restricted diffusion as described in detail above likely consistent with thromboembolic ischemic events.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-4-24**], the mitral valve vegetations appear larger and left ventricular contractile function is more depressed along with inferolateral hypokinesis.
Ultrasound and tagged WBC scan did not reveal a source of infection in the LUE AV graft.
She was desensitized to nafcillin in the ICU.
Nafcillin was changed to vancomycin on [**2173-5-1**] out of concern for drug fever.
The patient expressed an unequivocal desire to forego valve replacement surgery.
Given their preferences, as well as high operative morbidity, that the patient defervesced on antibiotic therapy, and that a repeat MRI did not show further evidence of cerebral septic emboli, the medical team agreed to continue with 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy (through [**2173-6-4**]).
She may benefit from surveillance cultures and repeat TEE at the conclusion of her antibiotic course.
She was found to have evidence of endophthalmitis on exam and was treated immediately with intravitreal vancomycin and then with PPV on [**2173-5-10**].
#Clostridium difficile colitis - Started on flagyl [**2173-5-12**] to be continued for 1 week beyond the course of nafcillin ([**2173-6-11**]).
Maintained on contact precautions.
#End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis - Continued HD Tu/Th/Sa with vancomycin given per HD protocol.
#Diabetes mellitus type II - Well-controlled on an insulin sliding scale.
#Hypertension - Well-controlled on reduced dose of metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was started when the patient was hemodynamically stable.
Therefore, amlodipine and benicar were discontinued.
