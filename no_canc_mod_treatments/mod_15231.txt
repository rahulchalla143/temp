Admission Date:  [**2194-12-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2194-12-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2147-8-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 47 year old obese male with a history of end stage renal disease of unclear etiology on hemodialysis since [**2194-3-20**] complains of shortness of breath and chills during hemodialysis on the day of admission.
He was transferred from his outpatient dialysis unit to transplant surgery team at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of his arteriovenous graft.
During the month prior to admission the patient had positive cultures from his catheter at his hemodialysis for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Initially the patient had a subclavian tunnel catheter that was found positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in [**2194-9-20**].
That line was discontinued and a left upper extremity arteriovenous graft was placed [**2194-10-10**].
The arteriovenous graft was used prior to maturation.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin a few days later.
He completed a 34 day course of Vancomycin and a 31 day course of Gentamicin prior to his admission at [**Hospital6 256**].
In addition, over the weeks prior to admission the patient had multiple blood cultures drawn for unclear reasons at hemodialysis that were positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus that were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin.
The patient was not treated for this Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
He has a history of a lumbar abscess/osteomyelitis that required surgical drainage and [**Location (un) 931**] rod placement in the thoracic through the lumbar spine to help with spinal stability in [**2184**].
The only procedure was done was that his dentures were put into place.
His last admission with intubation was [**2195-2-19**].
The patient was sent home from the hospital with a Hickman catheter and antibiotics.
Two weeks after he discontinued for pericardial infection the patient developed spinal abscess.
Spinal abscess that required surgical drainage and rehabilitation (to learn to walk again) at [**Hospital3 4419**] Center.
Spinal instability requiring two [**Location (un) 931**] rod placements in [**2184**] after spinal abscess removed.
Five years ago the patient was extremely fatigued and was diagnosed with calcinosis in his skin.
At that time he started on dialysis for a few months.
He was doing well off of dialysis until last year at which time he was restarted on hemodialysis on [**2194-3-20**].
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, unclear of length and duration of time but the patient is on Coumadin on admission.
The patient thought that his Coumadin was to prevent catheter clot.
Obstructive sleep apnea, this is apparent in old note, however, the patient has never been officially diagnosed as he is not on a CPAP machine.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications include Epogen, Nitropaste, Nephrocaps, Iron, Renagel, TUMS, Coumadin, Lasix, Aspirin, Xanax, Vicodin, Milk of Magnesia, Reglan, Colace and Protonix.
In his 20s, the patient became involved with drugs but denies intravenous drug use (his mother believes he may have experimented with intravenous drugs.)
Shakiness after hemodialysis, increasing low back pain, old ASM.
Denies headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, neck stiffness, weakness, dysuria.
Sensitivities from his Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates from the outside hospital were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin, however, initial isolates from [**Hospital6 256**] were resistant.
Therefore the patient was continued on Linezolid for approximately one week.
Given the patient's history of a rash to Ampicillin once the isolate returned sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin, the patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for Penicillin desensitization.
After sensitization the patient has been maintained on high dose Penicillin without incident.
Initially the patient had high temperatures but once Penicillin was started his temperature curve trended downward.
Given his congestive heart failure, and embolic events, Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted twice during hospitalization.
At this time it is unclear if it will be done while the patient is in hospital or when he finishes his antibiotic treatment and goes to rehabilitation.
Intravenous antibiotics - Initially the patient had very poor venous access and therefore on admission to the Medicine Team a right PICC line was placed.
This was discontinued when the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for Penicillin desensitization.
After approximately one week the left subclavian line was discontinued and sent for culture.
A repeat right PICC line was placed for longterm antibiotic administration.
Treatment course will be approximately eight weeks of intravenous Penicillin.
The patient was started on Metoprolol and this was increased as tolerated.
In addition he was started on Digoxin with levels which remained in normal limits this hospitalization.
These medications aided in good rate control and heart rate way below 100.
Fluid balance was maintained with hemodialysis, fluid restriction and strict ins and outs.
The patient was admitted to the hospital on Lasix and this was discontinued as the patient only made small amounts of urine.
The patient remained dyspneic for a few weeks during hospitalization.
The patient was started on an ACE inhibitors to decrease afterload.
The patient was maintained on hemodialysis during hospitalization.
The patient had multiple episodes after hemodialysis where he became hypotensive.
He responded well to small boluses of intravenous fluids.
In addition the patient received multiple units of packed red blood cells during admission to help with his blood volume.
His left upper extremity graft was found positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and this graft was removed by Transplant Surgery.
A temporary right hemodialysis femoral line was placed for approximately one week and then this was discontinued and a right internal jugular none-tidal volume was placed.
Plan is to eventually have a hemodialysis tunnel catheter placed.
During hospitalization he had a drop in hematocrit multiple times and required multiple units of packed red blood cells.
During his stay in the Intensive Care Unit for Penicillin desensitization the patient had a change in mental status and Neurology Team was consulted.
The Benzodiazepine was weaned off and all other psychotropic medications were discontinued.
In addition, all unnecessary medications were discontinued including Reglan and Protonix.
Once these medications were discontinued, the patient's mental status improved dramatically.
At that time it was unclear whether this was a new neurologic change or residual effects from the patient's prior infection and surgery procedure.
The patient was transported to [**Hospital6 **] Hospital for an magnetic resonance imaging scan of his spine because they have a broader-based magnetic resonance imaging scan machine there.
In addition, the patient has had treatments in place that already decreased the value of the magnetic resonance imaging scan.
The patient was going to be intubated, however, due to time constraints and the patient appearing ill he was brought back to the [**Hospital6 1760**] to continue with his antibiotic treatments and heart failure medications at that time.
The Infectious Disease Team felt that if there was an abscess there, as long as there were no neurological signs an intravenous antibiotics for eight weeks should treat the infection.
Increasing white count - The patient's had increasing white count after about one week of intravenous Penicillin.
Plan is for a ten day course of Flagyl treatment for Clostridium difficile.
The patient was placed on Acyclovir for possible zoster for one day period.
Patient came in with increased INR - Over the first couple of days of hospitalization the patient's INR increased and therefore the patient was given Vitamin K with a good response.
He was treated for five days of aluminum hydroxide and his phosphate level dropped down below 5.0.
