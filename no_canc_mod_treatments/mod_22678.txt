Right femoral line arterial line placement.
He was taken to the operating room emergently and underwent a laparotomy first because his abdomen was positive.
Past Medical History: PMH: HTN PSH: none   Social History: married  Family History: NC  Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service and taken immediately to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, small-bowel resection, resection of transverse colon, and right femoral line arterial line placement.
He was again taken back to the operating room on [**2-2**] for repair of right diaphragmatic laceration, repair of duodenal injury with lateral duodenostomy and wide drainage, repair of right renal vein injury, decompressive fasciotomies x4.
On [**2-3**] he was noted with acute ischemia of his right lower extremity and was taken back to the operating room by Vascular surgery for ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral artery, contralateral second-order catheterization of right external iliac artery, abdominal aortogram, right lower extremity angiogram, iliofemoral thrombectomy on the right and vein patch angioplasty of right common femoral artery into the superficial femoral artery.
He required multiple follow up procedures by orthopedics for debridement of the bony injuries and VAC placement of his right elbow injury.
He underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2-9**] with partial closure of abdomen and application of open abdominal dressing and again returned back to the operating room on [**2-15**] for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of his abdominal cavity.
TPN was initiated early on.
He was eventually weaned from the ventilator and evaluated by Speech for a Passy Muir valve.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (linezolid/Meropenem) and fluid resuscitated.
On [**3-13**] he underwent flex sigmoidoscope which was within normal limits.
He was started back on TPN at that time.
A wound VAC was placed over Xeroform and he was planned to be on strict bedrest and lying flat for a total of 5 days in order to allow the grafts to take.
He continued TPN and remained NPO.
The VAC required multiple re-reinforcements during this week for leakage however remained intact.
On [**3-25**] the abdominal VAC was replaced and the skin graft was assessed and appeared to be taking well especially on the left side and remained well vitalized.
On [**3-26**] patient underwent right above knee amputation by vascular surgery.
He tolerated the procedure well.
On [**3-27**] his trach and Foley were removed and he was restarted on tube feeds.
He continued to have leakage of his tube feeds via his fistula requiring multiple dressings changes throughout the day.
He was eventually fitted for a prosthesis and at time of discharge was independent with wheelchair transfers and ambulation with assistive device.
At time of discharge he was on a regular diet, his TPN was stopped and he was independent with his dressing changes and activity of daily living.
