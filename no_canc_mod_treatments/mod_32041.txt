was initially admitted in early [**Month (only) **] to the OSH with abdominal pain and diagnosed with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis.
He reportedly had an NSTEMI during this episode and so was only treated with antibiotics as surgery was too risky.
On presentation to the ICU, he continued to complain of abdominal pain which he says was only improved with dilaudid but returns to the same baseline pain in between doses.

A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire Sludge, few small stone fragments, and purulent bile in small amount were extracted successfully using a 8.5 mm balloon.
Successful placement of a 10Fr 9cm biliary stent.
Given history of known CHF he was carefully given IV fluid support and his home lasix dose was initially held.
OSH cultures from blood grew E.coli pan sensative and he was switched from Zosyn to ciprofloxacin on hospital day #2.
He will follow up with ERCP in 6 weeks for stent removal.
The recommendation of the ERCP team that he be considered for early cholecystectomy was discussed with the PCP by both the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and hospitalist, and the PCP prefers to hold off for now given his significant cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities.

Given brisk diuresis on home lasix and increased dose of metoprolol, Lasix was decreased to 20mg daily to allow blood pressure room.

Controlled with one dose of IV metoprolol 5mg.
He was continued on PO metoprolol for rate control and increased on hospital day #3 due to persistent heart rate in the 130s, likely related to increased activity on transfer to the medical floor (now walking independently, out of bed).
His PCP has been holding coumadin given recent GI bleed but had planned to restart this on [**5-27**], so he was started on 2mg warfarin daily, to be followed by his PCP (discussed with PCP)   Medications on Admission: Home ocuvite 2tabs daily Omeprazole 20mg daily isosorbide dinitrate 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 40mg daily doxazosin 2mg QHS Metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Furosemide 40mg daily spironolactone 25mg Daily nitroquick 0.4mg PRN .
