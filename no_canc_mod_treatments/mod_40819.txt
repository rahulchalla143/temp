Admission Date:  [**2171-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-10-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: fish / Spiriva with HandiHaler / Lithium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration.
Per previous notes, he has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias of unclear etiology - he has a G tube in place through which he gets tube feeds nightly.
He also has COPD and is on 2 L of oxygen at home that he uses inconsistently.
He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia and improved, only to have a relapse of symptoms within days to week or so.
This happened several times in the spring of [**2169**] and by mid spring of last year, he was noted to have high levels of peripheral eosinophils as well as eos in his sputum (BAL [**7-/2169**]), and the patient was treated for worms given his exposure abroad.
In the summer of [**2170**], given gastroesophageal reflux disease and significant esophageal dysmotility, potentially leading to his recurrent pneumonias, a decision was made to place a G-tube, through which he now gets his tube feeds and medications.
Recently he was hospitalized for an aspiration event and was treated with levofloxacin .
On the day of admission, he developed a fever to 101; the night prior he said he felt short of breath after his evening tube feed.
He says his aspiration events occur at night, after he lays down, following his G tube feedings.
He was placed initially on a nonrebreather which was quickly weaned to a venti-mask, his saturations in the low 90s.
In the MICU, the patient was stabilized with fluids, supportive oxygen supplementation, and vancomycin + zosyn for coverage of HCAP.
His outpatient pulmonologist was consulted and the suspician was for aspiration pneumonia related to tube feeds as a precipitation for this acute presentation.
The plan was for 48 hours of IV antibiotics, with conversion to PO if tolerated for an additional 5 day course.
Nutrition was consulted for help to minimize aspiration events.
Past Medical History: Suspected Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] Recurrent aspiration pneumonia h/o PE s/p IVC filter MS (diagnosed in [**2158**], presenting with optic neuritis and lower extremity weakness) chronic back pain s/p spinal fusion depression bipolar disorder hypothyroidism henia repair multiple spinal compression fractures (thought to be secondary to prednisone use) COPD with 2L NC at home OSA with CPAP at home  Social History: 75 pack year h/o smoking; quit several years ago.
CONCLUSION: Low lung volumes, with bibasal infiltrates.
There is probably a large atelectatic component as an additional finding of note.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY:  Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration, admitted to MICU [**5-15**] and treated for aspiration pneumonia.
# Cough/Fever: Given his history, the most likely etiology was aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, as time course and presentation fits with this.
He was initially treated with IV antibiotics, and subsequently transitioned to a course of PO augmentin, on which he improved.
He was also given nebulizer treatments.
# Chronic lung disease: Patient has suspected Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], for which he is on a prednisone taper, and azathioprine.
He was continued on his original Prednisone taper set forth prior to this admission by his outpatient Pulmonologist.
He also continued on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
# Bipolar disease - continued quetiapine and citalopram .
# Hyperlipidemia - continued pravastatin .
# Back pain, leg pain - continued gabapentin, morphine, fentanyl  .
# Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine .
