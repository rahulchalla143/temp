Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-7-6**], mild aortic stenosis, moderate left ventricular contractile dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and significant right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis are now present.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ MICU course: Respiratory failure: Patient was empirically covered with vancomycin and zosyn.
A BAL was done and a large mucus plug was suctioned.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia, so he was run 3 L negative on dialysis with improvement in his vent settings.
Systolic Dysfunction: Patient's troponins were elevated on admission with TTE showing new inferoposterior hypokinesis, consistent with acute coronary syndrome at some point in the last several weeks.
He was on aspirin, atorvastatin 80, and metoprolol.
ACE-I was initially held given low blood pressures.
He was started on 81mg aspirin, atorvastatin 80mg daily, and metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **], then transitioned to metorpolol succinate 50mg daily.
Leukocytosis was attributed to stress reaction in the setting of recent procedure.
He was monitored on telemetry and started on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily.
Coumadin was not started given his other co-morbidities; the decision to initiate coumadin can be readdressed as an outpatient with the patient's primary care physician.
# Nephrostomy through kidney via patient's ileal conduit: Interventional radiology replaced replacement of 14-French nephrostomy cath via loop ileostomy.
# End Stage Renal Disease on HD: Patient on Tues/Thurs/Sat HD, which was continued through his cardiology floor course.
Calcium acetate was increased to 1000mg TID per renal recommendations in light of elevated phosphorous.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Trend phosphorous with labs at hemodialysis and consider decreasing calcium acetate if phosphorous is lower.
= = = = = = = = ================================================================ Transition of care: --Check CBC with next lab check at hemodialysis to ensure that white count has resolved.
--decision to initiate coumadin can be readdressed as an outpatient upon discharge from rehab.
--Trend phosphorous with labs at hemodialysis and consider decreasing calcium acetate if phosphorous is lower.
