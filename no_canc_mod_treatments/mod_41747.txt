Pt had recent hosptialization ([**Hospital 931**] hospital--> [**Hospital1 498**]) [**Date range (1) 23794**] for pulmonary edema vs pneumonia requiring intubation, lasix and ceftriaxone.
This morning, she was found to be in V tach again, sp shock then given amiodarone gtt starting this AM.
Acute systolic Heart failure: Pt found to be in pulmonary edema and was given lasix 60mg PO.
During hospitalization, she was hypotensive (SBP 80-90s) with leukocytosis (WBC 23) and was given vancomycin and zosyn for broad empiric coverage.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of CHF and VTach.
In the ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] she was initialy satting well on 2 L. However, she suddenly became SOB and required a non-rebreather.
Her arms and legs were cold with BP in the 80s.
She was transitioned to BIPAP 100%.
She was given lasix 60mg IV once with minimal UO.
She was then given 100mg IV followed by lasix gtt.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
She improved with BiPAP and was able to be weaned down to face mask after diuresis.
Nitroprusside and lasix gtts were initiated.
The patient diuresed nicely, was weaned off nasal canula oxygen and and was transitioned to torsemide.
We also initiated coreg and captopril to optimize hemodynamics.
She also has chronic atrial fibrillation and takes coumadin at home.
The coumadin was held (as was heparin gtt) upon admission due to suspicion of a splenic hematoma on OSH CT scan (see below).
After stabilization of her splenic hematoma a heparin gtt was initiated with PTT goal of 50-70.
Patient was started on amiodarone while in house loading dose 200 TID for 7 g total, pt was continued 200TID (last day [**8-1**]), then on [**8-2**] decreased dose to 200 daily for maintenance.
#BiV Placement: The patient went for BiV lead placement for more efficient squeeze.
On [**8-4**] surgery took her to for Upgrade of VVI-ICD to biventricular-pacer- ICD with addition of epicardial left ventricular pacing lead and transvenous atrial lead and she was also cardioverted at this time.
Patient was cared for by cardiac surgery for about 24 hours than transferred to the floors to have continuous care by the CCU team.
Heparin was restarted after surgery with goal PTT 50-70.
She was also on keflex for total of 5 days after her BiV placement.
She was discharged on coumadin and will follow up with cardiology in the outpatient setting to discuss how long she should be on coumadin and if she still is in sinus rythm.
ACS consulted and recommended to hold heparin/warfarin for Afib and no surgical indication as not a good surgical candidate.
Interventional radiology was consulted and decided no intervention was needed at this time because the patient's Hcts were stable and not downtrending.
Etiology of spleic infarct and hemhorragic conerversion werent clear however it is likely patient through a clot from her A-fib which caused splenic infarct then led to hemhorragic conversion.
CT surgery recommended we restart anticoagulation because of her Afib and we put her back on heparin drip with goal PTT 50-60.
Patient was not a candidate for revascularization in cath lab because the scans indicated that this damage was old.
A C.Diff assay came back positive, and the patient was treated with Metronidazole in house.
Last day of flagyl was [**2128-8-5**].
After the biV patient was on C-surgery floor and they restarted her home colchicine for gout.
Differential: pre-renal in setting of CHF and low intravascular volume, AIN in setting of penicillin antibiotics at OSH, ATN (preceeded by pre-renal), foley in so less likely obstruction and post-renal.
She was treated with supportive therapy including titration of BP meds and strict monitoring of her I/Os.
# Diabetes type 2: Patient was on Insulin sliding scale.
She was sent home on coumadin and discussion should be made at folllow up about how long she should be on it.
#Splenic hematoma: it appeared stable while she was here however this should be followed up in outpatient setting by her PCP #BiV placement: patient will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] who performed the surgery for BiV lead placement   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were started on amiodarone to treat this rhythm and it is now gone.
We attempted to place another pacer lead in your heart through the veins but needed to place it surgically instead.
You tolerated this procedure well and it seems that your heart is pumping better.
You should also follow a low sodium diet as we discussed.
You are on warfarin (coumadin) to prevent a stroke resulting from the atrial fibrillation.
