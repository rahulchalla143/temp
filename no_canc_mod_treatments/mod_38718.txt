No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Complete occlusion of the basilar artery with multiple acute infarcts in the right cerebellum, right vermis, and bilateral paramedian pons.
Top of the basilar artery, including bilateral posterior cerebrals and superior cerebellar arteries appear patent.
He did not receive TPA at the outside hospital.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU following an interventional procedure which recanalized occluded vessels in the posterior circulation (right vertebral artery and top of the basilar artery).
He was intubated on arrival and remained intubated for this procedure.
- He has remained hemodynamically stable during his course in the ICU and has not required IV pressors.
He was initiated on IV anticoagulation with heparin and received his first dose of warfarin on [**2127-10-22**].
His heparin drip was discontinued on discharge and should receive his first dose of lovenox at his rehab facility.
- He was plavix loaded in the interventional suite and while he was receiving both plavix and heparin, he was noted to have some oropharyngeal bleeding that was formally addressed by a bronchoscopic evaluation showing the presence of a traumatic lesion in the soft pharynx.
- He received a tracheostomy and PEG tube on [**2127-10-21**] and has subsequently done well on trach collar.
His tube feeds were reinitiated overnight, and they are currently at goal.
He has remained on trach collar for >2 days.
- He had a repeat MRI on [**2127-10-19**] which showed completion of his stroke with extensive areas of infarcts in the region of the midbrain and right cerebellum as well as partial recanalization of his right vertebral and basilar artery - His family has remained at his bedside throughout his stay.
Cultures have eventually grown out Coag positive staph aureus for which he is currently receiving IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
He is also receiving aztreonam so as to cover for coag negative staph bacteremia.
- Prior to his discharge, he received a PICC line.
His INR remained subtherapeutic in spite of three days of 5mg of warfarin QHS, and his dose was increased prior to discharge.
He can be on a lovenox bridge to a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
Please check coags daily especially while his antibiotics are being discontinued.
- He requires a total of 14 days of IV antibiotics.
His vancomycin, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin can be safely discontinued on [**2127-11-3**].
Please provide aggressive phyiscal therapy and occupational therapy for him.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], you received treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of the [**Hospital1 69**] for a stroke in the back portion of your brain.
Our neurointerventional team were able to fix the blockage in the blood vessels of your brain, but there was still a large portion of tissue that did not receive oxygen and nutrients for a long period of time.
The region of your brain infarcted is called the brainstem, which can control a variety of functions including swallowing, breathing and has passing through connections that control movement.
- Initially, you were placed on a breathing machine to help maintain regular breathing.
- Since you have significant swallowing dysfunction, you received a PEG tube that inserts directly into your stomach.
You can receive tube feeds and water through this tube to provide you vital nutrients that you need to recover.
- It is important that you try your best to participate as much as possible in rehabilitation exercises to help improve your strength over time.
- We initiated you on a medication called IV heparin to keep your blood thin and [**Hospital1 90846**] and prevent future clots.
This will be transitioned to a pill called WARFARIN or COUMADIN, which will do the same to your blood (blood thinner).
- You will receive antibiotics for a limited period of time to treat a blood stream infection as well as a pneumonia that you developed while in the ICU.
- In addition to these, you will continue to take CITALOPRAM for depression WARFARIN for blood thinning LISINOPRIL for hypertension SIMVASTATIN for high cholesterol INSULIN as needed for high blood sugars FAMOTIDINE twice daily to prevent stress ulcers in your stomach   Followup Instructions: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 830**], [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 718**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2127-12-24**] 1:00                                [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 162**] MD [**MD Number(2) 2575**]  Completed by:[**2127-10-25**
