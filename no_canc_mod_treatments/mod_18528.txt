The pt was given levoquin 500IV x 1, heparin gtt, integrillin, reglan.
A balloon was passed and inflated in the mid LAD but unable to pass 80% stenosis distally.
The pt was started on dobutamine and IABP for cardiogenic shock.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 84 year old male with PMH of CAD (S/P MI), DM admitted with STEMI [**2-13**] occluded mid LAD complicated by cardiogenic shock on IABP for BP support and PO amio for rapid atrial fibrillation, unable to be weaned off pressors and eventually made comfort measures only.
1) Cardiogenic shock - As per the HPI, the patient was initially put on IABP for pressure support post-catheterization but became hypotensive and was found to have severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm).
He was unable to be weaned off these medications, and after a long course, decided to stop the IV pressors and become comfort measures only.
2) S/P STEMI - He had a difficult PTCA to mid LAD only, with cath complicated by difficulty passing wire.
He was treated with plavix, statin, and ASA until made CMO.
3) New onset atrial fibrillation - This was treated with amiodarone.
4) Infection - He was treated with levofloxacin 250 daily for a UTI, then vancomycin, ceftaz, and flagyl for empiric coverage.
Cultures never grew any organisms, and the antibiotics were stopped when he was made CMO.
He was treated with bicarbonate, but this was stopped when his cardiac output continued to drop despite the treatment.
7) DM - He was maintained on insulin SS for tight BS control until made CMO.
