He had been started on Lovenox in the hospital and on Coumadin prior to being discharged for his venous thromboembolic disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on two liters of home 02 at night.
Never intubated, and not on chronic steroids, however, is frequently on steroid tapers.
He is also status post blood resection.
Prednisone 20 mg q.d.
A femoral groin line was placed and he was resuscitated with normal saline 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and four units of packed red blood cells.
In the Emergency Department, he also received treatment for hypercalcemia in the setting of his ectopy seen on monitor.
Chest x-ray was repeated after fluid resuscitation and remained unchanged.
LABORATORY VALUES:  Significant for a hematocrit of 41, which subsequently decreased to 21 after intravenous fluid resuscitation and a white blood cell count of 21.7.
Coags were unable to be obtained secondary to a laboratory error on the sample of blood prior to fresh frozen plasma being administered.
Patient was found to have had a hematocrit drop of 10 points, so he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit and received another three units of packed red blood cells.
He was kept NPO and observed and colonoscopy was performed by Gastrointestinal in the Intensive Care Unit, which revealed diverticula, however, no evidence of bleeding.
Otherwise, he will continue to be on Protonix and his diet should be advanced soon to full as he has been without nutrition for seven days.
Venous thromboembolic disease:  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter was placed as the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation at this point.
Intermittent atrial fibrillation while in the Intensive Care Unit:  The patient has multiple premature ventricular contractions and ectopy and also has atrial fibrillation, however, again, we will not anticoagulate given his ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding issues.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient has severe lung disease and he will continue using a steroid taper.
He will continue to receive his inhaled steroids Ipratropium and albuterol.
All of his heparin was stopped including it in his flushes and a hit antibody was sent.
Prophylaxis:  He is on pneumatic boots and proton pump inhibitors and no heparin should be used at this time.
Access:  He has a triple lumen catheter in his left IJ.
Code status:  He is "Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate," however, but after long discussion with the patient and his wife, and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**], who will act as his primary care physician during this admission, he may be cardioverted once should he have an episode of VTVF, which is not an unreasonable condition given the frequency of the ectopy which he demonstrates on the cardiac monitor.
