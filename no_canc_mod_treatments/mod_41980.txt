A propofol gtt was titrated to sedation to control seizure activity.
Neuro rec'd to continue the cooling protocol with EEG, check dilantin level and continue 100mg q8hrs, obtain LP to eval for infectious source of fevers and seizure, and to consider loading with Keppra or start midazolam drip if continued seizures.
Given fevers, she was given vancomycin 1gm, zosyn 4.5gm, acetaminophen 650mg PR, and IV potassium repletion and sedated with fentanyl and versed.
Patient was started on fentanyl and midazolam at this time prior to transfer to the floor.

This may still be the effect of medication and the cooling protocol itself.
Percutaneous pigtail drainage catheter is appropriately positioned within this cavity.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 y/o female with Hep C and recent bowel/biliary perforation s/p ERCP with drain in place who presents s/p reported cardiac arrest with ROSC after 2 shocks in addition to seizure activity and clinical pararamaters consistent with sepsis.
She was intubated at OSH.
She was started on cooling protocol upon arriving to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU and then re-warmed.
She was also on neuromuscular blockade during this time.
However, this had been performed while pt was on cooling protocol was likely unreliable.
She was broadly covered with vancomycin/zosyn initially.
Ob/gyn was also curbsided regarding possible removal of IUD but did not feel IUD was source of infection.
Her JP drain was sent for culture and grew pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
She was transitioned to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin PO.
JP drain fell out prior to transfer to medicine floor; surgery recommended no replacement of drain or reimaging unless patient was febrile.
Patient was seen by ID while on the floor who recommended her to be switched to IV ceftazidime for 2 weeks.
Patient had mild increase in WBC and transaminitis during day 11 of hospitalization while on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Patient completed a 14 day course of vancomycin on [**5-3**] and 2 weeks of IV ceftazidime on [**5-9**] with appropriate decreased in WBC and LFTs.
She was kept on continuous EEG monitoring initially.
She was followed by neurology who recommended initiation of dilantin 100mg q8H.
?s dilantin level was found to be subtherapeutic and she was loaded with 1000mg of Dilantin to therapeutic level.
She had been treated with Perc drain in perinephric space and abx course recently completed.
JP Drain fell out on [**2113-4-23**]; surgery recommended no replacement of drain unless patient is febrile.
Patient finished a 2-week course of IV ceftazidime on [**5-9**].
The patient refused to stay in the hospital for this procedure even after explaining her the high risk for spreading of the infection, her becoming septic again and potentially dying from this.
Prior to discharge she was given a prescription for ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] until she is instructed otherwise by her PCP or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].
# Diarrhea: After extubation, pt developed diarrhea associated with profound electrolyte abnormalities that required frequent monitoring and repletion.
She was treated with loperamide.
Diarrhea may have been due to narcotic withdrawal.
Patient was initially maintained on a 1.5L fluid restriction but given well-compensated kidneys and normonatremia, the fluid restriction was lifted with no issues.
She was seen by nutrition who initially recommended ensure puddings then multivitamins.
She was maintained on peripheral IVs while at ICU and ordered for IR guided PICC placement while on the floor for the completion of her antibiotic course.
The PICC line was taken out prior to discharge.
