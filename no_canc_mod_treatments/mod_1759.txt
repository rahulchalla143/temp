Admission Date:  [**2129-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-10-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: unsteadiness and Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-18**]: Bedside External Ventricular Drain placement [**3-23**]: 3rd ventriculostomy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 11950**] is a 56-year-old RH man with a PMH remarkable for recurrent neurocysticercosis involving his fourth ventricle (initially diagnosed in [**2114**]), s/p VP shunt placement *2 (last time 2 years ago), with secondary seizure disorder who p/w unsteadiness and headache.
However, he had completed three O and P examinations of the stool which were negative, arguing strongly against an autoinfection cycle.
The ID team has been considering the possibility of getting the relatives checked to rule them out as a source for a re-infection.
Therefore, treatment was held to avoid an abrupt lysis of the parasite that could possibly worsen his symptoms.
On the day of admission, he recalls having a constant headache of pressure quality in is retro-orbital area bilaterally that would wake him up.
Neurocysticercosis: *Diagnosed in [**2115**] with cyst in 4th ventricle, resected at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital (path confirmed dx), reportedly received anti-parasite treatment *[**12-8**] at [**Hospital 1263**]  Hospital reportedly treated again (albendazole/prednisone); worsened dizziness at this time *[**2124**] multiple admits for severe HA: persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis and actually treated empirically for TB meningitis; ventriculitis vs trapped 4th ventricle on MRI *[**5-9**] VP shunt placed *[**8-9**] VP shunt revised 2.

The tip of the first ventriculostomy catheter terminates in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The osseous structures demonstrate a right frontal burr hole at the site of catheter placement, and a large midline suboccipital subtotal cranial defect measuring 4.2 cm (2:6).
However, a new left frontal approach ventriculostomy drain is in place, and there is apparent decrease in degree of dilation of the third ventricle, now measuring 12 mm (2:34).
There is expected pneumocephalus in the left frontal lobe at the site of ventriculostomy drain placement.
Interval placement of left frontal approach ventriculostomy drain with catheter tip terminating in third ventricle.
Left frontal catheter has been removed, with expected pneumocephalus along the tract.
Minimal blood products were present previously and likely unrelated to tube removal.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11950**] is a 56-year-old RH man with a PMH remarkable for recurrent neurocysticercosis involving his fourth ventricle (initially diagnosed in [**2114**]), s/p VP shunt placement *2 (last time 2 years ago), with secondary seizure disorder who p/w unsteadiness and headache.
On the day of admission, he reports that he has been having a constant headache of pressure quality in is retro-orbital area bilaterally that would wake him up.
He was also started on acyclovir, which unfortunatley infiltrated and caused a reddened blister reaction.
Plastic surgery was consulted, and made recommendations to apply bacitracin and xeroform to the area, but no further treatment was indicated.
On [**3-21**], his external drain was raised to 20cm H20, which was tolerated well.
Upon rounds at 6:30 am, the external drain was removed uneventfully, and skin was approximated with several skin staples.
He received an emergent 3rd ventriculostomy.
