Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease, recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella pneumonia and sepsis.
She was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with moraxella.
She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.
She was changed to cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days, after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.
Her mental status cleared during her hospital stay and treatment of pneumonia.
Her coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of her admission.
She was dialysed for volume overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.
5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to that was in the low 30s.
She was transfused one unit PRBC with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26 throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
She should be continued on epogen with dialysis.
She had one stool that was negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease stool output given skin breakdown.
Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff.
She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement for oral intake to prevent dehydration.
She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.
It was resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].
