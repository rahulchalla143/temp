Admission Date:  [**2188-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2166-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Doctor First Name 147**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**] Chief Complaint: Pt presents on [**2188-5-19**] for one-stage Ileopouch-anal anastomosis.
Ileopouch-Anal Anastomosis 2.
Exploratory Laparotomy with diverting ileostomy 3.
He has been on chronic steroids, at a dose of 5mg/d upon admission.
Due to recurrent symptoms, pt wishes for surgical therapy.
In overview, pt tolerated initial procedure well.
Pt continued to be hypotensive requiring pressure support for several days, with significant accompanying electrolyte abnormalities.
On floor, pt had an erratic course with fluctuations in fluid status and severe fluctuations in heart rate.
In consultation with renal and endocrine services, electrolyte and fluid status issues were resolved, and patient discharged home with midline venous catheter for prn fluid support, and appropriate VNA services.
Pt underwent appropriate rapid sequence induction for intubation in SICU, and due to his open abdomen was maintained on propofol and fentanyl until [**5-31**].
This continued despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Upon transfer to SICU, patient started on levophed and pitressor to maintain blood pressures.
Gradually weaned off thsee drips with appropriate recovery of blood pressure, pt essentially normotensive by [**5-31**].
On [**6-2**] pt was found to have left pnuemothorax, and a chest tube was placed.
Appropriate suction therapy, wound healed and sealed and pneumothorax resolved by [**6-17**].
On night of [**5-25**] was administered stress dose steroids in response to tachycardia unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.
Electrolytes stabilized in SICU, and upon transfer to floor pt remained eunatremic despite significant fluid shifts and fluctuating urine osmolarity.
Pt tried on Florinef to assist mineralocorticoid function, but this was of minimal help.
Also considered was a diagnosis of solute diuresis, powered by excess urea creation from steroid therapy and increased protein intake.
ID: Although pt never had a confirmed infectious process contributing to his condition, he was started empirically on IV Levo/Flagyl on [**5-25**].
He subsequently developed oral thrush and Fluconazole was added to his regimen.
Although there was concern from Renal that excess protein may be driving a solute diuresis, the opinion of the surgical team was that in the setting of a large healing wound, a new ostomy, and general post-operative condition, the pt needed significant protein intake and as a compromise he was continued on a moderate protein diet.
Of note, pt was discharged home with a Midline for prn IV fluids until his renal issues (as discussed above) could be resolved.
GI: Pt with total colectomy and ileoanal pouch for UC.
Due to abdominal compartment syndrome of 6.27, pt was given diverting ileostomy and open abdomen to assist recovery.
Although abdomen was closed with resolution of intra-abdominal pressure, ileostomy takedown will not be for a while.
On the floor, pt gradually began having good flow from his ostomy, and in fact output became so high he was started on significant doses of loperamide, as his ostomy output was felt to be contributing to his general hypovolemia.
