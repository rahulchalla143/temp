[**2111-8-14**] 08:20AM BLOOD CK-MB-6 cTropnT-0.10*  Brief Hospital Course: Briefly this is a 53 yo Female with HIV (?off HAART wbc of 1.3, last CD4 of 217 [**12-8**]), CHF, AVNRT, HTN, HepC, Asthma/COPD (on 4L home O2, still smoking), LIP, ESRD on HD, who was transferred on day of admission from dialysis with chills, SOB [**2-3**] way through HD.
Pt received enoxaparin, methylprednisolone, vancomycin and ceftazadime in the ED.
Because the patient is immunocompromised and at risk for infections, blood and urine cultures were obtained as she was covered empirically with vancomycin and ceftazadime.
Gentamicin was then started, and ceftazadime and vancomycin were discontinued.
Per ID consult recommendations, gentamicin was discontinued.
ID was consultd, recommended continuing pt on her prior HAART regimen (abacavir, nevirapine, ddI) despite possibly not being adherent to these meds, the theory being that these medications would suppress her wildtype virus and allow for genotyping of likely mutations at her outpatient clinic.
We continued outpt regimen and carefully monitored for possible reonstitution syndrome given pt may not have been taking HAART as outpt.
Renal team followed patient during admission and HD was continued as scheduled for M/W/F.
She received HD at [**Hospital1 18**] on the morning of [**8-17**].
