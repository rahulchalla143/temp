He operates a tree stump removal business.
On admission a Chest X-ray showed possible lingular infiltrate that could be consistent with pneumonia therefore levofloxacin was started as well as high dose oral steroids for COPD exacerbation.
He was transferred to MICU for further management.
Brief MICU course: The patient was placed on CPAP with subjective improvement of his dyspnea.
After administration of low-dose morphine and lorazepam, he was able to sleep well night and subjectively felt better this AM ([**2147-2-14**]).
Back on the medicine floor, patient's respiratory status remained tenuous with continued dyspnea and tachypnea at rest.
At this point, patient had completed 5 days of oral antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia therefore he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
He was also restarted on azithromycin for immunomodulatory effect as well as IV steroids given his tenuous respiratory status.
A follow-up Chest CT confirmed a bilateral, multifocal pneumonia and antibiotics were continued to complete a 7 day course of vanc/Zosyn (last day on [**2-21**]).
These were effective, however on [**2-16**] he became delirious, unaware of his surroundings and agitated, pulling at lines, etc.
We were unable to place Foley and Urology was called for Foley placement.
They stated that he likely had chronic prostate issues and would need a Foley at discharge with urology follow-up.
Foley was dc'ed on [**2-21**] however he failed voiding trial and Foley was replaced.
He is being discharged to pulmonary rehab for continued recovery.
Regarding other chronic medical issues, for his atrial fibrillation he was rate-controlled with diltiazem with heart rates in 60-80's, anti-coagulated with coumadin.
His INR at time of discharge was 4.5 therefore coumadin was held.
Blood pressures were in good control with systolics in 110-130's.
