History of Present Illness: Per initial surgical HPI: 55M recently discharged after work up for bilateral thalamic stroke, PNA, line infection, NJ feeding tube placement, and UTI, was intubated briefly at that time.
In the unit, patient had JP drain placed in an abdominal abscess.
He also developed a UTI and was started on diflucan.
He had right hemicolectomy and end ileostomy with Hartmann's patch.
He was started on Vancomycin on [**10-23**].
He was intubated on [**10-28**] for inability to manage airway secretions and was started on zosyn.
He was continued on antibiotics.
Hematology was consulted and hypercoag labs were sent and he was anticoagulated with heparin bridged to COumadin.
On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for re-eval of abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail.
Following intubation he suffered a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3.
He was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin.
Pt now transferred to the MICU for further medical management.
The pt was intubated and sedated on arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient was weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
The pt was placed on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the floor with a 2-3L O2 requirment.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
Of note, his percutaneous drainage tube was removed on [**12-1**] after multiple days of <5cc drainage.
ID was consulted and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem out of concern for drug fever on [**12-3**].
Surgery was called but felt his abdomen did not require surgical intervention.
He received 1L NS and 10mg PO vit K for a potential IR drainage procedure in the am.
In the MICU, the patient had JP drain placed in an abdominal abscess.
He also developed a UTI and was started on diflucan.

A feeding tube is again demonstrated and is coiled in the upper abdomen as before, terminating in the region of the gastric body or antrum.
Paranasal sinuses, mastoids and middle ear cavities are clear.
Right lower quadrant phlegmonous collection at the site of the prior pigtail catheter measuring approximately 6 cm x 8 cm x 7 cm.
He now presents after evaluation at an outside hospital that showed a significant amount of free air on an upright chest x-ray.
Upon house staff examination, decision was made to take patient to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy for probable perforated viscus.
The cecum itself was large and patulous and the perforation was partially walled off with omentum against the right lateral sidewall.
The decision was then made to continue with a right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch.
Patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications to the operation.
Patient remained intubated at this time.
Major Events [**10-14**]: hypotensive responded to fluids; levophed [**10-15**]: weaned off levophed [**10-19**]: started tube feeds via dobbhoff [**10-20**]: cont lasix, cont pressure support [**10-21**]: extubated, doing well overnight [**10-22**]: abx dc'd...desat overnight--low 90's..encouraged to cough.
[**10-23**]: wound grossly purulent, minimally opened by primary team and cultured, VANC started for gpc clusters, CVL changed over wire.
bronch [**10-27**]: sputum Cx with GPC in pt with hx of Hosp Acquired PNA - Vanc started, [**10-28**]: reintubated secondary to large amount of secretions which patient was unable to clear, on vancomycin, zosyn for hosptial aquired pneumonia [**10-31**]: intrabdominal fluid collection tapped by ultrasound, diuresis to continue; spontaneous breathing trial tolerated for an hour and a half [**11-1**]: successfully extubated [**11-2**]:[**Month (only) **] TF 80/hr, NaCl nebs [**11-4**]: continue aggressive diuresis, no bronch [**11-9**]: failed swallow eval, switched back to PO lasix, coumadin 10mg started for SMV thrombus [**11-12**]: therapeutic on coumadin, dose decreased to 5mg [**Date range (1) 57528**]: Tube feeds continued.
INR 4.4, Coumadin dose decreased to 1mg.
He developed tachypnea, O2 sats 70s on bipap, 80s on facemask, 90s NRB and HR 120s on arrival to unit.
He desatted to low 80s in ICU and was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine.
The pt was intubated and sedated on arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient was weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
The pt was placed on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the floor with a 2-3L O2 requirment.
In addition the patient was also initially treated for a likely MRSA PNA given fevers and increased sputum.
was consulted and in conjunction with surgery a plan was made to continue treating with IV Linezolid for a duration of 14 days post the plugging of the surgical drain (once it is deemed to no longer be draining adequate ammounts).
The pt was also noted to have an enterococcal UTI in the setting of Vancomycin use.
This likely required further imaging and a Plastic Consult.
The pt has a hx of SMV thrombosis.
The patient presented to the MICU with a supratherapeutic INR in the setting of Coumadin and Levaquin use.
During the patients stay in the MICU, the pts tube feeds were at sub-goal levels.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
Pt's respiratory rate came down after nebs, and humidifying face mask on fio2 50% Pt does have sleep apnea with bipap at home and maybe a possiblity.
We held off on bipap/cpap since pt still at high risk for aspiration.
Subsequent CXRs in the following days were negative, and pt remained stable on RA (and no futher episodes of triggers until day of transfer to MICU on [**12-7**])      Concerning the pt's anemia, iron studies c/w ACD (ferritin 801, iron 15).
Pt also of italian descent - G6PD consideration, which was negative.
Prior to coming to the floor pt's factor V lieden, and prothrombin mutation were also negative.
Pt was continued on Coumadin for his SMV thrombosis, and it was not clear to Neuro what caused the SMV thrombosis and the thalamic strokes in the first place (on his prior admisison).
Pt's coumadin did become subthereapeutic at one point, and pt was started on Heparin to be continued until he became therapeutic again.
They also recommended to place his eye glasses and alternating eye patch for his diploplia [**3-17**] stroke to help with delirium.
Concerning his percutaneous drain, general surgery's recommendation was to remove the drain after 48h of scant drainage.
Pt was developing low-grade fevers of 99 axillary, so pt's standing order of tylenol 1g q8 was d/c.
The foley was changed but continued to grow only yeast.
ID was consulted and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem out of concern for drug fever on [**12-3**] (with urine eos).
Surgery was called but felt his abdomen did not require surgical intervention.
He received 1L NS and 10mg PO vitamin K for a potential IR drainage procedure in the am.
Pt was then transferred to the MICU for closer monitering, and had replacement of intrabdominal drain by IR the next day.
Sacral decubitus ulcer/Osteomyelitis: While on the floor, patient was continued on Meropenem and Linezolid for presumed osteomyelitis for a sacral decubitus ulcer that extends to bone.
He will complete a 6 week course of these antibiotics on [**2193-1-14**].
Plastic surgery also saw him at this time and sutured part of the wound that was bleeding.
They did not perform any more debridements due to risk of bleeding while on anticoagulation but recommended [**Hospital1 **] to TID wet to dry dressing changes.
His heparin drip was held for [**2-15**] days while we ensured his hematocrit remained stable and he no longer required transfusions.
They saw patient and examined wound on day of discharge and recommended wet-to-dry dressing changes with [**Last Name (un) 79605**] x approx.
Plastic surgery follow-up was arranged at earliest possible appointment.
SMV thrombosis/ CVA: Heparin was initially held x 1-2 days when patient had bleed from sacral decubitus ulcer.
Once hematocrit was stable and he did not have any further episodes of bleeding, heparin drip was restarted since benefits of anticoagulation outweighed risks.
He will likely need lifelong anticoagulation given venous and arterial clots and should have INR followed closely on Coumadin with goal INR [**3-18**].
His RLQ JP drain was removed in early [**Month (only) **] and he did not subsequently spike a fever, show any signs of recurrent infection, or have any abdominal pain.
DM 2: For his Type 2 diabetes, he was continued on Lantus which was uptitrated for improved glycemic control and he was continued on humalog sliding scale with good glycemic control.
Hematuria/Candiduria: He had some hematuria in early [**Month (only) **] which was felt to be secondary to foley trauma and resolved after foley was removed.
Patient completed 7 day course of Diflucan for fever and candiduria (from [**12-11**] to [**12-17**]).
Lesion on tongue resolved and lesion on finger was no longer tender at time of discharge.
PEG tube placement was recommended for nutrition given risks of sinusitis and infection with NGT but pt declined and preferred to keep Dobhoff NGT.
He was discharged on tube feeds via Dobhoff.
