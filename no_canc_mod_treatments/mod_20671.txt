Her issues during her hospital stay were as follows:  ID: The pt was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis v. intra-abdominal infection s/p chorioamnionitis and Cesarean section v. pyelonephritis.
She received single doses of Levo/Flagyl in the ED, then was switched to Amp/Gent/Clinda.
General surgery and gynecologic oncology consults were obtained, and expectant management with percutaneous drainage of her absceses was agreed upon as a reasonable option.
She underwent transvaginal drainage of one of her pelvic abscesses and her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl; she improved, and was called out of the ICU on HD#3.
She underwent percutaneous drainage of one abdominal fluid collection on HD#5, and another on HD#10.
She continued to have intermittently elevated temperatures and leukocytosis until HD#20 when she began spiking high fevers again despite continuation of her antibiotics.
Her Zosyn was D/C'd and Levaquin was started.
Antibiotics were D/C'd completely on HD#30/POD#7, and she did not spike further temperatures.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**12-6**] was normal; a repeat obtained in the ICU after her surgery showed evidence of new RV dilatation and hypokinesis concerning for cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary function improved in the ICU after her antibiotic coverage was changed.
Urine and serum eosinophilia were noted at the same time, and the question of AIN due to medications was raised.
Once the pt was stable from an ID standpoint, she was started on a prednisone taper.
She was managed conservatively until HD#2 when her clinical picture became suspicious for sepsis, and an NG tube was placed.
Her albumin was also noted to be low, raising the possibility of a nutritional deficiency as the inciting factor.
She received FFP prior to all surgical procedures and did not have problems with excessive bleeding.
