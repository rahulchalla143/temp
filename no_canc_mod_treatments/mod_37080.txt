[**2119-6-26**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with a seven-beat run of an irregular intrinsic wide complex rhythm of uncertain mechanism but may be atrial fibrillation.
Right PIC line can be traced to the upper right atrium.
Discharge Labs: Creatinine 1.9 Potassium 4.7 Sodium 140  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD, atrial fibrillation c/b tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM placement, CKD, asthma and heart failure with preserved EF, who presented with cough, lower extremity edema and hypotension.
Patient was initially treated with Norepinephrine for hypotension and diuresed on a Lasix drip, with a loss of approximately 12 pounds.
Chest radiography revealed a possible infiltrate and the patient received 8 days of antibiotics for a health-care associated pneumonia (Vancomycin plus Zosyn, which was switched to Cefepime, and, finally, Levofloxacin to complete the course).
No definitive cause of her initial hypotension was identified, though interrogation of pacemaker early in her hospitalization revealed several prolonged episodes of atrial tachycardia (one lasting approximately 50 hours).
Though she was treated for an infection, the ICU team did not feel that septic physiology was to blame for her presentation.
Diuresis had been held for 48 hours prior to transfer.
Diuresis was intermittently continued on the cardiology service with little improvement in her peripheral edema.
A diuretic regimen of torsemide 20 mg PO daily was eventually restarted and patient was discharged on this regimen.
Atrial Fibrillation c/b Tachy-Brady Syndrome: Patient had dual-chamber (RA/RV) [**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed on [**2119-5-26**] for Tachy-Brady Syndrome.
Patient was continued on her Dabigatran throughout admission.
Her Amiodarone was dose reduced from 200 mg PO TID to 200 mg PO daily as review of records indicated that she may have received a load as high as 25 grams.
Metoprolol required dose reduction due to hypotension and at discharge was prescribed as metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 25 mg PO daily.
Patient was continued on dabigatran at the time of discharge.
On discharge her Cr stabilzed in the range of 1.8-1.9 after several days of regular diet with oral fluids and torsemide 20 mg PO daily to maintain treatment of lower extremity edema.
She was evaluated for fracture in the ED but imaging was negative.
Leukocytosis: Patient presented with WBC count of 13.4 with neutrophil predominance though no bands or atypicals.
She received three days of Acetazolamide while diuresis was pursued.
No treatment was initiated in the acute setting, especially as TSH < 10, but TFTs should be closely monitored following discharge.
Asthma: Patient initially managed with Levalbuterol however was transitioned to salmeterol given concern for worsening tachycardia and compromising hemodynamics.
Hyperglycemia/Impaired Glucose Tolerance: Patient was maintained on a Humalog insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemic correction though only required this very infrequently and did not need to be continued at discharge.
Ppx: The patient was maintained on SQ heparin throughout the hospital course Code status: Full code Contact: [**Name (NI) **] (sister), H:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106094**], C:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106095**] Lines: none Access issues: difficult but possible with peripheral sticks Dispo: extended stay rehab facility   Medications on Admission: 1.

Fluid was removed with a diuretic called Lasix but the amount of fluid that could be taken off was limited by your blood pressure.
You will need to continue diuretics as an outpatient.
The following changes were made to your medications: CHANGE Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth daily x 10 days.
Patient is scheduled to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) in 10 days, and amiodarone dose will be adjusted as necessary then.
START Torsemdie 20 mg daily CHANGE Metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 25 mg daily START Salmeterol disukus twice daily  STOP Furosemide (lasix)  3.
It is very important that you keep the appointments with your doctors including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
