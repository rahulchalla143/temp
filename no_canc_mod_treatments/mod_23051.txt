Based on the location and her elevated blood pressure on admission, this was suspected to likely be a hypertensive hemorrhage.
In addition, she had no sensory modalities intact on the left including pin prick, vibratory, noxious.
A dedicated chest CT on [**10-29**] showed a right upper lobe mass-like consolidation with adjacent cyst or less likely cavity, as well as bibasilar consolidations and tracheal secretions.
The etiology of this was felt to be a small consolidation over adjacent cyst/bulla in setting of probably aspiration pneumonitis initiated during/prior to intubation.
Should she develop fever or clinical signs of PNA, HAP coverage would be appropriate.
She underwent a repeat speech and swallow evaluation on [**10-30**] which resulted in recommendations of a regular solids, thin liquids diet, w/ TID oral care and 1:1 supervision to ensure aspiration precautions, assist with self-feeding, encourage alternating between bites/sips.
She was seen by cardiology, who recommended to start an aspirin 325 mg when stable from neurology perspective, statin and beta-blocker, but would not recommend further intervention at that time given the inability to anti-coagulate in the context of her acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Aspirin 81 mg was started on [**2158-11-1**] and given no further neurological deficits was increased to 325mg as per cardiology recommendations.
She was also started on Lisinopril 5mg daily on [**11-5**] for BP control.
Her BP regimen included metoprolol 37.5 mg TID, HCTz 25 daily and ACE-I as above at time of discharge.
She was started on a metoprolol 25mg TID, uptightrated to above dose.
This was discontinued, however, the cord progressed and cellulities ensued, w/ subsequent ulceration of the skin and purulent material drainage noted on [**10-28**].
Of note, patient was also diagnosed with a klebsiella UTI, pansensitive.
For this and cellulities (presumed MRSA), she was treated with 2 tabs Bactrim DS for a total of 10 days, to be completed on [**11-9**].
At time of discharge, left antecubital fossa erythema decreased with no purulent discharge.
