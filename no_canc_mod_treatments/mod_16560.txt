HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location 1268**] after undergoing a left femoropopliteal bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
He had previously been on Lopressor and digoxin.
He was started on amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
He was subsequently started on pressors for hypotension.
Here an arterial line was placed, and pressors were weaned off with a blood pressure of 150/60 with pacing at 80.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoropopliteal bypass bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
Status post bilateral CEAs.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2175**], coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in [**2184-8-5**].
Right total hip replacement.
MEDICATIONS AT REHABILITATION:  1.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Ultram 50 mg p.o.
Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
Extremities:  2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally, staples in the right arm and left groin, sutures in the left foot, status post multiple toe amputations, cool extremities, nonpalpable lower extremity pulses, otherwise wounds are clean, dry and intact.
EKG at the outside hospital showed junctional fascicular escape rhythm at 64 beats per minute, retrograde PEs, ST depressions at V2 to V4.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter, who was sent from rehabilitation with mental status changes, and symptomatic bradycardia with heart rates in the 20s and hypotension.
The patient was eventually placed on a cardiac regimen including aspirin and Lopressor titrated up to 50 mg p.o.
Given the fact that the patient has a history of rhabdomyolysis in response to statins, he was not placed on a statin.
Instead, the patient was started on gemfibrozil on discharge.
We feel that this was iatrogenic in origin in response to getting an amiodarone loading dose of 400 mg p.o.
This was in addition to other nodal blocking agents that the patient was on including Lopressor and possibly digoxin even though digoxin was not listed as one of the rehabilitation medications, but had been taken previously by the patient.
Of note, in addition to transcutaneous pacing, the patient at one point did receive atropine on the field, at the same time he was started on pressors including dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
Even though the patient was able to maintain his blood pressure without the transcutaneous pacer, a temporary pacer wire was placed by the electrophysiologists.
The patient was placed on heparin while hospitalized for atrial fibrillation.
However, it was decided that the patient was too much of a fall risk, especially given his presentation, and heparin was stopped and it was decided that it was too risky to continue any anticoagulation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The patient responded well to 40 IV of Lasix with good diuresis.
He was initially placed on hydralazine and Isordil for question of renal insufficiency.
Eventually he was converted to captopril at 25 mg p.o.
On discharge, the patient will be started on lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Blood pressure:  The patient was initially bradycardic and hypotensive, had to be started on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
Beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up.
The patient will be discharged on Toprol XL 50 mg p.o.
and lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
There was significant concern, given the fact that this examination included fixed and dilated pupils, lack of corneal or gag reflex.
Apparently, the atropine that the patient had received stuck around in his system for more than the expected period of time.
The patient received Ativan and morphine which only made the situation worse.
Given the fact that the patient had been on heparin for atrial fibrillation, there was some concern for a bleed.
The patient's delirium was attributed to Ativan and morphine which stay around in the system given his age.
Also, the patient was being treated for presumed pneumonia at the time.
The patient was empirically started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was started on a two-week course of ceftriaxone.
However, we felt that the patient should receive a two-week course of vancomycin.
The patient received a single-lumen PICC line on [**2185-6-9**] for antibiotics.
Vascular:  The patient still has his staples in place.
At this point, the patient will receive a video swallowing study.
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Senna 2 tablets p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Insulin sliding scale.
Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.
Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoropopliteal bypass surgery.
