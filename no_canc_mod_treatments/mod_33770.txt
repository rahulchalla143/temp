The patient is post laminectomy from T10 through L3, with bone grafting noted at L1.
A drain has been removed from the left posterior paraspinal soft tissues, and fluid and small foci of air are seen in the soft tissues.
The amount is not increased since the prior exam, where a drain was positioned at this site.
Fluid is seen in the left flank and left upper abdomen at the site of previous surgical drain placement, not significantly increased from [**5-7**] when the drain was in place.
Replacing the L1 vertebral body, anteriorly, is a vertebral body spacer and morselized bone graft material.
LENIS [**5-10**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent anterior fusion with approach done by trauma team and surgery performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-2**].
A JP and a chest tube were placed at the time which were managed by trauma.
He required a transfusion for a low hematocrit with associated tachycardia.
The patient then had a posterior thoraco-lumbar interbody fusion on [**5-7**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He did lose some blood and required a transfusion interoperatively.
Additionally, he had 2 units of RBCS [**5-8**] due to a hematocrit of 20.
His 2 hemovacs were removed by neurosurgery and the JP was removed by trauma uneventfully.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had hyponatremia during his hospitalization which was managed with sodium tablets.
Since he currently is requiring pain meds for his surgical pain he will have to wait to go to an alcohol rehab facility.
He had been on prophylactic antibiotics while his drains were in place.
His fever work-up revealed there was no infectious process present, and the likely etiology was left sided pleural effusion; likely due to surgery performed there.
