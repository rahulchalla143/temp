HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old Russian-speaking female who recently had undergone a complicated postoperative course from an elective cholecystectomy at [**Hospital3 **] in [**2135-4-9**] who was admitted for a day of low-grade fevers, hypoxia, and hypotension.
The patient had gone to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) 958**] to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis which was performed there.
The surgery was complicated by a transection of the common bile duct and had to be converted to a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
She had recently been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and was on Flagyl since [**2135-7-11**].
In the Emergency Room, she was given 500 cc of normal saline and then started on a dopamine drip to which the blood pressure did respond.
She was also given a dose of levofloxacin.
Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and hernia repair in [**2135-4-9**].
Multivitamins one capsule q.d.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Imdur 15 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Zocor 40 mg p.o.
Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
Prevacid 15 mg p.o.
Augmentin which was given in the middle of [**Month (only) 116**] for ten days for pneumonia.
The CK on admission was 50 and troponin 5.7.
She was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime in addition to the Flagyl for coverage of biliary source as well as a pulmonary source.
She was also covered with Flagyl for the question of a recurrent C. difficile.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  It was recommended a HIDA scan which was done to evaluate for biliary obstruction and this scan was normal.
Surgery had recommended MRCP if the family desired more aggressive intervention such as ERCP to alleviate any stricture that might be present; however, this study was held off since the patient was improving on antibiotics and that ERCP would likely not be done by GI given the complicated anatomy given her complicated postoperative course.
She continued on her vancomycin, ceftazidime, and Flagyl.
She has been completely afebrile on the regimen of ceftazidime and levofloxacin.
The ampicillin was substituted for ceftazidime on [**2135-7-27**] given the identification of Enterococcus.
It was doubtful that this was vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus since the patient continued to improve on the regimen that did not account for VRE.
Thus, her final regimen is ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for two weeks duration.
The EF was 60% and there was mild aortic stenosis on this transthoracic echocardiogram.
TROPONIN LEAK: Cardiology was consulted for troponin leak in a patient who has a reversible ischemic defect found after her surgery at the outside hospital as well as multiple complications.
She did have yet another troponin leak but this was not deemed an indication for cardiac catheterization.
She was kept on adequate blood pressure control and was started on an aspirin as well as an H2 blocker for prophylaxis.
She did well on this regimen and she was gradually put back on her original dose of metoprolol.
PULMONARY EMBOLUS: She was put on heparin for subtherapeutic INR and held off her Coumadin until it was clear that no interventions would be done.
On [**2135-7-27**], she was restarted on Coumadin at 3 mg p.o.
She will remain in the hospital until she can be taken off her heparin drip when her INR becomes therapeutic for PE which should be continued for at least a total of six months from the time of diagnosis which would put her at [**2135-10-10**].
Even if a DVT is found, there will be no change in medical management and the patient is being administered pain medicines to keep her comfortable.
Discharge medications and diagnoses will be addended at a later date.
