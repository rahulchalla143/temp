Upon coming out of the shower, he was light-headed and experienced a sensation of rocking backwards and forwards followed by sudden-onset left-sided weakness.
He was given IV tPA at 9:12 AM.
Due to his initial improvement, Neurointerventional radiology were not keen to intervene, but he did go to the angiosuite after the above worsening, but the vessel could not be opened.

No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally but some difficulty with weakness on initail assessment.

CT C-spine without contrast: Final Report INDICATION: 68-year-old man with recent fall, with concern for stroke, to evaluate for C-spine fracture.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the cervical spine without intravenous contrast.
There is some degree of rotation at C1 and C2- correlate clinically-?
Informed consent was obtained from the patient after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
The patient was brought to the neurointerventional suite and prepared for General Anesthesia and was ready for puncture at 2:20 p.m.  Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions.
A 4 French Berenstein catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery and the following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed:  RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:  RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY FINDINGS:  There is almost total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery noted at its origin with questionable trickle of contrast into the cervical portion of the right internal carotid artery.
There is good flow noted in the distal left internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral arteries on the left.
The system was upgraded to a 9 French system and Merci balloon catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery.
Multiple attempts to catheterize the proximal right internal carotid artery using gold tip glide wire were unsucessful.
Unsuccessful catheterization and recanalization of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
There is filling of the right ACA and MCA via collaterals from the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Persistent right ICA occlusion with reconstitution of the right ACA and MCA.
LABS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: [**2118-6-8**] 05:00AM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-4.37* Hgb-12.3* Hct-36.4* MCV-83 MCH-28.0 MCHC-33.7 RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-244 [**2118-6-9**] 05:35AM BLOOD PT-23.5* PTT-83.7* INR(PT)-2.2* [**2118-6-9**] 05:35AM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.3 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 RHM with no significant medical history (he reports having not seen a physician in many years) who noted acute onset of light-headedness and dysequilibrium followed by left sided-weakness and significant dysarthria at 7:30 AM ([**6-4**]) after taking a shower.
He was administered IV tPA at 9:12 AM.
The patient was started on heparin gtt.
In the acute setting the patient required a nicardipine gtt with goal SBP 140-190's, he eventually did not require this anymore.
After his first two hospital days, the patient was started on lisinopril which was uptitrated to 20mg QD with a goal SBP of 140-180; some degree of autoregulation was desired to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in the setting of the fixed deficit (ie the persistent R ICA occlusion).
As his LDL was not at goal <70 the patient was started on high dose Atorvastatin 80mg QD.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, and has been recommended for inpatient rehab.
#Hypertension: Patient has had goal SBP 140's-180's, he previously was not on any anti-HTN medications.
We started the patient on lisinopril and uptitrated to 20mg QD.
He was treated with acetaminophen for pain and tolerated this well.
#Antiocoagulation: Patient will need anticoagulation for his occlusion for at least 3 months.
His INR was 2.2 on day of discharge, and he will continue his coumadin dosing and management at his rehabilitation facility.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) D/c to rehab 2) Follow up CTA at 3 months (scheduled prior to discharge) 3) Anticoagulation with goal INR [**3-18**] on coumadin 4) Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Neurology) 5) Follow up with Primary Care Physian - who could potentially follow the INR or help facilitate monitoring with the coumadin clinic.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 325mg qd Nil OTC   Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.
2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).

4. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
5. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Neurological Exam Prior to Discharge: Mental Status: Awake, Alert, Oriented to person, place, month, day year, able to name months of year backwards Cranial Nerves: Notable for Left Facial droop, on left lateral gaze does not entirely bury the sclerae, saccadic intrusions on lateral gaze, sensation equal V1-V3 bilaterally, tongue midline, unable to raise Left shoulder (CN [**Doctor First Name 81**]), inconsistent visual fields (on one trial extinguished to visual double simultaneous stimulation) Motor: 0/5 in left upper and left lower extremity Reflexes: unable to elicit reflexes on the L, right biceps and right patella 2; upgoing toe on right Sensory: No extinguishing to double simultaneous tactile stimulation (using face and arm)   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], .
You were given an IV medication to break up the clot, and then taken for an intervention to help remove the clot, although this was unsuccessful.
For this reason we recommended starting a cholesterol medication (Atorvastatin).
We made the following changes to your medications: START Atorvastatin 80mg take one tablet by mouth daily START Warfarin 5mg tablet (take one tablet by mouth daily at 4pm, your blood will be checked to see how thin it is with a blood test known as INR with a goal INR of [**3-18**]) START Lisinopril 20mg tablet take one tablet by mouth daily START Docusate 100mg take one tablet by mouth two times a day STOP Aspirin 325 START Acetaminophen 650mg take  one tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain  Followup Instructions: We coordinated an appointment with [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 110520**], MD and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (the PCP for purposes of insurance) Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2010**] on [**2118-6-23**] at 1:45 pm.
