), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF of 25 % on echo this admission), aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm), PVD s/p b/l AKA, s/p renal transplant (baseline Cr 1.2 to 1.4) who was admitted for hypotension and nausea.
PTA he had been in heart failure clinic on [**9-14**] where SBP noted to be in 200's; his hydralazine dose was doubled and his lasix dose increased.
Started on 2 pressors for blood pressure support with gentle IVF.
Per cardiology service recommendations, a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to help determine etiology of hypotension.
Pt weaned off pressors and began lasix diuretic therapy for CHF exacerbation.
Pt also being followed by renal service for elevated creatinine and for his status post renal transplant in [**2105**].
He was maintained on his immunosuppressive therapy of azathioprine, prednisone, and cyclosporine.
There was some concern for rejection on a renal ultrasound but the patient's creatinine had returned to his baseline  Pt was extubated [**9-30**].
Pt is now off pressors with stable blood pressure, breathing normally on room air.
Swan Ganz catheter d/c'd [**2119-10-2**].
This resolved with [**12-18**] Amp of D50 (to 131); his insulin sliding scale was converted from regular to humalog; his NPH dosing was adjusted to 10 units in the morning and 5 units at bedtime.
Per renal service, this was felt to be secondary to his renal disease and his Epogen was therefore doubled in dosing; in addition, the patient received one unit of blood before his discharge; blood was given with Lasix.
In summary, this is a 56 year-old type I diabetic male with 3 vessel CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, aortic stenosis, s/p b/l AKA,  admitted for hypotension after increases in blood pressure medication and admitted to MICU for hypotension, intubated for respiratory distress.
Found to be in cardiogenic shock necessitating pressor support and in CHF.
Perfusion: Three vessel disease not amenable to PCI, not candidate for CABG -continue aspirin and plavix -continue lipitor (40) -started smaller dose of beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5) .
Status post cardiogenic shock--now resolved, appears secondary to increase in his blood pressure medications.
-continue lasix at 40 mg PO BID -continue digoxin at 0.0625 mg every other day, check digoxin levels regularly -avoid lisinopril given renal disease -continue hydralazine at 25 mg PO TID -please restart isordil and uptitrate as his pressure tolerates.
PVD: s/p b/l amputations -continue aspirin and plavix -will need physical therapy from extended hospital stay .
2) Renal disease, s/p transplant, creatinine now at baseline -continue azathioprine, cyclosporine, please have nephrologist follow this patient.
-CSA levels to be checked regularly -if creatinine levels rise, please check renal ultrasound -renally dose all medications .
Status post 1 pRBC transfusion prior to discharge -have increased epogen from 4000 to 8000 qMWF -monitor hct -if pt needs further transfusion, please give Lasix (40 mg IV) before and after transfusion to prevent volume overload.
4) Diabetes, (type I) -In setting of renal insufficiency and renal transplant will need to be on Humalog Sliding Scale.
Also should continue NPH 10 units qAM, 5 units qPM.
5) FEN: Diabetic/cardiac healthy; please continue sodium and fluid restriction.
