Plastic surgery and orthopedic surgery were consulted and followed the patient during his hospital stay.
Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine films were obtained to clear the patient of any further fractures at these locations.
The patient was preopped to go to surgery on [**2127-3-7**] for the bilateral ankle fractures, as it was felt that the patient was not as edematous as necessary to postpone any surgical intervention.
Because the patient was nonweightbearing, anticoagulation was instituted, including Lovenox.
On [**2127-3-6**], the patient was kept NPO after midnight for surgical intervention the next morning.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2127-3-7**] where ORIF of bilateral ankles was performed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Postop, the patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and was transferred to the PACU and then to the floor.

On [**2127-3-10**] after midnight, the patient was again made NPO with fluids for surgery again the next day.
On [**2127-3-11**], surgical intervention including closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of a left finger fracture and ORIF of a right ulnar styloid were performed in the operating room.
The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well without complication.
Lovenox was again instituted after surgery.
Perioperative antibiotics were given for each surgical procedure.
Due to some ?scrotal irritation/inflammation, a 5-day course of Levaquin was also instituted and was completed.
