En route to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital the patient was given, nitroglycerin, Ativan, and supplemental oxygen.
Initial arterial blood gas was 7.18/100/499 on 100% nonrebreather and was electively intubated despite the clinical improvement.
Creatine phosphokinase and troponin levels were negative.
Orogastric tube and Foley catheter were placed and showed poor urine output.
The patient was given intravenous Lasix.
The patient was given intravenous Levaquin 500 mg, intravenous Solu-Medrol 125 mg total, Ativan 7 mg, and approximately 7 liters of normal saline.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department where he arrived intubated and sedated  He was afebrile.
The patient was given 500 mg intravenous Flagyl and 2 mg of Ativan, and his ventilator was set synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation pressure support 5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, volume 600, rate 14, and FIO2 of 0.4.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was obese, moderately distended, with midline surgical scars.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was intubated for respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia for retained secretions most likely due to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient was started on Lopressor and removed all of his diltiazem to control his heart rate, and the patient was started on captopril to control his blood pressure.
Trials using diltiazem drips and nitroglycerin to control his blood pressure and heart rates were unsuccessful.
On [**9-16**], the patient became profoundly hypotensive, so at this time the cardiac medications were being held.
The patient has been receiving fluid boluses with target central venous pressures of 12.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient grew out Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-positive) from two sputum cultures which at this time is being treated with a course of oxacillin for 14 days.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/BRONCHITIS ISSUES: the patient was continued on Solu-Medrol, Atrovent, and albuterol for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis flare.
He received a 7-day course also of Levaquin, but no pathogens were grown out except the Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum, for which he was placed on oxacillin.
Therefore, the patient was felt to be in diastolic heart failure and optimizing of his blood pressure and heart rate were attempted to be obtained before extubation so that he would try to prevent flash pulmonary edema which we thought might be leading to him having wheezes rather than just his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient received several fluid boluses with goals of obtaining a central venous pressure of 12, and his hypertensive medications were held.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was still intubated and in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
