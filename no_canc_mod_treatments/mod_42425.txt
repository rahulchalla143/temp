Admission Date:  [**2116-5-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2116-6-8**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 38-year-old woman with end-stage renal failure on dialysis with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus Type I, peripheral vascular disease, status post left below the knee amputation and multiple digit and toe amputation.
Status post right transmetatarsal amputation, status post parathyroidectomy, status post renal transplant in [**2104**], now failed.
Status post tracheostomy in the past.
Again, there is a history of Naphthalene induced coma.
She did have rising liver function tests which started to decrease however, amylase and lipase as of [**6-8**] were still rising.
She is no longer on Phenytoin and this level has not been checked.
Total protein was assessed 51, glucose 68.
[**6-2**] growing staph aureus coag positive sensitive to Gentamicin, Tetracycline and Vancomycin only.
[**5-23**] growing staph coag negative in [**2-9**] bottles sensitive to Clindamycin, Erythromycin, Rifampin, Tetracycline and Vancomycin.
One strain sensitive to Clindamycin, Erythromycin, Gentamicin, Rifampin, Tetracycline and Vancomycin.
The other strain sensitive to Clindamycin, Erythromycin, Gentamicin and Oxacillin.
This was felt to be due to hypertension as she came in with systolic blood pressures above 200 and her family stated she had been non-complication with her anti-hypertensives at home.
On the day of admission she was intubated for apneic spells and her family decided that she would wish to be "Do Not Resuscitate" but not DNI.
Neurosurgery subsequently placed ventricular drain and initially she was loaded on Dilantin for a question of seizures.
So the Dilantin was discontinued eventually and the patient has not had any witnessed seizure activity.
The decision has been made to place a ventriculoperitoneal shunt this week.
She does seem to be mor somnolent prior to dialysis and after dialysis will eventually become more awake.
Dialysis has continued through her Quinton catheter.
Instead of removing this catheter, the decision was made to treat through this infection and Vancomycin was started.
Additionally the patient has been growing staph coag positive in her sputum and again she is on Vancomycin for this.
She did develop some loose stools and C. diff was sent which was positive and the patient was started on Flagyl for treatment of this.
They also recommended empiric treatment for gram negative rods which was started on [**2116-6-7**] in the form of Ceftazidime.
The [**Last Name (un) 3208**] has been following and recommending Humalog sliding scale as well as insulin in the TPN while she was on TPN.
Also to cover her with Lantis at night.
She was started on Reglan as well as Erythromycin.
It was felt that Erythromycin may be contributing to worsening of the C. Diff so this was stopped and it was unclear as to whether the Reglan was increasing her LFTs and this was stopped.
The patient did improve eventually and a J-tube was placed and tube feeds were then restarted after a couple of weeks of TPN.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has been continued on Nicardipine, Labetalol and Hydralazine in order to keep her systolic blood pressure below 150.
anti-hypertensives and today has been started on Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
twice a day and the Labetalol drip has been stopped.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] remains ventilated and at some point this week the plan is for her to receive a tracheostomy.
For now the patient remains stable condition in the neurological Intensive Care Unit and the oncoming [**Male First Name (un) **] will dictate the rest of the hospital course and all of the discharge instructions and medication as well as any follow-up that may be needed.
