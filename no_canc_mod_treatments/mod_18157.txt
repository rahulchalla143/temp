He was continued on lactulose and initially intubated for airway protection but extubated two days later.
Fresh frozen plasma was given to decrease his INR less than 1.6 for bleeding from his A-line site.
CIRRHOSIS SECONDARY TO ALCOHOL ABUSE:  Evidence on ultrasound and stigmata present on examination.
ALCOHOL ABUSE:  Continue proton pump inhibitor, thiamine, folate, lactulose.
