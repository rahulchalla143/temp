Pain management was also an issue with IV dilaudid, PCA, and fentanyl patch being utilized.
She was discharged to rehab on lovenox for anticoagulation, sodium thiosulfate for calciphlaxis, PO dilaudid, fentanyl patch, and APAP for pain.
She has apparently been receiving extra sessions on Thursday for ultrafiltration per [**Hospital 100**] rehab notes.
She received [**Hospital 2286**] on day of admission with HD stopped after approximately 3.7 L was removed secondary to shivering, RVR to 130s, and asymptomatic SBP drop to mid-80s.
For her fever, she was cultured and started on vancomycin and imipenum.
Given the concern for hypotension in the setting of a febrile illness with unknown source, she was started on vancomycin 1g IV and cefepime 2 gm IV.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2108-9-6**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Blood cultures from rehab facility in early [**Month (only) 216**] before coming to hospital: Blood positive for Enterobacter:  Sensitive to bactrim, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone (<8), cefepime,cipro, gent, penems, levo, zosyn.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to pubic symphysis after administration of intravenous, but not oral contrast.
Scattered calcifications in the liver compatible with prior granulomatous disease.
Numerous surgical clips are seen in the anterior abdominal wall with ventral hernia again noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F ESRD on HD complicated by calciphylaxis, atrial fibrillation on lovenox, DM2, OSA, hypothyroidism, HL, depression presenting with hypotension from [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] likely secondary to hypovolemia and sepsis.
# Sepsis Pt was found to be bacteremic with multiple organisms including enterobacter, pseudomonas (grew through HD line), and coag negative staph though this latter organism may have been a contamination.
Initially, broad spectrum was given with vancomycin and cefepime and narrowed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Notably, pt has penicillin allergy but tolerates higher gen cephalosporins without issue.
Pt was given a line holiday for two days as her TDC and midline were pulled.
After 48 hours clear with no growth of cultures, pt had TDC replaced and returned to [**Year (4 digits) 2286**].
No midline or PICC was placed for IV antibiotics as this will be done at the pt's LTAC.
Pt became afebrile with return of baseline WBC count.
Calciphylaxis and [**Date range (1) 197**] Necrosis: Patient has breast lesions consistent with [**Date range (1) **] necrosis and calciphylaxis in other areas particularly in lower extremities.
She finished her course of sodium thiosulfate without much resolution and was started on IV pamdironate 30 mg QOD with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 805**], renal attending, following.
# Pain [**2-29**] to calciphylaxis: Methadone was stopped as it seemed to coincide with her episodes of nausea.
Pt titrated to a regimen of reasonable pain control with standing Oxycontin, hydromorphone for breakthrough, and standing gabapentin and acetaminophen.
On MWF 100 mg Enoxaparin.
# ESRD She is on a M,W,Th,F HD schedule and receiving her vanc and ceftazidime Stopped sevelamer since phosphates running low.
# DM2 She was kept on her home insulin regimen.
# OSA She was continued on home CPAP (14 cm and 4 L O2).
# Gout She was continued on allopurinol.
# Rhinitis She was continued her nasal spray.
Will likely need ultrasound for better characterization of this.
