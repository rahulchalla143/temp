Tip of the Foley catheter within the distal ureter of the transplanted kidney causing mild hydroureteronephrosis.
53 y/o immunosuppressed female s/p renal transplant in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2172**], presenting from PCP's office with three weeks of chills, now with documented fevers tachycardia, borderline hypotension, and hypoglycemia.
Sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia: On presentation, meet SIRS criteria with fevers, tachycardia and mild bandemia from suspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression.
Pancultured in the emergency department and placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime.
Stool cx returned positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.
Blood cx from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).
The patient was transiently hypotensive in the emergency department, but responded to fluid boluses.
Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative for 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin.
Pt was advised to continue vanco for 2 weeks more after completing 2 week course of cipro.
Of note, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued as well prior to discharge given leukopenia.
Bactrim and valcyte, though also can cause leukopenia, were continued as pt has been on these for a long time without complications.
ESRD s/p transplant: History of lupus nephritis s/p renal transplant on cellcept, tacrolimus and prednisone.
The patient may have chronic volume depletion, she is on bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] which may artifactually increase creatinine.
During hospitalization, renal function was trended daily and patient continued on immunosuppressants with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Daily tacrolimus levels were also followed with level adjusted as needed.
Cellcept was discontinued prior to discharge given leukopenia (as above).
Pt has f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levels rechecked and to check WBC count, will modulate immunosuppression regimen based on those results.
Antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation with warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing elevated IgG and normal IgM in [**3-17**] and [**7-17**]) with multiple prior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula.
PT/INR followed daily with warfarin supratherapeutic on [**10-6**] to 4.7.
Coumadin was restarted at 1mg daily with f/u day after discharge to check INR levels and to adjust coumadin accordingly.
Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension treated with metoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurements documented in the 110-140 range, per OMR.
Given systemic HTN, home metoprolol initially held but restarted prior to discharge.
Not currently receiving treatment, but was taking simvastatin through [**2172-3-11**].

You have an infection in your bowels called C diff which can be contracted while on immunosuppression and during hospitalizations.
You are being treated for both infections with antibiotics.
Your INR level has been higher than optimal because your antibiotics can interfere with coumadin.
We have made the following changes to your medications: Decrease your tacrolimus to 2mg twice a day Take cipro for 11 more days (last day = [**10-20**]) Take vancomycin for 25 more days (last day = [**11-3**]) Stop taking mycophenolate mofetil (cellcept) until you follow up with the kidney transplant doctors Continue to take coumadin 1mg daily, but have your INR checked at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-11**] to make sure it is therapeutic  Followup Instructions: The following appointments have been scheduled for you: .
