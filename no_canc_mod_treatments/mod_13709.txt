Now she is s/p ORIF ([**2170-7-14**]) with hospital course complicated by hypotension, tachycardia and acute hypoxemia.
Once she was transferred to the medicine floor, she underwent placement of a short leg cast.
Her pain was controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.
Additionally she should continue to take lovenox unil [**6-27**] for DVT prophylaxis.
Following the procedure she was brought to the TSICU for further management.
She was treated with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, pain control, and antipsychotics for agitation.
She was also maintained on her nebulizer treatments and inhalers.
There was no evidence of PE, but she was found to have tracheomalacia of uncertain chronicity.
Upon arrival to the floor she continued to have need for supplemental oxygen.
She was started on broad antibiotic coverage for presumed aspiration PNA and HCAP.
Her hypoxemia improved and she was weaned off of supplemental oxygen.
She was discharged on flagyl and bactrim for a total course of 10 days to end on [**8-1**].
The geriatrics service was consulted, and recommended adjustments to her medications which improved her agitation.
She received standing plus PRN haloperidol with good effect, along with acetaminophen and oxycodone for pain control.
She had close monitoring of her QTc, with frequent EKG monitoring.
Upon transfer to the floor she was noted to have some cogwheeling so her haldol was replaced with seroquel with good effect.
We treated her hypernatremia with gentle hydration with D5W and encouraging PO intake.
# Nutrition: Per nursing in TSICU, there was concern for possible aspiration of foods when eating.
Following formal evaluation by Speech and Swallow, she was placed on a pureed diet with nectar thick liquids, crushed pills and 1:1 eating assistance.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Tracheomalacia discovered on CTA chest- may need follow-up with pulmonary to determine need for possible stenting - Continued titration of her delirium medications will likely be required - Ortho follow-up next week for cast removal.
Anticoagulation post-op should be discontinued this weekend.
