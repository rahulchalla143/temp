In [**2198-7-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] deemed him to be too high risk for surgery due to extensive aortic calcification.
He subequently underwent aortic valvuloplasty in [**2198-10-3**].
He was subquently referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for off pump CABG, with the possibility of aortic valve replacement.

A guidewire is seen in the descending aorta during femoral cannulation.
There is a small paravalvular leak which improved with protamine administration.
LV systolic function appeared severely depressed immediately after separation from bypass and slowly improved with administration of inotropes.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61512**] was admitted and underwent routine preadmission testing and hemodialysis.
On [**2199-2-8**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm Pericardial)/Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery, vein graft to ramus), and  Aortic Endarterectomy.
Cross Clamp time=180 minutes.
Please see operative note for surgical details.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated on multiple pressors and inotropy to optimize cardiac function.
Renal continued to follow postoperatively for his ESRD/dialysis needs.
Mr.[**Known lastname 61512**] was kept intubated to protect his airway while maintaining stable hemodynamics until POD# 5.
Pressors and inotropy were weaned off.
Beta-blockers/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis was initiated.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation was treated with Amiodarone and beta-blocker.
Electrophysiology was consulted and a temporary transvenous wire was placed.
Beta-blockade and Amio were held to allow for recovery.
Transvenous pacing wire was discontinued on [**2-19**].
Anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin secondary to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Supratherapeutic INR was treated with holding anticoagulation, reversal with vitamin K  and fresh frozen plasma, and gentle dosing with Coumadin was resumed.
All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Antibiotics for Clostridium Difficile was initiated.
A Midline was placed for access.
Hemodialysis was conducted per Renal.
He continued to progress and on POD# 17 he was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] for further progress in strength, mobility, and daily activities.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 85178**] to follow Coumadin dosing/INR once Mr [**Known lastname 61512**] has been discharged from rehab.
