Admission Date:  [**2112-10-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-11-4**]   Service:  THORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation requiring a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement in [**2110**] who had a complicated recovery since the surgery with pneumonia and a history of intubation and tracheostomy.
The patient was complaining of progressive dyspnea since his recovery from the cardiac surgery and was evaluated with a CAT scan in [**2111-7-13**] and was found to have high tracheal stenosis at the level of the thoracic inlet with the lumen approximately 7 mm in diameter.
However, the patient was hesitant in seeking help and finally consulted Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of Interventional Pulmonology and presents for a flexible bronchoscopy on the day of admission.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to phenothiazine, Demerol, and iodine-based IV contrast.
Chemistries revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, C02 26, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9 with a glucose of 115, calcium 9.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphate 3.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to have severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was admitted for further observation and management.
Because of his subtherapeutic anticoagulation, the patient was started on a heparin drip with a goal to titrate up to PTT of 60-80.
The patient was started on a beta blocker preoperatively.
The patient was evaluated by the Thoracic Surgery Service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as consulted by Interventional Pulmonology and for possible surgical intervention.
At the time, Mr. [**Known lastname 50980**] and his family said that they did not want a tracheostomy nor did they want a T tube and stated that he would prefer to die than to have those procedures.
Therefore, the patient was recommended a tracheal resection and reconstruction or a bronchoscopic procedure.
After the risks of the surgery was fully explained and all questions were answered and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the OR on [**2112-10-31**] for a possible tracheal resection and reconstruction.
However, this procedure was aborted due to the inability to establish with any degree of certainty that the anastomosis would be due without any undue tension.
The patient went ahead with the alternative plan for a bronchoscopic approach and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with dilatation and stent of the proximal tracheal stenosis on [**2112-10-31**] by Interventional Pulmonology.
On video swallow study, the patient demonstrated aspiration with nectar-thick liquids and thin liquids and the patient was initially placed on n.p.o.
The patient tolerated a pureed diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.
The patient was also started on Coumadin per his schedule and continued on IV heparin and because his INR was not therapeutic the patient was converted over to Lovenox anticoagulation therapy at 70 mg subcutaneously q.
