She received her second HD treatment on [**2138-9-11**].
Cyclophosphamide was considered, but not started given concern for toxicity due to age.
Oxygen delivery was increased progressively from 3L to 6L nasal cannula.
She was given Lasix 40mg IV x2 with minimal urine output.
Ischemic colitis was also considered given underlying vasculitis.
Patient also with chronic anemia.
She has required 2 pRBC transfusions during this hospital course.
Patient also with uncomplicated UTI treated with ciprofloxacin PO x3 days on admission.
She was urgently intubated given respiratory distress.

[**2138-9-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema which is now moderate, stable bibasilar pleural effusions with satisfactory position of the ET tube and right central venous line.
Shortly after admission, she was started on hemodialysis and did not demonstrate any signs of renal recovery.
Her INR was slightly elevated to 1.3 on admission and had minimal improvement with Vitamin K administration.
However, the diagnosis of lupus anticoagulant was not deemed relevant to the above diagnosis.
Patient was initially continued on her home regimen for hypertension with the exception of her [**Last Name (un) **] which was held due to renal failure.
However, when ANCA came back as positive, her hydralazine was discontinued given the known association between pauciimmune ANCA positive glomerulonephritis and hydralazine usage.
She was then placed on labetalol with improvement in her blood pressure.
She was started on high dose steroids and cytoxan with remarkable improvement in her respiratory status from intubation to being on room air.
Over the course of her admission, she became remarkably weak and dependent for her activities of daily living, in addition to being dialysis dependent.
Removal of her central line was required before discharge, and in discussion with the family about the risks of taking the patient off the floor for the procedure, it was determined that the goal of getting the patient home was worth the risk.
