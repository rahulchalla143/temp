HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, polymyalgia rheumatica, and osteoporosis who presents with fatigue and nausea after taking an accidental extra dose of 240 mg of sustain release verapamil and his first ever dose of atenolol (12.5 mg).
He took atenolol and began to feel fatigued and nauseated with substernal chest pain.
The patient also has been complaining of increased palpations and vision dimming lately which precipitated the addition of atenolol in the setting of the patient's history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
He also had a transcutaneous temporary wire placed and was then in a normal sinus/an accelerated junctional rhythm.
Verapamil sustain release 240 mg by mouth once per day (as    noted, the patient took and extra dose on the morning of    admission).
Atenolol 12.5 mg by mouth once per day (which the patient    started today).
Glucovance 5/500 mg by mouth in the morning and 2.5/500 mg    by mouth in the evening.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once per day.
Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Novolog 6 units in the morning and 4 units in the evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, his pulse was 80 (which was paced), his blood pressure was 40 to 113/19 to 70, and he was on 100 percent FiO2 and intubated with a respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume was 600, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
A troponin was negative.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and endotracheal tube in good position.
The pacing wire was also well positioned.
The patient was initially    started on dopamine and then transitioned to phenylephrine    for blood pressure support.
The patient was initially maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible infection.
He was also initially given stress-dose steroids as there was concern that he may have possible adrenal insufficiency given he is on chronic steroids.
Eventually, the patient's blood pressure began to recover as the nodal agents worked off and his pacemaker was functioning.
He was initially started on a labetalol drip as well as hydralazine for blood pressure control.
Therefore, he was started on metoprolol and verapamil for blood pressure control and heart rate control.
The patient was eventually continued on verapamil 40 mg by mouth q.8h.
and was then switched from metoprolol to labetalol for further blood pressure control; however, the patient stated that he felt extremely dizzy, and the team attributed this to his beta blocker dose.
Therefore, he was continued on just verapamil 40 mg by mouth q.8h., and his blood pressures subsequently returned to [**Location 213**].
On [**2107-6-24**], the patient had a dual-chamber pacemaker inserted.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not have any evidence of hematoma around the pacemaker pocket.
OTHER ISSUES:  As noted, the patient was initially    intubated for airway protection in the setting of    receiving 7 liters of fluid.
The patient was eventually    weaned from intubation and was extubated without incident.
He was given Lasix as needed as he was clearly volume    overloaded from having received large volume    resuscitation.
The patient was continued on an insulin sliding scale for his type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Calcium channel overdose with resultant intubation and    large volume resuscitation.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Metformin 1000 mg by mouth in the morning.
Pravastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
