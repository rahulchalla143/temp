You were treated with a procedure called ERCP which allows for proper drainage of the biliary system.
Your blood infection was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was eradicated.
Your left heel was involved in this infection, and you subsequently underwent a below-the-knee amputation of your left leg, followed by a revision of the amputation.
We stopped the TPN and placed a tube into your nose for nutrition.
We started you on antibiotics and removed an IV, which was likely the source of infection.
You will need to have antibiotics till [**2130-9-30**].
The updated list of your medications is included.
