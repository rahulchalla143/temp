continued ot have VT in the ED, and the patient was was started on lidocaine and amiodarone drips and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
Amiodarone load and lidocaine drip was discontinued without any further episodes of VT.
He has LAD 40% ostial lesion, left circumflex, 70% ostial lesion, RCA 40% mid lesion with patent left circ.
Review of PMH shows recent MCA stroke, with need for walker at baseline.
No report of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CAD status post 1v CABG (SVG-->OM).
PEA arrest in [**2197**] s/p hernia repair with prolonged intubation.
Lumbar stenosis 16.  sternal nonunion after CABG [**07**].
Pacer wire is noted in right heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
ETT performed on [**11-8**] demonstrated: A Dobutamine stress echo was carried out during which time peak HR of 127bpm was obtained (86% of maximum predicted HR).
Unfortunately, LVOT velocity could not be obtained either at rest or at peak dose Dobutamine, therefore aortic valve area could not be calculated.
These findings however appear to be most consistent with a cardiomyopathy with moderate AS rather than hemodynamic insignificant AS.

No benefit with vagal maneuver, carotid massage so IV lidocaine was given, amiodarone and mexiletine were discontinued and patient was switched to quinidine.
Patient had his lower pacing rate increased to 75bpm and subsequently, patient had no more episodes of VT. His mexiletine was titrated up to 648mg TID with QT of 560 which was corrected for wide QRS to 480ms which was minimally changed from his pre-quinidine QT.
He had no episodes of VT on this regimen and was discharged on telemetry monitoring with paced HR ranging in 70s.
Patient continued on statin, zetia, receiving aspirin via aggrenox.
