Admission Date:  [**2182-1-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2182-2-10**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old male who is status post pacemaker placement in [**2171**] for complete heart block who presents this admission for pacer and lead extraction due to infection.
He had been doing well with the pacer until [**2180-9-10**] when he underwent degenerative change at [**Hospital3 **].
In [**2181-8-10**] he underwent revision of his pacemaker pocket.
Unfortunately infection recurred and underwent a second pacemaker pocket revision on [**10-13**].
He has been treated with intravenous Vancomycin for six weeks.
He presents for a pacemaker lead extraction.
Congestive heart failure EF of 35% status post mitral valve repair with mechanical valve in [**2174**], status post pacemaker pocket revision times two.
Status post left brachial PICC placement.
Status post bilateral knee replacement.
Coumadin 5 mg Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday.
Toprol XL 25 mg po q.d.
Lisinopril 5 mg po q.d.
Digoxin .125 mg po q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
Vancomycin 1 to 2 grams q 30 hours.
Cardiovascular:  This 79 year-old man with infected pacemaker pocket was admitted for pacemaker explantation at its leads.
He was initially started on heparin while his Coumadin was held in order to have the pacemaker lead extraction.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained off his Coumadin until [**2-1**] when the patient underwent new pacemaker implantation into a new abdominal pocket.
On [**2182-2-2**] the patient then underwent a lead extraction.
Post lead extraction the patient was continued on his heparin while he was restarted on his Coumadin to get a therapeutic INR given that he has a mitral valve replacement.
He had two JP drains on in the right upper chest draining scant blood and one in the left upper abdomen with serosanguinous drainage as well.
His dressings were clean, dry and intact.
His Coumadin was restarted per EPREX.
The Infectious Disease Service recommended that the patient have a TEE, however, a TEE had been attempted during the pacemaker lead extraction in the Operating Room.
In particular Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that the patient did not require any further intravenous Vancomycin given that the patient had six weeks of intravenous Vancomycin and discussed this with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
He was to have follow up surveillance blood cultures one week after discharge off of Vancomycin to ensure that he did not develop any further bacteremia.
The patient was taken back to the Operating Room on [**2-6**] for pacemaker pocket evacuation.
A new JP drain was placed with good drainage.
The patient's heparin had been held for 12 hours with the development of the subcutaneous fluid collection/hematoma per PE recommendations.
The heparin was restarted cautiously after the evacuation of the pacemaker pocket.
Unfortunately the patient did develop a recurrent small hematoma, however, this remained stable and the drainage from the JP drain tapered off, therefore the JP drain was removed by the CT Surgery Service.
After days of remaining subtherapeutic and INR was therapeutic at 2.7 on [**2182-2-10**] his Coumadin was dosed was decreased for a goal INR of 2 to 2.5 for the next week given the bleeding recurrence at the pacemaker pocket.
Status post pacemaker lead extraction.
Ranitidine 150 mg po b.i.d.
Digoxin 125 micrograms po q day.
Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
Lisinopril 5 mg po q.d.
Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 hours prn pain.
Warfarin 5 mg po q.d.
He was advised that if he had any fevers or chills or increased pain at his pacemaker site that he should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] his primary care physician immediately for further medical advice.
