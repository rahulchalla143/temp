He was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] for insufficiency and Vascular Surgery consult.
There is no other weakness or numbness elsewhere on his body.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATION: Indocin prn for gout, last use was a month ago.
CT scan showed bilateral large pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, and chronic infrarenal, aortic, or right common iliac dissection.
Given that the patient had bilateral pulmonary embolism discovered on CTA, patient was put on Heparin for a PTT of 60-80.
Therefore, the patient did not require any IVC filters at this time.
Subsequent studies that his protein-C was normal at 66, protein-S at 139, anticardiolipin IgG as well as IgM were normal at 1.2 and 4.3 respectively.
However, he was found to have high levels of homocystine at 70.5, where the high range of normal is 12.4.
He was therefore then started on vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate.
He was then started on Coumadin 5 mg to reach an INR between [**3-3**].
He eventually reached 2.2 on the day of discharge with a regimen of Coumadin 5 and 7.5 mg alternating days.
They eventually took him for embolectomy of a very large subclavian artery clot.
Patent foramen ovale status post clam-shell placement.
Given that the patient had all of these clots, thrombolysis was a consideration, therefore Cardiology consult was called to do an echocardiogram.
Also noted on the echocardiogram was preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, mild right ventricular dilation, mildly depressed right ventricular function, and apical-septal aneurysm.
Given the right-to-left shunting and embolization without elevated pulmonary artery pressure along with his known deep venous thrombosis, it was felt that a PF closure with a clam-shell would be best.
He was given 48 hours of Vancomycin along with other antibiotics which he was taking for his pneumonia until blood cultures were clear for 48 hours.
Given the clam-shell placement, the patient should be on 75 mg of Plavix for the next three months.
At that time, Hematology recommended starting vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate.
He is to be on Coumadin with INR of 2.3 for at least six months.
Patient was empirically started on azithromycin for five days and ceftriaxone for 14 days.
However, the course of ceftriaxone was decreased down to seven days given that the fever may also be due to the gout that the patient was having.
He was continued on indomethacin until a day before discharge, where his gout flare had resolved.
