The patient was treated at [**Hospital3 1280**] with vancomycin and oxacillin, however, his respiratory status worsened and he was ultimately intubated and then transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further care.
MEDICATIONS:  On transfer include Protonix 40 mg daily, rifampin 300 mg b.i.d., oxacillin 2 grams q.4hours, Levaquin 250 mg daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.r.n., Restoril 7.5 mg p.r.n., Lasix 80 mg daily, Dilaudid 1 mg p.r.n.
ABG 7.32, 39, 85, 21/-5 with vent settings of assist control 100%, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 22 with no pressor support and 10 of PEEP.
Chest x-ray done on admission showed bilateral pleural effusions without pneumothorax or infiltrates and endotracheal tube in good position.
He had amiodarone at 1 mg/minute, nitroglycerin at 4 mcg/kg/minute and propofol at 40 mcg/kg/minute.
It was planned to place a Swan-Ganz catheter and then send the patient to CAT scan for an abdominal and a chest CT to look for septic sources and to rule out PE, however, upon arrival in the CSIU, the patient had a VT arrest.
The patient was treated in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit for the next several days in order to stabilize him, and on the [**12-14**], he was brought to the operating room at which time he had a debridement of an aortic aneurysm as well as patch of that aneurysm and resuspension of his aortic valve.
He tolerated the operation and was transferred back to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
Ultimately the patient had a prolonged hospital course with several return trips to the operating room, each associated with short periods of paralysis, followed by slow vent weans.
A summary of those events include the initial operation on the 25th for the aortic patch and resuspension of the valve, hematoma evacuation on the [**11-20**], return trip to the operating room on the [**11-25**] where he had a #27 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] pericardial aortic valve placed following which he had a postoperative pneumonia with pseudomonas.
At that time, it was found that he had dehisced his aortic valve and he underwent aortic root replacement with a #23 homograft as well as a mediastinal washout.
On the [**12-19**], the patient was again brought to the operating room where he had a cholecystectomy as well as a G- J tube placed and fascial layer of his abdomen was closed.
He tolerated that operation well and was returned to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit where he remained hemodynamically stable for about a week and subsequently on the [**11-29**], he had an episode of bleeding which returned him to the operating room for a mediastinal exploration during which they found a dehiscence of suture line and an infected initial homograft.
Therefore, he underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a homograft and a patch of the pulmonary artery aneurysm that was also found at that time.
The patient did well following this surgery and on the [**12-2**], he was found to have a DVT of his left upper extremity including the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
Additional pledgets were also placed in the pulmonary artery aneurysm suture lines.
On the [**11-19**], he was again brought to the operating room for an attempt at sternal closure with a pectoral flap advancement, however, the closure was aborted due to the size of the sternal wound and a VAX dressing was placed at that time.
On [**11-20**], the patient again returned to the operating room where he underwent a tracheostomy.
On [**12-21**], the patient returned to the operating room to have a tunnel line dialysis catheter placed and on the [**12-28**], the patient had a PICC line placed.
However, at the current time, he is alert and oriented, very interactive and responsive, moves all extremities, follows commands, and answers questions appropriately with Passy-Muir valve in place.
Respiratory status, the patient has had a tracheostomy which was performed on [**11-20**].
He is tolerating long periods of trach collar during the day with minimal pressor support, in the nighttime 40%, 5 of PEEP and 5 of pressor support at night, trach collar 40% during the day, maintaining O2 saturations of 96% to 99%.
Cardiac status, status post multiple aortic surgeries with the last surgery being an attempt at sternal closure and that was done on [**11-19**], following which his sternal wound was left with an omental flap and a VAX dressing to allow for secondary closure.
He also had several abdominal washouts and ultimately had his abdomen closed on [**10-19**] with additional debridement and skin closure on [**11-19**].
The patient also had a G-J tube placed and a cholecystectomy done on [**10-19**].
Currently, the patient is receiving tube feeds through his G-J tube and his abdomen is soft.
He has active bowel sounds and his suture line is healing well.
He has a tunnel catheter in his left internal jugular.
Infectious disease recommendations with duration of antibiotic treatment will be done prior to discharge to rehabilitation.
He is currently being treated with caspofungin 50 mg q.24hours, vancomycin 750 mg p.r.n.
when the level was less than 15, tobramycin 90 mg daily on days of hemodialysis only.
Recommendation of endocrine at this time is to continue levothyroxine at 50 mcg IV daily or if it is to be changed to p.o., the patient would need to have his tube feeds held for several hours prior to and following his dose of levothyroxine.
He has a sacral decubitus which is being treated with Accuzyme and DuoDerm.
Cardiac: Open chest with VAX in place, regular rate and rhythm, somewhat tachycardic.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds and G tube in place with no erythema or drainage from G tube site.
Aortic valve endocarditis, status post homograft with an     aortic valve replacement and repair of pulmonary artery     aneurysm, status post sternal debridement with an omental     flap and VAX dressing placement.
Status post exploratory laparotomy as well as     cholecystectomy and a G-J tube placement.
Left lower lobe extremity deep venous thrombosis, status     post inferior vena cava filter placement, 4.
Acute renal failure, status post placement of tunnel line     hemodialysis catheter.
Thrombocytopenia due to treatment with Zosyn.
Status post episode of disseminated zoster.
