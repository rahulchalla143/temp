HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50 year old woman with a known prior medical history found collapsed at work and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation by emergency medical services within about ten minutes of her collapse.
Intubation attempted multiple times and not successful.
She received a bolus of Amiodarone times three and then was found to have similar ST elevations in leads 3 and AVF.
She was given a heparin bolus and started on Integrilin and transferred here for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was notable for the following, proximal right coronary artery had 80% stenosis, diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 80% stenosis and 80% stenosis of the distal right coronary artery with a total of four stents employed with a gap left in the mid right coronary artery in the distribution of a relatively normal vessel.
There was a Type B dissection in the mid vessel, but clinically she was treated with two of these four stents.
A pixel stent was then deployed into the proximal left circumflex.
The patient was successfully weaned and extubated off of the vent, however, due to acute agitation and confusion, status post catheterization believed due to ethyl alcohol withdrawal, despite treatments with Ativan and Haldol, she was intubated for protection.
She was treated with steroids and Zosyn for a total course of three weeks.
The patient remained difficult to wean off the vent, prompting tracheostomy to be performed by Otorhinolaryngology.
The patient's course was notable for poor absorption from her nasogastric tube with high tube feed residuals, prompting placement now of the gastrostomy tube by General Surgery at the bedside.
The patient was, however, successfully weaned off of the vent status post tracheostomy.
[**Name2 (NI) **] now is to discharge the patient to a rehabilitation facility.
