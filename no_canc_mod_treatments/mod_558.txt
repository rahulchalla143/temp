At that time, she was stared on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin/Cefepime) and narrowed to cefpodoxime on discharge, to complete a 7-day course.
For the hypotension, she was given 5 litres resuscitative crystalloid and a left IJ central line was placed, after unsuccessful attempt at right IJ.
She was given Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam x 1 dose after blood and urine cultures were sent.

She completed a two week course of antibiotics for her c.dif colitis.
It became difficult to mobilize her fluids because she was felt to be intravascularly dry.
Eventually, a lasix drip was started, and she was successfully extubated.
She was also noted to be severely hypothyroid (her replacement medications had been stopped for some reason prior to admission).
She was started on IV synthroid after consultation with endocrinology.
She was receiving enteral nutrition during most of her stay, but remained very weak.
They recommended supportive care, and that an urgent endoscopy / colonoscopy would not alter her course.
She had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator due to profound weakness and volume overload.
Her BP was very sensitive to this rhythm, and she required DC cardioversion.
She was loaded on amiodarone and esmolol, and she once again developed this tachy rhythm.
Given that she had then completed an IV load of amiodarone, DC cardioversion was done again, and she returned to sinus bradycardia with a good BP.
She remained on DVT prophylaxis during the stay.
Other issues, such as pain control for her hip fracture, were adequately addressed.
