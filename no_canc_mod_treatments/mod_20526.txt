Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old woman with a history of Afib on coumadin, s/p CVA [**2095**] who presented with sepsis in the setting of acute onset retropharyngeal swelling.
She is a schoolteacher and was exposed to several children with Strep throat the days prior to her symptom onset.
She was started on Unasyn for her retropharyngeal infection on [**2103-10-10**].
Femoral line was discontinued in the evening of [**10-11**].
Her airway remained patent without need of intubation throughout the hospital course.
Patient began antibiotics with Unasyn 3 g every 6 hours on [**2103-10-10**].
ENT was consulted and thought that if her symptoms worsened despite antibiotics, dexamethasone 10 mg should be started.
Steroids were not needed.
Pain control was managed with acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
She did not take home medication on the day of admission.
Her HR was consistently in the 110s-120s off of medication, and of note, she recently stopped taking amiodarone because of abnormal thyroid function tests.
Her initial INR in the ED was supratherapeutic, so a dose was held and later resumed given that no invasive procedure was planned for her retropharyngeal infection.
She resumed short acting metoprolol 100 mg TID (close to home dose) as pressor was weaned off, however, HR was persistently elevated, so diltiazem was initiated.
Of note, she missed several doses of metoprolol because of SBP in the 90s while on diltiazem, so metoprolol was discontinued on [**10-13**].
Her HR remained in the 80s-90s and SBP mostly in the 100-120s on diltiazem 60 mg TID alone.
Patient was discharged on Diltiazem XR, as her HR remained well controlled.
# Shortness of Breath/acute diastolic heart failure: likely due to pulmonary edema from the aggressive IVF resuscitation in the setting of AF with RVR.
She was not symptomatic on the floor, was oxyygenating well without dyspnea, so diuretics were not continued.
Her delirium resolved with the therapy mentioned above.
