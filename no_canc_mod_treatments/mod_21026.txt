Admission Date:  [**2158-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-1-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for stroke  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed male with a PMH of AFib, DM, prostate ca s/p radiation, hemorrhoids s/p recent surgery, chronic venous insufficiency, OA L knee, HLD (unable to tolerate statins), HTN, thoracic aortic aneurysm '[**39**], Fe-deficiency anemia, GERD, colonic polyps, who in the middle of the night on [**2158-1-20**] (~1 am), awakened spontaneously, and reports that he "felt fine" used the restroom and then went back to sleep.
The consulting physician advised no IV heparin and the patient was outside of the time-window for tPA administration, as the 1 AM episode was considered to be the beginning of the symptomatic period.
At this point, he was transferred to the ICU and started on a heparin gtt.
He received IV fluids, and his exam improved overnight and throughout the day on [**2158-1-21**] with his speech returning to baseline per his brother's report.
Patient has also been on coumadin off and on for about 3 years.
His rectal bleeding persisted off coumadin despite suture ligation and banding rpocedure was done [**12-8**].
He has been on aspirin 325 mg a day all along.
His Coumadin was also on hold in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**Month (only) 116**] due to hematuria due to radiation cystitis.
Renal/bladder U/S ordered on day of discharge due to rising creatinine: PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: <<See above for hospital course at OSH / prior to admission to our ICU then transfer to Neurology floor service>>  Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] was stable on arrival and transferred rapidly out of the ICU to our SDU on the floor.
His symptoms remained stable -- he has Full EOMs, mild Left NLF flattening, mild weakness of several left-sided muscle groups (Left pronator drift, delt [**5-16**], tri 4+/5, [**Hospital1 **] full, WE 4+/5, FE [**5-16**], FF full, IP 4-/5, Quad 5-/5, Ham [**5-16**], [**Last Name (un) 938**] 5-/5).
He will continue on ASA 325mg for now, then d/c it when warfarin is therapeutic, goal [**3-16**] INR.
Consider up-titrating versus adding to these BP meds; his BP range was 145/75 - 166/94 24h prior to discharge.
**One issue that arose with Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] is that despite good PO food/fluid intake and despite IVF at 70/h during his 2.5d stay on our service, his BUN and Cr have been rising.
We held his ACE inhibitor on discharge, although this can be re-started if the GFR turns around and does not continue to fall.
If cystic bleeding becomes more than an intermittent problem, the warfarin should be held until urgent Urologic evaluation can be conducted.

Your atrial fibrillation (heart rhythm) put you at risk for a blood clot going from your heart to your brain and causing a stroke, and you were not taking medicine (warfarin/Coumadin) to prevent it becuase you had experienced a problem/procedure that put you at risk for bleeding on warfarin.
You will take aspirin 325 until the warfarin is therapeutic (INR between 2 and 3, most recent was 1.6).
