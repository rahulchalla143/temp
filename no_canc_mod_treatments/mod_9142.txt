This spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm but she has had bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since that time.
The patient was discharged from the hospital on beta blocker, Lipitor and Coumadin at that time and she has since come to the [**Location (un) 86**] area to seek further treatment of this.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for at least two previous bouts of endocarditis, one in [**2050**] and one in [**2070**] which was treated with antibiotics with no sequelae.
She has also had three uneventful pregnancies and has not taken any medications regularly and has not had any medical treatment over the past 20 years or so.

q.d., Coumadin 5 mg Monday, Wednesday and Friday and 2.5 mg alternating four days per week.
She was also taking Alprazolam for anxiety.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2103-7-10**] and taken directly to the Operating Room where she underwent mitral valve repair with a #28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band as well as tricuspid valve repair with a #32 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring and a primary closure of ventriculoseptal defect.
Postoperatively the patient was transported from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in stable condition on Milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and Propofol intravenous drips.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained with a Swan-Ganz catheter and the Milrinone was weaned off, the Neo-Synephrine had been discontinued, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and successfully extubated to nasal cannula oxygen.
On postoperative day #2 it was noted that the patient had significant thrombocytopenia, after being started on heparin.
Heparin antibodies were sent and have subsequently come back negative.
The patient remained on intravenous Neo-Synephrine throughout the course of postoperative day #2 which was ultimately discontinued late that day.
On postoperative day #3, the patient was continued with aggressive diuresis, was hemodynamically stable and remained in normal sinus rhythm at that time.
On postoperative day #4 the patient's chest tubes had been removed.
The patient was begun ambulating with physical therapy and tolerating that well.
Her Foley catheter was discontinued and she was voiding without problems.
She was treated with Magnesium and intravenous Lopressor and she was placed on Amiodarone as well.
The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm later that day and had had no subsequent atrial fibrillation while on the Lopressor and the Amiodarone.
The patient continued to progress with physical therapy on [**2103-7-17**].
The patient was still unable to be weaned completely from oxygen due to desaturation.
On [**7-17**], she underwent a thoracentesis for approximately 400 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and did state symptomatic relief of her symptoms.
Today, [**2103-7-18**], the patient remained off oxygen with adequate oxygen saturation.
Temperature is 98.6, blood pressure 110/70, heartrate 87 in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree atrioventricular block, respiratory rate 20.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Lasix 20 mg one p.o.
