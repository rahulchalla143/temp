Cough/Shortness of Breath: Questionable small infiltrate in left upper lung field in setting of low grade fevers, leukocytosis, and upper respiratory tract symptoms.
Started on vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin for HCAP as coming from rehab facility and titrated from BIPAP to 4 liters nasal cannula in ICU.
Solumedrol weaned to prednisone for possible COPD exacerbation with plan for quick taper, which was completed while patient was in house.
Patient was started on vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin x 7 day course (D1 = [**2188-6-2**] for Vancomycin and Zosyn and D1 = [**2188-6-6**] for Levofloxacin.)
On the floor, patient had an episode of persistent hypoxia to 85% on oxygen likely in the setting of delerium that was relieved with ativan and anti-psychotics.
COPD: On 2L nasal cannula at baseline.
Started on solumedrol and standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs for likely exacerbation.
Finished a quick prednisone taper given emotional lability.
Hydration was changed to 1/2 normal saline in the setting of mild hypernatremia.
Her lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were held.
All medications were renally dosed.
Home amlodipine continued but lisinopril and HCTZ held in setting of ARF.
Calcium supplement was held with improvement in Ca from 11.1 to 9.9 with IV fluids.
Gap closed with administration of IV fluids and resumtion of diet on repeat labs.
Continued home venlafaxine, trazodone prn and ativan with holding parameters.
The patient was given Ativan IV q12h:PRN for anxiety.
We continued iron supplements Type and screen was active.
Type II Diabetes: The patient was continued on Lantus [**Hospital1 **] and Humalog sliding scale.
Home lantus dose initially halved given NPO status but increased when diet was restarted.
The patient had elevated FSG, likely secondary to steroid treatment, Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale tightened and pt restarted on home dose lantus.
Lung Cancer: Details are unclear but patient is s/p chemotherapy and lobectomy at unknown date.
Prophylaxis: Patient was on PPI for GI prophylaxis and Subutaneous Heparin for DVT Prophylaxis.

You were treated for pneumonia with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin).
You were given nebulizer treatments and steriods (Solumedrol, followed by Prednisone) for COPD exacerbation.
You initially were put on noninvasive positive pressure respiration (BiPAP) to help with you breathing and later were switched to oxygen.
You should continue to receive IV fluids and drink plenty of fluids over the next several days to help your kidneys.
You should continue taking IV antibiotics (Zosyn, Vancomycin and Levaquin) for a period of 7 days total (you received 4 days in the hospital).
You should also continue with nebulizer treatments (Albuterol, Atrovent) for now.
We have held your Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide because of your acute renal failure.
We have also stopped your Advair Discus and switched you to Fluticasone inhaler, because you were tachycardic and because your are already getting Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
We have made the changes to your sliding scale to control your blood sugars while you were on steroids.
