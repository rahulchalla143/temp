Bronchoscopy could be helpful for further evaluation, especially given the  dense material within the lower lobe bronchi.
Right internal jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.
No obvious pleural effusion is seen; however, small bilateral layering pleural effusions with adjacent atalectasis may be present.
An irregular area of heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base could represent pneumonia, alternatively atelectasis, unchanged in configuration since earlier in the day on [**2-11**], but not since 6:06 p.m. Opacification at the right lung base is more likely pleural effusion and atelectasis, and not pneumonia.
Right internal jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.

In the MICU, the patient was weaned off of CPAP and was eventually able to tolerate 4L NC to maintain O2 sats >93%.
Her antibiotics were changed from levoflox to CTX/azitrho to minimize potential for suppression of MTB, if that is the cause of her sx.
She had frequent cough with copious production of sputum and frequent chest PT, incentive spirometry, and OOB to chair was performed.
