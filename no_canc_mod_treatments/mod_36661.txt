Admission Date:  [**2141-2-23**]       Death Date:  [**2141-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-6-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25288**] is a 76-year-old gentleman, with a history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2126**] with subsequent stenting, and a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of approximately 25%.
Vein graft to the RCA had a 50% stenosis.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] of CT surgery for consideration of redo coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.
Status post prostate cancer with radiation therapy.
CABG in [**2126**].
Right carotid endarterectomy with restenosis in [**12-11**].
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with aortobifem graft in [**2139-2-10**].
Prilosec 40 mg po qd.
Norvasc 7.5 mg po qd.
Zetia 10 mg po qd.
Doxazosin 2 mg in the morning, 1 mg in the evening.
Lasix 20 mg po qd.
Trental 400 mg po qd.
He was neurologically intact with no JVD or bruits, but a cardiac murmur from his aortic valve transmitted to bilateral carotid arteries.
At the time of evaluation, carotid studies and echo were pending.
On [**2-23**], the patient underwent redo sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a vein graft to the acute margin, sequentially to the PDA, and a vein graft to the distal LAD.
In addition, the patient also had an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
Subsequently, in the operating room the patient also had insertion of right ventricular assist device for RV failure.
The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed at the same time as right ventricular assist device was placed.
A balloon pump was placed in antegrade fashion into the thoracic aorta.
The operation was performed by Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**].
The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in fair condition on a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] insulin drip at 15 U/h, and a propofol drip at 15.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic ICU on perioperative antibiotics, on an amiodarone drip at 1 mg, milrinone at 0.5, Neo at 0.5.
The patient was started on aspirin.
He was also on a CIS drip 0.08, insulin at 9, and propofol at 30.
He was in sinus bradycardia in the 50s, with a blood pressure of 110/45, PA pressures 42/29, with an index of 2.1.
The plan was to try and wean the vent as tolerated and do CVVH with Quinton catheter and assess as per routine.
The patient was also seen by the renal attending who again agreed with dosing the medications according to CVVH, and noted the alkalosis that was going on at the time.
At the time, the patient was on amiodarone, vasopressin and milrinone.
Pressure control ventilations were started with some success to decrease the FIO2.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and was given albumin.
He remained on amiodarone, milrinone, Neo, ativan, cisatracurium, fentanyl, heparin, insulin drips.
The patient also had restarted Protonix, and continued with perioperative Kefzol.
Electrophysiology service from cardiology placed an intravenous atrial pacing wire because the epicardial A-lead was not working.
Epicardial V-lead was working properly though.
The patient was on multiple drips with pressor support and epinephrine.
General surgery noted and assessed appropriately the critical illness of this patient, and that the abdominal process and worsening acidosis may have been due to a global ischemia with possibility that this could produce small areas of ischemic gut.
The patient continued on the RVAD and intra-aortic balloon pump with a blood pressure of 87/42, heart rate in the 70s, with an index of 2.7, with the RVAD and intra-aortic balloon pump.
The patient remained intubated and sedated on the following drips:  dopamine, insulin, cisatracurium, epinephrine, heparin, Levophed, milrinone and Neo-Synephrine.
The patient also was in third degree AV block, and was using the pacing wire placed by electrophysiology.
The chest was re-explored, and Dopplers were placed to check the vein grafts.
At the time, the patient was also on a dopamine drip at 7.5, epinephrine at 0.08, Levophed at 0.35, milrinone at 0.5, and Neo-Synephrine at 4.
He also remained paralyzed, on heparin and insulin drips.
He was paced at a rhythm of 80 with PA pressures of 47/32, an index of 2.7, on maximal pressor support, with a blood gas of 7.29/37/80/19/-7.
At approximately 11:00 am, the patient experienced a progressive drop in his blood pressure with wide complex tachycardia, worsening acidosis, and anuria.
He had some runs of V-tach which deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation despite constant boluses of epinephrine, calcium, bicarb, and upward titration of his pressors and inotropes.
The family decided to withdraw therapy at that time, and the patient expired at 11:12 am in the Cardiothoracic ICU.
Status post redo coronary artery bypass grafting x 3/aortic valve replacement/right ventricular assist device placement/insertion of thoracic intra-aortic balloon pump.
Severe peripheral vascular disease, status post right carotid endarterectomy, and status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
13.Elevated homocystine levels.
15.Status post prostate cancer with radiation therapy.
