# Septic Shock: The patient was aggressively fluid resucitated in the ED and ICU per rivers protocol; he was briefly on norepinephrine in the ED, but had weaned by the time he arrived to the ICU.
As such, the patient initially in the ICU was covered with Vancomycin IV, Cefepime IV, Vancomycin PO, and IV Metronidazole to cover potential lung, urine, and colonic srouces, with a plan to wean antibiotics on the floor.
He was subsequently found to have Klebsiella Pneumonia in the blood, and was narrowed to Cefepime IV, Vancomycin PO, and IV Metronidazole.
Due to resistance panel, a PICC line was placed and a 10d course of IV Meropenem 500mg q6 was started, beginning on [**8-26**] and expected to go on until the evening of the 14th.
He does thus meet criteria severe C. difficile criteria per [**Hospital1 18**] guidelines.
As such, he was started on vancomycin 500 mg PO q 6 hr, and reduced to 125 mg PO q 6 hr, then to PO metronidazole.
Due to other infections, will continue flagyl for 1w post other abx.
He will continue metronidazole 500mg TID until 1 week after the Meropenem has been d/c'ed'  # Bradycardia: patient was bradycardic to 40s, asymptomatic, on metoprolol succinate.
This was discontinued and the digoxin will be used for rate control.
Resolved after fluid resucitation.
# Mild metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to fluid resustication with NS and and diarrheal losses.
We continued ASA in house.
# DM2: Blood sugars consistently were in the 300's at the beginning of the admission, so a standing bedtime dose of Lantus was added to his sliding scale.
Also, his sliding scale was adjusted accordingly throughout the hospital course.
The pt was given IV lasix with resolution of his edema and lung findings.
# Transitional Issues - 10d course of IV Meropenem 500mg q6.
