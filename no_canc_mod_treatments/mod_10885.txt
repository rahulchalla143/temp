There is a question of an upgoing toe on the left on repeat neurologic examination.
Because of this, the patient was given a Solu-Medrol steroid bolus, and the Neurology and Neurosurgery services were consulted.
Neurosurgical service recommended admission observation, continuance of a hard C collar, and neuroradiologist review of the films, MRI of the spine, continuation of the spinal cord Solu-Medrol protocol, and formal Neurology consult.
Neurology service felt that the patient had a flaccid left hemiparesis with facial sparing and loss of pin prick, but preserved proprioception.
They initially recommended MRI of the head and neck.
Because of the patient's mechanism of injury, initiation of the steroid protocol, and questionable traumatic brain injury, the patient was admitted to the Trauma service to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit.
