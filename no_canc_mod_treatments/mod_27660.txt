Pt being transferred to MICU service for management and tx of PNA.
Pt failed BiPAP & required intubation.
A triple lumen R-IJ was placed on [**2123-12-14**] in the setting of hypotension: she reportedly had SBP into the 80s & required pressors for a short period--dopamine initially (which made her tachycardic) then vasopressin.
Because of this cx data, her abx were changed from levoflox to cefepime.
Pt was started on TF via NGT.
Given overall picture, pt evaluated for trach & PEG at OSH; however, it was felt that she would be high risk for procedure given her kyphosis & body habitus, so she was transferred here for intervention.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was con't on cefepime for tx of PNA as well as IV steroids & nebs for COPD and dilt gtt for rapid afib.
She was started on vanc in addition to cefepime.
She was transitioned off dilt gtt and controlled with dilt PO.
Past Medical History: -COPD 02 dependent, chronic hypercapnia, never intubated prior to current admission -mild CHF-->LVED 40-45% on OSH echo -mild pulm HTN w/ PA pressure of 35mmhg by OSH echo -P-Afib-->not on coumadin, unclear why not -[**Name (NI) 15764**]>pt reports this is only present while on steroids -kyphosis -PVD w/ LE ulcers  Physical Exam: VS: T:  HR: 87 (70-110s) BP: 130/50 RR: 19 Sat: 96 on AC 15/8, 0.45 Gen: awake, alert, oriented x3, mouthing words/writing to communicate, sl uncomfortable appearing HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, sclera anicteric Neck: Supple, no LAD, no JVD CV: RRR S1/S2, no m/r/g Resp: Roncherus w/ exp wheezes throughout anterior fields Abdomen: Soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: Trace LE edema DP pulses are 2+ bilaterally Neuro: A + O x 3, CN II-XII grossly intact, Motor [**6-5**] both upper and lower extremities Skin: B/l LE healed scars from old wounds/ulcers; scattered ecchymoses on b/l feet.

# MRSA Pneumonia: Pt was found to have LLL pneumonia, initially considered CAP vs. nosocomial as pt had been transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after being admitted there from home w/ PNA, and because pt had been vented for over a week before transfer.
Pt received cefepime for pseudomonal coverage per OSH cultures, and was started on vancomycin for MRSA in sputum.
She should be continued on vancomycin and cefepime until [**1-1**].
# Respiratory distress: Pt originally intubated at OSH because of hypercarbic failure related to severe COPD, PNA, and pleural effusions.
A right-sided thoracentesis was performed on [**2123-12-27**] seeking to drain an effusion; this was complicated by the development of a pneumothorax which required the placement of a chest tube.
Bedside tracheostomy was subsequently performed by interventional pulmonology on [**2123-12-28**].
Pt administered heparin gtt and to r/o possible future PE source, bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were obtained and confirmed no DVTs.
Pt's outpatient mgt will require long-term anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation was held briefly in anticipation of her multple procedures; warfarin was re-started on [**2123-12-29**].
Pt was therefore maintained on nebulizers and guaifenesin, and was started on methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) IV at 40mg IV q8h, which was tapered to 20mg q8h.
Before [**12-27**] procedure, pt was maintained on stress-dose steroids.
On [**2123-12-29**], she was transitioned to 15 mg daily of PO prednisone.
# CHF: Pt uses furosemide 60mg daily as home regimen for baseline CHF, and was restarted on furosemide 60mg QOD to maximize respiratory capacity and was increased to 60mg PO daily.
She should continue on lasix 60mg PO daily.
# Type II DM: Per pt, elevated glucose only when steroids used.
Pt was initially placed on insulin gtt, which was then changed to NPH 30units x1 dose AM after MICU transfer.
# AFib:  Patient was rate-controlled initially on diltiazem gtt and later on diltiazem PO.
Anticoagulation was held in the setting of surgial procedures but restarted on [**2123-12-29**].
Continue warfarin and titrate to INR 2.0-3.0. .
# Nutrition: Nutrition was consulted and recommended tube feeds as follows: Half strength Nutren 2.0 at 50ml/hour with 15g Benepro, 1251kcal, 61g protein.
