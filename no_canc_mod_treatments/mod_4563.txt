She was planned for a repair on [**2107-3-29**] and was taken to the Operating Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for multiple bypass surgeries including a bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] subclavian bypass, renal vein bypass.
She is also status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Aspirin 325 p.o.
Nifedipine 30 p.o.
Lasix 40 p.o.
Postoperatively, she was transferred to PACU, intubated with Swan-Ganz catheter in place.
She required significant resuscitation and her hematocrit was slowly decreased.
It was found that she was bleeding internally and required significant resuscitation on that first postoperative day.
It was decided that the patient should return to the Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy and wash out.
The anastomoses were inspected, again new sutures were placed to stop any further bleeding from the anastomotic site and the patient was transferred back to the PACU.
Again, the patient required significant fluid resuscitation and her bladder pressures continued to increase.
Her pulmonary pressures also continued to increase and became more and more difficult to ventilate the patient including her airway pressures rising to 50's and 60's.
Again, her belly began to become more and more distended and it was decided that the patient would return to the Operating Room again for another exploratory laparotomy and wash out.
The belly was packed and Iodoform dressing was placed with two JP's.
The patient continued to require a significant fluid resuscitation through the day.
The patient continued to require fluid resuscitation and also needed cardiac pressors in order to keep an adequate blood pressure.
On the 17th night, she began dropping her blood pressure which did not respond to fluid resuscitation and the patient was started on vasopressin.
The patient was also on Levophed and dobutamine at the time.
The dobutamine was weaned off and Levophed was continued.
The patient continued to have a severe acidosis and required significant fluid resuscitation.
Discussion was carried out with the family as to the findings of the operation and the likelihood that the patient would not survive this hospital stay.
The patient endotracheal tube was removed and the patient was given morphine for pain control and her cardiac pressors were stopped.
