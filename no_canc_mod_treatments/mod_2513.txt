IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
# Chronic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (on CPAP) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion despite Lasix titration as an outpatient.
She was diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement of her dyspnea, lower extremity edema, pulmonary crackles, and elevated JVP.
She continues to be slightly volume overloaded and was discharged on an increased dose of Lasix 160 mg daily (from prior dose of 120 mg daily) for continued diuresis.
She was continued on her home spirinolactone 25mg PO QD and started on losartan.
She was likely becoming progressively hypercarbic as an outpatient due to progressive retention, as she was dozing off without cpap during the day and was also being diuresed with increasing levels of serum bicarb from contraction alkalosis, which may have further decreased her repiratory drive.
Also contributing was the fact that the patient was placed on supplemental oxygen in the ED, which further led to a decrease in her respiratory drive.
In the MICU, she received BiPAP and was transferred back to the floor.
She became increasingly somnolent and ABG showed 7.36/85/80, the patient was started on Bipap overnight.
She was placed on Bipap with improvement, and had her settings adjusted to the following with good results:      Inspiratory pressure 9, Expiratory pressure 6, supplemental oxygen 1-4L titrated to goal PO2 88-92% She remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint without recurrence of somnolence on these bipap settings overnight, and was discharged with Bipap and pulmonary follow-up.
After multiple days of diuresis on IV Lasix, it was thought that her fluid status would improve if she was in sinus rhythm so a flutter ablation was performed.
The patient underwent an ablation while in the MICU and was also cardioverted during the procedure for progressive pulmonary edema during the ablation.
The patient had been on Plavix as an outpatient for peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease, which was stopped in the setting of starting Dabigatran after [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery determined the Plavix could be stopped safely.
Her home Atenolol had been switched to Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg daily while she was in flutter, and she was discharged on Metoprolol Succinate (extended release) 75 mg Daily.
Given concern for ACS vs PE, she was started on a heparin drip briefly, but this was discontinued after CE's were negative.
She was continued on her home statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
# Hypertension:  She was initially on Atenolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide as an outpatient.
Her SBP was persistently elevated in-house in 150s-160s and she was started on losartan for additional blood pressure control and potential heart failure benefits.
As stated above, her Atenolol was switched to Metoprolol while she was in atrial flutter.
She underwent continued diuresis on Lasix in-house, and was discharged on a higher dose of Lasix 160 mg daily for further diuresis as an outpatient.
# Diabetes: Her home NPH was decreased in-house for AM hypoglycemia, and she was covered with an insulin sliding scale throughout her hospitalization.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue home simvastatin.
She was transiently on Atorvastatin during her episode of chest pain, which was switched back to her home Simvastatin prior to discharge.
# Osteoarthritis: Pain control with tylenol PRN as needed.
