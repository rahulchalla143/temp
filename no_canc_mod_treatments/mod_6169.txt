On [**3-5**] he was started on clears because no further bleeding had been noted.
He had a repeat tagged RBC scan which showed recurrent bleeding at the same spot (hepatic flexure) and a second embolization procedure was recommended.
This occurred in the setting of starting aspirin and plavix in [**8-22**] following MI and stent placement.
Two days later he re-bled and had an emblization by IR.
His plavix had been stopped after his bleeding episode, and he has been maintained on low-dose aspirin since that time.

He was started on IV Ampicillin and then was switched to PO Augmentin and will complete his antibiotic course at home.
