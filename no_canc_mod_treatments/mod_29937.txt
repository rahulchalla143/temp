Past Medical History: Diabetes, Schizoaffective disorder, COPD, HTN, CAD, Hypercholesterolemia, GERD, h/o head injury @ age 11  Past Surgical History: Perforated duodenal ulcer in [**2148**] s/p cholecystectomy, anterior parietal cell vagotomy, and [**Location (un) **] patch closure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
Borderline dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with trace inter-loop fluid in the mesenteric root, which is non-specific.
Remnant basal atelectasis at the left lung base.
Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube and of the right PICC line.
The patient was kept NPO and started on IVF for hydration in addition to a bowel regimen.
GI was consulted and recommended NG decompression in addition to initiation of cipro and flagyl.
Pain initially improved with NG decompression but subsequently worsened prompting repeat CT which showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop fluid.
Blood pressure improved with administration of IVF and remained stable on admission to the floor.
Her anti-hypertensives including lisinopril and diltiazem were initially held.
As below diltaizem was restarted on HD 1 for heart rate control.
This was not further evaluation on this hospitalization given the patients acute illness.
On admission she was continued on her home metoprolol but diltiazem was held given hypotension.
This medication was restarted on HD at a decreased dose with improvement in rate control.
On HD 3 creatinine trended upward to 2.0 and urine output decreased suggesting poor renal perfusion.
STABLE ISSUES # COPD- Patient was continued on her home regimen # ANEMIA- Patients HCT was at baseline throughout admission.
# CAD- Patient was continued on her home beta blocker and aspirin # GERD- Patient was continued on omeprazole # DM- Patients home glyburide was held and she was maintained on a ISS #Schizoaffective disorder- Patient was continued on seroquel                            ** AFTER SURGICAL ASSESSMENT ** Surgical consultation was requested on [**2153-2-9**] and exam was consistent with peritonitis.
She was taken to the OR emergently for exploratory laparotomy where a closed loop obstruction was discovered with ischemic small bowel.
After resection and primary anastomosis, she was brought to the ICU intubated and on pressors.
Her postop course was complicated by a wound infection and anastomotic leak requiring return to the OR for additional resection and repeat anastomosis.
CV: Her pressors were weaned off following aggressive fluid resusitation.
Patient was loaded with digoxin and given intermittent metoprolol with good rate control.
Once hemodynamically stable, she was diuresed with lasix to good effect, however a rising Creatinine limited the ability to push her diuresis.
Given her inability to take PO digoxin, her A-fib was managed with IV metoprolol.
As she remained in A-fib, a heparin drip was initiated with transitioning to coumadin beginning [**2-28**].
Her nebulizers were continued and she was weaned to extubation on [**2153-2-19**] (POD [**10-15**]).
She displayed bilateral pleural effusions which were resistant to medical diuresis, so bilateral chest tubes were placed which each drained several liters of transudate prior to being removed HD 22 and 24.
She was restarted on home inhalers while.
GI: Patient's wound developed erythema on POD#3 for which patient was started on cefazolin.
Erythema resolved and a wound vac was placed on [**2153-2-16**].
She returned to the operating [**2153-2-18**] for another ex-lap with small bowel resection and primary anastamosis.
Given the re-operation and re-anastomosis, her progress to PO intake was slow.
Her tube feeds were advanced to goal.
She was given acetazolamide for several days, then returned to lasix as needed.
She was given TPN for supplemental nutrition while awaiting return of bowel function.
She should have TPN continued until able to tolerate tube feeds.
Her Hct was stable and she was given heparin sc for DVT prophylaxis, then heparin drip while transitioning to coumadin.
ID: Prior to her anastamotic leak, she was on vancomycin for her wound infection.
The vancomycin was DC'd [**2-22**] following treatment of her MRSA wound infection.
The cipro and flagyl were continued for a total 14 day course after her reoperation.
