The patient had an abdominal computed tomography on [**2121-2-5**] that showed an enlarged pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collections with focal under-perfusion of the pancreatic head which has now resolved when compared to prior abdominal computed tomography.
The patient was placed on Lovenox and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
In addition, an abdominal ultrasound will be repeated to assess for the degree of portal vein thrombosis.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient initially was found to have bilateral pleural effusions as well as congestive heart failure after initial volume resuscitation for her pancreatitis.
Subsequently, she did quite well and was taken off nasal cannula and was saturating around 94% to 96% on room air.
Given these findings, a chest x-ray was repeated which revealed a moderate sized right pleural effusion that was new compared to a prior pleural effusion.
The patient underwent a right thoracentesis with drainage of approximately 500 cc of straw-colored fluid.
The Pulmonary Interventional Service was involved in the thoracentesis and determined that based on these findings, as well as the exudative nature of the effusion, the patient should be treated with antibiotics for at least two weeks.
The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
The cytology was negative for malignant cells and showed only reactive mesothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.
A chest computed tomography was performed to evaluate for loculated fluid collection, consolidation, and size of right pleural effusion after her pleural tap.
This revealed an interval reduction in the size of the right pleural effusion, partial re-expansion of the right lower lobe, with discoid atelectasis, and patchy ground-glass opacities that persisted in the right lower lobe, likely representing evolving re-expansion; however, a right lower lobe infiltrate cannot be excluded.
HYPERTENSIVE ISSUES:  The patient had gradual improvement in her blood pressures with blood pressures ranging from 120 to 130 systolic at the time of discharge on metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
and Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
The patient will have her blood pressure followed up by her primary care physician and subsequent adjustment in medications as needed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was still completing her course of Flagyl for her Clostridium difficile infection.
ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient had her peripherally inserted central catheter line discontinued prior to discharge, as she will no longer need total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was to have visiting nurses to administer her Lovenox on the day of discharge ([**2121-2-6**]) as well as [**2121-2-7**].
She will be continued on Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
for two additional days and then have her INR checked on [**2121-2-8**] by the visiting nurses with the results sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5992**] who will then adjust her Coumadin for a goal INR of 2 to 3.
Sodium chloride nasal spray as needed (for nasal dryness).
Flovent 110-mcg 2 puffs inhaled b.i.d.
Dulcolax as needed.
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Ipratropium bromide meter-dosed inhaler 1 puff inhaled q.6h.
Lovenox 80 mg b.i.d.
Benadryl as needed (for rash).
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Coumadin 3 mg p.o.
