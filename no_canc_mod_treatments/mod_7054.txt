In the right lower lobe subpleural space, there is a 7-mm calcification which along with mediastinal lymph node calcifications suggests granulomatous disease.
FINDINGS: There are expected post-surgical changes from prior amputation of the fifth toe and mid-to-distal fifth metatarsal bone.
Assessment for abscess limited by absence of IV contrast, but no obviuos soft tissue abscess identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o man with DMII who initially presented with ankle pain consistent with cellulitis, with hospital course complicated by sepsis, acute hypoxia requiring intubation in the medical ICU, progression of chronic kidney disease, and troponinemia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Right lower extremity pain due to leg cellulitis.
Upon admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazadime on [**2131-6-24**] for coverage of a presumed infection.
Flagyl was started on [**2131-6-30**] per Infectious Disease recommendations.
Mr. [**Known lastname 33020**] pain improved by time of discharge and all antibiotics were discontinued on [**2131-7-3**].
# Acute Hypoxemia: Soon after admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was saturating in mid to high 90s on nasal cannula; however, on [**2131-6-25**], patient was reported to have desaturations to mid 80s, and placed on non-rebreather without improvement in O2 saturation.
He was tachypneic and tachycardic, and decision was made to intubate and provide mechanical ventilation.
His presumed cause is likely flash pulmonary edema (secondary to sepsis) as he responded well to diuresis with IV lasix.
He self extubated on [**2131-6-26**], and required minimal supplemental O2 afterwards, ultimately transferred to the floor on [**2131-6-29**].
Of note while he was intubated and sedated, he required vasopressor support with norepinephrine, however this was discontinued as he was extubated and weaned off sedation.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Type 2 Diabetes controlled with complications: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on insulin sliding scale while in house, and did not have any complications.
They did ankle brachial index measurements and an ultrasound of his right superior femoral artery stent which showed satisfactory bloodflow.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home simvastatin was continued.
- Due to progression of chronic kidney disease, dialysis or transplant may need to be pursued within the next year.
