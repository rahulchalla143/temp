Patient was treated originally with CTX/azithro/Flagyl but switched to Vanc/Cefepime.
Her respiratory status improved greatly during her stay in the MICU and she was weaned from her O2 requirement as tolerated and transferred to the medicine floor.
Prior to discharge her antibiotics were switched to PO Levofloxacin to finish an 8 day course and she remained afebrile and her leukocytosis resolved.
She received 1 dose ceftriaxone in the ED and was switched to Vancomycin/cefepime.
She no longer complained of dysuria following initiation of antibiotics.
She was empirically started on antibiotics which would cover abdominal source.
The pt was not interested in surgical interventions so a surgical consult was deferred.
Final CT read showed no definite intra-abdominal process and antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin/cefepime.
She was continued on home Oxycodone 2.5 mg TID.
# CHRONIC CONSTIPATION - continued MiraLax QD, senna 8.6 mg x2 Capsule(s) Daily .
Uses wheelchair at baseline per rehab notes.
Her antibiotics were switched to PO Levofloxacin to continue a 8 day course.
We would recommend a trial of Sinemet should be undertaken to see if she would benefit from this medication.
