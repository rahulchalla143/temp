Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the lower margin of the clavicles, no less than 15mm from the carina, probably 2 cm below optimal placement.
A right parapelvic cyst measures 2.4cm x 2.3cm x 1.8cm.
Believed secondary to acetominophen overdose.
Believed secondary to ATN (muddy brown casts, FeNa of 0.3) which is a known complication of acetominophen toxicity.
The patient was noted to become hypokalemic and hypophosphatemic several days into this admission, requiring maximum supplementation of 180 mEq of potassium and [**7-21**] packets of neutra-phos daily.
She was started on amiloride at 2.5 mg daily and increased to 5 mg daily, which reduced the urinary potassium wasting and helped to stabilize serum K values at ~4.
She will be continued on this medication at discharge with a plan to follow up with the nephrology team for further outpatient management.
Amiloride was stopped on [**2105-2-28**] and potassium levels remained stable in the normal range.
She was followed by psychiatry and social work throughout this admission, and maintained off all psych meds (including home Xanax and Seroquel).
These issues require further investigation by her future psychiatry team.
On the day of her discharge, her psychiatry team determined that she was no longer actively suicidal and cancelled her Section 12 and requirement for 1:1 sitter.
