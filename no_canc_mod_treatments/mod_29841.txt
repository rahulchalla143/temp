Patient was recently re-admitted for further evaluation of hypotension from his rehab facility.
During this recent hospitalization, he received IV fluids.
Medications were adjusted, namely lisinopril was discontinued and beta blocker increased for better rate control.
Per report, the effusion is larger, though it is loculated and will likely require echo-guided pericardiocentesis.

The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.
Surgical clips are seen at the gastroesophageal junction.
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
Mesothelial cells and lymphocytes.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
[**Location (un) 5099**] VIRUS B ANTIBODIES: Negative    Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M with PMHx significant for aortic stenosis s/p AVR (tissue) [**2155-2-17**], COPD, prostate CA (s/p radiation and hormonal therapy [**2150**]) who presented from clinic with pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis; also w/ pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis.
The patient underwent [**Year (4 digits) **]-guided pericardial effusion drainage and a temporary catheter was placed.
Output decreased and pericardial drainage catheter was pulled.
The patient's cultures grew out Staph epidermidis, a separate coag negative Staph and Micrococcus; however, this was thought to be due to contamination, so antiobitics were not started.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, repeat pulsus the day after drainage catheter was pulled was 4 mmHg.
The etiology of the pericardial effusion is thought to be reactive from his recent aortic valve replacement surgery less than a month prior to this admission.
# Pleural effusion: Patient with a right-sided loculated bloody/exudative pleural effusion with eosinophilia, thought to be secondary to instrumentation from aortic valve replacement.
Patient underwent a thoracentesis and placement of pleurex catheter.
Interventional pulmonology placed a pleurex catheter to drain the remaining right-sided pleural effusion, which was removed after approximately 36 hours; the catheter drained a total of 860cc of serosangenous fluid.
Pleural fluid collected when the pleurex catheter was placed was also bloody, exudative with eosinophilia.
Interventional pulmonary recommended starting ibuprofen 800mg three times daily for 14 days, which he will continue as an outpatient.
# Status post aortic valve repair for aortic stenosis: Cardiac surgery following the patient through the hospitalization.
The patient was also given ensures with all meals.
# Emphysema: Continue spiriva, advair, albuterol inhaler through the admission.
# Code status this admission: DNR/DNI  #Transitional issues: -Will continue on ibpurofen (with omeprazole for GI prophylaxis) for 11 more days as an outpatient -Possible constriction noted on last [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need follow-up echo within 2 months of discharge -Pt and his VNA were asked to check temperature daily given positive pericardial fluid cx, which were thought to be contaminant, as discussed above -Pt will follow-up with cardiac surgery after discharge regarding recent AVR -Patient will follow-up with pulmonology at the VA after discharge regarding the pleural effusions, this referral will be made by his PCP and he will need a repeat CXR at this appointment  Medications on Admission: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H 2. docusate sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] 3. aspirin 81 mg daily 4. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension 30mL Q6H PRN 5. dorzolamide 2 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic [**Hospital1 **] 6. simvastatin 40 mg Daily 7. metoprolol tartrate 37.5 mg TID 8. tiotropium bromide 18 mcg Daily 9. alprazolam 0.25 mg  PO QHS 10. bisacodyl 10 mg daily PRN 11. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg Q6H PRN 12. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg [**Hospital1 **] 13. terazosin 5 mg QHS  Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 92068**], It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 69**].
You were hospitalizated with a fluid collection around your heart known as a pericardial effusion.
You underwent drainage of this collection, there was no fluid around your heart on your most recent heart ultrasound prior to discharge.
You will also need a repeat ultrasound of the heart 2 months after discharge  You were also noted to have a collection of fluid around your right lung, for which you underwent a thoracentesis (drainage of the fluid collection) and had a drain in place to drain the collection, which was removed prior to discharge.
Take all medications as instructed.
