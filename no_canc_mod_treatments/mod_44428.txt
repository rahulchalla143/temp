Admission Date:  [**2137-12-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-4-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amiodarone / Monosodium Glutamate  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: respiratory disress and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 76yo gentleman who had recent redo repair of thoracic aortic dissection with a course complicated by staph bacteremia and post operative seizures who was transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with respiratory distress and hypotension.
Yesterday, he became more drowsy and developed a fever to 102.4, and zosyn was started.
He was given 1mg of ativan and 40mg IV lasix, and he made 200cc of urine over the next 3 hours.
There was minimal output from his cholecystostomy tube.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were significant for BP of 60/p, which improved to 112/51 on recheck, HR 99 with a temp of 104 and RR of 37.
His pressure then drifted down to 71/37 despite receiving four liters of NS.
Peripheral dopamine was started, and he was noted to be alert to verbal commands.
A femoral line was placed (given b/l UE DVTs) and pressors were changed from dopamine to norepinephrine.
He received 325mg per GJ tube, vancomycin 1gm IV, and 600mg of tylenol PR.
CT surgery was consulted and recommended admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
On transfer to the floor his vital signs were HR 115, BP 112/53 RR 36, 100% on FiO2 of 100%, T 101.5 with norepinephrine at 0.9mcg/kg/min.
Per nursing report, his IV infiltrated with contrast during the CT torso and plastics placed a dressing over his right arm.
Past Medical History: Type A aortic dissection in [**2132**] s/p replacement aortic arch, resuspension of aortic valve, coronary artery bypass graft x1 s/p coil embolization of his left internal iliac aneurysm [**2136**] CTA in [**2137-9-3**] showed increase in size of aorta to 6.3cm, hence [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] planned redo repair in [**2137-10-3**] with replacement of ascending aorta and arch with graft  - developed seizures post-op, neurology felt this was sign of anoxic cerebral insult  - found to have E faecalis bacteremia  - LLL PNA with Cx growing serratia and E Coli  - left chest tube placed for pleural effusion  - right IJ thrombosis found during line placement  - hematuria felt to be due to Foley trauma while on coumadin; required CBI and followed by urology  - had trach and GJ tube [**10/2137**]  - [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] work-up with bronch for possible TBM, which was negative  - slow neurologic improvement, at time of discharge: "he was able to follow commands- he was able to open his eyes, grasp my fingers, and stick out his tongue.
He was not moving his limbs other than moving his toes and fingers and was not antigravity, he was areflexic"  - dc'd to rehab [**11-11**] on trach collar with CPAP Readmitted [**Date range (1) 104398**] with fever and seizures  - coag negative staph bacteremia from PICC line  - found to have Cholecystitis but not felt to be operative candidate, so had percutaneous choleycystostomy tube  - left subclavian DVT noted [**11-22**]  - dc'd back to rehab with plan for 6 weeks of vancomycin and return in [**1-4**] months for cholecystectomy pAFib s/p ablation [**7-/2137**], on coumadin s/p PPM for tachy-brady syndrome HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD Anemia, felt to be due to chronic disease h/o CHF with preserved EF Diverticulosis Benign prostatic hyperplasia Spinal Stenosis   Social History: Was living at [**Hospital **] rehab.

STUDIES: PICC placement [**2137-12-10**]: 1.
Evidence of occlusion involving the bilateral subclavian veins with no central access available for catheter placement.
20 cm PICC placed via right basilic access with the tip located in the mid axillary line.
A tracheostomy tube is visualized in good position.
The heart is notable for atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and a dual lead pacing device.
The patient is status post replacement of the ascending aorta with an interposition graft as well as replacement of the aortic arch.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is seen in place.
A metallic wire in the rectum may represent a temperature probe.
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
Post-surgical changes of the aorta and extensive aortic dissection, as described above, and overall minimally changed.
An aortic dissection flap is seen in the descending aorta to the level of the aortic arch, consistent with the patient's known history.
Brief Hospital Course: 76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**], Cipro [**12-4**]); Vanc should be continued until [**2137-12-26**] and Cipro until [**2138-1-1**].
Vancomycin was held on the day of discharge because of an elevated vancomycin level to 28.1.
A Vancomycin level should be checked in the AM, and vancomycin dose adjusted accordingly.
Patient was initially also treated with Cefepime, but this was soon stopped.
His ventilator settings were gradually weaned to pressure support, and at discharge he seemed to be at baseline with occassional periods off of the ventilator on trache mask (up to two hours).
He was tolerating a lasix drip, however was still net positive 7 liters from admission due to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
We elected to keep patient off of lasix drip on day of discharge because Cr was elevated, but think that the patient is total body volume overloaded and would benefit from further diuresis.
He has been intermittently hypotensive during bolus diuresis, and lasix drip has been well-tolerated and can resume in order to keep patient net even or slightly negative on a daily basis.
Could also be due to pneumonia or due to PICC line infection, so PICC line was removed and replaced with a midline.
Patient was seen by the infectious disease team who agreed with plan and suggested to start Meropenem if patient decompensated.
Patient's electrolytes were checked and repleted daily while on the lasix drip.
Foley catheter was changed twice over the admission, most recent being approximately 1 week prior to discharge.
At the time of discharge, patient's Creatinine was trending up, and this was felt to be most likely secondary to intravascular depletion from diuresis (although he remains total body volume overloaded).
Consequently, diuresis was held on the day of discharge as mentioned above, but Cr should be checked regularly and diuresis resumed when Cr trending down.
The ICU team considered performing a CT-guided thoracentesis, but his fevers resoved after pulling out the femoral line and a thoracentesis was not pursued.
EEG neg for seizure so likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic medications.
During his admission his Phenobarbital was stopped on [**12-8**] and his Keppra and Dilantin were continued with adjustment of Dilantin level to between [**6-11**] corrected for albumin.
Coumadin titration is likely changed dilantin levels, and his dilantin level should be checked every few days going forward.
Likely due to anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.
His PM coumadin should be held and INR checked in the AM, and dose adjusted accordingly.
The patient was bridged with Heparin for 48 hours after achieving a therapeutic INR.
We considered stopping dronederone as it was not keeping him in sinus, however did not hear back from his cardiologist so it was continued.
# Anemia:  Hct remained relatively stable, though patient did require 1U PRBC during admission.
# S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  No acute issues.
Simvastatin and ASA were continued.
# h/o diastolic heart failure: Patient was maintained on prn Lasix and then a Lasix drip given episodes of hypotension.
ASA was continued and repeat CEs remained stable with troponin of .11 and CKs did not increase.
Pain improved over time though the right arm continued to be ecchymotic and edematous at discharge.
Was treated with hot compresses, with some improvement.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Bacteremia Respiratory failure Acute Renal Failure Diastolic CHF Atrial fibrillation Pleural effusion  Secondary Diagnoses: Cholecystitis Aortic dissection s/p graft repair Tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Peripheral Vascular Disease Anemia, felt to be due to chronic disease Diverticulosis Benign prostatic hyperplasia Spinal Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair Hemodynamically stable Ventilator dependent but able to tolerate trach collar for short periods of time (up to several hours)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and low blood pressure thought to be related to an infection in your blood.
You were treated with IV fluids and antibiotics and you gradually improved.
Additionally, you had a decline in your renal function during the course of your hospitalization, likely related to receiving contrast for a CT scan at admission to the hospital and then receiving medications (Lasix) to help remove the IV fluids.
At a previous hospitalization, you have a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed to drain your gall bladder.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] during your stay, who recommended that you keep the tube at this time, but you should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in early [**Month (only) 404**].
You were continued on Coumadin and should have your INR checked and your Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly after discharge.
Dilantin can also increase your INR so it is important to have this checked every 2-3 days after discharge.
We made several changes to your medications: Stopped phenobarbital Continued vancomycin - please continue until [**2137-12-26**] Started Ciprofloxacin - please continue until [**2138-1-1**]  Please take all medications as prescribed.
