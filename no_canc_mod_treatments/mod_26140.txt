Admission Date:  [**2176-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-1-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Avelox  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: hypotension to 70s  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Tunnel catheter for HD -Blood and FFP transfusions -Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 68 yo F with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for AVR, who was transferred here from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible Y stent who is transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
No UOP recorded as she was incontinent, but at 8:45 pm a Foley was placed and drained 250 cc urine.
She was transferred to the MICU at this time for CVL placement and further monitoring.
Of note, her INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.4, and she was begun on a heparin drip (due to AVR).
Her heparin gtt was shut off at the time of her MICU transfer.
They felt she had a COPD exacerbation and treated her with steroids, bronchodilators, and azithromycin.
She was begun on zosyn and cipro for possible pseudomonal pna (as had reportedly grown this in past).
Her lasix and enalapril were discontinued there, and she was begun on IVF (total 500 cc).
Tracheobronchomalacia, s/p prolonged intubation/trach in [**2164**] s/p CABG 2.
Hyperlipidemia 11. s/p AVR [**2165**] 12.
Esophageal stricture s/p dilatation x2 [**85**].
The possibility of active extravasation is not optimally assessed without intravenous contrast.
A mid-cavitary gradient is identified, consistent with mild flow obstruction at rest.
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Normally-functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo woman with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for [**Hospital 64315**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible Y stent who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension, decreased Hct in the setting of retroperitoneal bleed.
She received aggressive fluid resuscitation and PRBC transfusions while in house as needed for bleeding.
Although her Hct stabilized, when we attempted to start anticoagulation with warfarin again at low doses, she subsequently developed a decreasing hematocrit which required further transfusions of FFP and Hct.
While attempting slow increase of coumadin to reach therapeutic INR for her AVR, she began further dropping her HCT with increase of her INR to 1.8.
She has required hemodialysis/ultrafiltration during her stay in the hospital, and she had a tunnel catheter placed to facilitate this in the future.
She did experience two transient episodes of desaturiation of hemodialysis.
She tolerated two additional dialysis sessions without incident.
Elevated WBC count - She was hypothermic and met criteria for SIRS but this is all likely explained by hypovolemic shock.
This was thought to be more consistent with venous stasis changes than cellulitis and did not change when vancomycin was started.
Tracheobronchomalacia -  Patient was originally transferred for stent placement for this problem.
She and her family subsequently decided not to proceed with this procedure given the risk/benefit ratio and the complications she has had during her hospital stay.
Volume resuscitation as above.
she was continued on statin for secondary prevention.
Aspirin was held given bleeding risk.
Diabetes mellitus - She was treated with an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital to maintain glucoses <120.
Prophylaxis - She was maintained on PPI and pneumoboots while in the hospital.
Access:  She had a tunnel line and PICC placed under IR while in the hospital.
