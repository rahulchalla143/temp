EEG [**2101-9-20**]: This continuous recording revealed a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy initially with some focal features in the right central area admixed with multifocal interictal epileptiform activity and short duration bursts of semi-rhythmic epileptiform activity, the latter in the right frontal central region.
As the tracing evovled temporally, the background seemed to gradually improve such that, at the end of the record, it was still compatible with a moderate diffuse encephalopathy still with focal features and occasional interictal epileptiform activity.
