Blood cultures and wound cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on vancomycin.
Reportedly, the patient had not received insulin that morning.
The patient was also noted to have an evaluated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for removal of arteriovenous graft.
The patient became unresponsive on the surgery floor and was noted to have systolic blood pressures in the 70s; reportedly baseline is between 80 and 90.
The patient was bolused with intravenous fluids which increased the systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer observation of blood pressures.
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday for two years).
Status post right arteriovenous graft placement in [**2108-8-27**].
Status post multiple thrombectomies and graft revisions; last thrombectomy was [**2109-6-27**].
Status post catheterization in [**2108-12-28**] which showed 3-vessel disease and required a percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery.
Ventricular tachycardia; status post automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator in [**2108-12-28**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus; now insulin dependent.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right below-knee amputation.
Sarcoma; status post excision in [**2084**].
Status post gastric bypass.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Renagel 1200 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Nephrocaps, Protonix, [**Doctor First Name **], Isordil, amiodarone, Neurontin, Coumadin (which was held since [**9-26**]), Plavix, Lidoderm, Tylenol No.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and seizures.
A tunnel dialysis catheter in the right chest.
A fluctuant mass at the right arteriovenous graft site with ulceration and drainage of pus.
The patient was initially given bolus fluids; however, eventually required dopamine for pressures.
This was eventually switched to Levophed, and later she was put on Vasopressin with some success getting off the Levophed; however, the patient remained requiring Vasopressin until she expired.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis.
She was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.
It was felt that the patient likely had intervascular infection and at some point would need an echocardiogram; or at some point evaluation to see if her dialysis catheter was infected.
ELEVATED INR:  The patient was given 8 units of fresh frozen plasma with correction of INR.
The patient was also given vitamin K.  Her coagulations were followed.
She required one bag of platelets and five bags of packed red blood cells.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was electively intubated for airway protection.
She remained intubated until after surgery; at which point in time she was attempted to be extubated.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient went for hemodialysis the following day.
She was continued on her renal medications.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was discontinued on the Plavix for the upcoming surgery.
The patient had atrial fibrillation; however, she was supratherapeutic on her INR, and Coumadin was held.
Amiodarone was held as it was a possible cause of her elevated liver function tests.
She required sedation when she was on the ventilator.
DIABETES:  She was started on an insulin sliding-scale; however, she remained hypoglycemic during most of her admission and required several D-5 ampules.
They indicated that it had been the patient's expressed desire to avoid a prolonged time on mechanical ventilation.
