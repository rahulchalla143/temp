His last surgery was [**2163-9-24**] where he underwent a left femoral popliteal revision with bovine patch for graft stenosis.
He returns now with left leg ischemia.
He has had a right femoral popliteal in [**2163-4-24**], a right femoral anterior tibial bypass with PTFE and a right femoral endarterectomy and right profunda femoris plasty secondary to failing graft in [**2163-8-25**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past illnesses include peripheral vascular disease, carotid disease, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction at the age of 36, status post coronary artery bypass graft x4 in [**2160**] at [**Hospital6 1130**].
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis via Quinton catheter Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
At the time of discharge he returned to peritoneal dialysis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left femoral PFA endarterectomy with bone patch angioplasty, left common femoral artery to below knee popliteal with PTFE [**2163-1-25**].
Exploration of the right femoral popliteal bypass with thrombectomy, a right femoral anterior tibial with PTFE, right femoral endarterectomy and right profundoplasty in [**2163-8-25**].
Revision of the left femoral below knee popliteal bypass angioplasty with bovine patch in [**2163-9-24**].
Quinton catheter in [**2162**].
Hemodialysis catheter in [**2163-7-25**].
MEDICATIONS:  Include Coumadin for his graft.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination with bilateral carotid bruits.
He was begun on IV heparinization.
Renal service was consulted for peritoneal dialysis management.
The patient underwent on [**2164-1-31**] an arteriogram which showed a patent right femoral anterior tibial bypass graft with a proximal common femoral artery 90% stenosis.
The left iliac was with disease and the left common femoral was with disease.
His beta blockade was increased to maintain a goal heart rate between 60 and 70.
Hemodialysis was instituted.
He was started on amiodarone which converted him to normal sinus rhythm.
IV heparinization was begun and recommendations were long term anticoagulation with Coumadin.
The patient underwent on [**2-13**] a left common iliac artery and external iliac artery stenosis with a left femoral patch angioplasty and removal of his peritoneal dialysis catheter.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was noted to have persistent left foot ischemia and they felt he would probably wind up requiring a below knee amputation.
The patient underwent a right femoral endarterectomy with patch angioplasty and a graft thrombectomy.
The patient's amiodarone was increased secondary to increase in atrial fibrillation.
IV heparinization was continued.
He tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was therapeutic on his Coumadin and his heparin was discontinued.
The Coumadin was discontinued.
PT/INR the following day was 2.2 after 5 mg of vitamin K. Recommendations were to hold the Augmentin which we had started for the patient's stump cellulitis and to continue to monitor his coagulations carefully, reconsider another antibiotic given that the Augmentin would synergize the effect of Warfarin.
Physical therapy felt the patient would require rehabilitation prior to the patient being discharged home.
The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation when medically stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg daily, acetaminophen 650 mg q 4 hours around the clock, Protonix 40 mg q 12 hours, amiodarone 400 mg daily, allopurinol 100 mg daily, albuterol nebulizer q 6 hours, arvistatin 80 mg daily, gabapentin 300 mg q 4 to 8 hours, amitriptyline 25 mg at h.s., hold for excessive sedation, Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d., Bisco 10 mg tablets or suppositories p.r.n.
MiraLax 17 grams q.d.
for constipation, insulin sliding scale - please see enclosed copy of insulin sliding scale, temazepam 50 mg h.s.
p.r.n., aspirin 325 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
History of coronary artery disease with myocardial     infarction at the age of 36, status post coronary artery     bypass graft x4.
End stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis,     discontinued with removal of the PD catheter and begun     hemodialysis.
Postoperative hypotension requiring vasopressor support     secondary to gastrointestinal bleed,corrected.
Status post left below knee amputation on [**2-15**].
Status post right femoral endarterectomy with patch     angioplasty and graft thrombectomy with return of     circulation.\ 17.
If patient's INR drops below 2 IV heparin should be begun for a total PTT 60 to 80.
