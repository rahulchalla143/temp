The patient also denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, or lower extremity edema.
The patient was given nitro drip, heparin intravenous, intravenous beta blocker and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Electrocardiograms at the outside hospital involved to include ST elevation and both the anterior and lateral leads with peak ST elevations of 6 mm in leads V2 and V3.
For intervention the patient had Angioject and stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery without complications.
Sat 98% on a nonrebreather and then subsequently 93% on 8 liters nasal cannula.
Per report the patient had been very anxious in the catheterization laboratory requiring heavy sedation with morphine and Haldol.
He is status post stenting of his left anterior descending coronary artery.
For management of his coronary artery disease he was started on aspirin, Plavix and he was placed on Integrilin for a total of 18 hours.
He was empirically started on a statin.
He was also started on a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor and his cardiac enzymes were cycled.
The patient was started on Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
The patient tolerated Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
He is also placed on Atorvastatin 20 q.h.s., Plavix 75 q.h.s.
and aspirin 325 q.d.
Pump function:  The patient was noted on bed side echocardiogram after his cardiac catheterization to have severe increase in his ejection fraction with a estimated EF of 20%  The patient had a formal echocardiogram on the [**5-10**] that showed an ejection fraction between 20 and 30%.
Based on these results the patient was started on intravenous heparin for the risk of left ventricular thrombus with such an akinetic ventricle including the apex.
However, as it was discovered that the patient had baseline dementia per family report and he subsequently suffered from an episode of delirium it was felt that the atrial fibrillation did not outweigh the risk the patient had of falling.
Therefore the intravenous heparin was stopped and the patient was placed on prophylactic subQ heparin.
The patient was diuresed with 20 intravenous Lasix prn and responded nicely within the first 24 hours.
His chest x-ray, which had initially showed failure cleared after diuresis and the patient required no further dosing of Lasix.
The patient was initially controlled with an intravenous insulin drip according to the [**Last Name (un) **] protocol and was then converted over to a sliding scale of regular insulin along with Glucophage 500 b.i.d.
and NPH fixed doses.
He was initially managed with Haldol, which seemed to help with the patient's agitation and was therefore discontinued.
A geriatric consult was obtained and they recommended that the patient be given Risperidone .5 mg b.i.d.
Therefore as stated under Cardiovascular the patient's Captopril dose was decreased to prevent orthostasis and he was put on a tight glucose control regimen including Glucophage, NPH and regular insulin sliding scale.
