He had his tunneled catheter removed [**12-8**] at the bedside, attempted HD via fistula [**12-9**] which did not work, so required replacement of tunnerled HD catheter on [**12-10**], followed by HD, and was stable for discharge.

Continue HD sessions per outpatient regimen, had attempt via fistula which was not successful so he had a tunneled line placed.
