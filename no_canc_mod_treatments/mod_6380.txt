The patient has been on end stage renal disease since approximately seven years ago and has a history of Type 2 diabetes, going back 20 to 30 years and is status post adenoma resection approximately 13 years ago with resulting panhypopituitarism and is currently on Prednisone at the current dose of 10 mg daily as well as Synthroid dependent.

The Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued.
Her hemodialysis was continued for end stage renal disease, continuing sessions of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday hemodialysis sessions.
On the morning of [**8-18**], the fingerstick was 42 and the following protocol was initiated - Given her lack of peripheral intravenous access, all [**Month (only) **] draws to this point were done by arterial sticks in the left radial artery, the right arm being off limits as her hemodialysis port was cited in that arm.
Initial arterial stick was drawn, being divided to be sent off for a serum glucose with additional tubes sent off in the Tiger top tube for analysis for termination of total insulin, pro-insulin, C-peptide and Beta hydroxy butyrate levels.
After this [**Month (only) **] sample was obtained, the patient was given intravenous injection peripherally of 1 mg of Glucagon and, then at set time points after the administration of Glucagon, repeat arterial sticks were done to determine the serum glucose.
The initial plan was for [**Month (only) **] to be drawn at 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the administration of Glucagon, however, given her terribly poor access, the actual timepoints obtained were at 15 minutes after the administration of Glucagon and then at 45 minutes after the administration of Glucagon.
In terms of her panhypopituitarism she was continued on her dose of Synthroid 75 mcg daily and dose of 10 mg of Prednisone p.o.
