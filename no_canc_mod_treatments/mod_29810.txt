CXR was read as negative, but he was given levofloxacin at the NH for empiric treatment of pneumonia.
He was given Humalog 7U IV, then started on an insulin gtt.
He was also given vancomycin 1g IV and Flagyl 500mg IV.
Pt appreciated to aspirate cup sips, but straw sips of thin liquid were safe for PO intake.
As such, I recommend the pt's PO diet include thin liquids, pureed solids, and PO meds crushed in puree.
Pt will require 1:1 assistance with meals to maintain aspiration precautions as listed below.
PO diet: thin liquids, pureed solids, PO meds crushed in puree.
His EKG was thought to have slight changes in the STE V1-V3 and troponin was slightly elevated at 0.08-- Cardiology reviewed his EKG and felt there was no significant change.
In the MICU, treated w/ vanco/levo/flagyl, given insulin gtt and fluid resuscitated.
Ultimately, sodium was brought to 140s over the course of five days, pt completed 5d of antibiotics (planned course of ten, vanco discontinued), converted to SC insulin regimen, and felt stable for transfer to floor.
He was continued on levofloxacin and started on vancomycin and flagyl.
All of his cultures here have been negatiave, although he was started on antibiotics prior to his arrival.
Vancomycin was discontinued after a 5 day course as urine and blood cultures were negative.
Plan for levofloxacin and flagyl to be continued to complete a 10 day course.
# HYPERNATREMIA/ELECTROLYTES: Appeared to have nongap acidosis, probably initially related to dehydration and later attributed to NS given for fluid rescuscitation.
A video swallow examination was perfromed and showed that the patient is able to take thin liquids with a straw and pureed food with 1:1 meal assist.
After discussion with the family and nutrition, will hold off on PEG placement and reevaluate in nursing home.
# CHF: Systolic CHF with EF 25% and grossly volume overloaded by exam plus O2 requirement likely [**3-10**] fluid administration for sepsis.
He responded well to diuresis and by the end of his hosptial course, no longer had an O2 requirement.
# DM: The patient presented with elevated blood glucose in the 700s, he was initially started on an insulin drip and transitioned to insulin subq.
Hgb A1C at admission 8.3  He will be discharged on his inpatient insulin regimen and will need to follow up with his primary care for further management.
# CAD: - started on ASA and metoprolol .
# FEN: Thin liquids and pureed diet with 1:1 assist.
