She has had a steadily increasing oxygen requirement since, progressing to the point on the day of admission of being on BiPap 14/8 15L.
She has been evaluated for her hypoxia by various coverage physicians over the weekend and was treated with nebulizer treatments and lasix with little improvement.
On exam in the ED, she was noted to have decreased air movement with rhonchi and faint wheezes which improved with nebulizer treatments.
She was initially placed on Bipap in the ED; after nebulizer treatments, she improved and was put back on nasal cannula.
The patient was thus intubated in the ED for worsening respiratory failure and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Chest CT [**2176-1-5**]: FINDINGS: The large left hydropneumothorax, mostly air filled was also shown on plain chest radiographs earlier today.
ET tube and NG tube are in good position with the NG tube terminating in the body of the stomach and the ET tube well above the carina.
CXR [**2176-1-5**] pm: Compared with the examination obtained approximately 6 1/2 hours earlier, a left chest tube has been inserted, with its tip ending in the apex.
The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.
A nasogastric tube descends into the abdomen.
Heart size is normal, although larger than it was prior to chest tube insertion.
Tip of the ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
CXR [**2176-2-5**]: One of the two left basal pleural tubes have been withdrawn approximately 6 cm now projecting over the cardiac apex and left hemidiaphragm.
The other tube is unchanged in position, tip just to the left of the midline at the level of the left hemidiaphragm.
Heterogeneous opacification in the lungs is probably a combination of pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia and emphysema.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 85yo woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, admitted with respiratory failure, intubated in the ED, likely secondary to multilobar pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure, complicated by a pneumothorax.
She was treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin for 14 days for broad coverage given that she had recently been living in health care facilities.
DFA for influenza and urinary legionella antigen were both negative.
She then developed a low grade temperature and with 2/16 sputum culutres with 2+ GNR and with a history of enterobacter, she was restarted on a 10 day course of meropenem to be finished at rehabilitation.
Her sputum culture grew gram positive cocci and she was started on a course vancomycin, to complete a 10 day course of vancomycin and 10 day course of meropenem.
She was day [**7-8**] fo vancomycin on [**2176-2-23**], she still remained supratherapeutic on day of discharge at 31 (on day [**8-8**]).
Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was treated with albuterol and atrovent, though she was not very responsive to these medications.
She was also given a dose of solumedrol 125mg IV, with a subsequent prednisone taper that was ongoing at the time of discharge.
She was diuresed intermittently throughout the hospitalization (see below) She was intubated in the emergency room and had a tracheostomy on [**1-18**].
Her ventilator weaning was complicated by a cuff leak, requiring 30mmHg pressure to seal.
This improved, and she has done well on pressure control.
Thoracic surgery was called, and in concert with interventional pulmonology, they placed a chest tube in the apex of the left lung.
She was determined to still have an element of pneumothorax at her left lung base, so a second chest tube was placed.
The apical chest tube was displaced slightly and caused subcutaneous emphysema, but it was effective and was able to be clamped and removed on [**1-10**] without complications.
As such, the thoracic team performed pleurodesis x 3 ([**Date range (1) 40042**]) with doxycycline.
The chest tube was set to suction and the inspiratory leak resolved.
The chest tube was clamped and removed [**1-24**] without complications.
A chest x-ray after chest tube removal showed no pneumothorax.
Another chest tube was placed, with a significant amount of resulting subcutaneous emphysema (head to toe) and no significant change in the pneumothorax.
A second chest tube was thus placed, which resulted in some improvement in the pneumothorax.
Her course was also complicated by a bronchopleural fistula, requiring pressure control ventilation.
Her fistula gradually resolved, and she has been able to be adequately supported on pressure control ventilation.
Her chest tubes were put to water-seal on [**2176-1-31**], then were clamped on [**2-9**], and daily CXRs have revealed no evidence of recurrent PTX.
The chest tubes were sequentially clamped and then removed with serial chest xrays revealing no pneumothorax.
Hypotension - She had an episode of hypotension in the setting of her pneumothorax.
Initially, it responded to fluid boluses and, given that the patient had been aggressively diuresed previously, was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
It resolved after chest tube placement.
She responded well to lasix 40mg IV.
She was treated with one dose of fluconazole with resolution of her symptoms.
Her metoprolol was restarted and the tachycardia resolved.
The pt was switched from diltiazem to metoprolol as the pt has been noted to have better rate control with BB than CCB.
The pts amiodarone was weaned down to 200 mg po qd prior to discharge.
She developed episodes of atrial fibrillation while on amiodarone and cardiology was consulted and she was started on a low dose heparin drip for possible DCCV if she became hypotensive.
Her heparin gtt was discontinued on day of discharge.
Diabetes - She was monitored with fingersticks.
Initially, she was treated with an insulin drip, but she was later switched to a sliding scale.
Hypertension - Other than during her brief episode of hypotension, she was treated with her outpatient metoprolol and diltiazem.
The pts medications wer changed to metoprolol and amiodarone.
Peripheral vascular disease - Plavix and aspirin was continued.
Hyperthyroidism - She was continued on methimazole.
Nutrition - She was treated with tube feeds, initially by orogastric tube, then by PEG once she had the tracheostomy.
