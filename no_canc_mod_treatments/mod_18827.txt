Patient was a direct admission to the Operating Room on [**2178-2-11**] where she underwent aortic valve replacement.
She had an aortic valve replacement with a #19 mosaic valve.
Her bypass time was 93 minutes with a cross clamp time of 66 minutes.
She was in a sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute with Levophed at 0.4 mcg/kg per minute, milrinone at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute, Amiodarone at 1 mg per minute, Neo-Synephrine at an undisclosed dose, epinephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute, Vasopressin at 2.4 units per minute, and Lidocaine at 2 mcg per minute as well as propofol at 30 mg per hour.
Upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was placed on a _______ infusion as well as Ativan and Fentanyl infusions.
In summary, the patient had an RVAD placed, and following the procedure she was again returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, again, with an open chest.
She was slowly weaned from her vasoactive medications.
Following the stenting to the RCA the patient returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She remained hemodynamically stable with her RVAD in place and the paralytics were slowly weaned to off so that by postoperative day nine all paralytics had been weaned off.
By that point the patient had also been weaned from her epinephrine, significantly weaned from her Pitressin.
Following the bronch the patient's Heparin was discontinued.
She was further weaned from her cardioactive IV medications, and on [**2178-3-3**] she again returned to the Operating Room, at which time her right ventricular assist device was removed.
Following RVAD removal the patient was again transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
She was in a sinus rhythm at 110 beats per minute with milrinone at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute, epinephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute, Levophed at 2 mcg/kg per minute, Vasopressin at 1.2 units per hour, Amiodarone at 0.5 mg per hour, and propofol at 30 mg per hour.
Patient tolerated the closure well.
Her Levophed had been weaned off, milrinone is at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute, epinephrine at 0.6 mcg/kg per minute, Vasopressin at 0.6 units per hour, Amiodarone at 0.5 mg per hour, as well as an insulin and Ativan drip.
Over the next week the patient continued to make slow progress at weaning from her vasoactive IV medications as well as slow progress in weaning from the ventilator.
Following identification the patient was switched from Fluconazole to caspofungin.
Following placement of the tracheostomy the patient returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, and over the next two days, started on trach collar trials, which she tolerated well.
Patient did exceedingly well with her trach collar trials.
At that point her tube feeds were changed to be cycled in the nighttime hours only, and she was able to take oral food during the course of the daytime.
At that point she was brought to the Operating Room for additional sternal debridement as well as a pec flap advancement and closure.
Following her sternal debridement the patient was again begun on trach collar trials, and within two days she was successfully weaned from the ventilator and has been without ventilator support since [**2178-4-3**].
The patient's oral diet was advanced over the next week with shorter and shorter periods of tube feed cycles at night, and by [**2178-4-8**] she was on a full oral diet.
