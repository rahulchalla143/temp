TUNNELED HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER EXCHANGE ([**4-6**]): PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, an informed consent was obtained from the patient.
The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the patient's right neck and right upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
After injection of local anesthesia at subcutaneous tunnel the existing tunneled hemodialysis catheter was released from the tunnel.
A 0.035 Amplatz guidewire was advanced through each lumens of the indwelling hemodialysis catheter into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
The indwelling hemodialysis catheter was removed and a new 15.5 French tunneled hemodialysis catheter with 19 cm tip-to-cuff length was advanced over the wire.
However, it was not possible to advance the catheter across the venotomy site.
A 16 French peel- away sheath catheter was therefore advanced over the guidewire into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance and the inner dilator and guidewire were then removed and the tunneled hemodialysis catheter was advanced through the peel- away sheath with its tip positioned at the right atrium.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of tunneled dialysis catheter with a new 15.5 French tunneled hemodialysis catheter, 19 cm tip-to-cuff in length via right internal jugular vein, its tip is positioned at the right atrium.
He was initially placed on a Labetolol gtt, and transferred to the MICU for blood pressure management.
He was discharged on Labetolol 300 PO bid and Lisinopril 20 mg daily (which can be titrated back up to his home dose of 40 mg daily).
We continued to hold his home doses of Clonidine 0.1 PO bid and Clonidine 0.2 mg/24 hr qSat, but these can be added back as his blood pressure tolerates.
He has been on Reglan, Erythromycin, Zelnorm, and Domperidone without significant improvement.
He was continued on Reglan 5 mg PO qidachs and Omeprazole 40 mg daily, and encouraged to eat small, frequent meals.
He was scheduled an outpatient GI appointment to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to address his gastroparesis and for consideration of G tube and J tube.
# Coag negative Staph bacteremia: The patient has had intermittent blood and catheter cultures positive for Coag negative Staph since [**2186-11-30**].
Blood culture from [**2187-4-3**] showed no growth, but his HD catheter and right triple lumen both grew Staph coag negative.
He was continued on Vancomycin per HD protocol.
He should be followed up by transplant surgery to determine if the old graft should be removed prior to possible transplant.
The patient's HD catheter grew Staph coag negative, so it was changed over a wire in IR on [**4-6**].
His Vancomycin was dosed per HD protocol.
He was continued on Lanthanum 500 PO tid with meals.
He is a high risk transplant candidate given his gastroparesis, but they do recommend proceeding with transplantation given his previous difficulties with HD access.
# CAD: The patient is s/p STEMI in [**12-21**] in the setting of cocaine use.
He underwent PCI with bare metal stent placement to the LAD.
He was continued on ASA 325 mg daily, [**Date Range **] 75 mg daily, and Atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
He was continued on Labetalol 300 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 20 daily (to titrate back up to home dose of 40 daily).
# Type 1 DM: Continued Glargine 5 U qhs and RISS.
