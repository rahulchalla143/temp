It was thought your seizures were related to hypoglycemia since you administered Insulin to yourself without eating dinner.
When you arrive to the ED you were treated with Ativan IV which controlled your seizures.
Because of the concern for additional seizures and the need to make sure your airway was clear, a breathing tube was placed in the ED and you were admitted to the MICU.
Neurology cleared you for discharge and you do not need to take additional medication for the seizures.
[**Hospital **] clinic came by to help control your blood sugars and your Lantus dose was increased to 9 units at bedtime.
You are being discharged in stable condition, without any seizure activity and with good control of your blood sugar.
The following changes to your medications were made: - STOP Glipizide.
This was stopped because your glucose was being controlled with insulin alone in the hospital.
Glipizide can be restarted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at your next visit.
- START Insulin Sliding Scale.
Please discard your prior prescription and use the insulin sliding scale attached.
- Continue taking your other medications as prescribed.
