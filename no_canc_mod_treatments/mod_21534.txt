As a result he was    started on Linezolid with resolution of the fevers.
This    issue was discussed with the infectious disease team who    felt that treatment at this time while the patient was on    antibiotics and at the same time also had a Foley in place    would have been useless.
It was therefore decided not to    treat him until the Foley could be discontinued and all    antibiotics would be stopped.
Retroperitoneal bleed:  Mr. [**Known lastname 496**] developed a    retroperitoneal bleed while on Coumadin with elevated INR    up to 4.6.
His hematocrit dropped to approximately 25 and    he required several blood transfusions in order to keep it    above 28, which was the target that the team had    established given his prior history of coronary artery    disease.
The vascular surgery team was consulted and they    recommended to intervene on this hematoma.
The INR was    reversed with fresh frozen platelets and Coumadin and the    hematoma has been resolving slowly since.
Anticoagulation:  The patient required anticoagulation for    history of HIT, which happened during this    hospitalization, but prior to [**4-26**] as stated above the    patient became supratherapeutic and developed a    retroperitoneal bleed.
However, once the retroperitoneal    bleed stabilized and his INR level came down to 1.5 low    dose Coumadin was restarted and eventually increased again    to 7.5 mg po q.d.
After only one day of Coumadin 7.5 mg    po q.d.
It was thought to be most likely    neurological possibly secondary to pain or anxiety and it    was addressed by providing him with constant sedation.
