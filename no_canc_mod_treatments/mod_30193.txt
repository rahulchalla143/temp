Admission Date:  [**2106-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placement to the third obtuse marginal coronary branch (OM3).
STEMI protocol was initiated and MR. [**Known lastname **] was given a load of 600mg Plavix, IV Heparin bolus, and started on Nitroglycerin drip.
325mg ASA had already been given prior to arrival to the hospital.
The ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG with these treatments and the patient's chest pain decreased to [**12-24**] and was stable at that level leading up to his presentation to the CCU.
Of note, the patient had an episode of chest pain in [**2095**] which led to emergent cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to OM3.
Unfortunately, subsequent to his MI in [**2095**] he endured a frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage immediately after the hospitalization for this procedure which was attributed to a combination of poorly controlled hypertension and several anticoagulants, including ticlid, aspirin, and heparin.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2095**]: 90% stenosis in OM3 into which a BMS was placed 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Hyperlipidemia -Glucose intolerance -HTN -Osteoarthritis -Right inguinal hernia, status post repair in [**2068**] -CVA: frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage post-cath while on Ticlid and aspirin -Prostate cancer s/p local radiation .

[**2106-9-27**] CARDIAC CATH (left): Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.0x12mm Xience drug-eluting stent in the OM3 were performed.
Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the OM3.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is an 83-year-old male with longstanding history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and CAD (prior BMS placement to OM3 in [**2095**]) who developed recurrent chest pain for 2 days and was found to have posterior STEMI on arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-9-26**].
STEMI protocol was initiated and the patient was given a load of 600mg Plavix, IV Heparin bolus, and started on Nitroglycerin drip.
He was also given 325mg ASA and high dose Atorvastatin was started.
ST-elevations soon resolved on repeat EKG with medical therapy and the patient's chest pain also abated.
He was admitted to the CCU for further management and a left sided cardiac catheterization was arranged soon after the patient was admitted.
He underwent successful placement of DES to OM3 coronary branch without any immediate complications.
During his hospital stay he was continued on daily ASA 325MG , Plavix 75 mg daily, a high dose statin, IV heparin, Metoprolol and Captopril.
Captopril was eventually switched to PO Lisinopril prior to discharge and the patient's beta-blocker was uptitrated to Metoprolol Succinate XL 150 mg daily at discharge.
He will continue to take his HTN and CAD medications as outlined below and he will plan to follow-up in 4 weeks for a Cardiology visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
RIGHT KNEE PAIN - One day after stent placement Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed swollen, warm, tender right knee which was notably effused.
The orthopedic team also performed a local injection with Bupivicaine and Cortisone for pain control.
The fluid tap itself was very therapeutic in that it also readily relieved the effusion.
The patient will have secondary benefit from daily ASA, and additional Tylenol can be used for recurrent pain as needed.
The patient was asked to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4304**] [**Name (STitle) 284**] in the orthopedics department who he already sees for his osteoarthritis management if he had a return of his knee pain or effusion in the coming weeks.
The patient's right knee x-ray showed no new changes, just his baseline  known osteophytic changes and joint space narrowing with chondrocalcinosis that was equivalent to his [**12/2104**] x-ray.
In the interim the patient was treated with IV Vancomycin for 3 days due to concern for a possible MRSA infection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 94783**] antibiotics were stopped prior to discharge.
STROKE HISTORY : The [**Hospital 228**] medical history is significant for a neurologic event/hemorrhagic CVA which occured in the setting of anticoagulation and hypertension in [**2095**].
Thus, Integrillin was never initiated as part of his MI management and the CCU team aggressively controlled the patient's hypertension with a SBP goal < 140 and during his stay he underwent daily full neurological checks.
HTN - Amlodipine was held and eventually discontinued as the patient had good BP control with SBP ranges in the 120s on uptitrated doses of beta-blockers and ace-inhibitors during his stay.
The patient was given Captopril which was increased gradually and switched to 40mg PO Lisinopril along with 150mg Metoprolol XL at time of discharge.
The patient was asked to continue these 2 medications for his hypertension management.
He was started on a sliding scale insulin drip soon after his admission for better control in the CCU setting.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] (appointment set up for [**2106-10-15**]) for additional diabetic screening and to discuss the need for additional control with medications on an ongoing basis.
PROPHYLAXIS/CODE STATUS : The patient was initially given IV anticoagulation in the ACS setting which served as dual DVT PPx and he was switched to subcutaneous Heparin later in his hospital course to prevent DVTs.
The patient was given a bowel regimen of Senna and Colace to maintain regularity.
