The patient was started on NTG and his PA pressures came down from 70/35 to 55/30 with modest improvement of RV fxn.
Based on the epi-aortic scan and the surgeon's assessment of the ascending aorta, the procedure was changed to an off-pump LIMA - LAD CABG only.
The plan was to refer the patient for a trans-vascular aortic valve replacement.
Post-procedure:: The patient is on low-dose phenylephrine.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2107-2-4**] and underwent an off-pump coronary bypass grafting x1 with the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery.
A discussion was carried out as to what options the patient had.
At this point, it was elected to do the left internal mammary artery to left anterior superior descending artery bypass off pump.
Post operatively he was extubated and epinephrine was slowly weaned.
He was weaned from all vasoactive medications over the next 3 days and was hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.
He was started on Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and received 2 doses of 5 mg and INR went to 4.8.
He was resumed with Coumadin at a lower dose and INR was therapurtic at the time of discharge.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
