Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-19**], there are more extensive wall motion abnormalities (suggestive of interim LAD ischemia/infarction).
Cardiac Catherization [**2116-9-15**]: Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
Discharge Labs: 138  104  29 --------------< 127 4.2  27  1.1  Ca: 8.6 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.2  5.6 > 11.8/33.7 <  193  PT: 22.8  PTT: 72.3  INR: 2.2   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] is an 86yo male with HTN, DM, HLD and extensive history of CAD s/p CABG as well as severe AS, who was admitted to the CCU with the diagnosis of  NSTEMI: No EKG changes suggestive of ST-elevation on admission; CK peaked at 566 and CKMB peaked at 64.
The catherization was performed through his left brachial artery and showed no change from 6/[**2115**].
The patient was then evaluated by CT surgery for potential re-do bypass and AVR.
He was considered to be a surgical candidate, however the patient declined surgical intervention knowing the risks and benefits at this time.
He is discharged on maximal medical management for NSTEMI as well as isosorbide nitrite, amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month with plans to taper to 200 mg daily, and warfarin for anticoagulation in the setting of apical hypokinesis.
WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: As noted above, on [**2116-9-15**] the patient complained of chest pain and was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia with heart rate in the 140s that resolved with IV lopressor.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Reduction in EF from 50 to 25-30% and new left ventricular aneurysm on TTE.
The patient was bridged on warfarin therapy with goal INR of [**1-8**] due to new LV aneurysm and the inability to exclude a clot.
The warfarin dose was titrated up to reach the INR goal.

We did various studies of your heart and did not think that there were new areas of blockage to your coronary arteries.
We discussed your case with cardiac surgery for treatment of your coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis, but you have decided not to pursue surgery at this time.
Please make the following changes to your medications: # STOP Lisinopril from 40 mg daily # START Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily  # START Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily  # START Amiodarone 200 mg TWICE daily You will continue this Amiodarone dosing for 1 month, and thereafter you will decrease the dosing to Amiodarone 200 mg ONCE daily as prescribed your cardiologist.
Please be sure to follow-up with your cardiologist about when to decrease your Amiodarone dosing.
# STOP Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg once daily # START Metoprolol Succinate 100 mg once daily, in the AM # START Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg once daily, in the PM (Total Metoprolol dose = 150 mg daily)  # START Coumadin 2mg daily  # STOP Simvastatin 80 mg daily # START Rosuvastatin Calcium 20 mg PO DAILY (Of note, Discharge Plan signed [**2116-9-20**] erroneously documents no change in Simvastatin 80 mg; the patient was called to notify him of the change to Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and the Rx was called in to his pharmacy.)
Please call to schedule an appointment for the week of [**2116-9-21**] to have your INR checked to ensure that your Coumadin dose is correct.
