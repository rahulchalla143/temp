Thyroidectomy   History of Present Illness: 77 yr old pt with hx of large anterior wall infarct in [**2103**], cardiac arrest [**2112**], s/p AICD, treated with Amiodarone over last several years for VT.
He is s/p upgrade to BIV ICD in [**2123**] and s/p VT ablation at CMC several years ago and again this summer.
He was treated with steroids and Tapozole, however free T4 is still 1.78, and TSH is 0.133.
As a result, he has been on Mexilitine since the summer.
He also notes lightheadedness right before his first shock.
At that point, he was restarted on PO amiodarone.
He is being transferred for further management of VT, and evaluation for possible VT Ablation.
Also, of note the patient is on warfarin for Low EF.
ROS: + BPH like symptoms - He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: large anterior wall infarct in [**2103**] -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: sudden cardiac arrest [**2112**], ICD implant [**4-/2112**], cardiac arrest [**8-7**] and 3/07ICD upgrade to biv icd [**4-10**], prior VT ablation [**8-11**] and [**9-12**], amiodarone initiated [**Date range (1) 87824**], started mexiletine [**2126-9-2**] 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Diabetes mellitus -Ischemic Cardiomyopathy last EF 22% in [**2120**] on warfarin -prior tobacco abuse -ascending thoracic aneurysm 4.6cms ([**9-9**]) -Stage 3 CKD -Hyperthyroidism, presumed secondary to amio toxicity -colonoscopy normal in [**5-12**] -sleep apnea -dental surgery with 4 teeth extractions, 6 implants in [**2126-11-13**]   Social History: -Tobacco history: smoked up to 2 ppd for 25 years, quit in [**2103**]  -ETOH: 3 glasses wine/week -Illicit drugs: none -Retired pilot.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male history of old anterior wall infarct, multiple cardiac arrests s/p ICD, ischemic cardiomyopathy last EF 22% on warfarin, hyperthyroidism [**2-5**] amio toxicity, stage 3 CKD and two prior VT ablations admitted after three ICD shocks on [**Holiday 1451**], now s/p VT ablation and thyroidectomy, back on amiodarone.
Amiodarone started at OSH, but stopped upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] given possible VT ablation.
Patient underwent VT mapping and ablation, during which he was put on dopamine and neosynephrine.
He quickly weaned off of these pressors and was extubated.
Inpatient endocrinology was consulted and it was decided to proceed to thyroidectomy after discussion of VT management with cardiology.
He was restarted on amiodarone 200mg PO TID x1month after thyroidectomy.
As a diagnostic trial, his prednisone was quickly tapered to 5mg daily for five days, and his methimazole was increased to 20mg twice daily.
However, it became clear that he needed thyroidectomy sooner than later given the incidence of VT.
He underwent thyroidectomy without complication.
Stress dose hydrocortisone was given prior to surgery to avoid adrenal insufficiency.
It is possible that a parathyroid gland was taken upon removal of the thyroid gland, so calcium was monitored every 12 hours thereafter.
He was sent home on calcium carbonate 1000mg daily and instructed to call with any symptoms of hypocalcemia.
Synthroid was started at a 50mcg dose given recurrent VT.  Oxycodone was given for pain control.
#LV aneurysm:  His INR was 1.6 prior to thyroidectomy so he was maintained on a heparin drip until the day of surgery.
He was continued on warfarin after surgery.
#Right pleural effusion and mass: Noted on multiple chest xrays during admission.
He was maintained on medical management of aspirin, carvedilol, and  valsartan.
He was continued on medical management with spironolactone, furosemide, carvedilol, and warfarin.
#Anemia: Likely combination of iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, and CKD.
He was continued on iron and B12 supplementation.
He was continued on doxazosin and finasteride.
He was continued on albuterol and tiotropium inhalers.
