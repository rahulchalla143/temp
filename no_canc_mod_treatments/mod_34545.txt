Admission Date:  [**2124-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-8-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: asystolic cardiac arrest, respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation central line placement, Arterial line placement ERCP with biliary and pancreatic stents placed biloma pigtail catheter placement and removal ERCP for pancreatic stent removal   History of Present Illness: 82 yo F with COPD and intestinal malrotation with recent cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis s/p cholecystectomy c/b  bile leak transferred from the ERCP suite after intra-procedural hypoxia and bradycardic vs. asystolic cardiac arrest.
The patient was admitted with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center 07.02-23.08.
A cholecystostomy tube was placed.
Post op course was complicated by sepsis (thought due to enterobacter bacteremia though not confirmed in records) complicated by ARDS requiring ICU admission.
The pt was then readmitted with fevers/ dysuria on [**2124-8-23**] [**2-26**] apparent E. Coli urosepsis with positive urine and blood cultures.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was converted to open cholecystectomy with Ladd's procedure (fixation of malrotation) on [**2124-9-1**].
Her post-op course was complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (Cr peaking 3.0) thought [**2-26**] oliguric ATN that resolved with IVF resuscitation; post-op possible ileus vs. obstruction (documented on plain film on [**2124-9-6**]), and bile leak confirmed by subsequent CT scan and HIDA scan on 08.15-16.08.
An ERCP attempted on [**2124-9-11**] at OSH was aborted due to failure to access and repair the biliary tree.
SBP were maintained with a neosynephrine continuous infusion.
An attempt was made during rescucitation for central line placement in the internal jugular vein with return of fluid that was serous possibly consistent with aspiration of a pleural effusion.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Recent choledocholithiasis and gallstone pancreatitis s/p open cholecystectomy c/b bile leak - Recent multidrug resistent E Coli urosepsis (2/2 blood cx, on [**2124-8-23**]; negative as of [**2124-8-28**]) - CRI baseline Cr 1.5 - Diastolic CHF EF 65%, mild TR - HTN - H/o asthma and COPD - Intestinal malrotation s/p Ladd's procedure .

U/S guided paracentesis ([**2124-9-8**]): 300cc aspiration of dark brown/green fluid sent for culture and sensitivity.
Right humeral head fracture, only partially imaged.
Right central line in the mid SVC, ET tube approximately 3 cm above the carina.
Micro:Blood ([**2124-8-23**]): E. Coli Sensitive to Amikacin (8), Zosyn (<8), Imipenem (<4), Gentamycin (2) ([**2124-8-28**]): No growth.
ECG ([**2124-9-12**]): Sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes KUB - no obstruction ECHO - EF 75% IR [**2124-9-13**] - percutaneous biliary drain placed ERCP report [**2124-9-15**]- difficult cannulation KUB [**2124-9-19**]: biliary and pancreato-hepatic stents in place.
IR [**2124-9-28**]: biloma drain removed ERCP [**2124-9-29**]: pancreatic stent removed   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 82 yo F w/ COPD, CHF, intestinal malrotation s/p Ladd's procedure with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis s/p cholecystectomy c/b ARDS, ATN, ongoing bile leak, and recent urosepsis transferred following intra-ERCP hypoxia followed by bradycardic vs. asystolic cardiac arrest.
Biliary drainage was performed on [**9-14**], with retrieval of > 1L.
ERCP for stenting was attempted X24 hrs after percutaneous drain was placed (on [**9-15**]).
Surgery/GI were consulted and followed for 24hrs to monitor for reaccumulation and recommend imaging.
Stenting was performed [**2124-9-15**], and the pancreatic stent was to stay in place for 1 week, and the biliary stent for 8 weeks.
Vancomycin and meropenem were empirically started, and then vancomycin was discontinued after day 4 given low suspicion of MRSA, and meropenem continued for a 9 day course.
Once biliary drainage dropped  to less than 10 cc/day and CT abdomen showed the biloma was much decreased in size, the biloma drain was removed (on [**9-28**]) by IR.
S/p cardiac arrest Pt was intubated and placed on AC ventilation with phenylephrine.
Pt was weaned off phenylephrine by ICU day2.
Pt was placed on ipratropium and albuterol nebs for possible COPD exacerbation.
Pt was started on meropenem 9 day course and vancomycin for 4 day course for broad coverage for both urosepsis and possible aspiration event.
Pt was switched from AC to CPAP but remained hypercarbic and hyperventilation with low tidal volumes by HD9.
Pt was resuscitated by CPR, supported by atropine and epinephrine.
# Leukocytosis: This was persistent despite being on 9 days of meropenem since admission for urosepsis at OSH; sources included urine (UA+) with [**Female First Name (un) **] given her risk factors of indwelling lines/tubes; Gi processes, ARF, and long term broad spectrum antibiotics.
Repeat UA and Ucx X2 grew yeast despite being on meropenem and foley changes as well as Sputum cx and miniBAL with + yeast as well.
There was concern for fungemia and empiric fluconazole was started for a 1 week course.
Pt  responded slowly to gentle IVF bolus challenge.
Lasix diuresis was initiated ICU day2 after volume repletion.
Lasix diuresis was initiated following percutaneous biliary drainage procedure after volume repletion was achieved.
She was continued on advair, standing atrovent nebs, albuterol/atrovent as needed.
She is not on tiotropium at home, unclear degree of COPD, will hold on starting.
# Tachycardia: may be sinus tachycardia [**2-26**] infection (sources see above); also possible atrial tachycardia and was plcaed on verapamil for rate control.
# Ileus [**2-26**] ongoing bile leak and recent cholecystectomy and ladd's procedure with no evidence of continued obstruction.
Pt was started on TFs and transitioned to po.
The foley was changed given a positive yeast culture.
She was treated with fluconazole as per above (given yeast also on BAL).
Orthopedic surgery was consulted, and repeat AP/lateral x-ray of right femoral head was performed.
Ortho recommended a sling for shoulder as needed and non-operative management.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D. .
Again, the patient was treated with tylenol and ibuprofen.
She was given oxycodone 2.5 mg as needed for pain.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D. .
Held home beta-blocker and aspirin pending stabilization and repeat ERCP.
Her ASA was held given her stenting and procedures.
She was started on verapamil for rate control and her blood pressure was well controlled on this.
She was maintained on aspiration precautions.
She was started on Remeron and a nutrition consult was placed for poor oral intake and this will need to be monitored as an outpatient.
Her urinalysis was positive, and she was started on ciprofloxacin on day of discharge.
