She was managed conservatively given lactate was relatively low and interpreted as no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, with NGT, heparin gtt, and pain control.
Decision was made by family and pt not to pursue aggressive intervention.
Pt was started on anticoagulation and empiric antibiotics and was going to be transferred to the medicine floor when she was noted to be anuric and unresponsive to verbal stimuli.
They essentially do not want anything aggressive done including further scans and want her to be comfortable but did not want to completely withdraw care at this time.

* [**2-20**] CXR: NG tube in good position.
She was treated conservatively with antibiotics and NGT decompression and heparin gtt.
she was not felt to require surgical intervention.
She has known clot in SMA, left renal artery and LEFT atrial thrombus (seen on CT superior cuts of CT abd/pelvis) despite anticoagulation with coumadin.
She was placed on heparin during this hospitalization for concern for SMA and renal artery thrombosis.
Concern was for recurrent stroke given her history of atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus as above, in spite of heparin anticoagulation.
She was continued on empiric antibiotics for concern for PNA, though CXR was unremarkable.
After extensive discussion with both pt's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12149**] and her son [**Name (NI) 12150**] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12151**], decision was made to change goals of care to comfort measures only, as it was felt that she had likely suffered a recurrent stroke in spite of heparin anticoagulation.
Family clearly did not desire PEG tube placement, and agree that further anticoagulation would not likely alter her prognosis.
Her coumadin was discontinued.
She was evaluated by the pain and palliative care service, placed on a regimen or oral morphine elixir prn, though she did not complain of signficant pain.
she was placed on scopolamine patch to manage secretions.
# Atrial fibrillation:  h/o atrial fibrillation with known left atrial thrombus despite coumadin, pt was treated with heparin gtt and rate controlled with metoprolol, these were discontinued given her goals of care as above.
decision was made not to pursue PEG tube feeding or intravenous hydration as it was not felt likely to alter her prognosis.
# DISPO: pt was discharged to hospice facility [**2-25**] after discussion with [**Month/Year (2) 12150**] at [**Doctor Last Name **] who confirmed discussion with his mother [**Name (NI) 382**] at 3PM and confirmed that she will meet pt at the hospice facility.
