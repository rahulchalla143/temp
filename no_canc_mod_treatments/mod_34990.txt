C7 compression fracture and T2 horizontal vertebral body fracture without evidence of ligamentous injury or cord injury."
[**2194-1-4**] BAL: MSSA 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: Identified C7 fracture on imaging; she was placed in a [**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar.
A geriatrics consult was obtained -- her nighttime agitation was subsequently managed with Seroquel 25mg QHS.
She was maintained on her home beta blocker dose.
She did require neosynephrine while on propofol, which was given while intubated and post-intubation for agitation.
Geriatrics was consulted and suggested giving seroquel 12 mg qhs for agitation instead.
We attempted extubation on Hd #2, but she developed tachypnea and respiratory distress and was reintubated.
It was thought that her pleural effusions may have contributed to her respiratory compromise, and she had a right and left-sided thoracentesis on Hd #3 and 4 (respectively).
Given concern that she had respiratory distress upon extubation, and was now currently on positive pressure ventilation, a 20Fr chest tube was placed in her right side.
Follwoing the chest tube placement, a 3rd extubation was attempted, but she again required reintubation.
Her son had given a vague history of a possible prior tracheostomy, and radiation to her neck -- perhaps causing some tracheal stenosis.
She was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically until sputum cultures and BAL returned negative.
At the time of discharge, she was tolerating increase intervals on trach mask and off the vent.
GI: She received tube feeds through a dobhoff tube, then through her PEG tube.
On [**1-11**] she had several loose stools and the tube feedings were held.
Tube feedings were restarted on [**1-13**].
Heme: She is on Coumadin at home for her history of atrial fibrillation; she was maintained on a heparin drip while in the unit until she became therapeutic.
Endocr: She received a 48 hour course of dexamethasone for her supraglottic swelling, in hopes that this would improve her chances of extubation.
