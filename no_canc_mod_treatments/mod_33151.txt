Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old man with a past medical history including previous posterior circulation stroke (age 37) with residual ataxia requiring a wheelchair for mobility, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was "found down" by his house keeper on [**2176-1-25**] (last seen normal [**2176-1-17**]).
As his blood pressure was 194/119, he received labetolol and was loaded with phosphenytonin 1g.
He was eventually restarted on aspirin 325 mg daily.
As there was cellulitis surrounding the wound, treatment with clindamycin was initiated.
Accordingly, a course of flagyl was initiated.
It was decided that continuing aggressive care would not be consistent with the patient's wishes and therefore he was transitioned to comfort-measures only.
