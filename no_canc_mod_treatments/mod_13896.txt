Due to the clinical findings, the patient was taken urgently to the Neuroangiography Suite for coiling of aneurysm after angiogram.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The in situ ventricular drains were removed at the time of the angiogram due to clot formation in the drain tube and new drains were placed urgently at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On post-op day 1 the patient underwent instillation of intraventricular tPA for dissolution of intraventricular  clot and this helped improve drainage from the drains and resulted in a lower intracranial pressure.
The patient was maintained on sedation at that time.
Later on the 12th, the patient was taken to the operating room for treatment of [**Last Name (un) **] ve brain edema, at which time a left frontotemporal parietal craniectomy was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] with the bone flap plac ed into the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue for preservatio n. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The above procedure was done due to persistent elevated intracranial pressures.
However, the family felt they wanted to continue aggressive therapy and this was continued.
The patient remained in the ICU until the [**2140-9-2**], at which time bronchoscopy and placement of trach was done.
Subsequently to this, in early [**Month (only) **] a PEG tube was placed for feeding.
The patient tolerated these procedure quite well.
However, due to the clinical findings and the presence of ventricular drains, no further interventions were felt to be appropriate.
Decision was made for the patient to undergo removal of the drains and placement of a ventricular peritoneal shunt.
He was, therefore, taken back to the operating room on the afternoon of the [**2140-9-9**], where he underwent removal of the ventricular drains and placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt and also had replacement of the bone flap with a small incision made in the left abdominal wall for removal of the bone flap and replacement of the bone flap onto the left frontotemporoparietal area.
The patient tolerated all procedures well.
Therefore, toward the end of the first week of [**Month (only) **], discussion was made with the family, who indicated the desire to maintain current aggressive therapy with plans for the patient to be transferred to [**Country 4194**] to his home country when arrangements could be made.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically minimally responsive male who remains severely comatose with grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage status post multiple procedures.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications will be dictated in an addendum note.
