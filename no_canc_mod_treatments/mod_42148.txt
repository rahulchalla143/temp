He was admitted to the floor and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
On the evening of this admission, the patient arrested, with Pulseless electrical activity.
He was intubated, sedated, and an NG tube was placed.
He was aggressively fluid resuscitated as well as required pressor support.
After this fluid resuscitation and successfully weaning the pressors, the patient was approximately 15 Liters positive.
Naturally, the patient was seen by cardiology, who thought it was likely an NSTEMI but would require further workup once stabilized.
During his stay in the CVICU, the wound was further opened and packed with wet-to-dry dressings.
Tube feeds were started and the patient was weaned off the vent over the next week.
After extubation, the NG tube was removed and the patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
He initially passed this evaluation but was noticed to be gargling and having difficulty swallowing.
The patient had new onset atrial fibrillation on the floor which was rate controlled with IV lopressor.
He was started on TPN on [**2195-9-3**] but eventually need for a PEG tube was determined, which was placed on [**2195-9-10**].
Tube feeds were started and the patient is now at goal.
