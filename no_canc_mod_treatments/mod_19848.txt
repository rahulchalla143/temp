Gastroenterology consulted and recommended gastric pacer placement given duration of symptoms and failure of medical therapy.
Gastric pacer placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2122-2-18**].
However, on the hospitalist service, attempts had been made to control his hyperglycemia with boluses from the patient's insulin pump as well as SC insulin on a scale.
MICU course: The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU in DKA, where he was put on an insulin drip, and his glucose came under control overnight, and his anion gap narrowed to within normal limits.
He continued to have significant pain which was treated with a hydromorphone PCA.
He received tube feeds and was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin scale.
Post-MICU course: The patient's diet was advanced, while tube feeds were continued, for his malnutrition.
The patient's pain significant improved and his hydromorphone PCA was rapidly tapered over 3 days.
A plan was made that the patient would not continue any opioids on discharge.
He was instructed to remain on J-tube feeds until further evaluation by his gastroenterologist.
