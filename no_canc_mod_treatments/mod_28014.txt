Admission Date:  [**2185-11-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-3-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD (x2) s/p varices banding endotracheal intubation nasal packing biliary cholecystostomy   History of Present Illness: 70 year old male with history of heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, and prior episodes of hematemesis in [**Country 26231**] that were self-limited without further evaluation, who is transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for further evaluation of possible upper GI bleed.
They were concerned for a variceal bleed and started octreotide bolus then 50 mcg/hour, gave him PRBCs, as well as FFP and vitamin K 10 mg SQ.
They could not place an NG tube secondary to his nasal trauma from earlier in the day.
GI was called and recommended OG lavage, however the ED was unable to pass the OG tube as the patient became nauseous and wouldn't tolerate passage.
He was continued on octreotide drip, got 1 U PRBC (received 2 at OSH), 2 U FFP, 1 L NS, and transferred to the MICU.
He has drank at least [**2-11**] glasses of scotch daily for many years, but over the last couple of weeks he drank more, up to 5 drinks per day.
EGD [**2185-11-17**]: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (ligation) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: serial hematocrits [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor Keep intubated Contact liver team immediatly for recurrent bleeding for consideration of repeat EGD vs [**Last Name (un) 10045**] tube placement, vs tips  Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure.
HIDA scan is recommended for further evaluation of gallbladder function.
Moderate amount of intraabdominal ascites is too small for a non-guided paracentesis.
2 mg IV Morphine sulfate was administered to the patient after 60 minutes.
[**2185-11-28**]: Technically successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis and percutaneous cholecystostomy.
[**2185-11-30**]: T-Tube cholangiogram: Placement of tube with location of tube within the gallbladder.
gm stain negative Blood cx: NGTD  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, 2 prior episodes of hematemesis, presenting with hematemesis and hematocrit drop in the setting of recent nose trauma and epistaxis, as well as evidence of hepatic failure on labs.
1) Upper GI bleed:  On arrival to the MICU, the patient had an OG tube placed, with bright red blood return that did not clear with 500 cc lavage.
In total, he received 19 units of PRBCs during this stay in the MICU.
He was started on an octreotide gtt and IV pantoprazole.
The patient was kept intubated until his hematocrit had been demonstrated to be stable, however it took an extra couple of days for the sedation to wear off, attributed to poor clearance by the liver.
Patient required FFP and cryoprocipitate for improvement in hemostatis.
Hepatology followed patient while inpatient and recommended a number of medications including vitamin K, nadolol (not given when patient NPO) and stictly no NG tubes (for risk of damaging variceal banding).
We will treat with PPI [**Hospital1 **], Nadolol, spironolactone, and lactulose upon discharge.
In terms of the spironolactone, he has some peripheral edema which is improved with spironolactone but occasionally his systolic bp was below 90 so this medication was held.
He was deemed not a good surgical candidate due to his liver disease so he was taken urgently to undergo a biliary cholecystostomy on [**11-28**].
He tolerated this procedure well and had rapid relief of his abdominal pain.
He also was started on pip/tazo for four days then transitioned to levo/flagyl.
He was followed by the transplant surgery team who recommended continued abx and followup in their clinic as scheduled.
His drain will need to stay in place for at least 6 wks and he will also require antibiotics for the duration of the drain.
This is also related to the necessity of Spironolactone for treatment of his liver failure.
