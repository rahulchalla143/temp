She was given ASA, SL NTG, nitropaste, lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine and plavix 300mg PO x1 (though not confirmed).
With considerable difficulty, a Magic Torque wire was ultimately passed through the center of the udeployed part of the stent and then progressively dilated with a 3.0x40 mm Sailor balloon, a 6.0x20 mm Agiltrac balloon and a 7.0x20 mm Diamond balloon.
Bivalirudin was given for anticoagulation.
The lesion was crossed with a PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] wire and dilated with a 2.0x20 mm Voyager balloon at 8 atm, restoring flow to the vessel.
The procedure was complicated by right iliac artery dissection which was successfully treated with stenting.
A left iliac artery stent was also placed for iliac artery stenosis.
She did well, and was called out to a monitored bed on HD #2.
Her medication regimen was optimized.
She was continued on ASA and Plavix (started on presentation to OSH).
Lopressor and captopril were added, with good control of her blood pressure.
These were changed to once daily formulations (Toprol XL and lisinopril) prior to discharge.
She was also started on a high dose statin, and lifestyle modification--including tobacco cessation--encourged.
On HD3, she was taken back to the cath lab for intervention on her RCA lesion.
Integrillin was started, and the lesion was balloon dilated with resolution of flow, and distal migration of residual thrombus to a very small lower pole OM1.
The patient was continued on integrillin for 18 hours post-procedure with a peak CK of 1137 which resolved to 287 at time of discharge.
