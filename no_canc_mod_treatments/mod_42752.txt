Admission Date:  [**2176-10-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2176-11-20**]   Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for multiple small-bowel and abdominal surgeries which resulted in adhesions and obstructions requiring lysis of adhesions and reduction of volvulus who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] with a complaint of hypertension, nausea, vomiting, as well as shortness of breath.
In addition to this, he had an episode of coffee-grounds emesis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications at the time of admission included Plavix, digoxin, Florinef, Levoxyl, Acufex, and Timoptic eyedrops.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this was a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman who has had prior multiple abdominal surgeries who was admitted for hypertension, and a complaint of nausea, and vomiting, as well as coffee-grounds emesis.
The patient was started on intravenous Protonix, kept on just clear liquids, and plans were made for an upper endoscopy.
He was admitted for aggressive fluid resuscitation, and as needed blood transfusion, and blood pressure control.
The upper gastrointestinal study revealed an incarcerated hiatal hernia, and a General Surgery consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 100353**] was obtained.
The surgery team recommended keeping the patient nothing by mouth, and intravenous fluid hydration, with strict ins-and-outs, and follow up of his electrolytes and hematocrits.
At this time, the patient was also seen by the cardiologist in preparation for a possible surgical repair and was started on levofloxacin.
The levofloxacin was started to treat a urinary tract infection.
The patient had tests which were positive for Helicobacter pylori, and he was started on an additional antibiotic regiment to treat this.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2176-10-25**]; where a laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair was performed.
On postoperative day one, the patient was doing well and had his nasogastric tube discontinued.
By postoperative day two, his Foley catheter had been discontinued, and plans were made to continue to advance his diet as tolerated, and the patient was deemed stable for discharge with diet including all foods except bread.
However, the patient required a Physical Therapy consultation and had some difficulty voiding.
At this point, the patient was stable from a surgical perspective, and his issues were primarily cardiac, and plans were made to transfer him back to the Medicine Service.
The patient converted from his atrial fibrillation and was maintained on sotalol with resolution of his hypotension, and he was essentially asymptomatic.
The patient had to have his Foley catheter replaced for an inability to void.
His Protonix was increased to b.i.d.
With the patient unable to take oral intake, and with his nutritional status needing to be addressed, a central line was placed without difficulty, and total parenteral nutrition was started.
The patient continued to be followed for his postoperative pseudo-obstruction.
On the day and evening of [**11-2**], the patient developed low urine output which was not responding to fluid boluses, and despite the fluid boluses and blood transfusion, the patient continued to have low urine output and went into respiratory distress; for which he required intubation which was performed by the Anesthesia staff.
The remainder of his hospital course was characterized by a pseudo-obstruction which failed to resolve despite rectal tubes and colonic decompression by the gastroenterologist by endoscopy.
The patient remained on total parenteral nutrition at this time and was actually able to be weaned to minimal ventilator support and extubated.
The patient remained comfortable on a ventilator with sedation, and neurologically was appropriate.
He did have a point during this course where he required dobutamine for his blood pressure which was able to be weaned off.
The patient having required a large volume resuscitation, subsequently upon improvement of his status, required diuresis which was able to be accomplished without difficulty.
The patient did not have resolution of his ileus, and with his pulmonary status worsening, and increasing ventilator support to maintain his oxygenation, his wife and daughter expressed their concerns that the patient did not want to be on ventilator support for a prolonged period of time, and without resolution of his pseudo-obstruction and with his prognosis (which included a prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay), the decision was reached with the family and attending physicians that the patient should be made comfort measures only.
The patient was made comfort measures only and was made comfortable, and he expired on [**11-20**] at 5:29 a.m. from respiratory compromise secondary to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
