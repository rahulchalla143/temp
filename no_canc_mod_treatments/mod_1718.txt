Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2118-11-16**] Laparoscopic loop ileostomy [**2118-12-6**] Hemorrhoid banding [**2118-12-26**] Exploratory laparotomy, takedown of loop ileostomy, small bowel resection, creation of end ileostomy and mucous fistula.
The ileostomy was created approximately 1 month ago, and since then the patient has been doing well up until yesterday when the ileostomy output suddenly stopped and the patient developed significant abdominal pain.
The patient was initially managed with a nasogastric tube and a Foley was also placed in the afferent loop of the ileostomy yielding large amount of small bowel content, whereafter the abdomen became less a tender and distended.

She was felt to have failed the trial of PO steroids, and was restarted on IV high dose steroids.
Diuresis given with small dose Lasix with good effect and not resulting in hypotension.
On [**2118-11-16**] she underwent a diverting loop ileostomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Post-op, the patient was transferred back to the ICU for management of post-op hypotension.
Pressors were used for a short duration of pressors and IV fluids.
On the floor, she was continued on TPN and allowed to trial clear diet which she tolerated fairly well.
Lasix was restarted at the same dose as was used pre-op to attempt to reduce the edema that was still present in her legs, arms, and breast--more so on the left side.
Ectopy noticed on telemetry, but Metoprolol not titrated up given lower SBP in 90's and HR in 40's.
Given that her SBP was in the 90's, she was transferred back to the ICU for further management.
Metoprolol was up titrated to try to achieve better rate control, but later discontinued and switched to Digoxin.
Given the clearance of blood cultures, lack of fevers or significant leukocytosis the patient was treated conservatively as removal of her lead would be difficult given that it is an ICD lead and that it is several years old and may would require a thoracotomy (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was treated with vancomycin, rifampin and gentamycin.
However on [**2118-12-6**] she developed ATN from the gentamycin, and antibiotics were held pending her renal function improving.
She is being sent home on Vancomycin and Rifampin and will need to follow-up with the [**Hospital **] clinic (scheduled) and receive safety labs through the duration of her course, which will be completed on [**2119-1-9**].
Small Bowel Obstruction [**1-11**] acute on chronic Crohn's flare: Medically treated at first but given recurrence a diverting loop ileostomy was performed.
Her SBO was definitively treated with this surgical procedure.
Lower GI bleed/Crohns disease/Hemorrhoidal Bleeding: This occurred on [**11-27**] while on prednisone 40mg daily.
The bleeding continued despite treatment with mesalamine.
On [**12-14**] to [**12-15**] pt reported small amounts of BRBPR, but received 1 unit PRBCs and this resolved.
Given ongoing irritation of her hemorrhoids her Cortef enemas were discontinued.
She is being discharged on a Prednisolone taper with close follow-up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 79**].
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: As her blood pressures improved her beta blocker was up titrated up and she was started on digoxin with a load of 0.5mg daily x 2 days then on digoxin 125mcg daily.
on [**2118-11-29**] per cardiology digoxin was no longer needed.
Anasarca and asymmetric breast edema: Related to steroid use in the setting of systolic congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
Steroids were weaned post operatively and she was diuresed initially with Bumex 0.5mg po daily.
L breast swelling was evaluated with Mammogram and ultrasound and found to be subcutaneous edema without other underlying pathology.
She was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD from breast surgery and he diagnosed her with truncal lymphedema related to total body fluid overload and stated the recovery is a slow process but it should recovery with tapering of steroids and diuresis.
She was initially managed with Ativan, and Celexa was then added.
Subsequent to this, her Ativan was changed to clonazepam with excellent results.
Renal function slowly improved with discontinuation of Gentamycin and Mesalamine, and then plateaued at 1.7 prior to discharge, thought to be secondary to mild dehydration for which she was encouraged to increase her PO intake.
She was also started on Imodium and banana flakes to decrease fluid losses through her ostomy.
If her renal function does not improve following discharge she should be referred to Nephrology for further evaluation.
An NGT and foley catheter was placed to decompress stomach.
However she continued to have abdominal pain with peritoneal signs and leukocytosis 20 K. On [**2118-12-26**] patient was taken emergently to the operating room and was found to have a perforation of small bowel at the site of the ileostomy with purulent peritonitis.
She underwent a takedown of her loop ileostomy, small bowel resection and creation of end ileostomy and mucous fistula.
Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole were started on [**12-26**].
Postoperatively was on intubated and on sedatives and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was bolused for decrease urine output was given intravenous fluids and Albumin.
On [**2118-12-27**] was extubated, off sedation and was started 100 mg hydrocortisone IV.
Cardiology were consulted and metoprolol dose was increased and recommended no digoxin.
On [**12-30**] her antibiotic were transitioned to Daptomycin and Piperacillin/tazobactam + rifampin.
She has been receiving intermittent intravenous fluid boluses for high ostomy output.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12811**] complains of intermittent abdominal pain which increases with movement, she has been encouraged to take her oral analgesia as needed.
She is ambulating with a walker and assist.
POD 7 [**2118-12-30**], Prelone 21 mg PO taper was started and he will continue her Prelone taper per her gastroenterologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] refer to GI note.
POD 9 she had approx 50 cc of blood from rectum, a stat hematocrit was drawn,35.2 and had no further episodes and is stable for transfer to rehabilitation center.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12811**] will continue on her antibiotics, Zosyn, Daptomycin and Rifampin until [**2119-1-9**] refer to infectious disease note for monitoring of her renal function.
