A CTA was done showing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli (left mainstem with sub total occ; right mainstem sub total occ).
He remained HD stable but persistently tachy with O2 sats of 90% on RA.
A heparin drip was started given stable hemodynamics, thrombolytic treatment was not inititaed.

He was admitted to the ICU for treatment and monitoring.
The aortic root was mildly dilated and systollic pulmonary artery pressure was elevated.
Because Mr.R was hemodynamically stable, had negative troponins (ie no evidence of RV infarction), and stable O2 sats, the decision was made to anticoagulate with heparin drip, rather than proceeding with tPA.
He recieved 5-7.5 mg coumadin and heparin gtt and then a lovenox shot on d/c.
