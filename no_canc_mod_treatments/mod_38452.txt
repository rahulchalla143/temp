Catheterization done at [**Hospital1 **] MC showed three-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possible CABG (coronary artery bypass graft).
As stated, the catheterization showed three-vessel disease, including 95 percent left main, 95 percent RCA (right coronary artery), 80 percent circumflex and 99 percent distal LAD (left anterior descending) with an EF (ejection fraction) of 40 percent.
Her meds at home include nifedipine XL 90 q.day, Lipitor 40 q.day, Paxil 20 q.day, atenolol 25 q.day, Celebrex 200 q.day, meclizine 12.5 q.day, Imdur 120 in the a.m., 60 in the p.m., and Buspirone 10 b.i.d.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive claudication, edema, palpitations, angina and CHF.
Right groin cath site with dry sterile dressing.
The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.
She had a CABG x4 with the LIMA (left internal mammary artery) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the LAD (left anterior descending), saphenous vein graft to OM (obtuse marginal) and saphenous vein graft to the PDA (posterior descending artery).
Her bypass time was 71 minutes with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well was transferred from the operating to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
She had Neo- Synephrine 0.5 mics/ kilogram/minute and propofol at 25 mics/kilogram/minute.
Her anesthesia was reversed.
She was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on postoperative day 1.
At that point, she was begun on an amiodarone drip and received IV beta blockade, following which the patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm.
Blood, as well as urine cultures, were sent and the patient was started on oral levofloxacin.
The following day, all cultures returned negative and patient's antibiotics were discontinued.
She remained in the ICU for vigorous pulmonary toilet, given her relative hypoxia.
By postoperative day 5, the patient's chest x-ray had shown improving lung fields and diaphragmatic excursion, and, at that time, she was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Incision with staples and dry sterile dressing, no erythema or drainage.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Include amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d., x7 days, then 400 mg q.day x7 days, then 200 mg q.day, aspirin 81 mg q.day, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
x10 days then 40 mg q.day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., potassium chloride 40 mEq b.i.d., x10 days and then q.day, Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Paxil 20 mg q.day, Buspirone 10 mg b.i.d.
She is to be discharged to rehabilitation at the [**Hospital3 1761**] Center.
CAD (coronary artery disease) status post coronary artery    bypass grafting times 4, with LIMA (left internal mammary    artery) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the LAD    (left anterior descending), saphenous vein graft to OM    (obtuse marginal) and saphenous vein graft to PDA    (posterior descending artery).
