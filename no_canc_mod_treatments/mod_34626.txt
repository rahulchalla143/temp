This time, he was quite agitated afterwards and was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] and started on dilantin.
The day after discharge, his neurologist discontinued dilantin and started him on a lamictal taper.
Near 10ish, he walked upstairs and sat down on the couch.
He continued to be so on arrival to [**Hospital1 6591**] and he was given ativan 2mg IM x 3 to no effect, then restrained and given a total of haldol 35mg IV, and then he was paralyzed with succinylcholine and rocuronium, and intubated.
He was reportedly loaded with dilantin 2g IV.
This likely reflects medication effect from benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration.
He was intubated and heavily sedated with 35mg Haloperidol IM&IV prior to transfer to this hospital.
Routine EEG with mini-sphenoidal electrodes was performed showing generalized slowing with fast Beta, but no asymmetry or epileptiform discharges.
He was continued on dilantin and started on Lamictal.
He should remain on dilantin until therapeutic levels are reached on lamictal.
2) Elevated CK's- Likely secondary to seizure and large (35mg) dose of haloperidol given at outside hospital.
Pt was continued on Thyroid replacement.
He will follow up with his PCP for further titration and repeat TFT's in a few months.
