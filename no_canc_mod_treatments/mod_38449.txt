[**Name (NI) **] was intubated at the scene and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] via Med-Flight as a trauma alert.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was subsequently admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in a hard cervical collar and was placed on ventilatory support.
He was quickly put on FIO2 of 100% on the ventilator on maximal ventilatory support.
The patient was also started on a Pertussin drip which allowed his Levophed drip to decrease somewhat.
A renal consultation at that time was called and deemed that the patient was in likely congestive heart failure and required aggressive diuresis.
Despite large doses of Lasix, the patient was unresponsive as far as urine output goes, and Nephrology decided then to put the patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration so he could get some of his fluid off.
Despite putting the patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, the patient's respiratory status did not improved.
Moreover, his hemodynamic compromise also did not improve requiring maximal doses of Levophed as well as Pertussin.
