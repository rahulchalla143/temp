[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    66 year old woman s/p mvr/tvr and ct removal REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    r/o ptx    Final Report HISTORY: Chest tube removal, to evaluate for pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest tube has been removed.
Heart failure service was consulted for management and she was placed on a Lasix drip which was titrated for diuresis, then zarolyxn added with good results.
The Lasix drip was decreased and she was aggressively diuresed preoperatively.
Surgery was consulted for a thyroid nodule and recommended follow up as outpatient for biopsy which  will be arranged after 4 weeks.
These were treated with an H1 blocker and Bactroban with improvement and resolution of itching.
On [**12-8**] she went to the operating room where mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty were performed as noted.
She weaned from bypass on epinephrine, phenylephrine and propofol.
The epinephrine was weaned off over 24 hours and she was extubated on [**12-11**], however, required reintubation on the next day due to respiratory distress.
CTs and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocols.
Amiodarone was utilized for atrial fibrillation with maintenance of sinus rhythm and beta blockade was reintroduced.
She continued to progress and  on POD#11 she was ready for discharge to rehab for further endurance and increase in activity.
