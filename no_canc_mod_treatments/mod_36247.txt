[**2125-2-19**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2122-9-7**], there is increasing size of the cardiac silhouette given the PA rather than AP view.

[**2125-3-3**] LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler images of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and peroneal veins were performed.

The patient was started on heparin gtt.
Coumadin was started [**3-9**] after hematocrit had remained stable (goal INR 2-2.5).
#Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure - Attributed to a combination of discontinuation of diuretic medication, alterations in the antihypertensive regimen, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient was transfused a total 5 U PRBC.
