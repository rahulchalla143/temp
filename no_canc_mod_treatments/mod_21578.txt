He was placed on antibiotic therapy for his pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation on outpatient Digoxin and Coumadin.
History of diverticulosis, status post exploratory laparotomy.
MEDICATIONS:  His medications on arrival to the hospital were Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
twice daily, Azithromycin 500 mg p.o.
8 hours, Mirapex unknown dose, Sinemet 25/100 two tablets every bedtime for his restless leg syndrome, question of Diltiazem 120 mg p.o.
He was also placed on a heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation.
At some point when he was stable, he continued on the heparin drip.
He was usually in sinus rhythm but had three prior episodes of atrial fibrillation over 20 years with DC cardioversion times two.
The patient also on evaluation was being worked up for the possibility of encarditis for which the transesophageal echocardiography was ordered to do DC cardioversion for his atrial fibrillation and rule out the endocarditis at the same time.
On [**9-29**], he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for transesophageal echocardiography and DC cardioversion with plan to start him on some low dose Nipride and increase his Captopril as tolerated.
The patient had DC cardioversion in the Coronary Care Unit on [**9-30**].
He continued diuresis with intravenous Lasix.
His transesophageal echocardiography also showed a foiled mitral valve leaflet with 3 to 4 plus mitral regurgitation.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for consideration of mitral valve replacement versus repair, and the patient was consulted on [**9-30**].
Medications at that time preoperatively were as follows:  Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Oxacillin 1 gm intravenously q.
4 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
once daily, Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
Additional medication is Pramipexole dihydrochloride 0.5 mg p.o.
The patient was also finishing an Azithromycin course as well as Levofloxacin.
The goal in the days prior to his surgery was to review his pulmonary status and try to improve his cardiac index as well as his diuresis status prior to surgery.
His INR was elevated and his surgery which was planned for [**10-2**] was cancelled while we waited for his INR to come back down to normal range.
Consult was also obtained to evaluate his elevated INR which at that point his last dose of Coumadin had been six days prior with an INR of 2.3.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on [**10-4**].
As the patient's repeat INR was 1.3, it was discussed with the patient and family to hold off for surgery for another couple of days until Monday morning to allow the INR to continue to drop.
The patient was given additional Vitamin K with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] following his progress.
A central venous line was placed on [**10-5**].
On [**10-7**], the patient underwent mitral valve repair with a 30 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty plan and a Maze procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].
On postoperative day Number 1, the patient was receiving Metoprolol, continuing his perioperative Vancomycin.
On postoperative day Number 3, the blood pressure was 111/64, heart rate was 80, receiving 20 of Metoprolol p.o.
In the unit he was given aggressive physical therapy and respiratory therapy.
He was placed on an Amiodarone dose and continued with his Lasix diuresis.
He also continued to be seen by the Hematology/Oncology fellow daily postoperatively and also worked for physical therapy to improve his ambulation, and was transferred out to the floor on postoperative day Number 3.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was hoping to be discharged and this was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and the plan was that he would be able to go to his local hotel over the weekend and have his coagulation profile drawn at the Emergency Department, have results called to our team who would relate to him his Coumadin dose.
A 3 mg Coumadin dose was given on [**10-11**], the day of discharge.
Wound management was discussed, please refer to the discharge instructions.
The resident on Cardiac Surgery would then call the patient with his Coumadin dose.
