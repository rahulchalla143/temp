Atrial fibrillation -- on coumadin with an INR goal of 2.5-3.
There is active extravasation of the medial branches of the right internal mammary artery into a large presumed extrapleural anterior right hemithorax hematoma.
Further evaluation after emergent conditon is addressed should be pursued with referral to pancreas center and likely abdominal MRI (without contraindication).
However, MRI of the cervical spine should be considered to exclude a small epidural hematoma.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team on the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management of his hemothorax and for evaluation by the Stroke team in light of his new symptoms and CT findings.
His hemodynamics were stable despite a hematocrit of 20 and he was transfused with a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells.
A right chest tube was placed for evacuation of blood.
His Coumadin had been reversed after the accident at [**Hospital1 **] and his strokes probably occurred in the setting of a normal INR therefore full anticoagulation was recommended due to his high risk for another stroke given his history.
He was placed on IV Heparin and Coumadin was resumed.
He had his chest tube in for about 5 days as the drainage diminished.
His daughter was at his bedside to help with translation and to support her father.
His chest tube was removed without difficulty and his oxygen was weaned off.
He did well with Physical Therapy as far as gait training, balance and functional mobility are concerned.
He was given a rolling walker to maximize safety and function at home.
He did display some cognitive impairment and required more therapy from nursing and occupational therapy and these issues should improve with time.
