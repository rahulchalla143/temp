The patient has a central cervical spine fusion in situ.
The patient is now intubated and the ET tube is identified in good position with its tip 4 cm above the carina..
Patient now intubated   Brief Hospital Course: Breifly: This is a 54 yo man with DM and ESRD due to anti-GBM disease who was admitted on [**9-19**] with ecoli sepsis and pneumonia.
He was intubated for respiratory failure, was unable to be weaned off, and a tracheostomy was placed.
The patient was started on double coverage for gram nbegative rods with zosyn, levoquin, and vancomycin to cover gram positive cocci.
On [**9-24**], the vanco and zosyn was stopped, as only etiology on culture was GNR, and the patient was continued on flagyl and levoquin for 21 day course.
Then vanco and zosyn were restarted and the other were stopped.
Vancomycin was stopped prior to his leaving the unit.
He was resuscitated with 6 L of IV fluids then levophed was used to keep his MAP above 65.
A full course of stress dose steriods was completed on [**9-25**].
He remained normotensive or hypertensive off of pressors from [**9-22**] on.
3)Respiratory failure: Elective intubation in the setting of mental status change and decreasing O2 sats.
Thoracentesis was attempted, but not the effusion was not tappable as it was all consolidated LLL.
His mental status and ventilation improved and he was weaned until [**9-24**] when developed increasing copious secretions, good cough but decreased MS again.
5) R IJ clot [**9-24**] discovered after unsuccessful line placement, pt started on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.
Hos coumadin will need further titration in rehab.
6)ESRD [**2-5**] antiglomerular basement membrane disease: On HD since [**3-8**] Q T/th/Sat.
He required several units of prbc transfusions early in MICU course but remained stable since.
He recieved periodic transfusions during dialysis to keep his HCT above 30.
He also recieved Epogen at dialysis.
7)Inc LFTs: Given his lab data on admission, ascending cholangitis was a concern and surgery was consulted to evaluate the need for emergent intervention.
[**9-25**] bilirubin decreasing with improving clinical picture, likely jaundice of sepsis.
8) Diabetes: He was maintained on insulin gtt for first two weeks of MICU course, then transitioned successfully to glargine and sliding scale regular insulin with Insulin added to his total parenteral nutrition.
The glargline was stopped after a few days because his AM BS were very low.
How he is on [**Hospital1 **] NPH that will need to be titrated up as his tube feeds are increased.
These episodes were controlled with dialysis and intermittent titration of captopril and lopressor.
He is not on amlodipine, captopril, lopressor, and hydralizine with blood pressures still in the 150 - 160.
10) Nutrition: He had a percutaneous enteral gastric tube placed on [**10-3**] with no complications.
He has been recieving tube feeds at 40/hour.
He is no methadone and oxycodone for breakthrough.
Continue frequent reorientation and have family being in familiar items.
