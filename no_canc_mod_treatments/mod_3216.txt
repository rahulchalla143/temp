Given his bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral chest tubes were placed at the time of admission on [**5-2**].
His urine culture grew enterococcus, and he was started on vancomcin.
His creatinine continued to rise despite IVF resuscitation, and he was administered tube feeds which were advanced toward goal.
Given his rising creatinine despite apparently adequate fluid resuscitation, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18821**] was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.
He had elevated serum glucose levels, and his insulin sliding scale was tightened.
The electrophysiology service was consulted, and recommended switching him to metoprolol from sotalol given his renal dysfunction.
He was stabilized on metoprolol prior to the time of discharge.
On [**2127-5-8**], the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement which was uneventful.
His chest tubes were placed to water seal and removed sequentially thereafter without clinically significant pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
He was restarted on coumadin and he was administered free water via his PEG to help correct his hyponatremia.

- Trazodone prn qHS  CV: h/o CAD, CHF, afib, hypercholesterolemia, cardiac contusion with low cardiac output.
- Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], off home sotalol and atenolol per electrophysiology service - Echo with overall left ventricular systolic function moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Repeat echo [**5-6**] unchanged - Pt has DDDR pacemaker, underlying rhythm is CHB, PM set for AV sequential pacing unless atrial rate > 150.
- his hematocrit at the time of discharge is 24, but we have intentionally held off on transfusion given his hemodynamic stability; would transfuse for hematocrit less than 21 (given TRICC and CRIT data)  PULM: Sternal fx, R [**4-10**] and L [**2-8**] rib fx-bilateral flail, - Ciprofloxacin until [**5-17**] - Perc Trachestomy in situ  GI: Tube feeds/PO diet - TF via PEG - Nectar thick liquids and soft solids started [**5-14**]  RENAL: Acute on CRF, now improved to 1.2.
