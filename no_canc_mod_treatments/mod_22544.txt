Admission Date:  [**2174-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-9-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 82 y/o M with h/o HTN, PVD, COPD, recently discovered SDH in [**4-19**], ESRD on HD, as well as CAD s/p kissing stents to LAD/LCx in [**5-19**], followed by ISR of LAD in [**11-19**] and recent repeat cath in [**6-21**] for refractory chest pain with taxus stents to 80% LAD (distal to prior stent and 70% proximal LCx), med-flighted from [**Hospital6 8283**] with recurrent chest pain.
Sent to the ED where he received IVF and was sent home.
His hypotension was presumed secondary to intravascular volume depletion and plans were made for careful IVF (given history of intubation secondary to CHF), while holding BP meds for low blood pressure.
He was started on a heparin gtt on the night of [**8-26**].
He was continued on [**Month/Year (2) **], Plavix, and received metoprolol 25 mg as tolerated by blood pressure while at OSH.
It was decided, given recurrent CP, to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath rather than waiting until Monday, and he was transferred on heparin drip and 3 L NC oxygen.
Of note, patient's INR today 2.2 and had been given coumadin for AF at [**Hospital3 4298**].
5) COPD 6) Depression 7) ESRD on HD 8) HTN 9) diastolic chf with 2 intubations for respiratory failure in setting of fluid overload 10) CAD: Since last cath, had outpatient persantine thallium stress test performed in [**Hospital1 1562**]--septal ischemia with good ejection fraction .

GENERAL COMMENTS: The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
4 The LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 15mm NC Ranger balloon and stented with a 3.0 X 16mm Taxus stent with lesion reduction from 80% to 0%.
The LCX lesion was directly stented with a 3.5 X 12mm Taxus stent with lesion reduction from 70 percent to 0 percent.
Successful stenting of the LAD (Drug eluting) 5.
82 yo M with HTN, hypercholesterolemia, PVD, CAD s/p stents to LAD/LCx as recently as [**6-21**], with recent SDH in [**4-20**] (small), presents with chest pain at rest with intentions for catherterization.
Will continue heparin drip and give Vitamin K for INR reversal with plans for possible cath monday.
Will consder ablation only if unable to decrease HR with meds - continue heparin gtt with frequent neuro evals given subdural hemorrhage.
Hold integrillin -[**Month/Day (1) **], Plavix -metoprolol 25 mg PO BID as tolerated, restart ACE-I next if BP tolerates -echo tomorrow, possibly cath monday at dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5452**] discretion -gave one dose of vit K. - obtain CTA to r/o PE, dissection as source of chest pain - will need op GI appointment for EGD (r/o PUD).
On BB, heparin for anticoagulation, holding coumadin.
- will hold coumadin due to h/o GI Bleed .
Shortness of breath: responded well to atrovent nebs.
-continue COPD meds -Component of volume overload.
Gave Imdur 30 mg (outpatient dose) .

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2174-8-29**] 4:58 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  Reason: rule out PE or dissection Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with PVD, CAD, COPD, p/w CP, s/p clean cath REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: rule out PE or dissection CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 82-year-old man with PVD, CAD, COPD presenting with chest pain status post spleen catheterization.
IV contrast-enhanced images of the chest were then performed.
There is prominent atherosclerotic calcification involving both distal vertebral arteries as well as the basilar artery, and to a marked extent involving the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries.
Impression: Hypertrophy in the whole stomach compatible with hypertrophic gastritis (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results The symptoms may be explained by the findings.
Additional notes: The procedure was done by the attending physician and GI fellow.
The differential diagnosis for his chest pain included cardiac ischemia due to coronary blockage vs. increased demand due to atrial fibrillation vs. volume related hypoperfusion in the setting of fixed stenoses and dialysis vs non cardiac cause.
He was continued on a heparin drip and underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated no flow limiting CAD.
He was continued on his outpatient dose of aspirin, plavix and metoprolol, while his ACE inhibitor was held.
Anticoagulation: The patient was restarted on coumadin after a CT of his brain was performed to rule out expansion of previously noted subdural hematoma.
It is likely that when the patient experienced chest pain previously, he self medicated with nitroglycerin leading to some hypotension.
His dyspnea responded well to atrovent nebulizers.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient underwent renal dialysis according to his normal outpatient schedule while in the hospital, with removal of fluid to assist in relieving his pulmonary congestion.
