He was given 1 liter of intravenous fluids.
After intubation, he became hypotensive and was started on dopamine.
The patient on x-ray and exam was found to be in congestive heart failure, and received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with some diuresis and improvement in his hypoxia on the ventilator in the Emergency Department.
Question mitral valve prolapse  ADMISSION MEDICATION:  The patient had previously been on atenolol which he discontinued due to inability to refill.
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN  SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient drinks two martinis a day, denies any intravenous drug use, denies any blood transfusions.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 95/69, heart rate 96, saturating 99% while on a ventilator set at AC, tidal volume 700, rate of 12 and PEEP of 10.
At this time, aspirin was discontinued.
He was diuresed aggressively with Lasix and ultimately put on a dose of 40 po qd of standing Lasix.
Of note, on his catheter he had anterior basal, lateral, apical, inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis.
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter placed for his management of his congestive heart failure and required dopamine during part of his hospital stay.
He was initially found when the Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on the 19th to have a wedge of 30, cardiac output of 4.6 and an index of 1.99.
He ultimately had milrinone added to the dopamine, and then dopamine was changed to Levophed.
He was on milrinone until the 23rd when it was weaned off without difficulty.
He was put on a po regimen for his congestive heart failure that included captopril 100 tid, aldactone 25 qd, Lasix 40 qd and ultimately carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **].
At one point, he was on digoxin for his heart failure and his atrial fibrillation.
He was placed on an amiodarone drip after receiving an amiodarone bolus and had multiple boluses due to refractory atrial fibrillation.
He was maintained on amiodarone drip and then converted to po for which he was on 400 tid for about two weeks.
The patient will need cardioversion in four weeks for his atrial fibrillation.
He will be on anticoagulation, discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0.
The patient was also on digoxin for rate control; this was discontinued prior to discharge and the patient was started on carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **].
He was profoundly cyanotic in the Emergency Room, and this progressively improved well on mechanical ventilation.
The patient was able to be weaned from the ventilator without much difficulty.
He had a prolonged period of sedation after extubation likely from sedating medications he had received.
He was extubated on the 22nd and did not require further intubation.
His fluid status was managed with po Lasix, as well as prn Lasix to keep him even to slightly negative daily.
He will need and endoscopy in the future.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] is aware that the patient will be discharged on anticoagulation and is okay with a goal INR in the low range of 2.0.
RENAL:  The patient developed some acute renal failure in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
He was premedicated with Mucomyst and hydrated for his cardiac catheterization and on the day of discharge, his creatinine was 1.2.
He was sent home with a five day supply of Indocin and his renal function should be monitored.
Amiodarone 400 mg po qd x1 weeks, then 200 mg po qd 2.
Carvedilol 3.125 po bid 3.
Lasix 40 po qd 4.
Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **] until INR is therapeutic at 2.0.
Aldactone 25 po qd 6.
Zestril 40 po qd 7.
Coumadin 2.5 po qd adjusting to keep an INR of 2.0.
Indocin 50 mg po tid x5 days  FOLLOW UP: 1.
The patient has been given all of these numbers and will schedule these appointments.
