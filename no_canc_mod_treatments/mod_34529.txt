Then she developed increasing pain in these digits as well as ulceration, ischemia, necrotic tissue, drainage, and purple fingers.
She restarted her procardia in mid [**Month (only) 958**] which did not help her sx.
She came to the ED and was told her pain was due to reperfusion of digits and was given percocet.
She has also been on Sildenafil (which she only restarted [**2-25**] wks ago) and steroid treatment for this and her other autoimmune conditions as listed below.
Her rheumatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**], saw her today as well and felt she should be admitted for further treatment, specifically with iloprost or prostacyclin gtt.
However, a secondary plan to use epoprostenol was initiated given that [**Hospital1 **] does not routinely carry the above medications.
She is being transferred from the medicine floor to the CCU per protocol for epoprostenol with MICU coverage.
She has received dilaudid for pain control but otherwise has received no antibiotics or other medications.
Ortho hand saw her and felt she had no acute issues and is not in need of antibiotics currently.
+ fpr fluid retension after being given IVF in a hospital approximately 1 month ago in the setting of dehydration.
Capillary refill mildly delayed on her left second finger ~3 sec otherwise cap refill approx 2 sec throughout with overall blanching of color on several digits.

?s: The patient was admitted with worsening digit ischemia [**2-24**] to Raynaud's.
She was initiated on Flolan and titrated up to 4ng/kg/min over the course of 3 days as a bridge until surgery.
The patient underwent debridement (3rd digit of R hand and 5th digit of L hand) and botox injections of b/l hands on [**2111-6-16**] with no complications.
Pain was controlled with Gabapentin, home standing dose of Dilaudid, with IV Dilaudid for breakthrough.
She was restarted on Sildenafil and Nifedipine after Flolan was discontinued.
Sildanefil was stopped and she was placed on nitro paste topical which seemed to slow down the R index finger necrosis.
She was sent home on nifedipine 60mg PO HS, nitro paste topical, plavix 75 and aspirin 325 to minimize platelet clumping as a possible mechanism of ischemia.
The hope is that by treating her Lupus flare, we minimize the [**Last Name (un) 8061**] and also that by Tuesday [**2111-7-2**], the full effect of the botox infusion will take effect.
She was also sent home on oxycontin 80mg PO BID plus dilaudid 6mg PO Q3H for breakthrough although her narcotic breakthrough requirements were decreasing after the steroids.
She will call to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**] in rheumatology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in ortho/hand to consider sympethetectomy if these maximal medical measures fail.
Improved with gentle diuresis with IV Lasix.
Vanc was started for cellulitis of the digits, given that the pt has a cephalosporin allergy.
Patient completed a 7day course of Vancomycin that started on [**2111-6-13**] and ended on [**2111-6-19**].
A1C 8.2 Patient with insulin pump, at half home basal dose, as she had several episodes of glucose<50 which improved with juice and/or D50.
They then advised how to intensify insulin coverage during the large steroid boluses and the patient's sugars although erratic, never were above 300.
Continued on home cyclosporine, hydroxychloroquie, methylprednisolone, calcium, vitamin D (50K every other week, last given Saturday [**6-13**]).
PCP prophylaxis should be considered if the steroids are to be continued long term.
