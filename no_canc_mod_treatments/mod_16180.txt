HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and temporal arteritis, who had a sudden onset of back pain radiating to the chest wall wiping off her car at 10:45 on the morning of admission.
The patient at the outside hospital was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin x3 with resolution of the chest pain, but her back pain was still present, and the blood pressure remained elevated at 195/68 in the right and 185/60 to the left.
The patient was given a total of 60 mg of Morphine with a relief of the pain of [**3-14**].
She was also given intravenous Lopressor 50 mg total.
The patient was then transported to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room for further management.
Here, the patient was started on an Esmolol drip and she remained chest pain and back pain free.
She was started on Nipride drip at 2 mcg/kg/minute, however, the patient then became hypotensive 90/palp, and Nipride was turned off, and she was restarted on Nipride at a much lower dose with the Esmolol, and her blood pressure normalized at 135/65.
Patient was seen by CT Surgery, who saw no need for surgical intervention because the patient had a descending aortic aneurysm.
Status post cataract surgery x2.
Status post right partial lobectomy for a collapsed lung 30 years ago of uncertain etiology.
Atenolol 100 mg po q day.
Prednisone, Prilosec, and Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
Imdur 60 mg po q day.
She had an INR of 1.1, PT of 12.8 and PTT of 25.2, sodium of 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarb 22, BUN 14, creatinine 0.4, glucose of 113.
She had a CT scan at the outside hospital read by the [**Hospital1 **] senior attending, who read a descending aortic dissection DeBakey-type III, type A.
Normal wall thickness and left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
She had a Thallium stress test done in [**2110-2-3**] which showed moderate areas of decreased Thallium uptake in the inferolateral region which resolved with rest and there was a fixed defect in the posterior basilar region, and the patient refused a cardiac catheterization.
Cardiovascular:  As mentioned, this patient came in with back pain, some mild chest pain at that point, and elevated blood pressures treated with Esmolol and nitroglycerin drip which were titrated to give her a blood pressure of roughly 130-140 systolic.
She was subsequently transitioned from IV nitroglycerin and Esmolol to metoprolol, and restarted on her Isodur, and her Norvasc at 5 mg po q day.
She was sent home on metoprolol instead of atenolol.
The other blood pressure medications remained unchanged.
Rheumatologic:  The patient has a history of temporal arteritis, so she was continuing on her prednisone 5 mg po q day alternating with 2.5 mg po q day.
Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg po q day.
Metoprolol 50 mg po bid.
Amlodipine 5 mg po q day.
Prednisone 5 mg po qod and 2.5 mg po qod.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
