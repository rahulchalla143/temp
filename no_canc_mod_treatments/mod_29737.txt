Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old man with history of gastric adenocarcinoma s/p resection in [**2136**], diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension presents one day after experiencing sub-sternal chest pain.
He subsequently traveled to [**State 108**] and was in the care of family when he describes experiencing severe sub-sternal chest pain that began yesterday at 4PM with radiation to left arm and left jaw, which he decribes as "very uncomfortable," and was associated with palpitations, nausea and diaphoresis.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He received 324mg of Aspirin, 80mg of Lipitor, 20mg of Lasix IV, 4.5g of Zosyn IV and 1g Vancomycin IV.
Troponin was elevated to 5.04 with CK of 339 and CKMB of 8.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension 2.
- Gastric Adenocarcinoma s/p subtotal resection in [**4-/2137**]  Social History: -Tobacco history: Never Used Tobacco -ETOH: Denies alcohol use -Illicit drugs:  Denies illicit drug abuse  Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Patient was on the ventilator at the time of passing, and when the ventilator was stopped, there were no spontaneous respirations.
Patchy opacities in both lung bases may reflect atelectasis.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall, lateral walls and apical segments.
Collapsed gallbladder with cholecystostomy tube in place.
Patient received 324mg of ASA in the ED and 80mg of Atorvastatin.
Pt was started on heparin gtt, loaded with 300mg of clopidogrel and given 75mg daily starting in AM.
Continued on ASA and Atorvastatin but ACE-I held due to acute kidney infury.
TTE could not rule-out ventricular thrombus so heparin gtt continued but then later stopped when decision was made that pt would not undergo long-term anti-coagulation with warfarin.
Pt went to IR on same day ([**2-28**]) for percutaneous gallbladder drain.
He was started on vancomycin and pipercillin/tazobactam and ID consult was obtained.
Around same time of percutaneous drain placement pt had stopped making all urine and developed hypotension requiring pressor support.
Pt was intubated at bedside by anesthesia.
Spontaneous circulation was regained with CPR and pressors were started.
After code was finished a sterile groin line was placed.
Patient stayed intubated for rest of hospitalization.
Tried to hold sedating medications and continue to reorient him as he is at high risk for delirium - pt later required low dose olanzipine 2.5mg Qhs for delerium and agitation intermittently.
This improved with Abx and perc drain for first day but then pt underwent respiratory code and was intubated for the rest of hospitalization until he passed.
This was thought most likely [**1-27**] to septic shock as BP was lowish at the time and required pressor support.
Cr was continuing to trend up and pt was still anuric despite pressors and volume repletion on the day that he passed.
The family requested that the patient be extubated saying they did not want him on artificial life support any longer.
Pt started on IV lasix to removed extra fluid from new congestion.
Pt started on aggressive ISS wth extra regular insulin which dropped blood sugar too aggressively the first night.
Held home Actos/Glyburide and placed on diabetic diet while in hospital.
