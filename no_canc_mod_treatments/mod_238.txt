ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
MRI Head: FINDINGS:  The patient is status post remote craniotomy and resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with surrounding gliosis.
IMPRESSION:  Status post remote resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with no evidence of new mass or abnormal enhancement .
ABNORMALITY #2: Over the left hemisphere, a [**5-9**] Hz slow posterior background rhythm was noted throughout the tracing.
The left hemisphere background slowing suggests a mild encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, medication effect, or toxic metabolic abnormalities .
EEG telemetry [**4-5**]: This 24-hour EEG telemetry captured six electrographic seizures by automated detection.
He was therefore started on keppra 1000mg IV q12 in addition to Depakote 750 [**Hospital1 **].
Valproate dose was subsequently increased up to 1000 mg Q8 as it was found to be low and the patient had continued seizures (~1/day).
Floor Course: MRI Head was performed (see results above) and showed the remote resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with no evidence of new mass or abnormal enhancement or infarct.
ASA 325 and Zocor were continued and we resumed atenolol 50 mg QD.
He should continue to receive chest PT and frequent suctioning at rehab.
Nutrition was maintained with tube feeds throughout his course.
Given that he did not have any further seizures, we therefore decided to wean off his Keppra.
He should be followed by speech therapy at rehab, and if he continues to fail swallow evals PEG may need to be considered.
