During the case, he received 1 unit of pRBCs, 3L NS and calcium with a couple amps of bicarb to help his acid/base.
Patient became hypotensive during the case requiring vasopressin and levophed for pressure support.
He received a BiV pacer with improvement in his EF by TEE.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: S/p MI and CABG in [**2112**] ([**Hospital3 **]), unknown anatomy.
- PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: S/p stenting, unknown anatomy.
- PACING/ICD: History of complete heart block, dual chamber placement for high grade AV block in [**2123**]; upgrade to dual chamber [**Company 2267**] model T165 ICD [**5-/2129**] - Ischemic cardiomyopathy .
[**Name2 (NI) **] care Services:  None  Family History: not pertinant to current admission  Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS: T= 97 BP= 145/55 HR= 68 RR= 15 O2 sat= 99% GENERAL: Intubated and sedated HEENT: NCAT.
CXR [**10-29**]: The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina.
Normal placement of a right internal jugular vein catheter without evidence of complications.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with complex medical history including CAD s/p remote MI, s/p CABG and PCI, ischemic CMP, s/p dual chamber pacemaker implant/ICD for high grade AV block who presented for elective BiV/ICD complicated by acidosis and hypotension.
# Pacemaker/ICD Placement:  Patient presented for elective BiV/ICD, while in the OR patient became hypotensive requiring levophed and vasopressin in the setting of large volume blood loss.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive during OR case requiring use of levophed and vasopressin.
He was weaned from pressors quickly once sedation was weaned and he received blood.
# RTA: On admission, patient appeared to have combined non-gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis in setting of ventilatory support.
Patient had persistant hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis post-extubation with an elevated urine pH and urine anion gap suggesting a distal renal tubular acidosis.
Patient was started on bicarb (1-2 mg/kg or 7g/day) and potassium supplementation prior to discharge.
# Chronic systolic CHF: He just received replacement BiV pacemaker and his EF improved from 30-35% on admisison to LVEF 35-45% post-procedurely.
# Thrombocytopenia:  Patient's platelet count was 131K at the time of presentation and had fallen to 40K post ICD placement.
He was continued on his plavix, aspirin and statin.
Metoprolol and losartan were held initially, but restarted at home dose prior to discharge.
# HTN:  Patient's metoprolol and losartan were held initially due to hypotension, but were restarted at his home dose when he was hemodynamically stable.
# HLD: Patient was continued on home statin, Zetia and Gemfibrozil.
# DM: Patient's home dose of lantus was reduced to 40 from 66 as patient was NPO for procedure and put on sliding scale humalog.
He was restarted on his home dose of lantus and sliding scale with good glycemic control through out his hospital course.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital following a pacemaker lead replacement, which was complicated by bleeding.
You received blood transfusions and your blood counts stabilized.
Additionally, you were found to have a kidney disorder that causes your blood to become very acidic, and you were started on medications to treat this.
We made the following changes to your medications: -START sodium bicarbonate -START Potassium Chloride 40 daily -CHANGED your heart burn medication to Famotidine to lessen interaction with plavix  Please have blood drawn on Tuesday and have the results faxed to your PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
