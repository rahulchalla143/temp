Pulmonary:  Around [**3-14**] the patient was noted to have slow onset progressive desaturation on room air and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen by the end of the day on [**3-14**] and was noted to be significantly more hypoxic on ambulation with O2 sats dropping to the mid 80s.
Chest x-ray was concerning for interstitial edema consistent with congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells as her hematocrit had dropped to 25.
By the next day her oxygen saturations continued to drop despite diuresis and a pulmonary consult was obtained.
As the patient was recently weaned from steroids the thinking was that this could possibly represent PCP given [**Name Initial (PRE) **] relative immunosuppressed state and Bactrim was started as empiric therapy.
By [**3-19**] oxygen requirement had increased to 100% FIO2 on a nonrebreather with sats being maintained in the mid 90% range.
An induced sputum was sent by respiratory therapy for a PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2347**], later that day the patient's oxygenation continued to worsen, began to develop mental status changes.
An arterial blood gas was sent, which showed a PAO2 of 35 and the patient was emergently intubated with initially difficult oxygenation either with 100% FIO2 and PEEP was gradually increased to about 15 bringing the PAO2 to above 70.
The antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was started on pulse dose steroids for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
By [**3-27**] there was evidence of ongoing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with increasing bloody secretions draining from the ET tube as well as drop in hematocrit.
The patient was restarted on pulse dose steroids and was also started on plasmapheresis.
This was initiated on [**2177-3-28**] along with Solu-Medrol 250 mg q 6 hours.
Dialysis initiated during this time also was able to take off a significant amount of fluid contributing to the decrease in oxygen requirement.
On [**4-2**] the patient's oxygen requirement began to climb with an increase in PEEP as well as FIO2 with some evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage could once again be occurring given the drop in hematocrit and appearance on chest x-ray.
Given the recurrence of these findings despite treatment with pulse dose steroids as well as plasmaphoresis, it was felt that plasmaphoresis would be of limited utility and would be continued on a q.o.d.
basis and the pulse dose steroids would be reduced once again to baseline of 100 mg of Solu-Medrol q 8 hours.
On [**4-6**] they elected to withdraw support and opted to extubate the patient.
She was initially started on a Diltiazem drip, which was discontinued due to bradycardia during the initial stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Possibly with the addition of sulfa crystals from the Bactrim that was used for PCP.
The recommendation made around the time of the first biopsy was to begin ace inhibitor therapy as this was a treatment of choice for sclerodermal renal crisis and this was continued and a higher dose after the second biopsy results came back with Enalapril intravenous with goals to keep the systolic blood pressure in the range of 100 to 120.
The patient required dialysis as she continued to have volume overload that was not amenable to medical therapy as well as continuously rising BUN and creatinine concerning for uremia.
Dialysis was changed over to CVVH over the course of the last three to four days prior to patient's death as goals were to get as much fluid off as possible as there was thinking that this volume overload could be contributing to her hypoxic respiratory failure.
Hematology:  The patient had evidence of DIC starting as early as the second day of her hospitalization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with D-dimers greater then [**2173**] as well as thrombocytopenia elevated FDP and decreased fibrinogen.
Treatment was supportive with fresh frozen platelets given for elevated INR and platelets given during periprocedural bleeding.
Treatment was largely supportive with blood products being given for hematocrits that showed evidence of continued decline or hematocrits below 30.
There was one bottle also that grew out yeast, however, this was likely also a colonizer as after the line was changed there was no evidence of fungemia by follow up blood cultures or by clinical status.
Scleroderma:  As this was likely the underlying etiology of the patient's diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, rheumatology consult was obtained who recommended treatment with pulse dose steroids and agreed with the utilization of the plasmaphoresis.
Cytoxan was discussed as a possible therapy for the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, however, it was felt that given the patient's thrombocytopenia and likely period of ongoing infections being possible in her somewhat immunocompromised state it was decided that Cytoxan would likely be riskier to use then its potential benefits and therapy was continued with pulse dose steroids along with plasmapheresis.
It is likely due in part to trauma to the procedure as well as the underlying thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorder.
