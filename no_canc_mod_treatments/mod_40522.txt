Renal Transplant US: IMPRESSION: Doppler flow demonstrated within the transplanted pancreas and kidneys, with mildly elevated resistive indices as described.
The urinary bladder, distal ureters, and pelvic loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
Status post kidney transplant with no evidence of stone or hydronephrosis.
Transplant surgery thought her elevated enzymes were due to relux.
She was given IV bicarb with improvement in her acidosis.
Her PO regimen was adjusted.
Though her bicarb fluctuated during admission, once she was able to take PO we resumed her PO bicarb and stopped her IV repletion with good effect.
However, she remained orthostatic with dizziness while standing.
Her CEs became positive with Troponin in the 0.3-0.4.
She was given ASA and beta blocked and given fluids.
She was also started on a low dose of Florinef at the behest of cardiology given her orthostasis.
Cardiology recommended an adenosine MIBI as an outpatient for risk stratification.
She was diuresed which may have contributed to her worsened orthostasis and outflow obstruction (see above).
Her cough was thought viral tracheobronchitis.
Continued her outpt metoprolol and lipitor.
ACEI was held given her orthostasis and renal dysfunction.
DM: s/p pancreas transplant.
Her sugars remained stable without insulin in house.
