Type 2 DM - diagnosed 3-5 years ago, reports glucose usually 130s 6.  hypertension - diagnosed 3-5 years ago 7.  hypothyroidism - on Synthroid 8.  anemia 9.
Although the observed findings are most likely due to granulation tissue, tumor involvement cannot be fully excluded and direct correlation with findings at bronchoscopy is therefore suggested.
Bronchoscopy: High grade fibrosis beneath the inferior part of tracheostomy tube.

The pt was initially stabilized with rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement.
Two days PTA the pt went to the OR for more permanent T tube placement without event.
The pt was treated with Levaquin 500 mg po qd for 7 days.
The pt was continued on her inhaled steroids and nebulizers with good effect and dyspnea resolved.
DM2: The pt was continued on a humalog insulin slide scale only during her stay, as her PO status was questionable until her final two days in house.
