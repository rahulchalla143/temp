HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old male admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2112-3-29**] for kidney transplant.
The patient had suffered renal failure due to Indocin toxicity and had been on hemodialysis for four years prior to transplant, using a left arm AV fistula.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2104**] and redo CABG in [**2110**].
Ankle surgery for gout.
Status post gastric bypass 30 years ago.
Status post corrective surgery for sleep apnea in [**2104**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2112-3-29**] and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent cadaveric renal transplant.
The procedure was performed without complication and the patient thereafter transferred to the PACU for continued observation.
In the postoperative period, the patient also developed nausea and vomiting requiring placement of a nasogastric tube on postoperative day number four.
CT scan of his abdomen was obtained to rule out mechanical obstruction prior to treatment with the Neostigmine.
Some Lopressor was given but the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease and he was therefore started on Levophed and Neo-Synephrine.
The patient was on Propofol for comfort.
On the day following the Neostigmine therapy, which was postoperative day number five, revealed that the patient's physical examination and his labs raised concern for an intra- abdominal pathologic process.
The patient had been started on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl.
Treatment of the rapid rhythm was attempted with two boluses of Lopressor but the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease into the 80s and 90s.
Given the hemodynamic instability, the decision was made to initiate amiodarone therapy and plans made for cardioversion.
On [**4-6**], the patient remained on the amiodarone drip but continued to have recurrent atrial fibrillation.
The patient was weaned off the mechanical ventilator and extubated.
Following the intubation, the patient's blood pressure was noted to decrease and the patient was started on a Levophed drip.
On [**2112-4-11**], the patient was noted to have a decreased cardiac output and an increased systemic vascular resistance and the patient was started on vasopressins in an attempt to support his cardiac output.
The patient's propofol infusion was changed to Fentanyl.
Because of worsening acidosis and decreasing cardiac output, the patient was also started on a Milrinone drip.
Based on the Infectious Disease input, the patient was started on meropenem and continued on Vancomycin.
The patient's Levaquin and Zosyn was discontinued.
The ileostomy and bowel appeared viable.
On [**2112-4-16**], cultures from the patient's midline abdominal wound which was open and was being packed came back with vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
The patient was switched from Vancomycin to linezolid.
The patient continued on Levophed vasopressin for blood pressure support.
The patient also remained on an amiodarone drip.
On [**2112-4-19**],  the patient was started on ciprofloxacin when cultures from his abdominal wound on the [**4-15**] grew pseudomonas.
The patient remained critically ill, requiring multiple pressor support and requiring increasing oxygen through the ventilator.
Given the overall gradual deterioration in the patient's function and unclear prognosis, discussions were held with the family on the patient's plans for further care.
On the evening of [**2112-4-21**], following discussions between the health care providers on the transplant end and Intensive Care Unit teams as well as the patient's family, the decision was made to change the patient's code status to COMFORT MEASURES ONLY.
Consistent with these wishes, all medications except morphine for the patient's comfort were discontinued.
