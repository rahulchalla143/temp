At that time he presented with dyspnea, conerning for infection, was initially started on levofloxacin.
He subsequently developed polymorphic VT storm with ICD cluster shocks requiring generator change, performed [**4-15**].
He was discharged on [**4-20**] after PM was adjusted to HR 90, started on mixilotine after initially being started on lidocaine drip, as well as started on verapamil and changed from metoprolol to toprol.
Unfortunately the patient was unable to fill the rx for mexilitine as it was not avaiable to pharmacy, had planned to pick up this AM, was able to fill his other meds.

There was no aortic stenosis on left-heart pullback.
QT continues to be prolonged, initially was attributed to treatment with levaquin, although should have been out of system.
K may have been somewhat low in the setting of stress and catecholamine driven intracellular shift.
He was initially on lidocaine drip and then transitioned to several antiarrhythmic regimens.
Final discharge regimen was mexillitine 200mg q8h, verapamil 240mg SR (previously 120), and inderall LA 160mg .

This was most likely due to not having one of your antiarrhythmic drugs available.
We also changed some of your medications including verapamil, propranolol, and magnesium to help prevent arrhythmias.
For your heart function, we started a low dose of lisinopril which helps prevent progression of heart failure.
We initially increased your spironolactone to 75mg (three 25mg tablets) daily, but your potassium increased and your kidney function worsened slightly on the day of your discharge, so we are asking you to decrease the spironolactone back down to 50mg (two 25mg tablets) daily.
Please take all your medications as prescribed.
