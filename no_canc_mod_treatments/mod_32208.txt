Admission Date:  [**2186-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-10-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with two bare metal stents to Right Coronary Artery   History of Present Illness: 87 yo female with history of dementia presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2186-10-8**] with chest pain and diaphoresis, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for immediate cath as thought to have an inferior STEMI, with ST elevations and CKs ranging from 150-155.
Soon thereafter the patient stabilized and was transferred to a general medical floor on [**2186-10-11**] for ongoing management while she recovered from her recent MI and additional care of her multiple co-morbidities, including COPD, Anemia, Alzheimer's type dementia, rheumatoid arthritis.
Infectious work up revealed negative blood and urine cultures, and a CT torso significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process, and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was found as well.
She was started on levofloxacin for presumed PNA on [**10-10**].
She converted back to normal sinus, sinus bradycardia and occasional AV-block (I and II) on her own on multiple occasions but generally required additional Amiodarone and Lidocaine boluses to resolve her VT episodes.
She was initially evaluated for a defibrillator but it was decided that she would have poor quality of life with a device given the frequency of her VT and she was also a poor surgical candidate given her multiple co-morbidites.
She was continued on metoprolol 50mg twice a day and her electrolyes were closely monitored and repleted while on the cardiology service.
Due to her bradycardia with Amiodarone she was switched to Quinidine for control of her VT episodes.
Unfortunately, she did not tolerate Quinidine well and was admitted to the CCU for monitoring of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and the alarming onset QT prolongation after initiating therapy with quinidine.
Past Medical History: CHF with a "dilated ventricle" Rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone and methotrexate history of falls, including pelvic fracture after a fall in [**Month (only) 956**] Anemia COPD/bronchiectasis Pneumonia status post intubation in [**7-25**] urinary incontinence Alzheimer's type dementia   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 **], independent with ADLs, but meals are supplied and daughter helps the patient with her daily medications by setting up her pill box for dispensing her daily medications appropriately.
Systemic arterial pressure was elevated at 210/80 mm Hg prior to administration of NTG drip IV.
Successful PTCA and placement of two overlapping 2.5x18mm Mini Vision bare-metal stents in the mid-RCA were performed.

During the procedure she was hypoxic and hypotensive with a PCWP of 20-25 so she was transferred to the CCU for post-operative monitoring.
Of note, the patient also has several additional active co-morbidities which include COPD, chronic anemia, Alzheimer's type dementia, hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis.
An infectious work up revealed negative blood and urine cultures.
A CT of her torso was significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was described as well.
She was started on levofloxacin for presumed PNA on [**10-10**].
On the evening of [**2186-10-11**] she triggered for a 60 beat run of NSVT, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**]/general cardiology service for further management on [**2186-10-12**].
The patient's arrhythmia was initially managed solely with metoprolol and then an amiodarone drip was started on [**2186-10-13**] at 4AM by nightfloat after the patient had a 60 minute episode of  ventricular tachycardia and EP was consulted.
They did not want to perform VT ablation in the setting of the patient's possible pneumonia and leukocytosis and recommended stopping the Amiodarone load and continuing the metoprolol.
She continued to experience hemodynamically stable NSVT on this regimen and eventually recieved additional doses of lidocaine to help control her episodes of hemodynamically stable NSVT.
The lidocaine had limited success and it was felt that Amiodarone may have been contributing to the patient's bradycardia.
Eventually EP started quinidine 324mg Q8H on [**2186-10-16**] to try to gain better control of the patient's ventricular tachycardia as they were moving away from a plan to ablate her and wanted to avoid Amiodarone.
The patient was transferred back to the CCU on [**2186-10-17**] for monitoring of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and new onset QT prolongation soon after initiating therapy with Quinidine.
The team stopped quinidine, azithromycin, and metoprolol and gave a one-time dose of atropine and IV magnesium.
Soon after quinidine was discontinued the patient's VT eventually stabilized and her electrolytes were closely monitored.
While in the CCU the patient's CAD management was continued with daily Aspirin, Plavix, Metoprolol and statin therapy.
PO hydration was encouraged and gentle IVFs were also supplemented.
During her CCU stay she was continued on her maintenance steroids with Prednisone  daily and her methotrexate medications were held secondary to her acute illness.
During her hospital stay she was given several units of blood and she was continued on iron supplements and folate.
In terms of her Alzheimer's type dementia the patient was alert and oriented to person, place and time for the majority of her hospital stay with only minimal prompting on occasion.
Initially the patient's Aricept and Namenda were continued but were eventually held as they are shown to cause QTc prolongation and were felt to be dangerous given the patients recent bradycardia and heart block history.
The patient's leukocytosis showed only mild improvement while on the CCU service despite continued antibiotics for her PNA.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebs were continued PRN for ongoing COPD management as well as additional therapy to help patient with shortness of breath associated with her suspected pneumonia.
On [**2186-10-17**] her PNA coverage was broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP as she had persistent WBC elevations while on Levofloxacin coverage.
This was felt to be secondary to an acute CHF exacerbation and she was given morphine, nitroglycerin drip and diuresed with Lasix to help manage her CHF.
The ability to more easily and quickly treat and respond her worsening CHF with IV Lasix, IV nitroglycerin and pain medications through an IV access route was conveyed to the patient and her family and documented.
Despite this attempt to continue IV therapy the patient refused and requested that the team "limit" her medications.
The patient's medications were reduced to a small list at that point, including SL nitroglycerin PRN, oral morphine liquid solution, oral lasix as tolerated and ipratropium nebulizers PRN.
She was switched to Tylenol for control of her painful arthritis symptoms.
At time of discharge home with hospice services on [**2186-10-24**] the patient was switched to Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution 5-15 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
