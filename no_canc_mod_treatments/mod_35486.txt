Admission Date:  [**2101-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-6-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: exertional neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with angioplasty and stenting   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and diet controlled diabetes who presented intially to [**Hospital3 934**] on [**2101-5-30**] after having 1 week of exertional angina.
During the intervention the LAD lesion was stented however a linear density was seen that was ultimately thought to be due to eccentric calcification and not dissection.
2 DES were placed in the LAD and 1 DES was placed in LCX for a 70% distal lesion.
During the procedure she developed neck/throat pain and intermittently had a LBBB on her EKG.
She was started on a NTG drip and the case was completed as planned.
She was recently prescribed thyroid replacement but has not yet started the prescription.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: sinus rhythm with nl axis and intervals with periods of sinus rhythm with wide complex and leftward axis (LBBB morphology)  CARDIAC CATH performed at [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**2101-5-31**] demonstrated: 80% prox LAD 40-50% distal OM LMCA and RCA were normal.
Linear density seen at the distal edge of first LAD stent felt likely to represent eccentric calcium and not dissection.
Patient initially presented to OSH with exertional angina found to have signficant 2 vessel disease that is now s/p PCI with stent placement.
The patient is was symptom free immediately following angioplasty with intermittent LBBB on EKG.
Transfered from OSH due to concern regarding LBBB and concern that LAD had dissected during stent placement.
Patient initially had some nausea, chest pressure and headache following arrival in CCU, but EKG was unchanged from pre-cath EKG (no LBBB) and symptoms resolved with anti-emetics and rest.
Post-cath check was unremarkable, and over the next 24 hours of admission the patient's cardiac enzymes trended up, peaking at CK 529 and Troponin of 0.58.
Patient began to ambulate on [**2101-6-3**] and worked with physical therapy on [**2101-6-4**].
Patient was restarted on home aspirin and ACE-inhibitor and started on plavix and a beta-blocker.
#Anemia:  Patient was noted to be anemic and was transfused 2 units packed RBC's on night of admission and on morning laboratories found to have an elevated TSH with a suppressed free T4, suggesting hypothyroidism as the etiology of her anemia, as iron studies, folate and B12 were normal and stool guaiacs were negative.
Pt was started on levothyroxine.
