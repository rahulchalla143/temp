Admission Date:  [**2101-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-9-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18141**] Chief Complaint: fever and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheter Revision of right nephrostomy tube  History of Present Illness: This is an 86 year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections and urosepsis in the setting of bilateral obstructing nephrolithiasis, S/P right nephrostomy tube placement who presented from nursing home with fever and hypotension.
She had bilateral obstructing renal stones requiring percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the right and also found to have a uterosigmoid fistula.
She was treated with sepsis protocol, 1 week of steroids and 2 week antibiotic course.
She was started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole 4 days PTA.
After discussion with family regarding code status, she was started on the sepsis protocol, receiving 2L of NS, and started on piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as dopamine.
She subsequently went to interventional radiology, where right nephrostomy tube was changed, and no new left nephrostomy inserted due to resolution of left hydronephrosis.
She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and pressors but was eventually stabilized and transferred on piperacillin/Tazobactam   Past Medical History: 1.
B/L obstructing renal stones s/p right nephrostomy tube 6.
Depression 9. vitamin B12 deficiency 10. hyperlipidemia 11.
DVTs in superficial veins [**5-10**] and [**6-9**] (superfical femoral and distal cephalic), on warfarin 13. apical cardiac thrombus   Social History: Lives at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Right-sided nephrostomy tube with decompression of the right collecting system, with only mild upper pole hydronephrosis seen.
Nephrostomy check ([**9-23**]): Uneventful change of right percutaneous pigtail nephrostomy catheter.
Interval resolution of left hydronephrosis, obviating the need for left percutaneous nephrostomy at this time.
PICC line placement ([**9-26**]): Successful placement of a 5-French double lumen 34 cm PICC by way of the right basilic vein with the tip in the distal SVC.
Blood cultures: 10/18 1/4 bottles E coli sensitive to ceftriaxone & pip/tazo [**9-22**] negative .
CVC Catheter tip no growth .
Urine [**9-21**]: > 100,000 organisms/mL E coli sensitive to pip/tazo & ceftriaxone [**9-23**]: > 100,000 organisms/mL yeast .
Labs at discharge:  WBC 11.4, Hgb 11.1, Hct 32.4, Plt 307 PT 19.5, PTT 51.1, INR 1.9 BMP remarkable for creatinine 0.6, BUN 16, glucose 112, bicarb 30, sodium 136 lactate returned to [**Location 213**] 1.1 on [**9-21**] cortisol stim test within normal limits while in ICU   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 87 year old female with a history of Alzheimer's and prior urosepsis who presented with sepsis from a urinary source once again and who is now status post right nephrostomy tube & on antibiotics.
Her right nephrostomy tube was changed by IR on [**9-23**].
Left hydronephrosis found on initial ultrasound was resolved by the time of IR intervention, and a left nephrostomy tube was not needed.
- On arrival to the floor, her antibiotic was changed to ceftriaxone 1g IV q24 since strain is susceptible on culture data.
Ceftriaxone was started on [**9-25**], and the plan is to continue the antibiotic until [**10-4**].
- The patient had a PICC line placed without problem on [**9-26**] for IV antibiotics.
- The patient should have an outpatient renal ultrasound in a few weeks in order to reassess the functionality of the nephrostomy tube and to ensure that hydronephrosis has not reaccumulated on the left side.
A slight increase in her white blood cell count two days ago is likely related to blockage of nephrostomy tube (nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 67863**] in closed position and corrected this).
- She is on ceftriaxone to continue until [**10-4**] as above.
# H/o DVTs and apical ventricular thrombus on last ECHO: The patient was on warfarin prior to admission but this was held temporarily due to high INR on admission.
Her warfarin was restarted on the floor, and her INR is now 1.9.
- Since the patient's INR is now 1.9, we will discontinue her heparin today.
She will continue on coumadin 5 mg QHS with INR monitoring at her nursing home.
- The patient should continue on tube feeds with free water replacement, which she is tolerating well.
