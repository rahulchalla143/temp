She continued on BIPAP with improvement in her oxygenation.
A left femoral central line was placed for IV access.
Both cardiology and nephrology were consulted who recommended urgent dialysis for volume control.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,  palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: - Diastolic CHF with LVOT obstruction at rest - Chronic 2L NC at night - Hypertension - Diabetes - Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations in [**2146**] (L) and [**2157**] (R) - GERD - Hypercholesterolemia - ESRD on hemodialysis M,W,F.
Receives dialysis at [**Location (un) **] hemodialysis center in [**Location (un) **].
Her family history is significant for coronary artery disease, cancer, and diabetes.
gauze in place from LIJ line placement w/o hematoma CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Admission EKG did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
# CHF: The pt's hypoxia was attributed to CHF and not pneumonia as she denied any cough, and was afebrile and lacking a consolidate on chest xray.
Due to chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and a physiologic HOCM that leads to hypotension during dialysis sessions, it is most likely that the patient developed pulmonary edema  in the setting of volume status change while receiving dialysis.
Her oxygenation status improved significantly following blood pressure and rate control and a dialysis session.
There are no PFT's to support the diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed.
The patient was weaned on BiPap and began to breathe comfortably on room air following dialysis.
# Atrial fibrillation: The pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and rate controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem for her history of atrial fibrillation.
# Hypertension: The patient's hypertension was also controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol and following a successful dialysis session her lisinopril and irbesartan were restarted.
# Diabetes: For her diabetes the patient was continued on her home dose of NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
She had no peaked T waves or QT prolongation on EKG and received calcium carbonate and D5/insulin as well as dialysis.
Prior evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
