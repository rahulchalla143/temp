# Hypotension on presentation: Most likely secondary to sedating meds and intubation.
- Was maintained on Insulin and D5 gtt with Q 1hr finger stick.
Did not change his usual regimen as the patient had been stable on the same insulin schedule for months, and this event was likely due to the unfortunate combination of excessive activity with small dinner.
