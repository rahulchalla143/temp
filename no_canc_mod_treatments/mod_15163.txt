The patient was sent to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and started on Nitroglycerin, Morphine Sulfate, Aggrastat and given 300 mg of Plavix.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Potassium Citrate.
He had an intra-aortic balloon pump in his right femoral artery.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient spent the next two days on the CCU service receiving medical management as well as all his preoperative testing.
On [**2149-12-19**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room where a coronary artery bypass graft was performed with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
Postoperatively, the patient was a number of drips including Neo-Synephrine, Milrinone and Amiodarone for intraoperative atrial fibrillation.
He was also placed on Plavix due to poor bypass targets.
His intra-aortic balloon pump and chest tubes were removed at the appropriate time.
The pacing wires were removed at appropriate time.
He was started on beta blockade when it was felt that he would tolerate it.
He was also diuresed using Lasix and placed on Captopril for afterload control.
He was given contact with physical therapy and case management.
It was initially the plan to send the patient to a rehabilitation facility, however, the length of time that it took to get the patient therapeutic on Coumadin and off his Heparin, as well as a newly developing cellulitis at his vein donor site, lengthened the patient's stay in the hospital, allowing him to become more independent from a physical standpoint.
He was initially started on Kefzol with little improvement in the developing cellulitis.
After a couple days of treatment with Kefzol, the patient had Clindamycin added to his antibiotic regimen which did cause a decrease in erythema and improvement in his cellulitis.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He is being sent home with a number of medications including: 1.
Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Captopril 25 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
He is not being sent home at this time with a prescription for Coumadin as his INR is at the higher end of therapeutic in the past couple days of dosing.
For that reason, the patient was instructed and I have spoken with the patient's wife over the telephone this evening to reiterate the patient is to contact the cardiothoracic team on [**Name (NI) 766**] morning regarding organizing blood draws and receiving a prescription for further Coumadin treatment.
The patient will return to the hospital on Thursday as well for wound check.
