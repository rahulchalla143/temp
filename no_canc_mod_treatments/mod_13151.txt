Pressure wire interrogation of these lesions demonstrated a baseline FFR of 0.86, which decreased to 0.69 with maximal hyperemia on adenosine infusion.
Limited hemodynamics revealed normal aortic systolic and diastolic pressures.
Successful stenting of the mid LAD with two overlapping Cypehr DESs (2.5x28mm distally and 2.5x13mm proximally) (See PTCA comments).
GI bleed resolved after d/c of Integrilin & coumadin.
On floor, pt had arthocentesis of knee that showed yellow fluid with crystals found to be gout.
He received 5 mg IV Lopressor x 2, Diltiazem 10 mg IV x 2, nitropaste, and total 360 mg IV lasix.
He required mask ventilation to correct hypoxemia.
Pt then started on amiodarone drip w/ good rate control, transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
## GI Bleed - After cath patient had two large bowel movements with blood that resolved after integrillin and coumadin stopped.
Patient was started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] dose for ulcers.
Since patient remained in chronic atrial fib he was restarted on heparin and coumadin for anticoagulation.
While on heparin and coumadin his Hct remained stable and did not have any further GI bleeding.
## PNA - During hypoxic event at night patient spiked fever on [**1-25**].
Empirically started treating for pneumonia with levofloxacin - started [**1-26**] for 10 day course, therefore last day [**2133-2-1**].
## CAD- PAtient with cath intervention mentioned above.
Once patient GI bleed resolved started on beta-blocker and ACEI.
Patient on both statin and fibrate on admission.
Held gemfibrozil while in hospital since know documentation of why patient needed both medications.
## CHF - Felt that patient respiratory failure due to fluid mobilization, especially after episode free s/p increasing nightly lasix and increasing afterload reduction.
Started patient on Lisinopril for afterload reducation.
However once discovered that respiratory hypoxia was more due to fluid shifts at night and CHF felt that patient did not need cardioversion since appropriately rate controlled; so amiodarone was stopped.
Continued anticoagulation with Coumadin and heparin bridge since patient in chronic atrial fibrillation.
While in hospital patient given steroid injection of knee for gout symptoms which he responded well to.
Patient will need to follow up outpatient for appropriate treatment of gout and may consider starting allopurinol once gout flare subsides.
