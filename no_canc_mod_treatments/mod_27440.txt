Admission Date:  [**2175-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for liver and renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Liver biopsy Dialysis catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 39 yo male with HIV diagnosed in [**2164**] but was only recently started on HAART therapy about 2 months ago in [**Month (only) **] [**2175**].
He has had several recent admissions this past month at OSH for PNA, neutropenia and left renal calculus with hematuria.
Workup includes multiple problems: increased LFTs, pericholecystic fluid, coagulopathy, hyperkalemia and ARF.
Because of the concern for reconstitional syndrome, his HAART as well as MAC therapy were stopped.
He was put on Ceftriaxone for unclear reasons.
Past Medical History: # HIV/AIDS, diagnosed in [**2164**], off HAART "on religious grounds", CD4 count 2 and VL 350,000 on [**2174-11-1**].
)genotype 1, viral load 7 million # Liver biopsy [**11-21**]: AFB positive granulomas, started on ethambutol/azithro/rifabutin for MAC (rifabutin later d/c'd for unclear reasons) # Longstanding right-sided abdominal pain of unclear etiology: distended [**Name (NI) **] with pericholecystic fluid, however HIDA normal, surgeons do not feel this is cholecystitis # Prior CT demonstrating hypoechoic splenic lesions, (?
At that time started on anti-retrovirals - kaletra and trizivir.
Physical Exam: VITALS: 99.0  145/80  100  16  95%RA GEN: A+Ox3, NAD, coughing, no respiratory distress, well nourished male HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclera icteric, MMM, OP clear NECK: no LAD CV: tachycardic, regular, pericardial rub heard best at LRSB, no murmurs or gallops, PMI at left nipple PULM: scattered rhonchi with bilateral faint crackles, no wheezes, good air movement ABD: soft, tender at epigatrum, nondistended, +BS.
Acalculous cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
Follow-up CT after treatment for bacterial infection may be considered, if warranted clinically.
Right cribriform plate is approximately 1-2 mm lower than the left.
Nonspecific fat stranding along the anterior right retroperitoneum and right pericolic gutter extending about the cecum is nonspecific, may be related to hepatic dysfunction.
If there is clinical concern for acute appendicitis, MRI could be performed in this patient who cannot have intravenous contrast.
[**2175-5-17**] ERCP: Four fluoroscopic spot images were obtained during ERCP procedure by gastroenterologist without a radiologist present.
Final image demonstrates placement of a biliary stent.
Clonality could not be reliably assessed due to scant numbers and cytophilic staining.
INTERPRETATION: Non-specific lymphoid profile; B-cells are scant in number and clonality could not be reliably assessed.
[**2175-5-26**] USN GUIDED PARACENTESIS: Successful 1 liter diagnostic paracentesis via the right lower quadrant under ultrasound guidance.
Brief Hospital Course: # Comfort measures only.
The patient has hep C and HIV not previously on medication until late [**2174**] (per conversation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72851**], ID at OSH).
Hep C viral load 55,000,000.  per OSH records, his HAART was held upon admission to OSH [**2-17**] concern for reconstitution syndrome in addition to concern that HAART regimen could be causing liver failure (pt was briefly treated with solumedrol for reconstitution at OSH, but this was discontinued upon his admission).
His PCP prophylaxis and MAC treatment were also held because of concern that these could be causing his elevated LFTs.
Given a high concern for biliary infection (RUQ pain, fever, elevated tbili), the patient undwerwent ERCP on [**2175-5-17**], at which time mildly dilated biliary tree was visualized with filling defect in distal CBD consistent with a stone, thus stent was placed.
The patient's LFTs continue to rise after stent placement, and give his immunocomprimized state, fungal etiologies were considered.
Given elevated LFTs, and clinical suscpicion for fungal infection, the patient was started on ambisome on [**5-27**].
Galactomannan and beta glucan were negative.
he was restarted on azithromycin for PCP prophylaxis on [**5-31**] (dosed qweekly), however his tbili began rising again, and this was discontinued on [**6-2**].
The patient was not felt to be a candidate for hep C treatment given his comborbidities.
On [**6-2**] repeat HIV viral load was >100,000, decision was made to continue to defer restarting HAART, while awaiting HIV genotype information (pt's prior HIV regimen of trisovir/kaletra was felt to be atypical).
In close consultation with the infectious disease team, the patient was ultimately felt to not be a candidate for HAART therapy out of concern for further liver toxicity and inability to tolerate the therapy.
After the patient's decision to be comfort only, all antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient had been started on MAC treatment [**2-17**] liver biopsy in [**11-21**] which was AFB positive on smear, however no cultures had been sent.
MAC treatment (ethambutol, rifabutin, azithromycin) were held upon admission at OSH.
TBil peaked on [**2175-5-21**] @ 22.1, s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**5-17**].
His OSH course was complicated by hyperkalemia for which he underwent hemodialysis on [**5-11**] and [**5-12**].
Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] pt was not felt to require urgent dialysis.
His temporary dialysis catheter was discontinued on [**5-24**], the tip was sent for culture which was unremarkable.
Biopsy was deferred as he was relatively high risk for the procedure and the relevance to management options in this patient (as he was already known to not be a candidate for interferon therapy) were limited.
The patient's renal failure continued to progress and in accordance with the patient's wishes he had a temporary dialysis catheter placed and 2 cycles of hemodialysis in able to prolong his life to allow his family to see him.
After his family's arrival - and in accordance with the patient's and his family's wishes - his dialysis catheter was removed and the patient had no further dialysis.
