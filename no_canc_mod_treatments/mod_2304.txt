# UTI in context of hypotension: Patient with E coli sensitive to ceftriaxone on culture.
Initially, stress-dose steroids were held because patient has h/o co-morbities with steroids.
Pt was started on Ceftriaxone 1g daily.
Patient was transitioned to PO cefpodoxime before her discharge home.
She tolerated the medications well.
# Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but given chronic steroid use, pt probably not able to mount cortisol response to stressor of infection.
Pt received boluses of fluids in the ED to which she was only partially responsive, but did not receive fluids in the ICU because she was exhibiting crackles on pulm exam.
Pt has not received any acute treatment for hypotension in ICU.
