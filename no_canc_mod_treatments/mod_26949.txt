There is a small, loculated (apical) pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart.. .
Very large bowel-containing right inguinal/scrotal hernia without evidence of obstruction or ischemia.
He was continued on heparin, started on IV fluids, and transferred to the CCU given evidence of heart failure on echo (EF 25%, RV dysfunction).
Anticoagulated with heparin and then coumadin briefly but then d/c'd coumadin in favor of lovenox as planned for inpaitent cystoscopy for malignancy workup (see below).
s/p IVC filter on [**2171-11-22**] given DVT present and concern for further embolization.
He was continued on lovenox for anticoagulation until cystoscopy performed [**2172-1-24**] and then started on coumadin.
He will continue lovenox until reaches goal INR [**1-25**] at which time coumadin can be discontinued.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will need daily INR checks until therapeutic on coumadin at which time lovenox can be discontinued.
Psychiatry was consulted and the patient was started on standing haldol [**Hospital1 **] with improvement and resolution of his agitation.
He required a 1:1 sitter due to flight risk and occasional agitation.
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone, which was then switched to ciprofloxacin.
His Foley catheter was removed, but patient developed urinary retention with drainage of 1.4L from his bladder.
Renal failure was likely post-renal due to obstruction and resolved with drainage of bladder.
Urology was consulted for very difficult foley placement and he was started on flomax.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and ceftazadime and vancomycin were started to complete a 2 week course (started on [**1-20**] and [**1-22**], respectively).
A midline catheter was placed [**1-22**] and should be removed on [**2172-2-4**] after completing his course of IV antibiotics.
He failed two voiding trials the week prior to discharge and therefore an indwelling foley was left in place with urology followup for urodynamics studies and consideration of TURP.
Urine cytology and cystoscopy was negative.
He was also scheduled for screening colonoscopy with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**]; instructions for the bowel preparation are attached with the discharge information.
#) Cardiac: No known CAD and on no cardiac meds at home.
Upon arrival, echocardiogram initially with EF 25% and RV dysfunction likely [**1-24**] PE, so ACEi and BB were initiated for presumed cardiomyopathy.
Repeat echo was performed after acute events resolved and showed preserved EF with normal wall motion.
Patient declining eval for herniorraphy and given no symptoms unlikely need at this time.
