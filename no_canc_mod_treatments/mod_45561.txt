After these arrangements had been made, the patient refused to go to [**Hospital1 1238**] and insisted that we take his PICC line out and allow him to leave the hospital.
The attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], spoke with him and made it clear that if he were to leave the hospital and stop his antibiotic course he would be at serious risk of dying from his endocarditis.
Additionally, he made it clear that if the patient was to stop his antibiotics and then restart any penicillin including Oxacillin he would be at danger of developing anaphylaxis.
We respected his wishes, removed his PICC line and he signed out AMA.
While signing the papers, we again reiterated the risks to him, namely of dying from infection or dying from anaphylaxis should he restart his antibiotics and he clearly understood them.
He was sent out on no medications, neither his antibiotics nor methadone.
