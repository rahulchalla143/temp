In the Emergency Department, she was reintubated for airway protection and she got Etomidate 20 mg, Succinylcholine 100 mg.
In addition in the Emergency Department, she also received charcoal, 6 mg Ativan, and 4 mg Versed prior to her CT scan as the patient was very agitated.
Her Q-T intervals were prolonged, but her tachycardia was resolved with fluid hydration in the Emergency Department.
No other information could be obtained from the patient as she was intubated at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and her ventilatory settings were in the SIMV mode with a tidal volume of 550 times 12 breaths, pressure support of 10, PEEP 5, FIO2 40% and Ativan drip of 2 mg per hour.
She was arousible and agitated and responded to painful/noxious stimuli.
After discussion with toxicology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that since the patient already received 50 grams of charcoal in the Emergency Department, it would be safe to extubate her and the patient probably did not have significant PCA toxicity as her QRS complexes were not widened.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Methadone 40 mg p.o.
