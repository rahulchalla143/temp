Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Aneurysm of ascending aorta and aortic arch, status post    replacement of ascending aorta and hemi-arch and aortic    valve resuspension with 32 mm gel-weave tube graft.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old female who was found to have mildly dilated abdominal aortic aneurysm on work-up for a heart murmur she had been diagnosed with.
This had been followed serially with echocardiogram and was found to have grown to 5.5 cm in [**2168-2-23**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2168-5-3**], and on that same day, she underwent replacement of her ascending aorta and hemi-arch and aortic valve resuspension with a 32 mm gel-weave tube graft.
The patient was taken intubated from the operating room to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit where she was maintained on vasopressor for blood pressure support, and she remained mechanically ventilated.
She was extubated mid day, on postoperative day #1, and subsequently developed respiratory acidosis, which was felt to be secondary to a combination of pain medication and respiratory fatigue.
She was subsequently placed on BIPAP ventilation over night, which she tolerated well, which allowed for resolution of her respiratory acidosis without use of further invasive ventilation.
Her chest tubes were removed on postoperative day #4, and she continued to work with physical therapy who felt that she would be a safe candidate for discharge to home with home physical therapy.
Throughout the course of her hospitalization, we maintained strict glucose control with use of her home Metformin, and regular insulin sliding scale was needed.
Diuresis was started on postoperative day #1 as per routine with good result.
It was felt that by postoperative day #7, as the patient had been afebrile, she had otherwise been hemodynamically normal, with a pulse in the 70-80s and a systolic pressure in the 120s, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 L, and otherwise unremarkable physical examination with only trace edema in the extremities and a clean wound, that the patient could be safely discharged to home with home physical therapy and home oxygenation.
