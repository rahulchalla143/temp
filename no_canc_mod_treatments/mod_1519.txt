Due to the result of this echocardiogram, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization [**7-23**], showing 90% proximal right coronary artery stenosis, diffuse disease in mid-RCA and 40% distal right coronary artery stenosis, 30% proximal left anterior descending stenoses, 90% mid-LAD stenosis and 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.
For these lesions, the patient received PTCA with two stents placed in the right coronary artery, PTCA with Rotablator to the left anterior descending with two stents.
During this procedure, the D1 branch was obstructed and required balloon and stenting.
The patient tolerated his procedure well and was doing well after his catheterization until [**2183-11-16**], when he presented with a temperature of 101.0 F., to the Emergency Department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain similar to his diverticulitis which he has had before.
While drinking Baricon contrast in preparation for an abdominal CT scan in the Emergency Department, the patient developed 10 on 10 chest pain while he had no history of chest pain ever in the past, with a [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in leads V3 to V6, [**Street Address(2) 7093**] depressions in leads II, III and AVF.
The patient was given an aspirin, 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor, he was heparinized and given three sublingual Nitroglycerin initially with resolution of pain.
During the procedure, the patient became hypotensive requiring Dopamine for pressure support.
He also dropped his oxygen saturation transiently requiring urgent intubation.
At this time, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
Overall, the patient received intervention of a kissing balloon inflation in left anterior descending and D1 with 30% residual stenosis in D1 as well as a balloon in the right coronary artery with zero percent residual stenosis.
Glyburide 2.5 mg twice a day.
A recent course of Amoxicillin stopped on [**11-22**] for right lower lobe pneumonia.
With acute coronary syndrome, the patient had received therapeutic intervention with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his two diseased vessels.
The patient was continued on aspirin, Lipitor, heparin, Integrilin and Plavix.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted for potential bypass surgery.
The patient was supported with intra-aortic balloon pump as well as two peripheral pressors, Dopamine and Levophed on initial arrival to the Coronary Care Unit.
In the Coronary Care Unit we continued sedation and mechanical ventilation until patient was further stabilized.
With the patient's presenting symptoms of left lower quadrant pain to the Emergency Department, and an elevated white count with 10% of bandemia, it was highly suspected that the patient had a recurrence of his diverticulitis.
He was put on intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl for treatment of his diverticulitis and was made n.p.o.
The patient's diabetic medicines were held and he was covered on Regular insulin sliding scale.
A right internal jugular central line was inserted on this date with placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter to further monitor the patient's hemodynamics.
The patient remained intubated and sedated with intra-aortic balloon pump as well as two pressors for blood pressure support.
The patient was bolused with normal saline for volume repletion.
The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient responded very well to volume repletion with normal saline as well as a unit of packed red blood cells and was able to be weaned off intra-aortic balloon pump on [**2183-11-19**].
He still required pressure support with 5 mics of Dopamine.
As the patient became hemodynamically stabilized and is now weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient was weaned to extubation and was successfully extubated on [**2183-11-19**].
On the same day, the patient was weaned off all pressors.
His pressure was now able to tolerate a low dose beta blocker as well as an ACE inhibitor.
He was requiring some supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
This was thought to be due to a minor congestive heart failure for which he received Lasix for gentle diuresis.
During his entire stay in the Coronary Care Unit the patient was kept on intravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
medications including his diabetic medications were restarted.
The patient tolerated his medications very well.
His antibiotics were converted to oral antibiotics.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and was ambulating well on the floor.
His oxygen saturation improved with gentle diuresis and by [**11-22**], his oxygen saturation was normal at 94% on room air.
He no longer required any supplemental oxygen.
Based on this study, the patient was started on Coumadin for anti-coagulation.
It was now determined that the patient should eventually undergo coronary bypass surgery in the future, but should not go on this admission.
The patient is expected to be discharged home and recover from his current myocardial infarction and undergo coronary artery bypass surgery electively.
He was to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as his cardiologist for discussion of appropriate date for his future elective coronary artery bypass surgery.
