The patient also reportedly had respiratory symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis.
In the ambulance, the patient was treated with morphine, nitroglycerin, and 80 mg of intravenous Lasix for congestive heart failure.
The patient required intubation while in the ambulance for hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequently developed pulseless electrical activity arrest.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and the patient received several rounds of epinephrine and atropine; with, by report, return of pulse and blood pressure.
On arrival to the Emergency Department at the outside hospital, the patient again developed pulselessness and was treated with 1 mg of epinephrine and dopamine.
Lasix was also administered in the Emergency Department.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for possible cardiac catheterization and further management.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications prior to admission included Zoloft and antihypertensives (particular medications unknown).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed temperature was 98.8, heart rate was 110, blood pressure was 80/50 (on dopamine), oxygen saturation was 93% on assist-control with FIO2 of 100% and 15 of positive end-expiratory pressure.
Endotracheal tube was in place.
Neurologic examination revealed sedated with occasional agitation and withdrawal to pain.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Significant laboratories and studies at the outside hospital revealed arterial blood gas with a pH of 6.8, PCO2 of 71.6, PO2 of 66.8, with a bicarbonate of 11.3.
Creatine kinase was 191, and troponin I was 4.93.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with multisystem organ failure.
The patient remained intubated with adequate ventilation; however, relatively poor oxygenation with large bilateral pleural effusions and alveolar infiltrates.
The patient continued with persistent hypotension requiring pressor support felt secondary to a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for persistent fevers to 104; however, multiple sets of cultures including sputum, blood, and urine were without growth.
The source of the infection was initially felt likely to be a pulmonary process; however, given the persistent fevers despite broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient underwent head, thoracic, and abdominal CAT scans for evaluation for potential additional source of infection.
The patient was weaned off of sedation with minimal neurologic responsiveness to stimuli.
