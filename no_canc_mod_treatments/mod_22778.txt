Linear opacity in left mid lung region is consistent with atelectasis, and small amount of pleural fluid persists in the right minor fissure.
Admission U/A was consistent with UTI, and urine cultures grew cipro resistant, nitrofurantoin sensitive E. Coli.
# Hyperglycemia: Etiology of her increased insulin requirement remained unclear but was hypothesized to be due to an occult UTI given her UA showing WBC.
She was initially on an insulin drip in the ICU which was subsequently converted to U-500 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs.
Her hyperglycemia remained within her baseline range, 200-300, on a sliding scale with U-500 given four times a day at specific times similar to when she might take her insulin at home.
# Urinary tract infection:  She was initially begun on ciprofloxacin; when sensitivities for E.coli came back resistant to cipro on [**2158-8-31**], she was started on a 7 day course of nitrofurantoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her foley catheter was removed shortly after arriving on the floor, where she completed her antibiotic course.
She was initially started on lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
In the ICU, she required PRN IV lasix to maintain 0.5 to 1L negative daily.
She was on IV lasix only upon transfer from the ICU with goal 1-2L negative daily.
Her home plavix was discontinued in the ICU as there was no obvious indication for it.
The remainder of her home medications were continued.
They became less frequent by discharge with QID metoprolol and continued diuresis.
She was discharged on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily.
She was evaluated by both a dentist and oral surgeon, who recommended extraction as an outpatient.
It may be advisable for her to discuss bisphosphonate therapy with her PCP.
She wears oxygen overnight at home and will continue this regimen as an outpatient.
# Constipation: She was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen.
Her presenting abdominal discomfort subsequently improved.

You were noted to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), which we treated with an antibiotic called nitrofurantoin.
You have spent several days on the general medicine service, where we have continued treating your UTI and also have taken off excess fluid using intravenous lasix.
Please note the following medication changes: - Please begin taking metoprolol 50mg XL rather than your prior dose of 12.5mg.
- Please begin taking lisinopril 5mg daily - Please increase you Lasix (furosemide) to 80mg twice daily - Please continue to take only 10mg prednisone daily, which is half of your admission dose - Please adjust your home insulin U-500 dosing to 90 units at breakfast, 100 units at lunch, 60 units at dinner, and 60 units at bedtime as discussed with the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes doctors.
- We have also written prescriptions for several medications you found helpful, which you can use as needed:  A/B otic drops for ear pain, Zofran for nausea, zofran for nausea, tessalon perles for cough, and trazadone for insomnia.
As prednisone can weaken your bones, you may consider a group of medications called bisphosphanates to maintain your bone health.
