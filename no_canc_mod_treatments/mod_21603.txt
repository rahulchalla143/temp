Prior to his admission on [**2103-9-19**], the patient was at a rehab facility from early [**8-22**] to [**2103-9-6**] where he was being treated for a PNA with Vancomycin and for a UTI with Ciprofloxacin.
Given recent courses of antibiotics, patient was treated empirically with flagyl for possible c.diff, but this was later d/c'd when stool cultures returned negative for c. diff x1.
Patient was s/p diagnostic thoracentesis [**2103-10-1**].
Thoracentesis was complicated by AFib with RVR that was rate controlled with Diltiazem.
He noted 1 episode of diarrhea one day prior to transfer.
Tracheobroncheal malacia, dx [**11-22**]; s/p Y stent placement [**2-20**] and removal [**7-23**] 2.
BPH (foley changed [**2-26**], needs to be changed q month- will have laser surgery once resp issues resolved.)
6 grandchildren lifelong non-smoker no etoh   Family History: Father died at age [**Age over 90 **], and a history of TIAs.
TEDS in place Neuro: AOx3, grossly normal.
A stent can be seen within the main trachea, however, the distal extent of this into the bronchi is not visualized on this exam.
Tracheal stent extending from the thoracic inlet down into the left main stem bronchus.
Tracheobronchial malacia- Awaiting eval and input from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Per IP 2 tracheobronchial metal stents were placed on [**10-5**], initially thought stents would improve breathing.
On [**10-10**] metal stents were removed per IP for symptomatic relief of persistent cough.
Atrovent nebs qid, ativan qhs, guaifenesin prn, and lidocaine nebs PRN per respiratory were continued.
[**2103-10-19**]: Patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery service and underwent a tracheoplasty for his tracheobronchial malacia.
He was restarted on his heparin drip immediately postoperatively.
On the evening of POD #1, patient became less alert with desaturations despite supplemental oxygen.
His creatinine also increased despite gentle fluid resuscitation.
Anesthesia was called for increasing desaturations and the patient was reintubated at the bedside without complication.
POD #2-Patient maintained on mechanical ventilation, remained stable throughout the day.
POD #3-Patient stable on a low neosynephrine drip.
He went back to the operating room for an uncomplicated tracheostomy.
Postoperatively, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite weaning of his anesthetics as well as hypoxic to the low 80's despite mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy.
He experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia treated with amiodarone and lidocaine.
The patient was given bicarbonate supplementation and aggressively ventilated.
A Swan Ganz catheter was placed at the bedside and the patient's pulmonary artery pressures were noted to be markedly elevated.
The patient was started on TPA and managed supportively for his low blood pressure and acidosis.
He was maintained on maximal pressor support as well as mechanical ventilation with continuing acidemia.
In discussion with the patient's family, the patient was withdrawn from mechanical ventilation as well as pressor support on the evening of POD #3.
ID: Pt had initially been started on Vanc for preop empiric treatment on [**10-7**].
However, on [**10-7**] UA was +for UTI, UCulture w/Enterobacter and staph Aureus, so Vanc was continued for Enterobacter UTI.
Levo/flagyl was started on [**10-9**] for empiric treatment of Asp PNA.
On [**10-9**] had an episode of RVR, HR up to 140s and responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x1 which converted back to NSR.
In setting of continual cough and poor PO intake, coumadin was discontinued and started on hep gtt for anticoagulation.
Patient was evaluated by the pulmonary service, who thought that PNA was not likely and thus antibiotic treatment was initially not initiated.
Patient is s/p diagnostic thoracentesis at OSH.
Cr slowly trended up from 1.1--1.6--2.0 in setting of continual diuretic use, clots noted in foley c/w post renal/obstruction.
Patient with chronic indwelling foley and prolonged hospitalization.
GU/Foley trauma-pt was noted to have clots in foley bag on [**10-9**], urology was consulted, pt with chronic indwelling foley for BPH changed qmonth per urologist.
