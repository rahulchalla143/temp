The daughter gave her a double dose of torsemide (20 mg total) and called EMS.
She was initially given SL Nitro and SBPs dropped from 150s to 50s, which then came up to low 100s with 250 cc bolus after 2 minutes.
She was not tolerating BiPAP well, placed on a nonrebreather, and pressures improved.
CARDIAC HISTORY: # CAD s/p MI with CABG in [**2110**] (in [**Location (un) 74814**], [**State **]) # PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: DES X2 in OM/Cx placed in [**2118**].

She improved quickly after having received 20mg torsemide PO x1 and lasix 80mg IV x1.
She was discharged on an optimized CHF regimen including spironolactone (which was started on discharge), and her home [**Last Name (un) **], aspirin, statin, and metoprolol.
Her digoxin was held at the time of discharge given her impaired renal function.
She was provided with teaching about how to manage her CHF at home including fluid restriction and low sodium diet.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Her baseline creatinine is 1.5 as of [**4-/2124**], was 2.3 in [**7-/2124**], 2.5 on admission.
Patient may have new Cr baseline at around 2.5, as Cr 2.3 in [**Month (only) 216**].
Her [**Last Name (un) **] and digoxin were held while in-house.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Digoxin: Her digoxin was held during this admission and at discharge given her impaired renal function.
4) She will have home VNA services who will draw chemistries and coags and fax the results to her PCP for evaluation of lytes, renal function, and warfarin and adjustements/management as needed.
