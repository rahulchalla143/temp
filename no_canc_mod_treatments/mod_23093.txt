Minimally invasive Maze procedure which consisted of     bilateral pulmonary vein isolation using the AtriCure     Synergy System with resection of left atrial appendage     as well as ganglionic mapping and ablation of positive     ganglia.
She was referred for surgical evaluation.

The patient wished to proceed with surgical pulmonary vein isolation and resection of left atrial appendage.
She was admitted as same day admission for a minimally invasive Maze procedure which consisted of bilateral pulmonary vein isolation using the AtriCure Synergy System with resection of left atrial appendage as well as ganglionic mapping and ablation of positive ganglia as well as a full electrophysiology mapping and testing performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2259**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
She did develop atrial flutter to the 130's and was given Flecainide and Lopressor was titrated.
She was having conversion pauses of up to 5 seconds, therefore Lopressor was not titrated up any further.
No further titration of medication was warranted at that time per cardiology recommendations.
Coumadin for started for atrial fibrillation and she was bridged with Heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics and her INR was therapeutic.
Her Coumadin was to be followed by the [**University/College **] [**Hospital 38299**] [**Hospital 197**] clinic and they were contact[**Name (NI) **] with recent INR and doses.
She was instructed to take Coumadin 7.5 mg on [**10-24**] with plans for INR draw [**10-25**] and further dosing instructions per the [**Hospital 197**] clinic.
