Admission Date:  [**2159-4-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2159-4-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-8-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  F-ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 44 year old male with a past medical history for aortic valve endocarditis status post aortic valve replacement with debridement and repair, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, chronic ventilator dependent secondary to Intensive Care Unit myopathy and neuropathy, chronic Pseudomonal colonization, and hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
He was discharged from the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit on [**3-27**], after a six month hospitalization for Pseudomonas pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, TJ tube placement, pancreatitis, and hypercalcemia.
At [**Hospital6 3872**], the patient received one week of antibiotic therapy with gentamicin.
He was weaned off of pressors after one week.
Tube feeds were held and the patient was evaluated by the Gastrointestinal and Surgery Department.
Status post aortic valve repair, aortic root debridement.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158-10-29**] ( saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery ).
The patient has been treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics and Calcitonin for his hypercalcemia, and ultimately responded to Pamidronate after eight treatments.
The patient has also had Vitamin D levels aggressively repleted.
Bowel dysmotility, previously on Reglan and erythromycin.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Haldol p.r.n.
Tylenol q. four hours.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
Epogen 3000 units subcutaneously twice a week.
Protonix 40 mg per J-tube q. day.
Reglan 5 mg intravenously q. six hours for three doses.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Recurrent vomiting:  The initial differential diagnoses for this patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting included GJ tube dysfunction contributing to gastric outlet obstruction, other structural causes of obstruction, for example stricture or ulcer, ischemia or adhesions at his gastric outlet, versus a functional motility disorder (for example gastroparesis, gastric dysmotility).
An abdominal x-ray with contrast injected into the J-tube to assess for feeding tube patency was done, which showed satisfactory positioning of the tube.
The patient was to have an upper endoscopy done to evaluate for gastric outlet obstruction; however, the patient's sister informed the Medical Team that an upper endoscopy had recently been done about two weeks prior at [**Hospital6 3873**].
Tube feeds were initiated and slowly advanced to a goal of 85 cc per hour, with initiation of Reglan 5 mg intravenously three times a day, with no recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.
He was continued on Lisinopril for afterload reduction, which was increased from 5 to 10 mg per G-tube q. day.
PULMONARY:  Recurrent aspiration - the patient was placed on aspiration precautions.
Although the patient continued to have copious secretions through his tracheostomy tube, he was afebrile with normal white blood cell count throughout his hospital stay; therefore, antibiotics were not initiated.
With regards to his ventilator settings, the patient was continued on C-PAP plus pressure support during the day and AC-ventilation at night for rest.
Current ventilator settings are as follows:  During the day the patient is on C-PAP plus pressure support, [**7-3**] with FIO2 of 40%.
At night, the patient is rested on AC-ventilation with total volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 40%.
The patient tolerated tube feeds well with no abdominal pain.
Work-up revealed low normal PTH, low vitamin D levels with PTH RP negative.
During a recent admission the patient was treated with two doses of intravenous pamidronate, once with 30 mg and the second time with 50 mg, and the patient was given Calcitriol to replete his vitamin D stores, as these were noted to be low.
Vitamin D levels checked on [**3-24**] were noted to be low (less than 7.0), so the patient was redosed with high dose Vitamin D, 10,000 Units, and was to then continue taking Calcitriol 0.125 micrograms per J-tube q. day.
The patient is to be continued on regular insulin sliding scale.
SEIZURE DISORDER:  The patient was continued on Keppra with no further episodes of seizure like activity during his hospital stay.
DEPRESSION:  The patient was continued on Zoloft with the dose increased to 50 mg p.o.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had an Intensive Care Unit neuropathy and myopathy.
He was continued on Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy with improving upper and lower extremity strength throughout his hospital stay.
The patient had a Passe-Muir valve placed on [**4-12**] and has been able to say a few words since then.
ACCESS:  The patient had a right arm PICC placed on [**4-7**].
NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on total parenteral nutrition while tube feeds were being held for various radiographic procedures and while tube feeds were being advanced to goal.
The patient has now been advanced to goal tube feeds at 85 cc per hour which he is tolerating well without nausea or vomiting and the total parenteral nutrition has been discontinued.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: (same as on admission with the except of Zoloft being increased to 50 mg p.o.
Haldol p.r.n.
Tylenol q. four hours.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
Epogen 3000 units subcutaneously twice a week.
Protonix 40 mg per J-tube q. day.
Reglan 5 mg intravenously q. six hours for three doses.
The patient is starting on Calcitriol 0.125 micrograms p.o.
