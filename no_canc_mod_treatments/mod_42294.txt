PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Prior medical history includes hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, status post open appendectomy and status post hernia repair.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Undocumented.
In the first days of his hospitalization his abdominal pain, discomfort improved with Demerol and Vistaril, and it was felt that through intravenous fluid resuscitation, conservative management would be sufficient.
The patient was soon started on prophylactic antibiotics and was kept in conservative treatment on the medical service for the next seven days.
Antibiotic coverage was then increased and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for resuscitation.
Following this, the patient was again taken to the Operating Room for re-look exploratory laparotomy, necrotic tissue debridement and placement of a feeding jejunostomy.
The procedure proceeded without any complications and the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit.
The tachycardia was ultimately rate-controlled with Lopressor and hypertension was controlled with intravenous Hydralazine.
All of these episodes were shown to be negative for embolism and throughout he has responded to pulmonary toilet.
Gastrointestinal - At initial presentation, the patient was on total parenteral nutrition.
This was gradually replaced with tube feeds.
The tube feeds were at goal until it was found that the patient had positive cultures for Clostridium difficile colitis.
Tube feeds were stopped and the patient was returned to total parenteral nutrition during antibiotic course for Clostridium difficile colitis.
Following appropriate antibiotic course surveillance cultures confirmed negative Clostridium difficile.
On two occasions, drains fell out during transfer of the patient and he required replacement while in Interventional Radiology.
An additional percutaneous drain was placed by Interventional Radiology and the patient was again started on intravenous antihypertensives and returned to the Intensive Care Unit.
At that time, the antibiotics included Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Fluconazole and Flagyl.
He was maintaining appropriate fluid and calorie goals on Peptamine tube feeds at a rate of 80 with the addition of 250 cc of water q.i.d.
He had a Foley catheter in place.
He also had a percutaneously placed pigtail catheter in place, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in place and a gastrostomy tube in place.
Given the prolonged periods without temperatures and decreasing white count, his antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Vancomycin and Fluconazole.
On postoperative day #33-31, the patient had a double lumen pigtail catheter placed in interventional radiology and efforts were began to find suitable placement for him.
On postoperative day #34-32, the patient was on a stable tube feed diet, having begun to tolerate a soft diet by mouth and had been afebrile for over 72 hours.
At that time he was screened for placement for rehabilitation and seemed to be a suitable candidate.
