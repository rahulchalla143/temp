HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male with an extensive cardiac history including CABG times three, mitral valve repair in [**2159**], ejection fraction 30-40%, [**2-1**]+ MR, [**3-2**]+ TR, dilated right and left atria and right ventricle, history of V tach arrest, now status post AICD placement, history of sick sinus syndrome, now status post pacer placement, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal failure, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2162-6-8**] complaining of nausea, vomiting, and increasing abdominal girth.
He was found to be hypotensive (questionable) presumably by overdiuresis and was treated with IV fluids, packed red blood cells and was briefly on pressors.
A CT of the abdomen showed abdominal ascites with pooling of IV contrast in the right heart and IVC.
Cardiac Surgery consult was placed to evaluate the patient for a possible mitral valve replacement.
The patient was seen by the Dental Service and was cleared for surgery by them.
Measurements were taken pre and post milrinone with the following results listed respectively:  Cardiac output 3.88, 4.31; cardiac index 1.77 and 1.9; pulmonary capillary wedge pressures 33 and 28; pulmonary artery pressure 60/32 and 50/25; right atrial pressure 25 and 21; left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 37% with 4+ MR.
Consequently, he was transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the CCU to undergo milrinone therapy and aggressive diuresis to optimize him for any surgery that might take place.
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in [**2141**], [**2146**], and [**2159**].
Cardiac catheterization in [**11-30**], during which the patient's left main underwent rotational atherectomy and PTCA with stent placement, slowly with evidence of competitive flow, midvessel, after takeoff.
Status post mitral valve repair in [**2159**].
Pacer placement in [**2161-4-29**].
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
Plavix 75 q.d.
Lipitor 10 q.d.
Hydralazine 10 t.i.d.
Aldactone 25 b.i.d.
Coumadin 2.5 q.h.s.
Prevacid 30 q.d.
Folic acid one q.d.
Lexapro 10 q.d.
Lasix 120 p.o.
Zaroxolyn 2.5 q.d.
Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
Aspirin 81.
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
Zaroxolyn 2.5 q.d.
Right femoral vein cordis with Swan in place.
After transfer to the CCU, the patient was maintained on a milrinone drip and was started on a Lasix drip.
His Plavix and Coumadin were held in anticipation of surgery and heparin was not started as the patient was maintaining an INR of 1.6 to 1.8 on his own.
A Swan-Ganz was eventually re-sited to the right IJ to allow the patient more mobility.
His right femoral arterial line was also re-sited to his right radial artery for the same reason.
