History of Present Illness: 73F h/o DM, PVD s/p bilateral BKA, ESRD Afib and diastolic CHF with multiple admissions for acute pulmonary edema (most recent [**2164-1-4**]) who presents with acute SOB, 1 hour prior to admission.
EMS found that she was unable to speak in full sentences and BP was 220; they put her on CPAP (10) and gave NG x 3 with improvement in sx.
By arrival to the ED, SBP was 130's; she was kept on CPAP for high RR (36) and started on a nitro drip and ASA 325 mg. TWI were noted on EKG in V5-V6 (though these were old compared to [**2164-1-4**] EKG).
(In addition, she was given ceftriaxone 1 g IV x 1 for a UTI; UCx from [**1-4**] grew Klebsiella, though returned after discharge so she has not received tx yet.)
By arrival to the MICU, she was weaned to a NRB and quickly to 3LNC (home night O2 requirements).
She denied missing her medications this morning; she lives alone at home, but a visting nurse normally arranges her medications for her.

EMS found that she was unable to speak in full sentences and BP was 220; they put her on CPAP (10) and gave NG x 3 with improvement in SBP to 130's.
In the MICU, she was maintained on CPAP overnight; in the morning, she became subjectively dyspneic though her oxygen sats were 100%.
She asked for BIPAP until HD, and she was able to be taken off BIPAP support when she initiated her HD run.
During her period of dyspnea, she was also hypertensive with systolics in the high 100s where she was briefly given nitropaste until HD.
She was easily weaned back to [**Month/Day/Year 5348**] O2 requirements (3LNC) with better BP control without lasix.
Renal team followed the patient and she received HD on her regular schedule.
