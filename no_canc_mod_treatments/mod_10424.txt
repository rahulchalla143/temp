She has past medical history of a-fib, hypertension, status post MI, prior stroke and most significantly, a 10 year history of inflammatory brain disease which has not been convincingly diagnosed.
She seemed to try to talk, but only occasional soft nonsense words were able to be uttered.
She has been treated with steroid courses numerous times in the past as she has had similar episodes of aphasia and similar symptoms, in general, and all of these have been well served with steroids.
Ativan 1 mg was given and she seemed to do better.
She was loaded with fosphenytoin and then started on Dilantin 100 mg p.o.
She had some difficulty with increased blood pressure and we needed to increase metoprolol and ramipril.
She was also started on hydralazine at that time and her blood pressure continued to come down well.
After the biopsy was finished, we started an IV steroid course of 1000 mg q.day of Solu-Medrol.
Throughout the time of the IV steroids she continued to slowly improve with her speaking.
After being fed by NG tube for a week, she was cleared by speech to have a full liquid diet with nectar thickening.
She is to have speech and swallow evaluations as an outpatient in rehab and she needs a video swallow within one week to further assess her swallowing and aspiration risk.
Blood pressure at the time was 80/40 and she lost consciousness for a few seconds.
However, the next morning she received a colonoscopy by GI.
