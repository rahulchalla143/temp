Multiple anterior abdominal wall abscesses as described above.
Gastrostomy tube, IVC filter, and suprapubic catheter identified.
Port a cath placement: TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained, the patient's left upper chest was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.
Lidocaine with Epinephrine was used to anesthetize the skin, tract and eventual location of this patient's port.
The port was then sutured in place using a zero-silk suture.
The catheter was then measured so the eventual length would place it in the distal SVC.
The vascular entrance site was then dilated to 9 French after which a peel-away sheath was placed and the catheter advanced.
The catheter was then joined to the subcutaneous port without incident.
Final chest x-ray demonstrates no kinks in the catheter, catheter tip in the distal SVC.
It was then flushed with heparinized saline.
Throughout the procedure, the tract and subcutaneous port location were irrigated with orthopedic solution.
IMPRESSION: Placement of an 8 French subcutaneous port via the left subclavian vein with the tip in the right atrium.
His G tube was replaced successfully by IR.
One of these pockets was aspirated and showed only clotted blood.
It was felt that these were most likely due to his heparin injections and so heparin sc was discontinued.
He was initially treated with Zosyn, but once the culture demonstrated that it was unlikely to be pseudomonas, and the resistance pattern was consistent with an ESBL resistant Klebsiella, Pt was switched to Meropenem.
it was presumed that his PICC line was the source.
This was removed and a port-a cath was placed by IR.
Pt has a history of autonomic dysregulation, this was treated by continuing his regimen of metoprolol.
Of note, pt was maximally impacted and constipated on arrival, he required an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 70883**] [**Last Name (un) 49666**] regimen.
