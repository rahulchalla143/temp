Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88903**] is an 83yM who initially presented to the thoracic surgery clinic in [**2101**] for an incidentally discovered RUL mass on routine preoperative CXR.
He underwent PET scanning as well as EBUS which were negative for malignancy.
He was followed with surveillance CT scans as he desired conservative management as opposed to VATS biopsy.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2103-3-21**] at which time he underwent VATS right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy.
He underwent placement of an anterior pigtail for evacuation of the pneumothorax and was taken to the OR on [**3-23**] for bronchoscopy for evacuation of mucous plug likely causing lung collapse.
He was admitted to the ICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued observation.
He remained in the ICU receiving 3% normal saline nebulizers as well as Acapella valve therapy and night-time BiPAP as tolerated.
His CXRs continued to demonstrated atalectasis with nearly complete right sided collapse and Interventional Pulmonology performed two further bedside bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet on [**3-27**] and 3.29.
A CT chest was obtained [**3-29**] and demonstrated an apical pleural effusion which was drained with a pigtail by Interventional pulmonology.
He continued to work with physical therapy and his ambulatory saturations improved.
On [**4-3**], his pain was well controlled, he was tolerating a regular diet and his CXR following pigtail removal was stable.

* Continue to use incentive spirometer 10 times an hour during day.
* Your chest tube dressing may be removed 48 hours after discharge from the hospital.
* You will likely continue to need pain medication once you are home, but you can wean off of the Tramadol over a few weeks as the discomfort resolves.
You may begin to take only Tylenol or ibuprofen for pain whenever you feel that this is reasonable instead of the Tramadol.
Make sure that you have regular bowel movements while on pain medications as they are constipating which can cause more medical problems.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication (Tramadol).
* Tylenol 650 mg (as mentioned above) is OK to take every 6 hours in between your Tramadol doses, but do not take more than 4000mg in 24 hours.
