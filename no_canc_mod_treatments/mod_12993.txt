He is usually on 2L O2, satting in the low 90s, but he was requiring a non-rebreather to sat 86% on 4L NRB prior to arrival.
He has a known history of hypotension with ?adrenal insufficiency, previously treated with fludrocortisone.
He was given Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage as well as stress-dose hydrocort and 1.5L NS for hypotension.
On arrival to the MICU, he is on a non-rebreather in no acute distress with continued SBPs in the 80s, despite fluid resuscitation in the ED.
He is adamantly refusing another IV placement in his arm, saying that 1 is enough.

[**2172-11-20**] CXR: New PICC line was inserted through the left arm with its tip being at the level of mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with history of chronic aspiration, COPD (no PFTs), t2DM, history of PE s/p IVC filter placement and dementia, presenting with shortness of breath and hypotension likely secondary to recurrent aspiration event.
No headway has been made so far and attempts at DNH at [**Hospital3 2558**] have been unsuccessful.
No invasive procedures were performed, but a PICC line was placed for IV antibiotic administration.
At family meeting on [**2172-11-20**], family seemed to agree that patient should be DNH (do not hospitalize) and that after this admission and antibiotic treatment care should not be escalated.
# Hypotension:  Patient has known hypotension, which has been a recurrent issue during his hospitalizations.
He has been on fludrocortisone and midodrine in the past for this and it seems he lives at low pressures.
On admission he was bolused with NS instead to maintain pressures and restarted on fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily.
We started broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl) to cover both aspiration pneumonia and HCAP.
He was additionally breathing comfortably on room air, though is on 2L home Oxygen at baseline.
Flagyl was stopped on the day of discharge as it is not indicated for aspiration pneumonia.
He will continue a course of Vanc/cefepime for a total course of 8 days.
He will be continued on Cefepime as above (for a 8 day course).
COPD: Continued Advair, tiotropium, albuterol/ipratropium nebs per home dosing.
T2DM: Continue metformin and maintained on insulin sliding scale in-house.
History of PE: s/p IVC filter: Not on any anticoagulation at this time.
It was agreed that the patient will be treated for his current infection with IV antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) through the PICC.
Vancomycin troughs should be monitored daily and vancomycin should be held if trough >20.
