You were given medications to improve your confusion.
You tolerated this procedure very well.
We started treatment to help treat this, however despite treatment, your kidney function continued to worsen and has not recovered.
While dialysis is an option to take the place of your kidneys, it is not without its risks:  dialysis can cause your blood pressure to fall.
In addition, you will need dialysis nearly three times a week, and the amount of energy you would need to put into getting dialysis would likely detrimentally impact the quality of your life and take time away that you can spend with your family.
It's likely that dialysis would prolong your life in the short-term, however the impact of dialysis on your daily life would probably be detrimental.
We will continue to treat your symptoms, including pain, shortness of breath, or whatever other discomfort you experience.
We will continue some of the tablets that we have been giving you to slow the progression of your kidney disease.
There are several medications that we have stopped that are not necessary - these changes are summarized below.
(3) We started midodrine, a tablet that will help slow the progression of your kidney disease.
(6) Pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day - this medicine helps protect your stomach from bleeding.
(7) Rifaximin - 400 mg three times a day - this will help keep your mind clear.
(8) Lactulose - You should take this medicine so that you have three to four bowel movements per day.
(9) Simethicone - as needed for gas pain.
(10) Glargine - we have given you a prescription for glargine (insulin) which you do not need to start immediately.
If sugars are persistently > 300, can start glargine 6 units at night.
(10) You can stop the following medicines: simvastatin, aspirin, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D, milk thistle, flaxseed oil.
(10) There are several other medications that will be given you as part of hospice, including morphine for pain and benzodiazepines for shortness of breath.
