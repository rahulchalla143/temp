Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
The etiologies for her hypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications and critical AS.
Patient was given gental IV fluid boluses after being admitted to CCU.
Patient declined hemodialysis, also denied AVR or valvuloplasty, so after extensive discussions with patient's HCP (her son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 10166**]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.
She expired on [**2146-2-2**] in the setting of critical AS, hypotension and acute renal failure.
Patient declined hemodialysis, so she was made comfort measures only after all medical options to keep her alive failed.

She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a previous GI bleed.
Metoprolol was held given her hypotension.
