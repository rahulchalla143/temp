However, patient was bradycardic to 40s during bedside Echo and received 0.5 g atropine which increased his rate to the mid 60s transiently.
Also given 2L and put out about 1 L  The patient's intial hyperkalemia was treated with 2g of calcium gluconate for membrane stabilization, as well as 10U of insulin with concomittant D50 administration.
He was also given albuterol/ipatropium nebs which decreased his peak pressures and improved breath sounds.
Vanc/Zosyn were started for empiric antibiotic coverage.
A R femoral central line was placed due to his persistent hypotension- RIJ was not accessible.
Dopamine drip started and levophed weaned off.
Follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] [**Name (STitle) 50568**]:  [**2190**] -AVR replacement -Asc Aortic aneurysm -GERD   Social History: The patient lives with his wife Occupation: Retired pharmaceutical industry Mobility: unaided although does still walk with cicrumduction of his right leg Smoking: Ex-smoker quit 20 years ago previosu 20/day Alcohol: Rare Illicits: No   Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; Father - DM Sibs - 2 brothers - 1 died from sequelae of drig use, other brother well  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:36.9oC P:68  R:20  BP:141/64  SaO2:100% 40% O2 General: Intubbated, drowsy and agitated on awakening not following commands.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
2.Status post aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta graft placement for aneurysm repair, with no evidence of graft failure.
4.Low-lying ET tube extends only 1.1 cm above the carina, and should be retracted by at least 2 to 3 cm.
[**9-5**]: Carotid U/S: The study is somewhat limited due to the dressing for the right internal jugular line and the neck swelling.
Compared to the prior day's EEG, background activity is slightly slower, indicating slight worsening of cerebral function or additional medication effects.
No evidence of conduction system abnormalities  Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o male with PMHx of 5 v CABG, aortic valve replacement, and asc aortic aneurysm repair with CVA, was admitted to the CCU s/p "cardiac arrest" of unclear etiology.
The patient presented initially with unresponsiveness and with presumed conduction delays given his prolonged QRS and bradycardia.
ARDS, PE, Pneumonia, and aspiration were considered.
Patient was initially also started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were discontinued on subsequent days as he remained afebrile with normal urine and blood cultures and without any source of infection.
The patient received 0.5mg of atropine in the emergency department for bradycardia and was admitted to the cardiac care unit.
Patient was continued on pressors for better BP management.
Based upon presumption diagnosis of cardiac arrest, the cooling protocol was initiated and continuous EEG was started, revealing nonspecific slowing.
The patient's primary process was thought unlikely neurologic in origin given dramatic hemodynamic sequelae of the event and negative CT head along with nonspecific slowing  on EEG.
On [**9-8**] patient was weaned off sedation and weaned off pressors.
The patient was extubated as he was following commands and appeared to be neurologically intact although he was delirious.
He was started on PPI and ranitidine with no further episode of arrhythmias on telemetry.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as an outpatient for further evaluation and management of his CAD.
# Delirium: After coming off of sedation and being extubated patient was agitated and delirious.
Patient was seen by PT and OT who initially recommended rehab however after his quick recovery recommended sending patient home with services and with outpatient OT.
#DM: the patient received ISS while in house to good effect.
He was discharged on his home metformin and Glyburide.
#HLD: The patient's atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily.
# HTN: Patient was continued on his lisinopril.
