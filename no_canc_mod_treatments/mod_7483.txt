HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2138-12-24**], Mr. [**Known lastname 29201**] was admitted to the Operating Room where he [**Known lastname 1834**] a coronary artery bypass graft times four.
In summary, he had a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft, as well as saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal I and obtuse marginal II, as well as the posterior descending artery.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred, postoperatively, to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.
He arrived to the CSRU on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 mcg, and a propofol drip at 20 mcg.
This did not respond to two liters of lactated Ringer's and fluid boluses or raising his Neo-Synephrine drip to 2.5 mcg and weaning off his propofol.
At this time, he was given Hespan 500, to which his blood pressure responded well.
It went up to the 160's, and he was subsequently placed on low dose nitroglycerin.
For this, he was treated with four units of FFB, four units of packed red blood cells, and a six pack of platelets.
On postoperative day number one, he remained intubated and A-paced.
He was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.25 mcg and amiodarone drip at 0.5, a propofol drip at 30, and an insulin drip at 3.
He was also slowly weaned from his Neo-Synephrine and propofol, which were only restarted when, again, the decision was made to keep him intubated overnight.
He was, again, slowly weaned from the vent and slowly weaned from his Neo-Synephrine and propofol drips.
He was, subsequently, extubated, which he tolerated well, on postoperative day number two, and his Neo-Synephrine and propofol drips were weaned off.
He continued to be on an amiodarone drip at 0.5 mcg, and maintained sinus rhythm with occasional APC's.
Chest tube output also decreased significantly during postoperative day number two and, after chest x-ray, his chest tubes were removed.
