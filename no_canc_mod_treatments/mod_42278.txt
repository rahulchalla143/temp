HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This 79 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement and history of diverticulosis presents to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] with complaints of abdominal pain as well as nausea and vomiting.
She has a history of coronary artery disease status post stent placement during a [**2168**] catheterization.
She is status post second coronary artery bypass graft, the first performed in [**2162**]; the second a three vessel re-do performed in [**2170**].
She had an aortic valve replacement for bicuspid valve performed during that second coronary artery bypass graft.
Three to four plus mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
As mentioned, including the coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement.
She has a history of carotid stenosis status post a left carotid endarterectomy in [**2168**] and a right carotid endarterectomy in [**2162**].
Aorta-bifemoral bypass in [**2155**].
Lisinopril 5 q. day.
Toprol 12.5 q. day.
Lipitor 40 q. day.
Isordil 30.
Protonix 40 q. day.
ALLERGIES:   She has two sensitivities noted, including itch in response to morphine and epistaxis in response to aspirin.
for bowel rest and an nasogastric tube was put down.
She was followed by Green Surgery as well as the Gastrointestinal Service.
The most likely etiology of her high grade partial small bowel obstruction was assumed to be adhesions from prior abdominal surgeries.
She was given total parenteral nutrition for nutrition and was maintained with an nasogastric tube for decompression.
However, given her past cardiac history she was started on a heparin bolus and GTT.
A shock assessment with a Swan-Ganz was attempted while she was in the unit, but interpretation of the numbers was made difficult by her large mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**2-21**] and initially placed on Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin.
She was pan cultured and her PICC line was discontinued and the tips sent for culture.
Her heparin course was discontinued and she was placed on an ACE inhibitor.
Once the sensitivities returned on the enterococcus, she was maintained on Levaquin to cover her urinary tract infection as well as this question of possible pulmonary infiltrate seen on the chest x-ray.
From an Endocrine perspective, she had a cortisol stimulation in the Intensive Care Unit which showed adrenal insufficiency so she was put on a seven day replacement course of hydrocortisone and flutocortisone.
Aspirin was declined by the patient secondary to the side effect of epistaxis.
However, other cardiac medicines were titrated up in order to give her good blood pressure and rate control as well as to attempt mild diuresis to remove some of the fluid given in the unit.
Her beta blocker was restarted; her ACE inhibitor was increased gradually and spironolactone was added.
Also, a formal congestive heart failure consultation was called on the patient in order to optimize medication regimens as well as hook her into care upon discharge.
A KUB was ordered which was consistent with partial small bowel obstruction with scattered fluid levels but no free air.
She was on Levaquin still for her enterococcal urinary tract infection at the time of this white count jump, so clindamycin was added to broaden coverage.
No evidence of infection was found on these studies, however, over the next day or so, the patient began to have episodes of nausea, vomiting and increasing abdominal girth.
and intravenous fluids were restarted with the plan to drop an nasogastric tube if emesis persistent.
Antibiotics were discontinued on the 30th secondary to there being no evidence for active infection.
