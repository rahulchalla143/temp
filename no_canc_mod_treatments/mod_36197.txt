tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: 52 year old woman with hx of lupus nephritis, multiple sclerosis, hypertension who is presenting with altered mental status, fever, and shock.
Her lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10 mg daily and her lasix was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg daily.
A RIJ central line was placed after a failed attempt at the left IJ.
She received vancomycin and ceftriaxone at meningitic dosing.
She received decadon 10mg x1.
ET tube approximately 1 cm above the carina.
NG tube in appropriate position and IJ catheter within the cavoatrial junction.
Moderate pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, ascites, subcutaneous edema, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema are all consistent with volume overload.
Findings are suspicious for infectious colitis; however, this could also be seen with ischemic bowel as a result of prior hypoperfusion episode and/or ongoing vasculitis, given the history of SLE.
# Septic shock: [**2-27**] serratia bacteremia presumably from GI source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.
Shock requiring max dose 4 pressors on presentation and she was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia.
Also cardiogenic in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p treatment of sepsis).
Serratia was initially covered with cefepime which was then changed to ciprofloxacin given sensitivities as per ID recs.
She completed a full 2 week course of the above antibiotics with resolution of her shock and discontinuation of pressor support.
Of note, she also grew serratia from right leg deep tissue biopsy (performed by surgery on presentation), but suspect leg was seeded from blood as opposed to leg as source of bacteremia.
General surgery and dermatology were consulted and deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood.
CT right lower extremity was unrevealing for abscess and air was leg was presumably seeded from bacteremia as opposed to leg as source.
Aggressive wound care was performed daily.
Will need wound care per wound care recommendations.
She was started on caspofungin pending [**Female First Name (un) **] sensitivities and tunnelled, PICC and A-line were all discontinued.
Caspofungin was then changed to fluconazole as it was sensitive and she completed a 2 week course from date of first negative blood culture.
# RIJ/Rt brachial DVT:  Developed in the setting of right sided tunnelled line.
She was started on heparin gtt and tunnelled line was discontinued.
She was started on coumadin, and the heparin gtt until INR [**2-28**].
# Anemia/hct drop:  Has baseline anemia from underlying renal dz and renal failure however now with acute drop while on heparin gtt.
Prior to discharge, she had some frank blood from her tracheostomy, and heparin gtt was stopped.
Heparin was stopped for 2 days, and then restarted without incident.
given her prolonged intubation, she was trached and a PEG was placed by interventional pulmonology.
She tolerated this well, and at the time of discharge, she was on a tracheosty mask at 35% FiO2.
The tracheostomy tube was replaced with a shorter tube on the day of discharge.
She became oliguric on admisison requiring initiation of CVVH which she tolerated well and was transitioned to HD.
Stress dose steroids were initiated on presentation and hydrocortisone was subsequently titrated down to prednisone 10mg daily and she was discharged on cellcept 500mg qid.
HSV1 was cultured from lip ulcers and she was started on valtrex for a 14-21 day course.
Topical viscous lidocaine was used for pain control.
Her cellcept was held and her sepsis was treated and her WBC count and hct improved.
She was discharged on prednisone 10mg qdaily and cellcept [**Pager number **] qid.
# nutrition: A PEG tube was placed and she tolerated tube feeds.
She was started on an oral diet after a speech and swallow evaluation.
She had some discomfort surrounding her PEG tube and was evaluated several times by interventional pulmonology and no problems were found.
# hypertension: maintained with good blood pressure control on his current medications.
