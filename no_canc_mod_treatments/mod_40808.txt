She will  be discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily and potassium supplementation  # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient had acute renal failure on admission which was likely prerenal in the setting of what appeared to be septic shock with low UOP.
She was diuresed with lasix drip despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.
# Anemia, NOS:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.

Her home zyprexa and sertraline were continued.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation, controlled on oral diltiazem.
Her home digoxin was held in the setting of renal failure.
Patient and family decided not to anticoagulate given bleeding risks.
She was started on full dose aspirin, and her home plavix and high dose statin were continued.
We elected to defer this evaluation given her goals of care and quality of life to not limit thin liquids, but instead to discharge her with aspiration precautions.
Nutrition had also recommended tube feeds if there was not adequate intake, but the patient was eating well by the time of discharge and tube feeds were not felt to be needed at that time.
