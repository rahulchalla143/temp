Admission Date:  [**2193-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 20%), rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement in [**2186**], chronic atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), status post pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement for symptomatic bradycardia in [**2192-10-22**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on the day of admission for a cardiac catheterization in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation and elevation in cardiac enzymes (thought to be associated with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction).
At the [**Hospital1 **] Catheterization Laboratory the patient had a Taxus stent deployed to her left anterior descending artery lesion.
She had an episode of acute pulmonary edema prior to catheterization and was given intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous Lasix, and 4 mg of morphine with improvement in her oxygen saturations.
Status post mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement in [**2187-9-23**] (both mechanical CarboMedics valves).
Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
Automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator and dual-chamber pacemaker placed in [**2192-10-22**] for symptomatic bradycardia.
Baseline anemia (with a hematocrit in the 35 range).
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.
Digoxin 0.125 mg once per day.
Lisinopril 20 mg once per day.
Aspirin 325 mg once per day.
Tenormin 25 mg once per day.
Ursodiol 300 mg once per day.
Lasix as needed.
Imdur 60 mg once per day.
Lipitor 10 mg once per day.
Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.
Her cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-1**] showed a left-dominant system with left main coronary artery with a 40% lesion, a left anterior descending artery 80% lesion to the bifurcation of the diagonal, and a left circumflex lesion of 50% at the obtuse marginal with distal occlusion, the left posterior descending artery and right coronary artery with luminal irregularities, and a Taxus stent was placed in her left anterior descending artery lesion.
Her filling pressures with a right atrial pressure mean of 12, right ventricular pressure of 45 systolic and 5 diastolic, and a wedge pressure of 25, and a pulmonary artery diastolic of 25, cardiac output of 4.8, and an index of 3.04.
She was diuresed with as needed Lasix while in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with 20 mg to 40 mg intravenously.
Her wedge pressures, her pulmonary artery diastolics which were used as a circuit for a wedge pressure, decreased to between 15 and 18 prior to transition to the floor.
The patient was also on a nitroglycerin drip in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit which was transitioned to by mouth nitrate prior to her moving to the floor.
(b)  Ischemia:  The patient was status post a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and left anterior descending artery stent placement.
In addition, for ischemia, the patient was continued on her aspirin, Plavix, statin, and ACE inhibitor.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and is status post dual-chamber pacemaker with automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator.
She was placed on Toprol-XL prior to her discharge for rate control and also for her heart failure.
The patient was continued on her Coumadin, and this was dosed according to her mechanical valves.
She was placed on a heparin drip until she was therapeutic on her Coumadin (her goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5).
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient was given Mucomyst after her catheterization given her baseline renal insufficiency and her dye load during the procedure.
She was discharged on a dose of Lasix of 20 mg once per day given her high filling pressures and her cardiomyopathy.
NAUSEA ISSUES:  The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis.
Status post left anterior descending artery stent.
Mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement from rheumatic heart disease.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day  5.
Lisinopril 20 mg once per day.
Atorvastatin 10 mg once per day.
Isosorbide mononitrate 90 mg once per day.
Lasix 20 mg once per day.
Toprol 25 mg once per day.
Coumadin 2.5 mg once per day (to start on [**2-6**] and skip a dose on [**2-5**]).
