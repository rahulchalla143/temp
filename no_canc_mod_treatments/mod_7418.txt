The patient presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with three days of shortness of breath, pedal edema on [**2131-3-25**], and on electrocardiogram there, the patient was found to be in complete heart block with escape rhythm in the 30s.
Temporary pacemaker wires were placed on [**2131-3-25**], with 70% capture noted as per discharge summary.
The patient was noted to have four beat run of ventricular tachycardia prior to wire placement as well.
Given both pacing needs and history of ventricular tachycardia, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for pacer defibrillator placement.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] was called urgently for bedside wire evaluation with fluoroscopy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year old male with complete heart block and history of ventricular tachycardia transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with temporary pacing wires for permanent pacemaker/possible AICD placement.
The patient had initially been started on Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine for hypotension status post the intubation.
The patient went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a biventricular permanent pacemaker placed with no complications.
On [**2131-3-29**], the patient was weaned from the ventilator successfully being alert and in good spirits.
He had been placed on a Lasix drip prior to being extubated with a diuresis of 3.5 liters.
Catheter pacing wire was seen in the right ventricle and/or right atrium, left ventricle wall thickness normal, cavity was mildly dilated, several global left ventricular hypokinesis, no mass or thrombi seen in the left ventricle, right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, right ventricular systolic function appeared depressed, [**12-7**]+ mitral regurgitation, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient is a 73 year old male who presents with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with complete heart block, status post permanent pacemaker, also history of ventricular tachycardia, but the patient's family wanted him to be do not [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not resuscitate.
Rhythm - Complete heart block - He is status post permanent pacemaker placement with no events.
The patient was noted to have brief episodes of atrial fibrillation, however the decision was made not to initiate coumadin at this time due to risk of falling and anemia and the relatively short periods of time that the patient has been in atrial fibrillation.
The patient will be discharged on a dose of Lasix p.o.
Pulmonary - The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has received Atrovent nebulizers here and is on Singulair as well and uses a Combivent inhaler.
Infectious disease - The patient received Vancomycin peripacemaker wire adjustment and pacemaker placement.
Complete heart block, status post permanent pacemaker placement.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Porcine aortic valve replacement.
Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
Paxil 20 mg once daily.
Digoxin 0.125 mg once daily.
Zestril 2.5 mg p.o.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
Lasix 30 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution one drop O.U.
Latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution one drop O.U.
Singulair 10 mg p.o.
The patient should have blood urea nitrogen and creatinine as well as potassium monitored frequently and have his potassium repleted as needed given the diuretic usage.
