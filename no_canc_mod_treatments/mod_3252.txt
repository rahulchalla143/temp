Sleep apnea with BiPAP at night; 9.
Degenerative joint disease and chronic back pain, status post laminectomy; 11.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix, Prinivil, Diltiazem, Coumadin, Aspirin, Atenolol, Flecainide, Trazodone, Valium, Effexor, Duragesic, Neurontin, Ambien, Glipizide, Combivent, Bactrim, Claritin, Tylenol #3, Actos, Colace, Glyburide, Glargine, Imuran, Folate, Prednisone, Vioxx and Protonix.
Chemistries, sodium 141, potassium 6.0 which was hemolyzed and falsely elevated the potassium value, chloride 97, bicarbonate 36, BUN 66, creatinine 1.2, glucose 253.
She was provided with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, however, she continued to desaturate and was subsequently transferred to the MICU.
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient started to vomit bright red blood and continued to desaturate on a nonrebreather.
The patient was successfully intubated and arterial blood gases showed pH of 7.32/34/32.
Her systolic blood pressure dropped to 60 and her heartrate then increased to 120.
A central line was placed.
She was provided with 2 units of packed red blood cells and two additional units of fresh frozen plasma were hung.
She was transfused 7 units of packed red blood cells and given a further 6 units of fresh frozen plasma.
Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which found prepyloric ulcers but no source of active bleeding.
Hemostasis was achieved following epinephrine injection.
She was started on Vancomycin following gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain and blood cultures.
Sputum cultures subsequently grew out Pseudomonas and Ceftazidime was added.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Floor on [**2149-11-12**] for further management.
She was continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d.
with hematocrit checks, anticoagulation was avoided secondary to the risk of recurrent bleed.
Follow up esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was performed.
She was not a candidate for anticoagulation given her recent gastrointestinal bleeds.
Her atrial fibrillation was managed with rate control agents while in the MICU.
On the Medical Floor she was restarted on Atenolol and did not demonstrate any episodes of rapid ventricular rate.
Electrophysiology Service had seen the patient and determined that she was not a good candidate for cardioversion given that it was unknown how long the patient had been in and out of sinus rhythm as well as the inability to anticoagulate her.
The patient is also not a candidate for Amiodarone, given her pulmonary disease.
She was started on Flecainide in order to suppress her atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary - The patient has a history of inclusion body myositis requiring intubation in the past and also has a history of baseline carbon dioxide retention.
She was continued on BiPAP at night given her history of sleep apnea and was also continued on p.o.
steroid doses as well as Albuterol treatments.
Ceftazidime was continued for Pseudomonas pneumonia for a planned 10 day course.
Endocrine - The patient has Type 2 diabetes, blood sugars were monitored four times per day, regular insulin sliding scale was used as needed.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed requiring total of 23 units of packed red blood cells and 18 units of fresh frozen plasma.
