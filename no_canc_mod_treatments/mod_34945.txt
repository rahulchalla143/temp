Admission Date:  [**2108-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-6-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cozaar / Nitroglycerin / Primidone / Zestril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: gangrenous left heel and right heel/great toe ischemia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access;contralateral second-order catheter placement with bilateralextremity runoff & abdominal aortogram.
([**2108-12-6**]) 2.Right lower extremity bypass graft with nonreversed saphenous vein graft.
([**2108-12-12**])   History of Present Illness: HPI: 65 M h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2085**], CHF (EF ~20%), DM2, ESRD on HD (?
h/o [**Year (4 digits) 2091**] with urosepsis, on since [**10-18**]), admitted [**12-6**] for bilateral foot gangrene s/p b/l femoral bypass on [**12-11**] (right leg) and [**2107-12-13**] (left leg) transferred from vascular service for syncope in setting of V fib.
Of note, the prior evening, patient developed hypotension with sys bp in 60's of unknown etiology and was started on phenylephrine gtt with improvement in BP.
Per surgical service, this was in the setting of slow VT, though it is unclear whether slow VT was the sole cause of hypotension (ddx includes sepsis, bleeding, adrenal insufficiency POD#1).
He was being treated with cipro/flagyl/vanco empirically.
He was also started on hemodialysis for unclear reasons (?allergic reaction to [**Last Name (un) **]).
Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
65 M with MMP including CAD s/p MI, CHF(EF 20% s/p BiV/AICD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, Type II DM, ESRD on HD, admitted for gangrenous heels [**1-12**] PVD s/p femoral bypass with course complicated by syncopal episode and V-fibrillation s/p AICD cardioversion.
# Bilateral femoral bypass: Underwent surgery on [**12-11**] and [**12-12**] for right and left femoral bypass.
Initially started on neosynephrine drip.
Although he initially had a low cardiac index, this was thought to be consistent with CHF with EF of 20%, and unlikley to be due to cardiogenic shock.
He did not respond to a 1L fluid bolus so a levophed drip was started to provide pressor support with some inotropy.
Patient continued to require pressure support for the remainder of his course in the intesnive care unit.
Pancultures were sent and antibiotic coverage was advanced to vancomycin and zosyn.
ACE and beta blocker held in setting of hypotension.
# Rhythm: Hx of atrial fibrillation on coumadin since [**2105**].
EP was consulted, recommending to d/c amiodarone given polymorphic VT in the setting of a prolonged QT interval 450-500, start lidocaine gtt and aggressive repletion of electrolytes.
Patient was started on mexilitine.
As team was unable to convert rhythm, prognosis was poor, he was unstable and requiring increasing pressure support and patient was in distress from persistent shocks, team had discussion with health care proxy and decision was made to change goals of care to comfort measures only.
Pressors were discontinued and patient expired soon afterward.
No evidence of frank pulmonary edema, hypotensive requiring pressors with CI 1.8->2.1, likely secondary to class III heart failure with EF of 20%.
Therefore CHF regimen held.
# PVD: s/p bilateral bypass surgery.
# ESRD: etiology of [**Name (NI) 2091**] unclear(started HD [**10-18**]), s/p ultrafiltration [**2108-12-13**], ?stopped prematurely secondary to syncope and hypotension.
# DM: insulin dependent, x 12 years.
# hyperlipidemia: - continue statin .
