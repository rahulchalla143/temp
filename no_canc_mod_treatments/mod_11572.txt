HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with coronary artery disease, status post recent catheterization in [**2-21**] with critical AS, atrial fibrillation, GERD who presented on [**2117-4-21**] to an outside hospital with increased shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, and cough with bloody sputum.
The patient was given 1 dose of ceftriaxone and 5-day course of azithromycin plus a 14-day course of levofloxacin.
White blood count was [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was started on empiric Flagyl.
The patient states he is taking all medications at home.
The patient was placed on nonrebreather with O2 saturations 99 percent.
The patient was given 600 cc bolus of normal saline without effect and was subsequently started on dopamine and blood pressure improved to 110/60.
A left IJ was placed at the outside hospital, and the patient was also given a dose of Lasix 40 mg x 1, vancomycin 1 g x 1, and imipenem 500 mg.
The patient was given 5 liters of IV fluid.
The patient was given 500 mg of levofloxacin and 500 mg of Flagyl.
The patient was given 2 units of packed red blood cells, A line was placed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post catheterization in [**6-22**] with stent in the right coronary artery with brachytherapy.
Status post recatheterization in [**3-23**] with re-stent of right coronary artery with a Cypher stent.
Question of COPD with bronchospasm, recently on a steroid taper.
NPH 6 units in the morning and 5 units at night with    Humulin insulin sliding scale while on steroid taper.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
Coumadin 2 mg q.d.
Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d.
Singulair 10 mg q.d.
Nitro patch 0.6 mg q.12 hours.
Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
Protonix 40 mg q.d.
Allopurinol 75 mg q.d.
Plavix 75 mg q.d.
Simvastatin 20 mg q.d.
Cardizem 120 mg q.d.
Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d.
Prednisone 20 mg on a taper.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, given IV fluids, given 4 mg of dexamethasone in the setting of recent steroid use.
During hospital course, the patient was started on vancomycin, Zosyn, and given a 5-day course of azithromycin.
The patient subsequently developed a drug reaction rash to the Zosyn and was started on imipenem.
The patient received a 5-day course of azithromycin, 10-day course of vancomycin, and 10-day course of imipenem.
The patient continued to spike temperatures.
The patient was given fluconazole for evidence of yeast in the urine as well as sputum.
This was the only organism that was evident in moderate growth; however, this was thought to be secondary to re-colonization after use of broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient was ultimately started on caspofungin and received 3 days of caspofungin.
During this course, the patient underwent Swan-Ganz catheter placement to determine overall fluid status.
Therefore, fluid boluses were used to maintain blood pressure.
The patient was initiated on dopamine and subsequently Levophed in the Emergency Department.
However, during the hospital course, the patient was transitioned from these pressors over to dobutamine and vasopressin with improvements in mixed venous saturations.
However, given the patient's functional status thought to be less likely, again, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient was placed on the ARDSNet protocol for ventilation with lung protective strategies.
The patient remained stable on the ventilator without significant issues in oxygenation.
For this, ventilator settings were adjusted.
The nonanion gap metabolic acidosis was subsequently thought to be due to renal failure as well as aggressive saline infusion.
Lactated Ringers was used for further volume resuscitation.
IV fluids were used to maintain central venous pressures.
The patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30 and the patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix especially in the setting of recent stent.
The patient's Coumadin was withheld and initiated on heparin.
The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate despite aggressive measures.
The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, given aggressive fluid resuscitation as needed.
For that, the patient was started on caspofungin.
