GI consulted, felt likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear; would EGD only if continued hematemesis and BP more stable.
BP wise, brought down to goal ~190 with labetalol gtt.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY - Hypertension, difficult to control per PCP; baseline reportedly 170s - Congestive heart failure, EF unknown - Borderline DM2 - Chronic kidney disease stage IV (baseline Cre 1.6-1.8) - Osteoarthritis s/p L THR - Dementia - Hypothyroidism, recently started on levothyroxine (last month)    Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 2558**].
Confluent hypodensities within the periventricular white matter likely represent chronic microvascular ischemia.
A right scleral band is seen around the right globe.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
Nasogastric tube is in place, tip in the gastric body.
Evaluation of the deep pelvic structures is limited by streak artifact from bilateral hip replacements.
IMPRESSION: hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle  Chest X-ray, PA and Laterl [**2152-7-2**]: The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with COPD.
Superior and anterior subluxation of humeral head with respect to glenoid, but no frank dislocation.
Compared to the previous tracing no major change.Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 128 0.86 312/431 0 -9 -155   Brief Hospital Course: HYPERTENSION, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ms. [**Known lastname 96278**] was initially admitted to the MICU after coming from the ED on a labetolol drip for her hypertension.
Neurology ultimately felt her presentation was consistent with transient worsening of her dementia from relative hypotension/hypoperfusion in the setting of aggressive blood pressure reduction.
Two days after being called out to the floor from the MICU, her blood pressure began to increase and she was restarted on lisinopril 40mg, HCTZ 25m, with PRN hydralazine.
She did not respond to IV metoprolol, and as pacer pads were being placed she developed ventricular fibrillation.
She became pulseless for which chest compressions were initiated and the patient was given 1 shock.
A right femoral central line placed, heparin bolus and gtt initiated for a STEMI.
She was transferred to the CCU conversant and, on [**7-3**], was started on 20 mg LISINOPRIL, 25 mg METOPROLOL [**Hospital1 **], and NORVASC 5 mg daily for a low SBP goal of 160 based on the patient's longstanding hypertension in the 170's.
Her IV heparin was discontinued, and SC heparin started due to the risk of bleeding.
She was started on ASA, continued on beta blocker, ACEI and high dose statin.
She was continued on these medications throughout the hospitalization.
GIbIIa inhibitor was not started due to concern for acute bleeding.
She was difficult to controll with IV beta blockade and responded transiently to cardizem IV.
She was started on cardizem PO 60mg qid, with marginal control of HR (90s - 100s) with frequent reversions to fibrillation.
On [**7-5**], patient was started on amoiodarone loading dose of 400mg QD.
She has a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding atrial fibrillation control and suspected tachy-brady syndrome.
She was started on coumadin 2mg PO daily on [**2152-7-5**], which was increased subsequently to 4mg PO daily on [**2152-7-6**].
She should have her INR measured daily and warfarin dosing adjusted to goal of INR 2 - 3.
Her urine cultures, C.diff and legionella were negative.
She was afebrile throughout and was never on antibiotics while in-house.
She was placed on PO protonix.
She did test positive for H.Pylori by EIA, but was not treated due to no signs of acute bleeding and the risks associated with long term antibiotic treatment in a geriatric patient.
She should be reevaluated with serial abdominal exams for follow up.
She was treated by physical therapy and acetaminophen around the clock.
Patient will require renal dosing of medications.
Ophthalmology thought the scleral buckle was secondary to prior repair of retinal detachment.
CODE STATUS, COMMUNICATION: The patient is a poor candidate for invasive procedures given her age and baseline dementia.
Patient is on coumadin and will require daily measurements of PT/INR and adjustment of her coumadin dose to achieve goal INR of 2 - 3.
Patient was started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She should be continued on this medication at a dose of 400mg daily for another 10 days, then on 200mg daily for another 14 days, followed by maintenance dose.
She is on metoprolol and lisinopril.

You were treated for all these complications and required intensive care unit management.
Your arrhythmias were finally controlled with medications (see medication list below).
Finally, because of your arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) you were started on a medication (coumadin) to help prevent a stroke.
