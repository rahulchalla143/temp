Admission Date:  [**2120-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-5-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Non-verbal, right hemiparesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Intubation, mechanical ventilation s/p Ventricular drain placement Arterial line, central venous catheter, PICC placement  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 63 year old man with a hx of HTN, DM, and COPD who went to work as usual today and was last seen normal around 7:00AM.
He was intubated for airway protection and is now sedated in the ER.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and felt that no surgical intervention was indicated at this point.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: T afebrile BP158/80 HR50's  RR14-18 O2 Sat 100% Gen: Intubated, +spontaneous movement of the left arm and leg HEENT:  NC/AT, no icterus or injection, ET and OG tubes in place.
Blood pressure was controlled with labetalol to try and minimize further hemorrhage.
He was started on mannitol and a ventricular drain was placed by neurosurgery on [**2120-6-15**] given high likelihood of developing hydrocephalus.
Drain was removed on [**2120-6-21**], mannitol discontinued a few days prior.
After several days in the ICU, he became intermittently agitated and was restarted on propofol.
Multipodus boots were started, as was range of motion exercises of his right hand to prevent flexion contractures once tone began ot increase.
It showed unusual enhancement of basal cisterns and area just lateral to bleed, which per neuroradiology could represent effect of blood vs infection- advised sending CSF.
However, with aggressive pulmonary toilet, this improved and he was weaned to nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular: Pt was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial EKGs and enzymes.
He was weaned form labetalol to captopril and metoprolol for blood pressure control.
He was on ancef prophylactically while drain was in place.
On [**6-23**], patient was less alert than in the several days prior, lungs had increased crackles, and sputum had Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain so he was started empirically on levofloxacin and vancomycin as fevers to 102 persisted, WBC count remained at 14, and it was felt his decreased alertness was likely due to fever and infection.
Lumbar puncture was done, and CSF was xanthochromic with 300 WBC (69%N, 4%L, 27%M), 166 RBC, protein 150, glucose 53.
Therefore, levofloxacin was discontinued, he was started on ceftraixone 2gm, and vancomycin was continued as CSF was consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis, especially as he was s/p ventricular drain.
FEN: While intubated pt was given tube feeds to maintain adequate nutrition.
After extubation, he was sleepy and inattentive, most likely due to infection, so tube feeds were continued.
All medications were stopped and morphine and ativan given for comfort as needed.
Antihypertensives and insulin sliding scale were restarted.
SC heparin was restarted for DVT prophylaxis.
Speech and swallow evaluation was performed and patient was started on nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
