After failing medical therapy alone he underwent PVI at our center in [**2158-4-25**] and was started on amiodarone maintenance.

Today, patient underwent successful PVI, however with induced left atrial tachycardia patient went into persistant atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion and ibutilide.

RHYTHM: symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2151**], status post pulmonary vein isolation in [**2158-4-25**], underwent re-do pulmonary vein isolation for recurrent PAF.
The vein was isolated, but shocked into left atrial tachycardia with persistant atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion and ibutilide.
Patient returned to sinus brady after 200J cardioversion in the PACU.
