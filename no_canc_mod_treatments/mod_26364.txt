US performed @ OSH showed 7cm fluid collection in the right mid thigh, for which he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn ([**2182-12-26**]).
Vancomycin was discontinued and levofloxacin switched to cipro on [**12-31**].
The patient decompensated early am on the day of transfer with sats in the mid 80s, requiring Dopamine gtt to maintain MAP > 65.
The patient was initially transferred to SICU on [**1-2**] for further diuresis, continuation of Dopamine gtt, and commencement of BiPap.
In the CCU, the pt had worsening SOB, hypoxia, hypercapnia that was not responding to diuresis so he was tried on bipap and then intubated.
CCU team gave pt 80 IV lasix today x1 for diuresis.

After he had recovered from his infectious insult he was slowly diuresed with a lasix gtt maintaining goal diuresis of negative 500 to 1000cc/day.
On [**2183-1-20**], he was doing well from a respiratory perspective, breathing on PS with 5/5.
ABG demonstrated good ventilation and oxygenation and the pt was extubated.
He was evaluated by the interventional pulmonary team and received a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement on [**2183-1-21**].
He was transferred to rehabiliation facility for further weaning and potential tracheostomy removal after improvement in his diaphragmatic function and further diuresis.
Differential diagnosis includes: peripheral neuropathy affecting the phrenic nerve (diabetes, CIDP, vasculitis, connective tissue disease given + [**Doctor First Name **], possibly motor neuron disease) vs. prior injury during CABG in [**7-29**] (can be injured during cooling) vs. spinal cord injury (C 3,4, 5), less likely given his arms are strong and nutritional deficits causing injury to nerves.
The neurology service recommended supportive care at this moment with investigation into treatment later on after recovery from his acute insults (PNA, CHF, Pulm HTN).
They recommended an EMG/NCS to help diagnose a neuropathy, and if the results demonstrate a demyelinating disorder then he may benefit from treatment with IVIG.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were initiated on [**12-26**].
Vancomycin was discontinued and levofloxacin was switched to cipro on [**12-31**]; flagyl was continued.
Although the patient was afebrile and had a normal WBC count since admission, broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued given concern for early sepsis in light of low SVR measured with the swan-ganz catheter and repeated episodes of hypotension.
Both PICC lines and Swann Ganz catheters were removed and tips were cultured, and showed no sinigicant growth to date.
The pt completed a two week course of antibiotics without further complication.
All of his antibiotics were discontinued on [**1-20**], [**2182**] and he remained afebrile without significant concern for further infection.
Diuresis also did not improve heart function as measured by persistent hypotension and requirement for pressor support.
The patient arrived at the CCU on dopamine gtt, then was switched to neosynepherine and finally levophed; attempts to wean were unsuccessful.
He was started on a lasix gtt with good urine output (>100cc/hour) and after several days was transitioned to lasix IV bolus [**Hospital1 **]-TID with good diuresis.
Until then, he should have routine electrolytes monitored to better assess his renal function and his body weight as well as daily ins and outs should be monitored to verify appropriate diuresis.
He was continued on ASA/plavix/statin which he was on as an outpatient.
His plavix was disontinued one week prior to his Trach/PEG placement after consultation with his vascular surgeon Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**].
He should be continued on his ASA and statin.
A decision re: re-initiation of plavix should be made in consultation with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**] and vascular surgeon as an outpt.
Cardiac Rhythm: The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] with a pre-existing diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which was controlled at home with digoxin and sotalol.
The patient was also on chronic anticoagulation at home with coumadin with a goal INR of [**12-27**].
Digoxin was discontinued upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] given a lack of evidence for significant LV pump dysfunction.
The sotalol was therefore maintained during this admission.
However with an episode of GIB, the anticoagulation was discontinued all together.
Decision re: re-initiation of his anticoagulation should be made as an outpt after consultation with his PCP and cardiologist.
Primary Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient was initially trasnferred to the CCU for indication of fluid overload and respiratory distress with intention to perform pulmonary artery catheterization to investigate etiology of patient's symptoms.
On admission the patient was maintained on non-invasive ventilation as he was noted to become increasingly hypercarbic, hypoxic and acidemic when off BiPap.
Once relatively stabilized from a respiratory status, the patient underwent placement of a Swann Ganz catheter which was remarkable for severe pulmonary hypertension: RA 15-20 mmHg (A wave); RV 75/7; PA 75/24, with relatively low PCWP suggesting that the patient's right heart failure on admission was secondary to a primary pulmonary process rather than secondary to left heart failure.
Prior to admission to the CCU the patient has been undergoing aggressive diuresis given evidence of decompensated CHF.
However, given the PA cath results it became evident that the patient was actually relatively [**Name2 (NI) 66438**] the LA/LV which was likely contributing to the patient's hypotension and pressor requirements.
Given this, the patient was aggressively repleted with KCl to correct the underlying metabolic alkalosis.
The pulmonary consult team suggested inhaled nitric oxide as an initial empiric treatment for suspected pulm HTN.
The patient initially tolerated this treatment well, with peripheral BP remaining stable or increasing.
PAP improved slightly with sildenafil rx, but the PA catheter was removed on [**1-5**] due to concern for a line infection.
After completion of his antibiotic course as above, his septic physiology resolved and he slowly regained appropriate BP and hemodynamics.
Howevever as he is currently hemodynamically stable with good diuresis, decision to start either CCB, prostacyclins or inhaled NO for management of his pumonary HTN was deferred until further discussion with his PCP and pulmonologist.
GIB: The pt was maintained on anticoagulation as noted above for his atrial fibrillation during most of his hospital stay.
Since that one episode, the pt was also found to have some coffee ground from his OG tube after re-placement of his ETT tube on [**1-20**]'[**82**].
A decision re: re-initiation of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation should be made after discussion with his PCP and cardiologist as an outpt.
He had a R fem-peroneal bypass operation in [**9-28**].
Vascular service has managed wound dressing changes thoughout the hospital course and plans to place a vac dressing once the immediate issues have resolved.
Most currently, the vascular service has recommended wet to dry dressing changes on the right calf wound.
During this admission, the patient has shown acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis and potentially impaired perfusion given hypotension.
Mucomyst and hydration have been given prior to any administration of contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Endocrine: The patient has DM, which has been managed with an insulin sliding scale throughout his hospital course.
Sugars have been kept under good control with 8units of NPH [**Hospital1 **] in addition to RISS.
FEN:  After the patient was intubated, tube feeds were given through an NG tube.
He received a tracheostomy as well as a PEG tube placement on [**2183-1-21**] without complications.
The TF were given through the PEG tube and the pt was subsequently evaluated by Speech and Swallow for ability to take POs.
PPx: The pt was maintained on DVT ppx with either a heparin gtt or heparin sub Q TID (After the episode of GIB, the gtt was stopped as above).
In addition, the pt also recieved GI ppx with PPI and bowel regimen.
