Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: This is a 47 yo M with history of DM, CAD/MI, PE on coumadin, presenting with scrotal abscess and fever admitted to the ICU after drainage of his abscess then downgraded to floor for discharge pending improvement in scrotal swelling.
Active Problems:  1) Sepsis from scrotal abscess: Patient presented with septic physiology that improved in the setting of receiving broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam) and and having abscess drained by urology.
As of his second hospital day the patient began to manifest considerable improvement in his septic physiology in the context of antibiotic treatment.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Levo/Flagyl and the patient's symptoms markedly improved prior to discharge.
This raised concern of acute PE (though he was supratherapeutic on coumadin at presentation).
Over the course of hospitalization this improved with adequate pain control and resolution of fever.
4)  History of pulmonary embolism: Given INR of 12 at presentation and surgery his coumadin was held until INR hit 2.5 at which time it was restarted at half dose (5 mg per day).
At time of discharge INR was 1.2 and the patient was bridged with Lovenox with instructions to f/u his INR with PCP.
Insulin teaching was done and the patient was also sent home with instruction to use insulin to supplement his oral agents.
His aspirin was continued throughout the hospitalization.
8) Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on his home simvastatin  9) Hypertension: His lisinopril, Metoprolol, and furosemide were all initially held given hypotension but then restarted without incident once the patient's hemodynamic status had stabilized.

You were given antibiotics and your condition improved.
After correction your INR went too low, so you are now on coumadin and a medication called lovenox (enoxaparin) to keep your blood thin while your coumadin levels rise to appropriate levels.
You were evaluated by a diabetes specialist and started on injectable insulin.
During your hospital stay, we made the following changes to your medications:  DIABETES - STOPPED Glyburide, and STARTED Glipizide XL - STOPPED Metoformin, and STARTED Metformin XR - STARTED injectable insulin (lantus)  INFECTION - STARTED Flagyl and Levofloxacin, to be continued for a total of 2 weeks  BLOOD THINNING - STARTED Enoxaparin - DECREASED Coumadin  BREATHING - STARTED albuterol / ipratropium nebulizers  HEART - INCREASED Toprol (metoprolol)  Followup Instructions: PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:Thursday, [**8-9**] at 10:45am With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],MD Location: [**Hospital 17457**] MEDICAL Address: 100 [**Doctor Last Name **] CENTER STE 126Q, [**Hospital1 420**],[**Numeric Identifier 15489**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 17458**]  Urology Appointment:Wednesday,[**8-15**] at 3pm Name: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] K.
