Approximately 2 hours following the procedure she developed sudden onset right sided weakness and numbness.
Neuro exam was pertinent for right sided numbness, weakness and right hemianopsia.
CTA did not seem to show a definite clot in left main stem MCA but on coronal section decreased flow in M3 and M4 on left side.
In terms of her atrial fibrillation, she was referred for the procedure because she failed propafenone and sotalol.
She was last cardioverted in [**Month (only) 1096**] while on Sotalol 80 [**Hospital1 **] and reverted back to atrial fibrillation within minutes of getting shocked.
Prior to her procedure she had taken subcutaneous Lovenox after stopping warfarin.
In addition, a TEE performed just prior to her procedure showed no evidence of left atrial clot.
She also received therapeutic IV heparin throughout the period of left atrial access during her atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.
She has no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

# Atrial fibrillation  Refractory to multiple medications and cardioversions.
s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation which did not keep patient in SR. She developed atrial fibrillation three times throughout hospitalization requiring several doses of IV metroprolol and diltiazem.
Propafenone was started and titrated up to 225mg TID, which appeared to effectively suppress her atrial fibrillation.
At discharge she was in SR on propafenone and diltiazem.
She was scheduled a exercise stress test to assess her heart rate response on propafenone and diltiazem.
She was sent home on enoxaparin bridge while awaiting therapeutic INR on warfarin.
# HTN  Stable on regimen of diltiazem, lisinopril and furosemide.
