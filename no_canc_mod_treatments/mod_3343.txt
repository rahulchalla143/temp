Admission Date:  [**2174-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2174-3-26**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 19013**] is an 80 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypothyroidism, and metastatic breast cancer who presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**3-11**], with complaint of transient ischemic attack type symptoms, slurred speech, facial droop, lower extremity tingling and numbness times one to two weeks.
On admission here, she was found to have bilateral compartment syndrome and subsequently underwent bilateral fasciotomy on [**3-17**].
Her postoperative course was complicated by intubation for respiratory distress from fluid overload.
She subsequently had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a super-therapeutic PTT while on heparin for presumed deep vein thrombosis.
This resulted in hypotension requiring temporary pressors as well as acute renal failure secondary to ATN.
She was started on hemodialysis on [**3-23**].
Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy for goiter in remote past.
Breast cancer diagnosed in [**2171-4-16**], metastatic to bone, including rib, spine and pelvis.
Status post Tamoxifen, XRT and chemotherapy in the past; last treatment in [**2172-9-16**].
The patient also underwent left lumpectomy in [**2171-6-16**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer to the Floor, vital signs with temperature of 97.4 F.; heart rate 70; blood pressure 160/70; respirations 18; 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Calcium 7.5, phosphorus 7.0, magnesium 2.1.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   An 80 year old female who presented with rhabdomyolysis to an outside hospital and transferred here with bilateral compartment syndrome, status post bilateral fasciotomies.
She was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the Floor on nasal cannula.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of super-therapeutic PTT while on heparin.
She was started on heparin because deep vein thromboses could not be ruled out and were on the differential for etiologies for her compartment syndrome.
Her gastrointestinal bleed resulted in hypotension requiring pressors temporarily.
She began hemodialysis on [**3-23**].
At the time of dictation, she has undergone three hemodialysis sessions with removal of four kilograms of fluid each time.
She will continue to undergo hemodialysis and the Renal Consultation Team feels that she will likely recover her renal function.
After her episode of hypotension requiring pressors had resolved, she was restarted on her anti-hypertensive regimen, which included Lopressor, Isordil and Diltiazem.
Infectious Disease:  Per Surgery recommendations, the patient was started on Cefazolin intravenously after her surgery.
Endocrine:  Known diabetic; continued on Regular insulin sliding scale.
She will likely need her NPH regimen to be added back as her p.o.
She was restarted on her Synthroid, which she had stopped taking at home.
