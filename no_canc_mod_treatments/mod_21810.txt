Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan (ICU Course): 57M history of ESRD started HD  on [**2141-7-31**], CAD s/p MI 3 years prior, DM2, HTN, HL who presented with syncope on [**2141-7-29**] admitted for observation in the setting of ESRD/initiation of HD with hospital course complicated by "unresponsiveness" episode on [**7-31**] with spontaneous resolution concerning for dialysis disequilibrium syndrome vs vasovagal syncope.
# Unresponsive episode Patient had "unresponsiveness" episode during dialysis with no loss of pulse or respirations.
Serial ECG did not suggest ischemia although troponin continues to be elevated in the setting of his ESRD.
Patient received second session of hemodialysis at bedside in ICU and remained asymptomatic with no events or hemodynamic instability during session.
The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital stay with no malignant rhythms noted  #ESRD: BUN/Cr elevated compared to 2 weeks prior, likely in the setting of aggressive diuresis with torsemide/metolazone.
He received two episodes of hemodialysis at time of MICU call out with the assistance of a renal consultation.
His chemistries were trended daily, and adjustments to his medications were made such as discontinuing his torsemide, adding Nephrocaps, increasing sevelamer carbonate, and continuing calcitriol.
#CAD: s/p MI 3 years prior, not on any cardiac medications for unclear reason.
The patient was started aspirin 81mg QD for prophylaxis.
A statin was not initiated given that the patient complains of proximal muscle cramping in the setting of an elevated CK.
The patient was continued on home doses of amlodipine and enalapril for this chronic issue.
Transitional Issues: -Adding a statin should be readdressed as an outpatient once the patient's CK and proximal muscle cramping resolves -Consideration may be made as an outpatient as to starting a beta blocker  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
