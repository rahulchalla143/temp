Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using placement of drug-eluting stent(s).
We planned to treat this total occlusion with PTCA/stenting and heparin was started prophylactically.
A 6Fr long sheath was exchanged in for right femoral access and a [**Doctor Last Name **] 3 guide provided good support for the procedure.
A Prowater wire was used to cross the mid LAD total occlusion with minimal difficulty.
We then post-dilated the distal overlapping stent with an NC Quantum Maverick OTW 2.75x15mm balloon (max 21atm, 10sec) and the proximal overlapping stent with an NC Quantum Maverick 3.0x15mm balloon (max 22atm, 10sec).
