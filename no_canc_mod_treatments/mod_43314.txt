POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2111-9-16**]):       TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.
Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old male who is s/p orthotropic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**Month (only) 205**] [**2108**] for alcoholic cirrhosis, history of colon cancer s/p colectomy, on rapamune who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and SIRS from L sided pneumonia.
Treated for HAP with Vanc, Meropenem, Azithro given frequent hospitalizations and penicillin allergy.
He received 5 days of azithromycin and 8 days of meropenem/vancomycin for HCAP.
Antibiotics were stopped on [**9-13**].
After intubation sats failed to improve so he underwent semi-urgent bronchoscopy revealing significant mucus plugging as well as an aspirated tablet.
After removal of mucous plugs and the tablet he improved and was rapidly weaned to fairly minimal ventilator settings.
Due to his previous failure, poor nutritional status, and great weakness decision was made that he would be unlikely to clear secretions adequately and to pursue tracheostomy for better pulmonary rehab and clearance of secretions.
2) Sepsis: Patient was meeting criteria for sepsis on admission with leukocytosis and tachypnea and also had hypotension requiring norepinephrine for blood pressure support later in his course.
With treatment of pneumonia as explained above his pressures improved and he had been off pressors >72 hrs at time of discharge.
3) End stage liver disease s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1326**]: The patient has a liver [**Year (4 digits) **] and is on sirolimus chronically for immune suppression.
4) Acute Kidney Injury:The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with most recent baselines around 1.5.
Briefly rose to 1.9 during this hospitalization but trended back down to 1.2 prior to discharge with good supportive care.
He was maintained on tube feeds throughout his hospitalization.
After tracheostomy PEG was discussed but not desired by hepatology due to infection risk.
He had some intolerance of tube feeds and high residuals for which he was started on metoclopramide and rate was lowered with a more dense formula with improvement.
He will need transition to a softer dobhoff feeding tube once final decision regarding tube feed strength and rate is made.
These were stopped during his intubation as he was having no bowel movements.
At time of discharge given recent trouble with high residuals both these medications were being held.
This was being treated with small doses of PO hydromorphone with reasonable effect.
His outpatient amitryptyline was also continued.
9) Depression: He was continued on him home mirtazapine and amitryptyline in the hospital.
He remained on heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

You required mechanical ventilation to help with your breathing, and ultimately had a tracheostomy tube placed.
You were given antibiotics to treat a presumed pneumonia.
You were continued on your anti-rejection medications, for your liver [**Hospital1 **].
You were started on tube feeding for nutritional support, but it was unclear if you were digesting much of it, as your nurses were suctioning high levels of tube feeds back up through your feeding tube.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Discontinued cefpodoxime, an antibiotic you were taking before your admission - Discontinued cholestyramine, loperamide and tincture of opium, because your diarrhea improved and these can worsen your digestion of your tube feeds - Discontinued prochlorperazine (Compazine) because it can interact with METOCLOPRAMIDE, which we started at 5 mg with meals and at bedtime, to help you digest your tube feeds - Decreased your dose of SIROLIMUS to 1 mg daily, to keep it at the appropriate levels - Started HEPARIN injections, 5,000 units subcutaneously, three times daily, to prevent blood clots - Started NYSTATIN oral suspension, taken orally four times daily AS NEEDED for thrush - Started SENNA, one tab taken orally twice daily AS NEEDED for constipation - Started LIDOCAINE patch 5% adhesive patch applied topically for 12 hours at a time, followed by 12 hours off, as needed for back pain - Started PANTOPRAZOLE 40 mg tablets, taken orally once daily - Started MEROPENEM, an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia.
You will receive 500 mg through the IV every eight hours, through [**2111-10-3**] - Started ALBUTEROL nebulizers, one nebulizer treatment every four hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Started IPRATROPIUM nebulizers, one nebulizer treatment every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Started Heparin Flush (10 units/ml) 2 mL IV PRN line flush, this is for your PICC line maintenance  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Hospital 1389**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2111-11-4**] 1:20  You may hear from the [**Month/Day/Year **] center in the next week or two to discuss scheduling an earlier appointment.
