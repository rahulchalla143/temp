Brief Hospital Course: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient required extra 3 days in the hospital because his oxygen saturations dropped to 60% on ambulation with physical therapy on Friday [**2179-3-19**].
Patient continued to desat down to mid-80s on ambulation with 3L supplement oxygen, which likely is his baseline and he will require supplemental oxygen at all times with activity.
He started a 2 week course of azithromycin and will continue slow prednisone taper over 2 months as instructed.
Started on anticoagulation with coumadin which was continued by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86**] on followup in [**2174**], when he was noted to be in NSR.
In [**2175**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] discontinued coumadin as he only had one episode of a fib, which was thought to be from combination of COPD and EtOH use.
Pt had afib/a flutter during recent admission in [**2-/2179**] during MICU course and was started on diltiazem with good response on serial EKGs.
Added on heparin and coumadin after discussion with pt and daughter.
Should keep pt on coumadin 7.5mg daily, and stop heparin drip (currently at 700 units/hr, target PTT 50-60) once INR therapeutic ([**3-13**]).
