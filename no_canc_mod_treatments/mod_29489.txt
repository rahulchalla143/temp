He was found to have bilateral upper lobe infiltrates and lymphadenopathy on a chest CT.  Sputum grew out Pseudomonas and he was treated with cefepime and a steroid taper.
A PICC was placed and he was discharged home on to complete his treatment regimen.
Pt received vancomycin and ticaracillin/clavulanate x2 doses.
CXR: ET tube is in good position.
NG tube projects beyond the projection of the film.
The NG tube courses below the diaphragm, however, the tip has been excluded.
[**2185-8-24**] AXR: Tip of NG tube overlies duodenal bulb.
[**2185-8-28**] CXR: The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.
ET tube in standard placement.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
CXR [**2185-9-5**]: Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.
Right subclavian catheter has been removed, and a left PICC line has been placed, terminating in the lower superiors vena cava.
Status post tracheostomy with patency of the central airways demonstrated bilaterally.
The nasogastric tube should be advanced 5 to 10 cm.
There is extensive bilateral consolidation, with bullous destructive changes and air bronchograms, consistent with cavitary pneumonia, unchanged in comparison to the prior study.
Video Swallow [**2185-9-22**]: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy study was performed in collaboration with the speech and swallow department.
Varying consistencies of barium were administered under constant fluoroscopic video guidance.
[**8-18**] endotracheal sputum culture: pan-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[**9-13**] sputum culture: 3 different colonies of Pseudomonas, one pan-sensitive, one resistant to meropenem but sensitive to tobramycin, gent, amikacin.
These were also sensitive to colistin as tested by the [**Hospital3 **].
Amikacin, colistin not tested.
On [**8-15**], at the OSH, note was made of food in his right upper lobe obtained during bronchoscopy suggesting aspiration.
The patient was initiated on antibiotic treatment with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin.
The patient's vanc/levo/zosyn regimen was discontinued and the patient was started on meropenem given the pseudomonas sensitivities.
Per their recommendations, the patient was continued on meropenem and was also started on tobramycin.
Multiple attempts were made to wean the patient from the ventilator via pressure support trials.
Given his prolonged weaning course the patient received a tracheostomy on [**2185-9-1**].
Flagyl was empirically started for C. diff, given his long courses of antibiotics.
However, many C. diff toxin studies were negative, and eventually, the diarrhea was treated with loperamide with good results.
# Hyperglycemia: On admission the patient was apparently on home lantus though his diabetes history could be obtained.
Given the patient's difficult to control blood glucose levels, [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and the patient was initially placed on a sliding scale.
However, in the setting of steroids, glucose too difficult to control on ISS and patient was placed on a insulin drip.
He was placed on thaimine and folate supplements.
# FEN - patient with PEG placed while in ICU and on tube feeds.
