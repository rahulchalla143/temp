Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7739**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH intubated and s/p fosphenytoin load for two generalized convulsions noted by his family and EMS personnel.
He remained intubated over the first night he was in our ICU and continued to receive IV dilantin at a rate of 100mg TID.
PROBLEMS Seizures: [**Name2 (NI) **] he was initially started on dilantin for his two seizures, he had an extensive work up to rule out secondary causes of symptomatic seizures.
Ultimately, on obtaining a further history from the patient and his family, he reported that he had been taking his tramadol inappropriately over the past few months.
His monthly prescription of tramadol would routinely run out of pills prior to the end of the month.
I spoke with his physiatrist directly, and conveyed our thoughts about tramadol being a cause for lowered seizure threshold.
He was instructed to continue his other home medications of flexeril and lyrica.
Renal Failure: On admission, his admission creatinine of 1.3 rose to 1.5 and then subsequently to 1.8 in spite of continuous IV fluids.
This worsened to 11 following IV rehydration (dilutional) and remained at ~11g/dL.
On discharge, the patient and his family was educated about findings related to his MRI, EEG and iron studies.
Medications on Admission: Ultram ER 300mg QD Lyrica 50mg QD Tramadol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN Flexeril (unknown dose) QHS Vitamin E multivitamin herbal supplement Circuleg (PRN hemorrhoid?)
Lyrica 50 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day.
Capsule(s) 2. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for back pain/discomfort.
3. hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-500 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 6 days.
You briefly received sedation following your seizures while you were intubated (with a breathing tube).
We believe that your seizures were likely caused as a side effect of tramadol use, which can lower the threshold for seizures.
During your hospitalization, we noticed that your kidney function had worsened slightly, but this improved with IV hydration.
- DO NOT TAKE tramadol in the future.
- Our decision was to NOT continue any antiepileptic medications at this time.
Do not consume more than 4g of tylenol daily.
