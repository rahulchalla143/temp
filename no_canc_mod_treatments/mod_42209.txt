Patient is intubated and sedated on exam, no family members available for collateral; all history is second-hand.
He was transported by EMS to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where CT head, C-spine and T-spine were performed.
During the flight patient became agitated, so he was given fentanyl and ativan.
He was intubated for airway protection prior to imaging.
Patient was intubated, exam was performed after pt off propofol x5 min (although had received succinylcholine bolus 20 minutes prior to exam).
Past Medical History: -COPD -HTN -Glaucoma -Arthritis   Social History: Lives at home with wife.
HEENT: 2 inch laceration on forehead above right eye.
-Babinski: Toes upgoing on left, downgoing on right -Rectal tone: flaccid paralysis  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: patient is alert and awake on o2 nasal cannula.
Abnormal widening of the C6/7 disc space, with associated anterior STIR hyperintensity at the same level.
CXR ([**7-31**]): In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.
NG tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image.
Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.

Multiple C-spine degenerative changes were also noted, in particular a large osteophyte at C6 and autofusion at C4-C5.
[**7-31**]: Patient was started on methylprednisolone burst followed by 23-hour methylpred drip.
He was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU for further management.
He was bradycardic and hypotensive(likely spinal shock, see below), managed with pressors.
Cardiogenic was ruled out via normal TTE; cardiac enzymes negative x3.
On HD #2 [**2135-8-1**] patient became bradycardic to 20s with resultant hypotension, so dopamine gtt was started to maintain SBP 90-140 to optimize cord perfusion.
On [**8-3**]: The patient was cleared for surgery by cardiology.The patient was scheduled for a posterior and anterior cervical decompression for the following day.
On [**8-4**]: The patient underwent Anterior cervical diskectomy C6-C7 and fusion& Posterior decompression via bilateral laminectomies at C4, C5, C6 and superior C7 with instrumented fusion with placement of hemovac drain with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].The patient was transferred to the Neurosurgery service and was recovered in the trauma intensive care unit.
He required a diltiazem intravenous drip for his atrial fibrillation and phnelephrine to keep his systolic blood pressure for a MAP or 65 or greater.
The patient required propofol for sedation due to blood pressure and heart rate instability when woken up.
On exam, the patient was examined off propofol for 1 minite.
On [**8-5**], The patient was intubated and continued on continuous intravenous infusions which included : phenylephrine, prop/fent/dilt/insulin gtt.
The patient continued to experience some hemodynamic instability when off sedation and was only taken off propofol for 5 minities at a time for exams.
The hemovac drain was left in place given large output.
The patient required a lot of encouragement to cough and deep breath and required nasal tracheal suctioning.
The patient was determined high risk for deep vein thrombosis and the patient underwent placement of a IVC filter.
The phenylephrine gtt  was weaned to off today.
The diltiazem continuous intravenous gtt for atrial fibrillation continued.The chest xray was consistent with the feeding tube,  which terminates within the stomach.
The surgical incisions were well approximated, clean dry and intact.
The hemovac drain was discontinued.
The patient was started on a PO diltiazem.
The patient was on continous oxygen delivered by face tent.
The patient continues on po diltiazem and remains in atrial fibrillation.
