Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from the aortic arch through the brain during the infusion of Omnipaque intravenous contrast material.
On [**2153-1-27**] he was taken to the OR for an emergent repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a 30-mm Dacron tube graft from just after the left subclavian artery takeoff all the way down to the mid visceral bearing segment of the abdominal aorta using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and a separate side branch to revascularize the celiac artery.
Please see operative report for further surgical details.
He was transferred intubated and sedated to the CVICU requiring pressor support, in critical condition.
In summary: he  had a very complicated postoperative course due to cerebral and spinal infarcts with scans showing multiple areas of slow diffusion, predominantly in Left parietal and occipital lobe concerning for sub-acute infarcts, paraplegia, S. marascens bacteremia with presumed graft infection, VAP and  post-op wound infection at the back of the thoracotomy site with coag negative staph.
The patient had remained intubated until POD#1.
Anticoagulation was not initially started.
However, after his continued Paroxysmal Afib, and neuro event, Coumadin was ultimately initiated.
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room for Trach and PEG placement on [**2-7**] with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **].
Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated.
POD 15 from initial TA AAA repair now with ischemic eschar around the inferior portion of the wound.
General Surgery and Plastics was consulted.
The patient was scoped by GI who visualized active rectal bleeding and was concerned for perforation on anoscopy likely secondary to flexi-seal s/p packing, seemingly with hemostasis.Hematocrits remain stable.
ID signed off after recommending: antibiotics for wound infection: would continue Vanco/Flagyl for 2 weeks from day of debridement ([**Date range (1) 11701**]),for Serratia AAA graft infection: Plan to continue cipro IV for 4 weeks for presumed serratia endovascular infection ([**Date range (1) 11702**]).
And will require life long suppression with cipro PO after this given presence of graft.
He remains NPO with continued nutrition, hydration and medication via the PEG in place.
He was fitted for a Passy Muir Valve.
On the day of his discharge to [**Hospital1 11703**] rehab on [**2153-2-22**], he remains paraplegic, anticoagulated for PAF/CVA, with a JP drain and sutures intact s/p thoracoabdominal debridement.
