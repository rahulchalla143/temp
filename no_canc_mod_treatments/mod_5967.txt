In the ICU, he was started on levophed (which was changed to neosynephrine and titrated off [**6-24**] at approximately 4pm).
He was started on ceftazidime for possible PNA, vancomycin IV, and flagyl.
He was noted to be in SVT and converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone loading.
Stool cx was positive for c diff, and he was changed to flagyl/vanco po, other antibiotics were discontinued.
He was noted to have a Hct of 24 on admission and received 1 unit PRBC with minimal change in hematocrit, but was guaiac negative.
Summary of hospital course: 1) Atrial flutter: While in the MICU, the patient had hypotension in the setting of atrial flutter in the 150s, after which he converted to normal sinus rhythm following amiodarone drip.
The electrophysiology service was consulted, who recommended titrating up beta blocker as tolerated by blood pressure.
His metoprolol was titrated up gradually to 50 mg PO BID, amiodarone was continued, and, at time of discharge, the patient had been in paced rhythm (60s) without atrial flutter for >72 hours.
Metronidazole was discontinued on [**6-29**], and the patient will continue on PO vancomycin 250 mg PO q6hrs to complete a 3 week course, after which the dose will be gradually tapered and pulsed (see discharge medications).
Rifaxamin was added to his regimen on [**7-2**].
In the future, if he should be started on antibiotics for an other infection, vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h should be given at the same time.
Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets dropped to 119 on [**2188-6-25**], likely due to a combination of dilutional effect (in the setting of fluid resuscitation) and sepsis.
