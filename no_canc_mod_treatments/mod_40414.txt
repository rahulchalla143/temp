She has had sputum smears taken ever since a positive purified protein derivative dating back to [**2101**].
Migraine headaches.
Autoimmune hepatitis.
Status post colectomy (atonic colon as a complication of lupus).
She also had revealed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2123-3-9**] for pancreatitis; at which time she received sphincterotomy of a stenosis in the major papilla.

q.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d., folic acid 1 mg p.o.
q.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Vioxx 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Dilantin 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Vivelle patch (estrogen) two times per week, Keppra 500 mg p.o.
(antiepileptic), Estrace cream 0.01% q.d., Procardia 10 mg p.o.

She has had chronic diarrhea since her colectomy in [**2108**].
She had a jejunostomy tube present in the left upper quadrant.
Arterial blood gas was 7.35/33/92 on assist control 16 X 600.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She was initially hypotensive and required Levophed pressor in order to maintain her blood pressure.
She also received frequent boluses of normal saline.
She initially required fluid boluses after the Levophed was stopped but did not require any further use of pressors while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
NEUROLOGY:  She has a history of seizure disorder; and per her online outpatient notes, it appeared that her neurologist had been trying to transition her from Dilantin to Keppra.
Therefore, her dose of Dilantin had been getting gradually reduced while as an outpatient.
We opted to load her with Dilantin and to maintain her at a therapeutic level given our concerns about a possible seizure in the setting of acute illness.
ENDOCRINE:  She was on oral prednisone daily at home for her lupus scleroderma.
She was started on stress-dose steroid of hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously t.i.d.
prednisone as the patient takes at baseline.
This was likely the source of her frequent pneumonias, her immune system dysfunction.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She had a pan-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and was therefore started on levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
Her arterial line tip was positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and she also had [**1-1**] blood culture bottles that grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Therefore, she was stated on vancomycin on [**2123-4-4**].
She was started on ceftazidime and Flagyl on [**2123-4-10**] (as recommended by the Infectious Disease team).
GASTROINTESTINAL:  She continued to be fed through her jejunostomy tube while she was here.
She had a gradual increase of pancreatic enzymes, amylase and lipase, to close to 300 before they started decreasing on [**2123-4-9**].
HEMATOLOGY:  She required 1-unit transfusions of packed red blood cells while she was her.
