Blood cultures revealed negative results, but the PICC line catheter tip which was cultured revealed positive cultures with coagulase negative staph.
Therefore, it was concluded that the patient was febrile from line sepsis and his line was removed.
The patient was started on vancomycin for this line sepsis, and he was continued on imipenem with which he was admitted to the hospital.
Fluconazole was also added to his antibiotic regimen.
On hospital day 3, the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and debridement of this visible pancreatic abscess at the body and tail of the pancreas.
A cholangiogram was performed and a feeding jejunostomy was placed intraoperatively.
The surgery was relatively uncomplicated, and the patient was taken to the surgical intensive care unit for postoperative recovery.
He was stabilized with intravenous fluids.
He was started on an amiodarone drip for this.
So this pleural effusion was drained by tube thoracostomy and was left to drainage.
Trophic tube feeds were begun on hospital day 8, and the patient tolerated these without problems.
Per their recommendations, the patient was started on Zosyn and the total number of antibiotics that the patient was on was 4 including vancomycin, Zosyn, imipenem and fluconazole.
By [**2105-6-15**], which was hospital day 10, the patient was off pressors, was more hemodynamically stable, and was still continued on antibiotics.
The patient's tube feeds were noted to be at goal at hospital day 15.
Cultures of his open abdominal wound revealed pseudomonas and, for this, the patient was treated with acetic acid dressing soaks.
On [**6-21**], the patient was alert and oriented and was off sedation and his atrial fibrillation and flutter had been restored to a regular rate and rhythm.
On [**6-21**], which is hospital day 16, the patient underwent doxycycline pleurodesis at his right chest to promote the feeling of his chest pleura and to eliminate the need for a chest tube.
The patient was eventually weaned down on his ventilator from a ventilation mode to CPAP, but he failed to make progress thereafter because he was not alert enough to be able to breathe on his own in a consistent fashion.
His right chest tube was removed after pleurodesis.
He continued to make slow progress over the next day or two to the point that speech and swallow consultation was obtained and physical and occupational therapy services were obtained.
On [**6-28**], the patient was doing so well as to not necessitate antibiotics any more and these were all discontinued.
The patient was maximized on pressors and inotropic agents, but eventually was found to have become asystolic on telemetry.
A code was called and ACLS protocol was instituted with chest compressions for about 45 minutes with return of palpable pulses and a supraventricular rhythm.
Alteplase therapy was instituted to attempt to break up the pulmonary embolus and, thereafter, the patient was placed on heparin drip.
