She was mannually bagged for oxygenation in the emergency room.
A femoral line was placed as other access was difficult to obtain.
After that time she was intubated and given rocuronium 6 mg, etomidate 20 mg, and transiently was on a nitro gtt.
She was given doses of vancomycin and zosyn to cover for possible pneumonia in setting of recent hospitalizations.
She was also given 100 mg IV lasix, and had put out 600cc of urine prior to arrival to the floor.

[**2113-10-27**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in radiographic position of the endotracheal tube.
The tip of the tube is still at the origin of the right main bronchus.
[**2113-10-28**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube still projects over the carina.
The size of the cardiac silhouette, the left basal opacity, and the position of the endotracheal tube are unchanged.
ET tube in standard placement.
Given that her extremities were cool and her lactate was elevated, sepsis from a hospital-acquired pneumonia was also a consideration in the setting of her recent admissions and intubations/extubations.
She was given 100 mg of IV lasix in the emergency room and put out over 600 cc, but then developed hypotension limiting further diuresis.
She also has marked pulmonary hypertension which could also have contributed, and was at risk for aspiration given prior CVA.
Patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible hospital acquired pneumonia, with vancomycin given her history of MRSA in sputum, and zosyn.
After the patient's blood pressure stabalized based on arterial line tracings, diuresis was initiated with a lasix drip for her congestive heart failure.
After initial stabalization of her blood pressure, she was started on a lasix drip for gentle steady diuresis.
Her beta-blocker was held in the setting of hypotension and acute exacerbation.
Her aspirin was continued.
#) Diabetes mellitus: Patient was continued on insulin as she was on her prior admission.
She was not listed as taking coumadin or other anticoagulation agents, hoewver upon review of the records, she has had a mildly elevated INR, PT, and PTT in the past.
Her home dose of levothyroxine was continued.
Gentle diuresis was attempted to help forward flow to her kidneys, and nephrotoxic agents were avoided.
Heparin drip was discussed, but given her history of stroke and coagulopathy, decision was made to defer initiating anticogulation until further details could be obtained from her family and other providers.
Beta-blocker was given for rate control as permitted by her blood pressure.
Her lasix drip was stopped.
Patient was initially bolused fluids, and her antibiotic coverage was expanded.
At approximately 11:30 PM on [**2113-10-30**], patient's blood pressure again began to decline, and levophed was started to maintain a MAP above 65.
Dobutamine was initiated to help with any component of cardiogenic shock, as well as vassopressin.
