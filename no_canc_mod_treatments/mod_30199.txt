The change was made to zidovudine 200 mg b.i.d.
The patient immediately responded to transcutaneous pacing with one jolt of 200 joules.
The patient also received intravenous factor VIII and calcium in the emergency department.
He was emergently taken to the catheterization laboratory for placement of a temporary transvenous wire.
Currently, the patient was on AZT, Kaletra and lamivudine.
He had a history of supraventricular tachycardia, status post ablation in [**2179-6-26**].
He had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, possibly secondary to internal hemorrhoids in [**2179-10-27**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Zidovudine 200 mg p.o.
Lamivudine 150 mg p.o.
Vioxx 25 to 50 mg p.o.
Verapamil 120 mg of sustained release p.o.
Atenolol 100 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for further monitoring and consideration of further electrophysiologic intervention.
He was administered factor VIII, as recommended by the hematology/oncology service, and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the hematology service in the emergency department as well as in the unit.
All of the patient's blood pressure medications were discontinued, as they were considered to likely be a precipitating factor to his new onset arrhythmia.
The renal service was consulted on the following morning and the patient was administered Kayexalate as well as calcium gluconate and Lasix overnight.
The temporary wires were left in place throughout the day on [**2180-5-11**], although the pacing rate was decreased by the electrophysiology team.
Dopamine was also started at renal dose, which produced a significant amount of diuresis, even after the dopamine was discontinued.
The patient's potassium ultimately corrected as well and required repletion on [**2180-5-12**].
The transvenous pacing wires were removed without event on [**2180-5-12**] and the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit throughout his last night of hospitalization for consideration of bleeding and possible recurrence of arrhythmia.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient's discharge medications included only his antiretroviral medications, as previously listed, as well as daily administration of factor VIII, to be given by the [**First Name (Titles) 407**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] team at 10 AM every morning.
NOTE:  The patient was not discharged on any calcium channel blocker or beta blocker medications.
