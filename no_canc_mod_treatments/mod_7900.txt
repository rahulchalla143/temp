Patient was transfused with 2 units of PRBC and received 3 L of NS with improvement in BP.
Her home anti-hypertensive meds were held and slowly restarted prior to discharge.
We restarted Metoprolol and HCTZ, but did not restart Lisinopril.
Considered anemia secondary to lysis as pt has antibodies to several blood antigens and it is unclear if she was transfused during recent ortho procedure.
Although there was no evidence of bleeding, because of profound anemia on presentation, her Lovenox was discontinued and this decision will be communicated to her Orthopedic surgeon at [**Hospital1 2177**] as well.
#CAD: Pt is s/p CABG and AVR.
Plavix was also held in setting of possible bleeding source for anemia, but was restarted prior to discharge.
Her staples were removed and she was treated with pain medication as needed.
She will f/u with Ortho at [**Hospital1 2177**] as outlined below.
2.Lisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge, given relative normotension during the admission.

We think that you were anemic because you just had a large operation on your hip and your body is taking time to recover.
You were given a transfusion of blood and fluids through an IV and we monitored your hemoglobin levels which remained stable.
We stopped your blood pressure medication (Lisinopril) because your blood pressure was low.
