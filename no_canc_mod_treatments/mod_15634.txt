He was treated with diltiazem given by intravenous bolus and by drip for rate control and Ativan with withdrawals.
He subsequently developed facial edema and airway edema requiring emergent intubation for airway protection.
He also received Protonix at one point during hs hospitalization there.
He developed hypotension and required a short course of Neo-Synephrine.
His atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response was eventually treated with digoxin with good rate control.
The patient received bronchoscopy two times with aggressive suctioning on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] with eventual re-expansion of his left lower lobe.
Digoxin 0.1 mg by mouth once per day 2.
Pepcid 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
Lactulose 300 mg per rectum twice per day.
Albuterol as needed.
Vitamin K times three.
ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, DILTIAZEM, and ATIVAN are questioned for anaphylaxis.
This continued to clear each day and was thought to be multifactorial with an element of hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy, and alcohol-induced encephalopathy causing his change in mental status.
The Allergy Service was consulted and they suggested that the patient have a re-challenge of Ativan an diltiazem as an outpatient.
It appeared highly unlikely that the patient developed angioedema secondary to Ativan since he has received Ativan multiple times in the past without any adverse reactions.
GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS SEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient was to complete a 21-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone as per Infectious Disease consultation.
Will continue digoxin for rate control for now, and would reconsider whether the patient would be able to be compliant with outpatient anticoagulation.
He was not started on any oral anticoagulation during this hospitalization.
In terms of his hepatic encephalopathy, he was continued on lactulose 30 mg by mouth three times per day with good effect.
Anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to cirrhosis and alcohol bone marrow suppression.
Ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously q.24h.
Albuterol inhaler as needed.
Famotidine 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
Lactulose 30 mg by mouth three times per day.
The patient was to have a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed on [**2113-11-17**] to complete his antibiotic course.
