[**Known lastname 86671**],[**Known firstname **] [**Medical Record Number 86672**] F  44  [**2129-4-22**]  Radiology Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2174-2-14**] 1:11 PM   Final Report INDICATION: 44-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post aneurysm coiling and subsequent vasospasm.
Subsequently, axial perfusion CT images were obtained during infusion of Omnipaque IV contrast.
Sequentially, rapid axial imaging was performed through the brain during infusion of Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
Images were processed on a separate workstation with display of mean transit time, relative cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] volume, and relative cerebral [**Name2 (NI) **] flow maps for the CT perfusion study and maximum intensity projection images for the CTA maps.
The left middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral arteries, and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries are normal without evidence of vascular abnormalities.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage and status post PCom aneurysm coiling, for further evaluation to exclude vasospasm.
A coil artifact is seen in the right paraclinoid region.
