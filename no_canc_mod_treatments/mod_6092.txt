Admission Date:  [**2193-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-10-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: ?SBO  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2193-3-11**] exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy [**2193-3-14**] percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement  History of Present Illness: 63M with h/o ESRD on PD, Diabetes, CAD s/p CABG, PVD s/p AKA presents with shortness of breath and hypotension to the Micu service [**2193-3-10**].
Blood cultures and PD fluid sent for culture.
CRI/diabetic nephropathy-seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] (baseline Cr 6), now on PD (s/p catheter repositioning on [**2192-4-30**]) 4.
PVD: s/p left AKA, right 4th toe amputated 5. s/p femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2185**] 6.
Right eye vetreactomy after retinal hemorrhage 7.
L eye laser surgery for retinopathy 8.
A routine CT scan of his abdomen showed intra-abdominal free air but this was thought to be due to his recent PD catheter manipulation.
Neurological:  He remained sedated on the ventilator post-operatively.
Once we were able to extubate he received prn doses of sedation as needed.
All sedatives and narcotic pain medications were held.
His room was changed to one that received sunshine and his delerium started to clear.
Cardiology was consulted and they recommended continued medical management.
He did develop a-fib with rapid ventricular response requiring an amiodarone drip and digoxin.
He was able to be transitioned to PO amiodarone with good rate control.
Pulmonary:  After extubation he continued to have volume overload due to IVF resuscitation.
Gastrointestinal:  He underwent a total abdominal colectomy on [**2193-3-11**].
Once he was stable hemodynamically and his ileostomy was functioning, tube feeds were started and advanced to goal.
His PO intake was no sufficient but he refused to have a feeding tube reinserted.
Due persistent pressor requirements and a persistent leukocytosis he underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement on [**2193-3-14**] due to concerns for cholecystitis.
The percutaneous tube ultimately fell out on [**2193-3-26**].
He was started back on Flagyl for empiric C.diff treatment.
Genitourinary:  A temporary HD catheter was placed in his right IJ.
He underwent successful CVVH for a number of days.
Once stable, he was started on HD and did not tolerate his first attempt.
900cc was removed and he became hypotensive requiring a small IVF bolus.
A tunneled line placement was attempted by IR but the patient was too claustrophobic and uncooperative.
When his pulmonary status worsened his line was replaced over a wire at the bedside in the ICU and CVVH reinitiated.
The following day he was intubated and the line changed over a wire for a longer catheter.
FEN:  He was started on TPN on POD3.
Once he was stable hemodynamically with bowel function he was started on tube feeds.
TPN continued once extubated as his PO intake was poor.
Hematological:  He did received a total of 5units of RBC transfusions.
ID:  He was initially placed on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl post-operatively.
The flagyl was discontinued but due to his elevated WBC it was resumed empirically.
On POD3 he still had a pressor requirement and a leukocytosis so he receieved a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
Bile cultured from this tube was negative for bacteria.
Endocrine:  He is a diabetic and required an insulin drip due to hyperglycemia.
Plastic surgery was consulted and they recommended enzymatic debridement.
