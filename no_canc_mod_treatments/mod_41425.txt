She had been doing fine at rehab until [**2192-3-28**] when she went for a doctor's appointment and got acutely short of breath - by the time she arrived at the OSH ED she had decreased level of consciousness and was intubated.
During her OSH stay, she was ruled out for acute MI, diuresed, and treated for CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
Left subclavian CVL was subsequently placed and CVP was [**2-23**], with decrease inurine output.
Given her prior aggressive diuresis, she was given 500cc IVF followed by maintenance IVF and 1u pRBC with improvement in her urine output.
Per discussion with son [**Name (NI) **], she has never had any interventions for her AS.

An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus.
A left subclavian line overlies the distal SVC, unchanged.
In the future, Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] should receive E antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.
Pt had been started on CAP coverage at OSH, but she has been hospitalized twice in the past month so more appropriate to cover for HCAP.
Started on vanc/cefepime/azithro on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] to cover for HCAP and this was continued for 8 day course (last dose [**2192-4-7**], and azithro for only 5d).
For management of CHF, diuresed pt with lasix drip with acetazolamide as well and removed several liters of fluid.
HR consistently on 90s, so placed pt on metoprolol rather than atenolol to get targeted HR control and uptitrated as needed to achieve goal rate of 60-70s.
A right central line was placed in the IJ for medication administration.
Due to aggressive diuresis, she developed a contraction alkalosis that inhibited her respiratory drive, so lasix drip was stopped.
Switched from atenolol to metoprolol succinate 100mg.
Also, started lisinopril and uptitrated to 5mg on d/c.
Patient is on 40mg of torsemide per day.
treated pt for HCAP due to multiple recent hospitalizations with vanc/cefepime for 8 days and azithromycin for 5d.
Treated with chest PT, nebulizers, guaifenison.
managed HR with uptitration of metoprolol succinate to 100mg qd.
40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery), MSSA swab (positive), and cardiac cath (result: AS moderate, wedge 14-15, CI 2.3, 60-70% proximal LAD lesion).
She was treated with free water boluses as well as calcitonin salmon for hyperCa.
Thus, NG tube was placed and tube feeds were initiated.
The tube feed and NG tube was removed on [**4-12**], and the patient was able to take PO meds and food by time of discharge.
Continue PO diet of thin liquids and puree.
Held lisinopril and nifedipine in setting of normotension.
continued BB but switched home atenolol to metoprolol for better rate control.
