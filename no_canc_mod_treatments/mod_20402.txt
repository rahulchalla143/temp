At that time he was given Vecuronium Succinylcholine and Etomidate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was then taken to the computerized tomography scanner where he underwent a head cervical spine, chest and abdominal computerized tomography scans.
He was made Do-Not-Resuscitate until the family was able to arrive at the hospital at which point the wide open fluids were stopped and the ventilator was turned off.
It was determined prior to the families arrival that a right chest tube was not something the patient would have wanted.
It should be noted that in the Trauma Bay the patient received Mannitol as well as Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for his open skull fracture.
