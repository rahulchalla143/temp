INFECTED PACEMAKER LEADS:  Patient has a long-standing implanted pacemaker because he previously had experienced syncopal episodes related to sick-sinus syndrome.
There was granulation tissue over the site of patient's previous intervention and a previous wound culture grew MSSA for which he had undergone a course of Keflex.
This is in addition to multiple antibiotic treatment course in sequence beginning in spring of [**2154**].
Because patient had increased purulent drainage from the site, he presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was started on vanc and cefazolin.
His pacemaker was explanted on [**1-22**], procedure complicated by hematoma at right groin site which self-resolved with some inital pressure and asymptomatic bradycardia to 30s-40s.
[**Hospital3 **] microbiology records show that blood cultures drawn prior to the initation of antibiotics were all No Growth Final.
IV cefazolin and topical mupirocin was continued, and patient was switched to IV daptomycin.
He is to receive a total of 6 weeks of IV daptomycin for treatment of potential endocarditis given the finding of vegetation vs. fibrous tissue on the tricuspid valve.
Sick Sinus Syndrome: Patient is s/p pacer explantation on [**1-22**].
He was continued on lithium and topomax per home regimen.
Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine.
He was continued on antifungal and moisurizing agents per home regimen.
