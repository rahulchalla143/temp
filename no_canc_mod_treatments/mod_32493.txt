2) Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 82 yom with hx of ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with Peripheral Neuropathy, Afib on Coumadin who presented from an OSH with SDH s/p fall.
He had a CT head done which showed a small 5mm left parietal subdural hematoma, INR 3.1 and was given Vit K and 2u FFP.
He developed uncontrolled HTN with SBP in 180s and was given multiple doses of Hydralazine PO/IV and Metoprolol PO/IV with minimal response.
He was subsequently placed on Nicardipine gtt and transferred to SICU.
Nicardipine gtt was titrated off at the time of my examination with SBP in 150s.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 82 yom w/ ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with peripheral neuropathy, Afib on Coumadin who presented from OSH with SDH.
1) Subdural hematoma: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with small, acute left parietal subdural hematoma sustained during a mechanical fall with head impact.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an INR of 3.1 at presentation, anticoagulated on coumadin, which was reversed with 1 unit FFP and 10 mg of Vitamin K.  Neurologic exam was unremarkable and stable throughout hospital stay.
Patient was initiated on Keppra as seizure prophylaxis.
Per Neurosurgery recommendations, he will remain off his Coumadin for 4 weeks and will follow-up in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic for repeat CT scan to assess for resolution of his bleed.
At that time, he should be resumed on coumadin if bleed is resolved and fall risk is minimal.
2) Hypotension:  On the neurosurgery service, he developed hypertensive urgency and was treated unsuccessfully with IV/PO metoprolol and IV/PO hydralazine.
His blood pressure finally came down treated w/ Nicardipine and -3.5L HD.
At this point, the patient was transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension, likely in the setting of stacking of multiple blood pressure meds combined with large volume removal during dialysis.
A central line was placed in the setting of progressive hypotension out of concern for sepsis.
Additionally, the pt underwent dialysis on the evening of [**10-3**] and upon return to the ICU developed Afib with RVR in the context of large volume removal.
Ultimately, no antibiotics were required, and hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation.
The patient takes diltiazem and long acting metoprolol at home.
His metoprolol was uptitrated, and diltiazam 30 TID was added due to persistent elevation of BPs.
Calcium channel blocker was changed from Diltiazem to Nifedipine.
Both Nifedipine and Metoprolol were uptitrated to achieve goal SBP<130, per JNC7 guidelines.
4) Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in normal sinus rhthym while he was on the floor with combination therapy from rate controlling agents metoprolol and diltiazem.
On [**2127-10-5**], Diltiazem was switched Nifedipine CR given concern for over-blockade with two anti-nodal agents.
With regard to his coumadin use, the patient was taken off his coumadin upon arrival to the neurosurgery team on [**2127-9-29**] in the setting of subdural hematoma.
For this reason, he should be restarted on coumadin after he has been re-evaluated by neurosurgery in 4 weeks.
During his hospital stay he was continued on aspirin 81 mg for anti-coagulation.
He will remain on aspirin 81 mg as an outpatient until coumadin can be resumed.
During HD, he received 11,000 U Epo and and 8 mcg of Zemplar.
He will continue on Nephrocaps and Sevelamer.
6) DM Type II:  Upon admission, the patient's glypizide was held and he was started on an insulin sliding scale.
His symptoms resolved with D50 bolus and his insulin sliding scale was halved.
He continued on this sliding scale with fair control of blood glucose levels (<200).
Upon transfer to the medicine service, the swelling improved slightly after hemodialysis and with mobilization.
His oxycontin was discontinued due to concerns regarding fall risk, and he was started on standing tylenol for pain control.
10) Prophylaxis:  Patient was on heparin 5000u SC TID as DVT while inpatient as DVT prophylaxis, approved by Neurosurgery from the standpoint of his subdural bleed.

You will remain off the coumadin until you are re-evaluated by the neurosurgery team.
Please continue to take the aspirin 81 mg daily.
Your medications for hypertension and atrial fibrillation have been changed to Toprol XL 150 mg PO daily and Nifedipine CR 120 mg PO daily.
During this admission, you have also received hemodialysis for your kidney disease.
We will continue hemodialysis once you leave the hospital on Tues, Thursday, and Saturday.
We will continue your nephrocaps, sevelamer, and lasix medications that you were taking prior to coming into the hospital.
