The cardiac index was depressed at 1.1 L/min/m2 with modest augmentation of cardiac output with dobutamine to 15 mcg/kg/min (with minimal change in heart rate and only mild increase in systemic systolic arterial pressure), based on a measured oxygen consumption post-sedation.
The mean aortic valve gradient was 42 mm Hg at rest with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2  WIth dobutamine infusion at 15 mcg/kg/min, the gradient rose to 56 mm Hg, with calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2.
[**2200-8-6**] Ultrasound 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-7-28**] for surgical management of his aortic stenosis.
As his coumadin had been stopped 4 days prior to admission, heparin was started for anticoagulation given his chronic atrial fibrillation.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery which showed mild two vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, mild pulmonary hypertension and a normal left ventricular function.
On [**2200-7-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent an aortic vakve replacement using a 21mm pericardial valve and a left atrial appendage ligation.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and cardioversion was attempted unsuccessfully.
Amiodarone was thus started for rate control.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
Ceftriaxone was started for possible aspiration pneumonia however his chest x-rays remained normal.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued with high nasogastric tube output and he was held NPO for a suspected ileus.
His output eventually decreased and his NG tube was removed on postoperative day 6.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] soon developed emesis and his NG tube was replaced.
Laboratory studies were consistent with pancreatitis and TPN was started for nutrition.
Mr. [**Known lastname 50840**] nasogastric tube (NGT) output slowly decreased.
Coumadin was continued for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
