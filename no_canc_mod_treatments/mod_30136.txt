Patient was initially admitted to ICU and he received Lasix boluses.
Patient recieved high-dose thiamine intravenously so a thiamine level was not sent.
The patient was then transferred to the cardiology service for further management and evaluation for CAD.
He was transitioned from Lasix boluses to a Lasix drip for more aggressive diuresis.
He was continued on a Lasix drip until he approached euvolemia, at which time he was transitioned to an oral regimen for outpatient management.
Early in his course he was also started on Metoprolol (for CHF and an atrial tachycardia), Lisinopril and Spironolactone.
Spironolactone was discontinued prior to discharge as patient was mildly hyperkalemic and there was concern for loss-to-follow-up.
He was discharged on Metoprolol succinate 100 mg, Lasix 40 mg PO and Lisinopril 10 mg. His prior anti-hypertensives and diuretics were discontinued.
Given his low EF and LBBB, the patient may benefit from CRT but this was not persued during this hospitalization given the acuity of his presentation.
Titration of Metoprolol and Lisinopril 2.
Addition of Spironolactone to current regimen given low EF 3.
Follow-up of CBC with consideration of outpatient hematology-oncology referral 5.
Evaluation and consideration of CRT given low EF and LBBB .
Patient was started on Metoprolol tartrate that was titrated and then converted to Metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily prior to discharge.
Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive to slightly hypotensive in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
Metoprolol, Lisinopril and Spironolactone were managed as above.
He received high-dose Thiamine for seven days, as well as Folate and a multivitatmin.
These were not continued at discharge, as the patient was discharged with multiple medication changes and there was a concerted effort fo facilitate his compliance.
