Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Aortic pathology - aneurysm ascending aorta, infrarenal AAA (3.9 X 4.5 cm), s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair ([**8-/2144**]) - CRI : recent left ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis - Prostate CA s/p radiation - Diverticulosis - Amputation R toe: several months ago secondary to infection - Bilateral Knee Replacement  Social History: The patient currently lives alone as his wife is in Rehab.
[**2151-1-4**] CXR: Endotracheal tube is 7 cm above carina.
Left cordis catheter is in left jugular vein.
Tip of NG tube is in fundus of stomach.
There is cardiomegaly with LV predominance and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
These findings are most suggestive of a meningioma, but other lesions, such as lymphoma, sarcoid, and optic nerve glioma, should be considered.
The descending thoracic aorta had a uniform size and texture consistent with previous descending thoracoabdominal repair by a graft.
At the end of the surgery, following additional stent placement, this filling resolved completely with no residual endoleak visualized.
Widely patent flow on the left to the level of the knee, where arthroplasty susceptibility obscures the popliteal artery; stenosis can not be excluded at that level.

On the following day he was brought to the operating room where he underwent Endovascular Stenting of Ascending and Aortic Arch w/ Debranching and Re-anastomosis of Right Innominate and Left Carotid Arteries.
Following the surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable but serious condition.
Sedation was weaned off by post-op day one but patient did not wake up and had very poor response to stimuli.
The family initially chose to continue with aggressive treatment over the next few weeks.
He has remianed in an unresponsive state, on hemodialysis, on the ventilator, and on tube feedings.
Due to the poor prognosis, and lack of improvement in neurologic function, the family requested that he be made a DNR, and that dialysis be stopped on [**2151-1-22**].
The following day, [**2151-1-23**], the patient's daughter and daughter-in-law both requested for him to be extubated and made comfort measures only.
