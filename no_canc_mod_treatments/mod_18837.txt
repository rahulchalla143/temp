Per patient (who is a questionable historian), he saw his hepatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in clinic today and had routine labs drawn.
He reports taking all medications as directed.
Cirrhosis (Hep C/ETOH) s/p liver transplant [**5-/2148**] 2.
Hepatoma s/p ablation 3.
IMAGING: Abdominal XR ([**2153-9-4**]): Nasogastric tube with tip in the proximal duodenum (first or second portion).
There are also enlarged lymph nodes in the paratracheal, pericardial, and epicardial regions.
Aortic valve was not well seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo man with HCV and EtOH cirrhosis s/p OLT ([**2148**]), c/b ascites who presented with worsening hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia: Pt was admitted with asymptomatic hyponatremia to 122 found on routine labs.
He was initiated on a trial of Tolvaptan 15mg, which was discontinued due to a rise in his creatinine.
# Renal Failure: Admission creatinine was 1.3, however creat began to rise while on tolvaptan and later while being fluid restricted.
The pt was started on midodrine and octreotide, with daily albumin.
Tacrolimus was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxic effects.
Urine output gradually decreased and the pt became less alert, likely due to uremia, therefore HD was initiated on [**8-7**].
After 2 weeks of dialysis, the pt was also listed for kidney transplant in addition to liver transplant.
# HCV/ETOH Cirrhosis S/P OLT: Tacrolimus was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxicity, however cellcept was continued, along with bactrim prophylaxis, lactulose, and rifaximin.
The pt is currently listed for both liver and kidney transplant.
Vancomycin and cefepime was started for HAP.
The pain has been moderately controlled with simethicone, occasional paracentesis, and HD.
It is felt to be due to fluid shifts in the setting of frequent HD and [**Doctor First Name 4397**].
On several occasions, the patient underwent severe or sustained drops, necessitating pRBC transfusions.
Transfusions were complicated by the patient's fluid overload, necessitating them to be given with lasix or during HD.
The patient's candidal esophagitis was treated with fluconazole.
Uremia is being treated with HD as described above.
The nausea is now moderately controlled with zofran and compazine, and the pt is tolerating tube feeds.
A dobhoff was placed and he began to receive tube feeds, however, as his nausea progressed, he could no longer tolerate tube feeds, and was started on TPN.
He has since been switched back to tube feeds but continues to have very poor PO intake.
# Depression: Venlafaxine was initially held due to it's possible contribution to [**Last Name (un) **].
# Code Status: Full code on admission, made CMO on [**2153-9-24**]  On the morning of [**9-10**], the patient was seen by transplant surgery at hemodialysis.
HD was stopped due to the hypotension.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tranferred to the SICU and the transplant surgery service for further hemodynamic montitoring for possible sepsis, where he was maintained eventually on triple pressors and then made CMO once it was determined that further escalation of care would be outside of his wishes.
He is on lactulose and rifaximin.
He received fent prn once intubated.
Once the patient was made CMO he was given a morphine gtt for comfort.
The patient was started on Neo-synephrine for hypotension.
The patient was then started on vasopressin.
The patient received PRBCs and albumin for hemodynamic support.
He responded to low dose lopressor, but had increased wheezing.
The patient remained on constant Vasopressin neosynephrine and levophed until he was made CMO at which time the pressors were withdrawn.
On [**9-15**], the patient had increased wheezing after receiving lopressor for tachycardia.
He remained intubated with a PS of 5 and PEEP of 8.
Due to risk of infection, it was decided to not place a pigtail drain in the left pleural cavity.
Speech and swallow was consulted and they recommended thin liquids and soft solids.
The patient was restarted on TF intermittently, and stopped intermittently due to inceased residuals.
GU: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome and is listed for a combined liver/kidney transplant.
Endo: The patient had stable BS and was covered with a RISS.
Infectious disease: The patient has blood cultures on SICU admission.
He was on vanc and cefepime.
Thoracentesis fluid was also cultured, with negative results.
