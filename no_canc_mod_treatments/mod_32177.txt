He subsequently experienced visual changes, emotional lability, and confusion.
Since being on the neurology service, he has had a EEG negative for szs, rpt MRI/MRA head without ischemia or temporal lobe enhancement, and LP that was significant for lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC 85, 95% lymphs).
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 96.5 166/92 80 26 90% on NRB --> 96% BIPAP 10/5 FiO2 ... GEN: elderly appearing man in NAD, awake, alert HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP slightly dry and without lesions, JVP approxmiately 13 cm above sternal notch NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
He was sedated on propofol and fentanyl and propofol was weaned several times to see if his mental status had changed but he did not exhibit signs of improvement.
Propofol was weaned on the day before he was extubated and he still did not show signs of improvement in mental status.
With diuresis and broad spectum coverage, his CXR improved and his leukocytosis and fevers resolved.
However, he was unweanable from the vent due to poor mental status, blood pressure lability, and heavy sedation requirements.
Pt has a hx of COPD, which was treated with standing albuterol and atrovent nebs and a steroid taper, with minimal signs of improvement.
Because repeat sputum on [**7-10**] grew out GNR he was also started on cefipime, but the cultures only showed minimal growth of pan-sensitive Klebsiella and cefipime was D/C on [**7-13**].
He was consistently hypertensive to SBPs in the 190s and 200s when sedation was weaned or when he was agitated.
When comfortable and on BP meds and full sedation, he dropped his SBPs into the 80s and 90s.
Metoprolol was tried but this caused the patient to drop his SBPs and was not continued.
He was maintained on low dose captopril to treat hypertension, as well as using sedation (propofol) to maintain BPs at a normal range.
Propofol was weaned several times to see if there was change in mental status, and most times it was weaned he became more hypertensive.
<br> Hypernatremia: Patient was initially hypernatremic at presentation.
This was treated with free water boluses and resolved.
<br> COPD: Pt had mild/moderate ds at baseline [**2-3**] prolonged smoking hx.
Albuterol / atrovent were continued per PE tube.
<br> FEN: Patient was put on tube feeds and kept at goal.
Patient given Narcan PRN constipation.
