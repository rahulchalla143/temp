The patient underwent multiple debridment, vac placement, and skin graft by the plastics team.
The history of lower extremity swelling and new onset liver disease (see below) raised red flags for schistosomiasis given its endemicity in [**Country 3399**].
No infectious organism responsible for the cellulitis was convincingly found, with wounds growing only [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] thought to be a contaminant and treated for several days with IV micafungin.
Broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) were started, picc line placed, and abx continued throughout hospitalization ([**2104-9-2**] - [**2104-10-8**]).
Ultimately patient defervesced and respiratory status improved wth diuresis and large volume paracentesis of ascites fluid (see below).
Patient discharged with the following instructions: - Daily dressing changes with xeroform, kerlix, ACE wrap - Skin graft donor sites on thigh open to air - Can perform nonweight bearing ambulation with crutches for short periods - Follow up with ortho as outpatient .
Therapeutic paracentesis were performed x2 with between 3.5 to 4 L of ascites fluid removed; peritoneal data was without evidence of SBP.
Patient was started on lasix and spironolactone to control significant abdominal ascites and scrotal edema.
Patient was vaccinated with first dose of HBV vaccine on [**2104-10-3**] and he will need repeat doses in one month and in 6 months.
Per infectious disease recommendations, clarithromycin was added to his antibiotic regimen and zosyn was shown to have some in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] effect on h. pylori.
Patient was thus treated for h. pylori with triple therapy and the plan for a follow up EGD as an outpatient to evaluate healing ulcer.
Patient was maintained on a ppi and nadolol throughout hospitalization.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable following sclerosis of ulcers (see above) and did not actively bleed throughout rest of hospitalization.
