HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 76-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement, on chronic Coumadin therapy, who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] after a fall which led to a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe and small subdural hematoma.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, and her digoxin level was found to be 0.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for an admission to Neurosurgery where she remained for one day and had her anticoagulation reversed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  She was subsequently transferred to the Medicine Service after serial CT examinations of the head which were negative for an increase in the size of the bleed.
Upon transfer to Medicine, her anticoagulation was restarted due to concerns over the formation of clots along her mitral or aortic valve replacements.
The Neurology Stroke Service agreed with this assessment and decided the patient should be anticoagulated for at one week with serial CT examinations to look for increasing size of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with a central hematoma and could subsequently be switched to Coumadin after one week with a stable CT scan of the head.
The patient tolerated this regimen for two days.
