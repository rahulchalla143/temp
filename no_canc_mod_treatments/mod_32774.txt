Patient was noted with one episode of flash penetration before the swallow with consecutive straw sips of thin liquids which cleared spontaneously.
Recommend a PO diet of thin liquids and small bites of soft solid consistencies.
PO diet of thin liquids and SMALL bites of soft solids.
Patient would also benefit from speech and language services at rehab.
She was on a heparin drip while at rehab with plans to start warfarin on [**2112-7-25**].
She was monitored initially in the SICU and required intubation for airway protection with GCS [**7-13**] (extubated successfully on [**2112-7-25**]).
She was transferred to the neurology service, and her seizure medications were adjusted.
She is being discharged on Levetiracetam [**2103**] mg PO BID and zonisamide 100 mg PO QD.
Interventional radiology performed more imaging on [**2112-7-30**] looking for a source of the bleed.
There apeared to be partial compression of the right ureter on imaging, though no further intervention was performed on the ureter since her renal function remained relatively stable.
Overnight from [**7-30**] to [**7-31**], she required another transfusion for decreasing blood counts, though, again, she remained hemodynamically stable.
She was noted to be on SQ insulin sliding scale upon admission, though she has no prior diagnosis of DM (confirmed with patient and PCP).
ANTICOAGULATION, MECHANICAL MITRAL VALVE: Heparin was restarted on [**2112-7-31**] since the bleed appeared to be stable by that time and she was considered to be high risk due to a mechanical mitral valve.
Coumadin was not restarted in the hospital, though it is recommended to be started at 4 mg QHS beginning on [**2112-8-3**] upon discharge.
It is noted that she was on aspirin 325 mg on admission.
VOLUME OVERLOAD: Patient was noted to be short of breath at rest and volume overloaded on exam in the setting of multiple blood transfusions and IVF for CT contrast exposure.
She was treated with several doses of lasix 10 mg IV with great improvement in her volume status.
She was started empirically on vancomycin + ceftriaxone on [**2112-7-27**] for HAP and then switched empirically to vancomycin + zosyn on [**2112-7-28**] since her leukocytosis persisted.
She was continued on vancomycin + zosyn, and her leukocystosis slowly improved to 12.8 on discharge.
Antibiotics are to continue through [**2112-8-5**] for treatment of HAP.
RLE ultrasound was performed since she was considered to be at risk for DVT with her immoblization and being off anticoagulation for several days; the ultrasound was negative for DVT.
The need for this should be readdressed once heparin is discontinued and IV antibiotics are completed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted ot the hospital for seizures, and your medication has been adjusted to control these.
You had a bleed in your abdomen called a rectus sheath hematoma, which was treated by a procedure called "embolization" that helps block bleeding in the artery.
Your blood counts were a little low, so you were given a blood transfusion.
You are being discharged to a rehab facility for further physical therapy and treatment.
