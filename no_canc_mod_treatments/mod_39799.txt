The patient was not responsive to nitroglycerin and therefore was brought to the Operating Room and an intra-aortic balloon pump inserted.

He was started on Precedex and extubated on his post operative night.
On POD1 beta blockers were started and he was gently diuresed with Lasix.
Chest tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol and follow up CXR showed no pneumothorax.
Pacing wires were removed on POD3 per cardiac surgery protocol without difficulty.
He was changed from Percocet to Ultram due to confusion and lethargy.
He worked with Physical Therapy for strength and mobility.
On POD 5 he was ambulating with assistance, tolerating a full oral diet and his incisions were healing well.
There was  a tiny amount of serosanguinous drainage on the sternal dressing the morning of discharge, however, the sternum was stable, no further drainage could be expressed and he was afebrile with a normal white blood cell count.
