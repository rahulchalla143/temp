ACTIVE ISSUES # Decompensated CHF: She was continued on a nitroglycerin drip and home antihypertensives.
She was also continued on home BiPAP and was diuresed with a goal of negative 1-2L per day.
She briefly became hypertensive off the nitro drip and was placed back on the drip while her home antihypertensives were uptitrated but was soon able to be weaned off again.
She was weaned off of the nitroglycerin drip and continued on her home antihypertensives which were uptitrated to goal BPs in the 120s/80s.
Might be related to sedating medications at home (Oxycodone-Acetaminophen, Gabapentin dose higher than recommended for her renal function).
# Leukocytosis: Patient had leukocytosis on admission and was started on ceftriaxone for UTI.
She was febrile to 100.4 on HD2 and azithromycin was added to cover for community acquired pneumonia.

Creatinine was monitored daily and medications were renally dosed.
She was placed on a sliding scale and standing lantus.
# Gout: Continued on Allopurinol, Colchicine (renally dosed)  # Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine  # Chronic pain: Gabapentin and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen were held while somnolent and gabapentin was restarted when mental status improved.
# Depression: Continued on home Fluoxetine  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -[**Month (only) 116**] need cath vs stress test as outpatient -Needs to wear CPAP at night  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
