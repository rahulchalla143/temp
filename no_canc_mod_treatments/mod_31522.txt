GI bleed: Resolved once INR normalized with vitamin K and FFP.
Decsion was made with patient not to pursue colonoscopy given known history and spontaneous resolution.
After prolonged discussion of the risks of bleeding on coumadin and of the risks of pulmonary embolism on coumadin, pt stated she would not restart coumadin.
Pulmonary Embolism:  Pt was diagnosed with b/l segmental PE's in [**5-12**], although it is unkown at what point these occurred, i.e these could have been present prior to the placement of the IVC filter in [**1-12**].
At admission, pt had been on coumadin, therapuetic levels, for approximately 10 weeks.
the IVC filter was placed in [**1-/2177**] because she was found to have a LE popliteal DVT and there was concern for risk of GI bleeding on coumadin given multiple episodes of GI bleeding in past.
Hopefully, IVC filter can prevent large PE's.
PPX: PPI, heparin sc - please have MD at rehab decide when pt is ambulating enough to stop heparin prophylaxis .
