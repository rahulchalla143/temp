[**3-23**] stress ECHO revealed resting gradient 18, with valsalva 86 and post-exercise 191 (8 METS, lateral ST changes, stopped [**2-20**] claudication, mild-mod AI).
Also c/o numerous pre-syncopal events, last 3 nights ago.
In [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab, peak gradient was 118 with Valsalva and post-PVC (Braunwald-Brockenbrough beat).
PVD:  S/P stenting L common iliac x 2 in [**1-23**] c/b retroperitoneal hemorrhage and RLE [**2192-9-27**] (6 x 29mm) 3.
OSA:  Not on CPAP 4.
HTN:  On BB, clonidine, norvasc and minoxidil 8.
Following injection of 1ml of diluted Optison (3ml with 7ml of saline), there was prompt enhancement of the mid-septum extending into the moderator band.
Alcohol 0.5ml and then 0.5ml (total 2ml) were then injected during direct echo visualization.
Dobutamine was then increased to 30mcg/kg/min with resultant 36mmHg peak LVOT gradient.
Dobutamine was then stopped with resting LVOT gradient of 30mmHg.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o male with HOCM, severe PVD and kidney/pancreatic transplant admitted for elective ethanol septal ablation.
Pt underwent successful ethanol ablation of septum, with reduction in LVOT gradient with valsalva and dobutamine (see above).
However, given his low septum thickness, lack of family history or low age, it was decided to try holter monitoring for 4-6 weeks before ICD implantation.
