HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplant complicated by multiple episodes of increased LFTs secondary to common bile duct stenosis treated with stents who presented with rigors and fevers of 105.
He had been seen initially at [**Hospital6 48708**] and received empiric coverage.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol, status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2126-6-15**], complicated by portal vein thrombosis, status post lysis and stent placement on [**2126-6-27**], also with CBD stricture in the common bile duct with stent placement, history of portal hypertension with esophageal varices, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, GERD, anxiety and depression, and degenerative joint disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Rapamune 1 mg once a day, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg twice a day, Valcyte 450 mg once a day, prednisone 7.5 mg once a day, Bactrim single strength once a day, fluconazole 400 mg once a day, Lopressor 37.5 mg b.i.d., Atrovent 2 puffs p.r.n., albuterol 2 puffs q.4 hours, Paxil 20 mg once a day, Protonix 40 mg once a day, ursodiol 300 mg p.o.
t.i.d., ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
He was started on imipenem and vancomycin and fluconazole.
He was started on an insulin drip as well for hypoglycemia.
The patient was intubated for respiratory distress.
An ERCP was done, and it was noted that his biliary stent was infected.
A new biliary stent was placed.
He underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram given blood cultures.
Of note, the patient underwent placement of two 8 French pigtail catheters and 2 liver collections on [**9-12**].
His Coumadin was resumed.
Unfortunately he removed his PICC line that was placed for long-term antibiotics, as well as the 2 pigtail catheters placed in the liver bile leaks.
He underwent replacement of 2 left hepatic abscess collection drains.
His antibiotics were changed per infectious disease to include daptomycin for the VRE and meropenem for the Clostridium, as well as the Klebsiella.
He remained on daptomycin and meropenem for the remainder of this hospital course.
He remained on daptomycin for this.
He was given albuterol and Atrovent inhalers with improvement.
He remained on the medical surgical unit where he was evaluated by physical therapy who recommended rehab based on the slow progress of functional activities.
Occupational therapy evaluated the patient and recommended rehab for inability to complete ADLs.
It was noted that the 2 percutaneous pigtail catheters were located in the left hepatic lobe with slight interval decrease in size of the 2 hepatic abscesses.
The PICC line was replaced after the patient self-removed.
A second hepatic artery stent was placed with good angiographic result.
After the hepatic artery stent was placed, his alkaline phosphatase continued to increase slightly each day from 304 up to 406.
The plan was to discharge him to [**Hospital **] Rehab for further physical therapy, IV antibiotics and nutrition support.
He should followup in the outpatient clinic with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9404**] to evaluate further IV antibiotic needs, specifically meropenem and daptomycin.
The length of course of antibiotics depends on further repeat imaging to assess the resolution of hepatic collections.
He should also have a CBC with differential, LFTs, CHEM10 and trough Rapamune levels every Monday and Thursday.
Of note, the patient needs to be scheduled in the future for biliary stent change.
