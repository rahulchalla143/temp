Approx 4 months ago, pt began experiencing DOE associated with mild chest tightness; this began happening near the end of 2 mile daily walks that she had previously finished without difficulty.
When the DOE did not respond to asthma Rx and in fact progressed such that she had dyspnea and marked chest discomfort with routine daily activities, she saw a cardiologist.
Past Medical History: Spina Bifida Surgery as infant Raynaud's phenomenon   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: Her father had symptomatic CAD requiring stents at age 60.

2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, short axis slices (8 mm slices with 2 mm gaps), sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index and end-diastolic volume index were normal.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] right coronary artery with origin from the left coronary cusp, luminal narrowing proximally, and anterior course between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery (malignant).
Cardiac surgery was consulted and on [**12-21**] she was taken to the operating room where she underwent repair of anomaolous RCA.
On POD #3, her epicardial wires were pulled and she underwent rest thallium study which was normal.
