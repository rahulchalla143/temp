She was discharged off of her Valsartan (due to renal failure) and Carvedilol (due to symptomatic bradycardia).
She also saw transplant surgery for her fistula.

Cardiac History: Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2141**]/[**2142**]/[**2144**] anatomy as follows: -CAD s/p multiple PCIs in the past: - [**10-18**]: S/P PTCA w/ stenting of the distal PLB and distal RCA lesions - [**10-19**] cath: LAD had a 40-50% stenoses, RCA with a 30-40% ISR in the  previously placed patent proximal stent, 80% stenosis in PDA and a widely  patent PL stent with 30-40% stenosis - [**4-21**]: PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA .
PVD: - [**5-18**]: Right femoral to dorsalis pedis in situ bypass graft with greater saphenous vein, angioscopy with valve lysis.
- [**5-18**]: Right first and second toe amputations and left first toe amputation.
- [**10-18**] peripheral cath: LLE disease, CIA normal, EIA 90% distal lesion, s/p  cutting balloon, right lower extremity normal - [**1-20**]: Status post left carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty - [**10-22**]: US follow-up of her carotid stenosis and bilateral bypass grafts.
EXTREMITIES: WWP, LUE antecubital fistula with palp thrill, L>R LE edema, mild erythema over LLE, bandage on LLE from VNA, several small open blisters, no tenderness, no purulence, no fluctuance, 1+ peripheral pulses.
EXTREMITIES: WWP, LUE antecubital fistula with palp thrill, L>R  LE edema, chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally, 1+ peripheral pulses.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: Patient with weight gain, lower extremity edema, CXR consistent with volume overload, BNP elevated to >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**] therefore likely acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation [**2-15**] stopping carvedilol and Valsartan.
Patient required intermittent bipap over the first 48 hours of admission.
Also empirically treated for pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin though this was stopped when the patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis and repeat CXR did not show any underlying infiltrate.
She was started on lasix gtt and metolazone.
She still required bipap after this initial diuresis so in conjunction with renal consult and the patient's outpatient nephrologist dialysis was initiated through a tunnelled HD line (AV fistula not yet mature).
She received 3 days of dialysis in the MICU and her oxygenation improved.
She states this is chronic, but covered empirically with Ceftriazxone given allergy to Bacrim and Cipro.
# Renal Failure: Creatinine basline on admission.
Increased somewhat with lasix gtt.
Her medications were renally dosed.
Dialysis was initiated as above.
Calcitriol was initially started and then stopped secondary to possible cost in the outpatient setting.
Likely due to ESRD and iron deficiency.
# Diabetes: Patient's sugar well controlled on glargine 15QAM and insulin sliding scale initially, but glargine was uptitrated during her stay to 20Units.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Patient given vitamin K given her low HCT and high INR.
Coumadin was held.
She was not not bridged with heparin due to procedures (HD line placement).
Her coumadin was restarted when the INR trended down and then held again because it trended up to 3.1.
Her coumadin was held again and it trended down to ###### .
# OSA: typically on CPAP at night, but doing better on Bipap initially.
As fluid was taken off at hemodialysis she was switched to CPAP at night and weaned off nasal cannula during the day.
# Hypertension: Patient initially started on home meds including valsartan.
