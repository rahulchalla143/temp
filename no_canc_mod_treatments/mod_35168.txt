Hypoxic respiratory failure: He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior to the VATS procedure and per the OSH report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.
Apparently he initally did well after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.
Small PTX on am CXR - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs.
- check b12, folate, iron studies - trend for now - guaiac all stools .
- maintain excellent BP control - rate control as below .
Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient and coumadin for anticoagulation.
- re-start coumadin per thorasics - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control w/ metoprolol for now .
[**5-30**] - Extubated, high O2 requirement, on 80% facemask - CT placed to waterseal, PTX stable - Weaned to 5L NC .
would HOLD mtx indefinitely and defer further tx choices to outpt rheum - path prelim c/w UIP, discussed with family - vanc trough 7, increased to 1g [**Hospital1 **] from 750mg [**Hospital1 **] - seen by speech and swallow failed swallow -> made npo .
[**6-1**] - increased PTX, changed CT to suction from water seal - changed zosyn dosing - MIE Q2H, chest PT - NG tube placed, pulled out of position with question aspiration event, replaced .
[**6-2**]: - desat to 70s up to 70% facemask PLUS nasal canula, but subsequently weaned weaned down to 35% without NC - afib with rvr got 5mg metoprolol with good response - CT placed back to suction given inc. size of PTX -> waterseal this AM - Family mtg held, ok to reintubate, if reach point with little hope of improvement, family will likely withdraw care .
[**6-3**] - chest tube put on waterseal again in AM, but ptx worse on repeat chest film to returned to low wall suction - restarted digoxin - pulled out NGT -------- [**6-4**] -HR mainly in the 70-80s but occasional sympathetic driven spikes to 140-150. continued dig 0.125mg daily and changed PO lopressor to 5mg IV lopressor IV q4hrs -patient desats with any slight movement, for the most part on 6L NC -plan to call family regarding any need for intubation and they will likely say to not intubate at this point, still full code currently though -I/O goal even, by 7 p.m. even -changed CT to water seal, no real change in PTX, per thoracics attg patient will need pleuradesis as he will unlikely improve given stiff lungs related to ILD -MIE stopped -decreased solumedrol to 20mg IV x 1 today, with a plan to continue weaning rapidly -S+S to re-eval [**2120-6-5**] -haldol 0.5mg started tid prn anxiety ------- [**6-6**] - family meeting regarding goals of care - thoracics placed pneumo stat - repeat evening CXR with worsening PTX so placed on suction - 9 pm repeat evening CXR improved - started bactrim for PNA - d/c'ed all nonessential po meds -------------- -re-trial of pneumo-stat failed -chest tube replaced and placed to suction, plan to place to water seal in a.m. prior to discharge home with hospice.

You are being sent home with a chest tube to "water seal" meaning there is no significant suctioning applied to the space between your lung and chest wall but air cannot enter from the outside.
Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
You should also increase your supplemental oxygen prior to movement.
