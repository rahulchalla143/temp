Admission Date:  [**2196-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2150-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, chills x 3 days; myalgias, fatigue x 2 weeks  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical Ventilation (intubation/extubation) Tracheostomy PEG tube placement Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension who presents from home with fevers, chills, myalgias and SOB.
At that time symptoms were attributed to mild flu and he was instructed to take tylenol and drink plenty of fluids.
On Sunday he was prescribed a Zpack and inhaler over the phone.
He was also given Levofloxacin for pneumonia and ibuprofen for fever.
Patient is admitted for recurrent pneumonia.
ROS: Denies night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
Trach site clean/dry/intact CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, normal S1/S2 Pulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rhonchi/rales - very mild wheeze in left upper lobe anteriorly Abd: +BS, soft, non-tender/distended, PEG site clean/dry/intact - slight erythema on right side Ext: no cyanosis/ecchymosis/edema, PICC site in right antecubital   Pertinent Results: [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   WBC-9.3 RBC-4.17* HGB-13.0* HCT-38.1* MCV-91 MCH-31.3 MCHC-34.2 RDW-13.4 [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   NEUTS-76.1* LYMPHS-18.4 MONOS-4.1 EOS-1.0 BASOS-0.4 [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   PLT COUNT-322 [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   ALBUMIN-2.9* [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   ALT(SGPT)-94* AST(SGOT)-88* LD(LDH)-431* ALK PHOS-146* TOT BILI-0.2 [**2196-7-5**] 05:50PM   GLUCOSE-109* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-13  [**2196-7-8**] @ 1600: HIV viral load 61,600 copies  CXR [**7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Patchy ill-defined opacities within both lungs, most pronounced within the left mid and upper lung field, which could represent areas of infection.
At this time he was also started on vanco/cefepime in addition to the [**Month/Year (2) **].
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-8**], Bactrim IV was started, as well as Prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 5 days, given low PaO2 in the setting of PCP.
ID was consulted on [**7-9**] and recommended holding off on HAART at this time.
In the setting of this ARDS physiology, prednisone was subsequently increased to 40 PO BID from 60mg PO Qam per ID.
PaO2 was stable, but worsening hypercarbia required intubation on [**7-11**] on volume assist control with ARDS tidal volume.
By [**7-12**], he met SIRS criteria for tachycardia and fever, and steroids were increased to 40 mg Q6hrs.
Antibiotics were extended to cipro, cefepime, and vancomycin.
Steroids were weaned back to 40mg daily by [**7-15**] and abx were decreased to just [**Month/Day (4) **] for coagulase negative staph aureus bacteria, with discontinuation of [**Month/Day (4) **] by [**7-18**].
He developed thickened secretions, leukocytosis, persistent fever, and worsening hypoxia by [**7-24**] concerning for ventilator associated pneumonia, so he was started on vancomycin, cefepime, cipro x 8 days for VAP (completed on [**7-31**]).
Steroids were decreased to 20 mg daily given lack of evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation and concern that steroids could be harmful in the setting of second pneumonia.
However, sputum samples continued to reveal only yeast and normal oropharyngeal flora, and bronch could not be performed due to hypoxia/high PEEP requirement.
There was concern that weaning from ventilation was being limited by ET tube placement and/or obstruction with secretions, bronchoscopy was performed on [**7-27**], with the removal of thick secretions but no frank ET obstruction.
By [**8-3**], Bactrim was decreased to prophylactic dosing and prednisone was tapered off.
MAC prophylaxis with Azithromycin was started on [**8-4**].
PEEP was difficult to wean, but by [**7-29**], tracheostomy and g-tube were placed.
Upon call out from MICU, patient was breathing well with trach and trach mask in place.
He also had chest physical therapy while on the floor.
- Continue chest physical therapy - Continue Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers q6hrs .
# SEDATION/AGITATION MANAGEMENT: Intubated on [**7-11**] with Fentanyl and Midazolam.
Propofol and Cisatracurium were added on [**7-12**] due to inadequate sedation; these agents were discontinued on [**7-13**].
Sedation became greatly limited by episodic tachycardia and HTN in the setting of anxiety and agitation, requiring intermittent restarting/ discontinuing of Fentanyl drip and frequent adjustment/bolus doses of Midazolam, Methadone, and Zyprexa doses.
Maximum dose of Zyprexa was reached, so it was discontinued and Quetiapine was started.
Clonidine was added for duel function as antihypertensive and sedative.
Adequate anti-anxiety/agitation control was achieved with Midazolam boluses prn and standing Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine, and Methadone by [**8-5**].
Upon call out from the MICU, patient continued to elicit anxiety.
Of note, he was continued on albuterol nebulizers throughout this time.
- Continue Diazepam 7mg qHS/5mg q12hrs PRN, Fluoxetine 10mg daily, Seroquel 75mg qHS/25mg qHS PRN .
Antibiotics were extended to cipro, cefepime, and vancomycin and extraneous lines were removed.
His abx coverage was decreased to just vancomycin after blood culture from [**7-12**] grew out 1 bottle of coag negative staph, but vanco was discontinued on [**7-18**] due to the low suspicion for CoNSA bacteremia in stable clinical setting.
Upon call out to the floor from the MICU, patient's foley was discontinued and urinalysis showed no signs of urinary tract infection.
Patient was switched from Bactrim to Atovaquone on [**2196-8-16**] for possible drug fevers with plans to transition patient to Dapsone.
Because there was concern for metheomoglobulinemia, G6PD labs were ordered first.
At time of discharge, this was still pending, so the switch from Atovaquone to Dapsone was held until patient sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
- Will follow-up on Stool Cultures/O and P/Cdiff - Patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if his low-grade fevers persist despite being on Dapsone .
# BP LABILITY: His outpatient regimen of Lisinopril and HCTZ were held due to the development of hypotension in the setting of SIRS by [**7-12**].
He required pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin) due to a worsening septic picture.
He was off all pressors by [**7-16**].
He began to develop HTN on [**7-24**], with SBP to 250s systolic and associated tachycardia to 160s, which normalized of BP following hydralazine bolus followed by labetalol bolus then labetalol drip.
MAPs were improved with IVF and low-dose Levophed, which was discontinued by [**7-26**].
Attempts to wean sedation resulted in intermittent spikes in BP and HR, which were somewhat improved after trach placement.
He continued to experience intermittent, volume-responsive drops in BP while being weaned from sedation.
He last received pressors after a hypotensive episode during GJ-tube placement in the setting of sedation on [**8-3**]; pressors were discontinued when sedation was lifted.
His blood pressure was subsequently maintained on Clonidine patch, started [**8-3**], and IVF boluses as needed for intermittent hypotension in the setting of extensive autodiuresis.
There was concern for possible adrenal insufficiency given urine sodium wasting and hypotension, with cortisol from [**8-5**] pending.
By the time patient was called out of the MICU, his blood pressure was stable on Clonidine patch.
He was not restarted on his home medications of HCTZ and Lisinopril.
- Continue Clonidine patch .
He was started on IV fluids as he is likely dehydrated secondary to infection, fever, and dehydration.
It was thought this was due to his inhalers and anxiety component.
- Continue above regimen for anxiety.
Despite side effect of tachycardia, patient should continue on Albuterol nebulizers .
Started on iron supplementation.
He received 1 unit of PRBC with appropriate increase in Hct to 22 and stable Hct thereafter.
# ELEVATED LIPASE: Lipase was within normal limits at the time of admission but peaked at 389 on [**7-30**] following propofol use in the setting of extubation.
Lipase peaked at 420 again after GJ tube placement on [**8-3**] (no propofol was used.)
# URINE ELECTROLYTES.
As per above, there was concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of low BP, but patient was ruled out with cortisol stimulation test.
As per above, adequate anti-anxiety/agitation control was achieved with Midazolam boluses prn and standing Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine, and Methadone by [**8-5**].
- Continue anxiolytic regimen per above .
# POOR GI MOTILITY: NG tube with tube feeds were initiated following intubation.
High tube feed residuals with no BM were noted by [**7-14**].
A bowel regimen including lactulose enema was given, producing a bowel movement by [**7-16**].
A post-pyloric Dobhoff was placed on [**7-18**].
Tube feeds were resumed [**7-20**] but TF material was found coming from his mouth the same day, and NG suction revealed 450 cc residuals.
Imaging revealed that the Dobhoff was not post-pyloric and lipase increased, so TPN was started on [**7-23**] ending tube advancement.
After Dobhoff was advanced, tube feeds were restarted on [**7-26**] and slowly advanced without significant residuals.
Given his history of poor GI motility and high tube feed residuals with pre-pyloric feeds, GJ tube was placed on [**8-3**], with tube feeds started on [**8-4**].
Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2196-8-16**] cleared patient for Thin Liquids, Regular Solids with re-evaluation by nutrition and speech/swallow as outpatient when patient can be weaned off his G-tube.
- Continue TPN until can be weaned - Continue Thin Liquids/Regular Solids Diet - Patient can take pills whole with water or in puree - Nutrition Consult and Speech and Swallow Eval when weaning patient off PEG tube - Continue oral care every 8 hours .
When ARDS picture improved, bactrim was dosed at prophylactic doses for PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**8-3**], and azithromycin prophylaxis for MAC were started.
Patient was switched from bactrim to dapsone on [**2196-8-16**] after concerns that the bactrim was causing drug fever.
- Continue Darunavir, Ritonavir and Truvada.
# FEN: GJ-tube placement with TFs started on [**8-4**].
Glycemic control was discontinued due to glucose levels consistently <150.
- Continue TPN until patient can be weaned - Continue Thin Liquids/Regular Solids Diet - Patient can take pills whole with water or in puree - Nutrition Consult and Speech and Swallow Eval when weaning patient off PEG tube - Continue oral care every 8 hours .
