Pt had a percutaneous R nephrostomy tube placed by IR with frank pus draining out.
Pt was started on decadron, weaned from levophed, and continued on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl to cover from likely source of kidney abscess.
Pt was stabilized, transferred to the medical floor, where she was continued on Levo only.

Pt's mental status on admission was likely due to a combination of taking too much narcotics and sepsis.
