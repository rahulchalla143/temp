Admission Date:  [**2132-10-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-1-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line placement Intubation Mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: 42F with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis transferred from OSH for acute on chronic pancreatitis.
Alcoholism - sober from [**7-26**] until now Depression Anxiety/Panic Attacks Brain aneurysm (Dx [**9-25**])/VP shunt for hydrocephalus (placed [**12-28**] at [**Hospital1 112**]) Tonsillectomy C-Section   Social History: Smokes [**12-21**] cigarettes/day.
Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous contrast.
Pancreatitis with decreased pancreatic enhancement suggestive of necrosis; copious peripancreatic, retroperitoneal and mesenteric fluid without evidence of hemorrhage or pseudocyst formation.
[**10-26**] BETA GLUCAN NEGATIVE .
She did not tolerate ARDSnet volumes and was on pressure support for two weeks until tracheostomy was placed after which she weaned to trach mask rapidly.
She became hypotensive requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
A NJ tube was placed to start TFs.
Her TG were noted to be elevated to 7,000, and pt was started on gemfibrozil.
She was empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 14 days (meropenem + ciprofloxacin) given necrotic pancreatitis.
She also required an insulin gtt to control her blood glucose.
Lipase peaked at 1300 on the day of admission, but had trended down to 35 within 5 days.
General surgery was reconsulted however they did not feel a need to intervene.
She was continued on sliding scale insulin as well as evening lantus (40 units) to maintain sugars given hypo-endocrine function and started on pancrease replacement for hypo-exocrine function.
She was scheduled for follow up with general surgery on [**12-5**] at 1015 AM for follow up following discharge from rehab.
Her pain was well managed on dilaudid PO.
She required brief paralysis an esophageal balloon to maximize PEEP given initial difficulties with oxygenation.
She never tolerate AC to achieve ARDSNet volumes for a prolonged time; therefore, she was largely on pressure support pulling high volumes.
Given her diffuse bilateral intersitial infiltrates, leukoctyosis in the mid-20 range, and persistent fevers, she was emprically treated for VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, cipro for two weeks.
Tracheostomy placed [**10-24**].
Speech and swallow service saw pt on the day of discharge and fitted her for a passy-muir valve.
A repeat abdominal CT showed development of small area of wall thickening near uterus communicative with peripancreatic fluid as above however our suspicion for intervention was low given that her WBC trended back down and remained afebrile.
PO vancomycin was continued as above given her loose stools.
Fluid overload: In the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation for pancreatitis and diffuse third spacing.
Excellent diuresis was achived with lasix drip and metolazone.
This was converted to IV lasix by bolus prior to transfer to floor.
Her IV lasix drip was stopped prior to transfer to floor and her PO lasix was discontinued after one day.
We suggested that further diuresis with diuretics is not indicating since she is self-diuresing, and given her significant metabolic alkalosis, she is likely quite volume depleted intravascularly.
Magnesium and K repleted daily with K goal > 3.5.
Nutrition - Was getting tube feeds for high caloric demand given pancreatitis, however upon transfer to floor pulled out NG tube.
Would recommend continued assessment of nutritional intake in rehab facility and would consider nutritional consultation for further input given that she still has continued caloric demands secondary to resolving pancreatitis.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Ventilator Associated PNA   Discharge Condition: Medically stable for discharge to rehabilitation   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 84691**],  You were admitted to the hospital with acute on chronic pancreatitis.
The inflammation caused by your pancreas was severe enough to cause damage to your lungs requiring intubation for two weeks.
A tracheostomy was placed in your neck because we had difficulty getting you off the breathing machine.
If all goes well, your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] be [**Name5 (PTitle) 460**] to remove this tracheostomy within the next few months.
We started you on a medicine to treat this called vancomycin which you should continue to complete 10 days of it on [**2132-11-10**].
For this reason, we started you on insulin which they can continue to give you at the rehabilitation facility.
Your blood sugars should improve over time as your pancreas heals.
You still have significant amounts of edema (swelling) as a consequence of the fluid you received for the pancreatitis.
The medication changes we made during this hospitalization are in summary: (1) Started vancomycin by mouth, which you should take for your loose stools.
(2) Started insulin as needed on a sliding scale to manage your sugars.
Over time, you will likely be able to come off insulin as your pancreas heals.
You should continue to take lantus 40 units at night with dinner.
The doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] help [**Name5 (PTitle) **] get off this medicine as your pain improves.
(6) Started nystatin which you can continue to use for your oral thrush.
The fentanyl patch can be discontinued over time at the discretion of the rehab facility.
(11) We had held your citalopram and wellbutrin while you were here because they can make you sleepy on top of the other medicines.
(12) You can continue your other home medicines as per your home regimen.
