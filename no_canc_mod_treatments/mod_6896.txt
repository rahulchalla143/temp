At the outside hospital he ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction, which was associated with one episode of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which was easily reversed to normal sinus rhythm with direct shock cardioversion followed by lidocaine bolus and drip after which the patient was transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
The chest pain was accompanied by shortness of breath, which is his usual anginal equivalent and was unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin, so he went to a local hospital in [**State 1727**] where his symptoms were improved with treatment of oxygen and nitroglycerin.
O2 sat 88% on room air.
He was started on nitroglycerin and heparin drips.
Lidocaine drip was started at that time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, status post laser eye surgery, probable neuropathy, hypercholesterolemia on a lipid lower placebo controlled study currently.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Isordil 60 mg q.a.m., Trental 400 mg q.a.m., Diovan 160 mg q.a.m., Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.a.m., Prilosec 20 mg q.a.m., aspirin 161 mg q.d..  Lipid study pills, Toprol XL 25 mg q.h.s., insulin NPH 30 units q.a.m.
Groin 2+ femoral bruits.
Troponin initially 0.83, peaked at 22.9.
In summary, the catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial mitral regurgitation, left main 50%, left anterior descending coronary artery 90%, left circumflex diffusely diseased and right coronary artery diffusely diseased.
The Cardiothoracic Service was consulted and the patient was seen and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On [**10-27**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times five.
In summary, he had a coronary artery bypass graft times five with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and ramus sequentially.
Saphenous vein graft to diagonal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer the patient had an arterial line, a Swans-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two apical pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes and one left pleural chest tube.
He was on Propofol at 30 mics per kilogram per minute and nitroglycerin at 1 mcg per kilogram per minute.
The patient's postoperative course was initially complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 150s for which he was cardioverted into a normal sinus rhythm and an Amiodarone drip was begun.
On the morning of postoperative day one he was weaned from the ventilator and extubated successfully.
He also had an increase in his creatinine and potassium levels on postoperative day one for which nephrology was consulted.
On postoperative day three he was deemed safe and ready for transfer to Floor Six for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
The patient remained on postoperative cardiac surgery floor for the next four days where he was monitored for his hemodynamic and his renal status.
O2 sat 92% on room air.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 400 mg q.d., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d.
Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Lasix 40 mg q.d., times ten days, potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents q.d.
times ten days, NPH insulin 35 units q.a.m.
and 18 units q.p.m., Humalog insulin sliding scale, Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs q 4 hours prn.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times five.
