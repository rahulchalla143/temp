He was continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin initially.
Thereafter, BP were normal with the exception of one event during hemodialysis; this episode of hypotension was attributed to not taking midodrine prior to hemodialysis as the patient normally does.
As the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, the antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was discharged home.
As above blood pressure stabilized and he was dialyzed on HD 1 and 3.
A cardiac evaluation for heart failure was attempted; troponin 0.05 but the patient declined further cardiac biomarkers and ECHO.
Patient was continued on his home statin and ASA.
