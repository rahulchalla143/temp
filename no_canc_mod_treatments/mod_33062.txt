Reports mild meningismus on formal testing, although he flexes and rotates his neck freely during casual conversation.
Radiologic Data: MRI head: "Bilateral subdural fluid collections that demonstrate duffisue pachymeningeal enhancement with no evidence of associated blood products.
His headaches remained difficult to control and both psychiatry and pain management were consulted.
He was tried temporarily on ultram and fiorecet, but there was concern for ultram interacting with his psych meds (the combination with wellbutrin was concerning for lowering seizure threshold) and the fiorecet was being overused, so it was DC'd out of concern for generating rebound headaches.
Venlafaxine was tried as well temporarily and ultimately switched for nortriptyline.
We referred him to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1194**] Center (for which he'll need a formal referral from his PCP) for possible trigger point injection, and also for follow up with his outpatient psychiatry NP, and we plan on faxing a list of possible outpatient psychiatrists to his PCP for him to follow up with.
We urged him to follow up with his PCP to have his INR followed and gave him a prescription for bloodwork for INR as soon as possible.
