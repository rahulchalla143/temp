Admission Date:  [**2160-7-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-8-15**]   Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] originally presented to an outside hospital on [**7-21**] with bright red blood per rectum, where he underwent a colonoscopy.
On the [**7-29**], he passed bowel movement and clots in large amounts to a total output of 1700 cubic centimeters.
Angiography was also undertaken to identify the bleeding vessel to guide surgical intervention and to attempt occlusion of the bleeding vessel.
After being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where Mr. [**Known lastname **] received numerous transfusion of packed red blood cells and crystalloid, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was prepared for surgery and underwent a subtotal colectomy on [**2160-8-2**].
Incidental finding at the time of surgery was that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was asplenic, presumably because his spleen had been removed at the time of his prior surgery for bleeding diverticula-a right hemicolectomy.
The procedure was without complication.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6237**] past medical history was significant for diverticulosis with recurrent lower GI bleeding for which he was treated with a right hemicolectomy in [**2156**] at an outside hospital.
He followed a conservative postoperative regimen, which included post-surgical bowel rest, routine labs, and chemistries.
On postoperative day #4, a series of Lasix doses were started in an attempt to gently diurese the fluid that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had received during his surgery.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 6237**] abdomen remained distended, through postoperative day #7, he was started on total parenteral nutrition on that day and this continued until he was taking adequate nutrition PO.
He was continued on a regimen of IV and then PO Lasix to continue his diuresis of fluids and the abdominal examination was followed serially until it was felt that he was tolerating the clear diet well and solid foods could be reintroduced.
More vigorous diuresis using Lasix (Furosemide) was started and by postoperative day #12, Mr. [**Known lastname 6237**] room air oxygen saturation was 98%.
