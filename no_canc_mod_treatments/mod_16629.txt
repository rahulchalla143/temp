Also ?contributed to by oxycodone/oxycontin overuse, as patient very intent on getting his pain medication and both are hepatically metabolized.
B12 deficiency was ruled out with normal B12 levels, RPR sent, but pending at time of discharge.
Seizure disorder was also initially entertained, as patient had a history of seizures in [**4-3**], attributed to his oxycodone/oxycontin withdrawl and cocaine and heroin use, but had incomplete follow up (patient failed to show up at scheduled MRI and neurology appointment).
Patient was treated with lactulose 60mL QID, titrated to 4 Bowel movements/day, and decreased dose of oxycontin to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] (from 60mg [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient) with improvement of mentation/somnolence.
Also was kept on his outpatient dose of B12, and given thiamine and folate, even though no evidence of alcohol use x 1.5 years.
Patient's hepatic encephalopathy resolved, and patient was discharged on home dose of lactulose (30mL TID, titrate to 3 bowel movements/day) with instructions to follow up with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] hepatology, and with pain clinic appointment for further management of his ongoing pain issues (SEE below).
Patient on nadolol as an outpatient.
Nadolol was held and Atropine and glucogon given in the ED with minimal improvement.
EP was consulted and initially recommended placement of pacemaker, which patient refused at current time and also non-candidate as evidence of recent IVDU.
Therefore, patient's nadolol continued to be held throughout hospital course, and was discharged off of nadolol with plans to follow up with PCP and hepatology.
Currently on oxycodone and oxycontin (60mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Has been on methadone in past.
During hospital course, oxycontin dose was decreased to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] (as above, as ?mental status changes contributed to by oxycontin/codone use), and oxycodone was held (although given x 2 due to patient's pain).
Therefore discharged with instructions to take the decreased dose of oxycodone and oxycontin only as needed and follow up with pain clinic for further managment.
Nadolol was held during hospitalization in setting of bradycardia as described above.
Per OSH records, secondary to narcotic (oxycontin/codone) withdrawl and cocaine and heroin use.
PPX: Patient maintained on SC heparin, protonix, bowel regimen throughout hospital course.
