Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old man with a past medical history of multiple medical problems including ESRD on HD, multiple previous [**Year (4 digits) 12916**] (MRSA, ESBL E. coli, VSE) s/p fall with C2 fracture [**4-28**] with progressive collapse s/p ORIF C2 and posterior instrumentation C1-C5 and left iliac crest bone graft placement [**7-31**].
He presented from HD after reported intermittent confusion and brief episodes of shaking.
Initial thoughts were possible seizures vs medication (ertapenem/meropenem) side effect, as he recently started taking ertapenem for his iliac crest infection on [**2127-8-29**].
The patient's symptoms progressed on HD2, with increased shaking, agitation and slurred speech.
He received his LP, but during the procedure he required 1mg of Ativan for sedation.
He acutely desaturated requiring nonrebreather and suction.
Patient was disoriented and lethargic.
MICU consulted and patient transferred for management of respiratory distress from the IR suite.
He remained intubated, but his mental status started to improve once he was off  carbopenem antibiotics and switched to aztreonam.
He had two sessions of hemodialysis while in the ICU, which he tolerated well while intubated.
He was sussessfully weaned off the ventilator and was mentating well.
His PICC line became displaced requring reinsertion on [**2127-9-26**].
The patient did have episodes of mild sundowning/delirium, but was easily reoriented and never required sedating medications.
His acute mental status changes were felt to be due to administartion of carbopenems, given his rapid recovery off these medications.
# History of Iliac crest infection: Patient started on a six week course of Ertepenem on [**2127-8-29**].
Continue Aztreonam as recommended by ID.
He was evaluated by ortho spine prior to discharge and received cervical spine xrays.
Likely a medication effect.
ESRD on HD: Resume prior HD schedule on discharge.
ASA held for potential interventions and history of GIB.
# COPD: Patient required ipratropium and albuterol inhalers on prior admissions.
Rec'd albuterol/ipratropium nebs PRN for respiratory congestion.
