Admission Date:  [**2122-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-12-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: SOB, "Sweating"  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with LAD angioplasty and stenting Endotracheal Intubation   History of Present Illness: The patient woke up this morning severely dyspneic and diaphoretic.
She had several stents placed throughout this artery.
She had several episodes of hypotension in the cath lab and a balloon pump was placed.
She was sent to the CCU with balloon pump and PA catheter in place.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: After cath, she came to the CCU on a balloon pump and intubated.
Her beta-blocker and ACE-I were held due to BP issues.
Once she recovered from this, and her vitals were improving, she was slowly started back on her ACE and B-blocker without issue.
She was initially on heparin due to akinetic apex.
A repeat echo several days post-cath showed improvement and her heparin was stopped.
2.Pump: She was initally on a balloon pump, but this was removed in the morning after admission, as she was holding her own BP without issue, and tolerated weaning trials.
She was initially on dopamine as well.
She had received lasix in ED, and had a large diuresis.
We believe she was hypovolemic at that point, and her BP responded well to a 1L fluid bolus.
All walls are mobile enough for her to not require chronic anticoagulation.
4.Pulmonary: She was intubated on arrival.
She did have some blood tinged sputum, but this was likely the result of ET tube trauma, and gradually faded.
6.DMII: She was initially maintained on sliding scale insulin.
When she began eating, her home oral meds were added back.
7.FEN:She was given maintenance fluids initially, then began eating and drinking on her own.
Her Lasix was stopped, but her other home BP meds were kept at their original doses.
She was also put on Plavix and understands the need to keep taking this for 6 months no matter what.
