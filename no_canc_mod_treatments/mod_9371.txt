Blood, CSF, and urine cultures remained negative (including for legionella for virus).
It was unclear how to interpret this result so it was felt that the patient should complete a course of ceftriaxone at the meningeal dose.
-PICC placed for completion of 14d course of ceftriaxone 2g iv qd -pleural effusions should be followed radiographically.
3)Hilar LAD- finding on chest CT.  should be followed as outpt in [**5-20**] weeks pending radiographic resolution of PNA   -f/u as outpt w/repeat CT.(however note below)  ***post hospital course c/b discovery of AFB positive sputum culture, as per attg note PMD contact[**Name (NI) **] who was to contact pt.
Ceftriaxone Sodium 2 g Recon Soln Sig: One (1)  Intravenous once a day for 8 days.
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QD (once a day).
Take all your prescribed medications 2.
1) Consider repeat CXR to follow-up your pleural effusions 2) Need to address initiating HAART (anti-retroviral) therapy
