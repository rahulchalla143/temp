She was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department and found to be somnolent but arousable and was given Narcan 0.4 mg intravenously with improvement in her mental status.

The patient was initially started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for a question aspiration pneumonia and given 125 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department for question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Off oxygen, the patient saturated between 92% to 94% on room air with occasional desaturations to 88% to 90% on room air.
Given the improvement in her oxygen saturations and her mental status, her symptoms were attributed to the change from Percocet to MS Contin.
The MS Contin was discontinued, and the patient was placed on her Percocet for pain.
She did well in the Intensive Care Unit with oxygen saturations as described above without the need for antibiotics or steroids.
She will continue on her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease regimen via meter-dosed inhalers.
PAIN CONTROL:  The patient continued to take Percocet without change in mental status.
At this point, the patient should avoid longer-acting narcotics at this time.
Her NPH was cut in half to 31 units of NPH b.i.d.
PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was continued on her psychiatric medications as before.
