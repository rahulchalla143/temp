Prior to that, she was using her oxygen continuously, taking her inhalers as scheduled, and walking around her house/doing daily tasks without any difficulty breathing.
In the ED, patient's vital signs were stable, but was noted to be lethargic with poor air movment on pulmonary exam, both of which improved with nebulizers, solumedrol, and azithromycin/CFTX.
She was started on continuous albuterol inhalers and intermittent BiPAP.
She was started on Levo/Flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA vs CAP and had a PICC line placed.
She was also started on steroids (prednisone 60 mg PO daily) for presumed COPD exacerbation.
Her CP resolved completely with 0.3 mg SL nitroglycerin and did not return during the remainder of the admission.
Noted to be having improved air movement during ICU stay, and was weaned from continuous to q3H ipratroprium and q6H albuterol nebs, and transitioned to oral prednisone prior to being called out to the floor.

Right PICC tip remains in the right subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89 yo F with COPD on 2 L home O2, pulmonary hypertension, CKD who presents with acute onset dyspnea likely c/w HCAP requiring ICU admission with continuous nebs and NIPPV, subsequently transferred to the medicine flow.
Shortness of Breath: Patient initially admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring continuous inhalers, NIPPV (BiPAP) and IV steroids.
Likely had a COPD exacerbation, triggered by a PNA (initially ?aspiration vs HCAP, but ultimately most likely HCAP given recent hospitalization and rehab stay).
Initially treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for HCAP, briefly switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration PNA in the MICU, subsequently switched to Vanc/Cipro for HCAP once on the general floor.
By [**7-14**], she was back to her baseline oxygen requirement of 2L NC with minimal shortness of breath.
Her home inhalers, spiriva and advair, were held during this admission.
We began a long prednisone taper starting on [**7-15**] (40mg x 3 days) and will continue with 20 mg qd x 3 days starting [**7-18**], then 10mg x 3 days starting [**7-21**].
We asked for palliative care's recommendations regarding symptom management and assistance with preventing re-hospitalization.
They recommended trying a small dose of liquid morphine 30 mins before activity to see if this might decrease shortness of breath (as trial for home).
We encouraged ambulation with walker and assistance, which she was eager to do.
# Chest Pain: Pt with episode of CP on morning of [**7-12**], resolved with SL nitro.
Enzymes were cycled, troponin of 0.05 was felt to be [**1-13**] demand ischemia in the setting of increased work of breathing, no concerning changes on EKG.
Likely in the setting of pt's respiratory distress, standing albuterol nebs and holding patient's beta-blocker.
The patient was restarted on her home medications, and had only mild elevated BPs in the setting of the prednisone taper (120s-140s today).
