Check ET tube placement.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
The tips of a dual channel supraclavicular right central venous catheter project over the SVC and superior cavoatrial junction respectively.
A right subclavian venous access catheter tip remains in the right atrium.
A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying uppermost right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was taken to the OR where she had Left AV upper arm graft placed for HD access secondary to ESRD.
Patient technically had fine placement of Left AV graft; however, during procedure patient had respiratory compromise/airway edema and was intubated.
Patient noted to have elevated troponinsX3 as above s/p airway management.
The patient was treated with Zosyn in hospital then Augmentin po x 6days postdischarge.
These medications were discontinued and patient improved mentally after several doses of flumazenil and narcan; however, patient was transferred to T/SICU for HD and observation on [**2172-6-4**].
Pt transferred back to floor ([**Hospital Ward Name **] 7) on [**2172-6-5**] and patient improved gradually, was hemodialyzed per renal recommendations, her diet was advanced as tolerated, and eventually was discharged on home meds as above with diabetes management [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consult recommendations which were the same as her prehospital insulin.
