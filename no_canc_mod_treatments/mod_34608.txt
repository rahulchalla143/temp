He was treated with Meropenum and linezolid given historical infections and pancytopenia last admission with vancomcyin treatment.
A PICC was placed on [**1-18**], and he was discharged to home with the plan to complete 8 more days of ertapenem (switched for ease of daily dosing) for a total 14 day course of carbapenem antibiotics.
He will plan to see him after this acute illness resolves and pull his foley, have him fitted for a condom cath, and recieve botox injections to the bladder.

# Pancytopenia:  Has had pancytopenic reaction to vancomycin in the past, noted to have downtrending WBC count during this stay while on linezolid.
His counts began to normalize after stopping the linezolid and with his clinical improvement.
# Transaminitis:  Patient's transaminitits elevated from baseline on admission, initially thought to be possibly secondary to hypotension with some element of shock liver.
His statin was held as a precautionary measure, and his liver enzymes trended back down to normal as his clinical status improved.
