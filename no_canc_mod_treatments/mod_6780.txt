Admission Date:  [**2161-5-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-7-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-11-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old male with a known history of hepatitis B virus for approximately 18 years, which has been resistant to lamivudine therapy as well as study drug ACH-[**Numeric Identifier 33100**] for ten weeks.
Glucotrol 5 mg p.o.
Adefovir 10 mg q. day started on [**2161-5-28**].
The patient was hepatitis A virus antibody positive, IgM negative, with hepatitis B serologies pending at the time of admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**] medicine firm for management of his hepatitis as well as coagulopathy management.
He was initially placed on prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a regimen of levofloxacin, Flagyl as well as vancomycin and Nystatin.
Throughout his medical intensive care unit course his coagulopathy was aggressively managed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  Additionally on [**2161-6-3**] the patient had a right internal jugular line placed and tube feeds were initiated.
In the medical intensive care unit the patient was observed closely for neurologic deterioration and he was placed on the transplant list and given approximately an 80% mortality with his encephalopathic picture and hepatic failure.
He remained intubated and sedated.
Surveillance cultures done throughout his MICU course had been negative to that point and the patient had been covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Initially they recommended change of the patient's central venous line and tip culture as well as a change of antibiotics to Zosyn, vancomycin and fluconazole.
Given that it was unclear at that time when a liver would be available for transplant, the neurosurgery service was consulted on [**2161-6-11**] for bullet placement for ICP management.
The patient's INR was corrected to a value of 1.5 with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
