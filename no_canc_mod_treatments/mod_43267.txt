Therapeutic paracentesis  History of Present Illness: 49M w/ polysubstance abuse, HCV, HBV, AIDS, autonomic dysfunction, and cirrhosis admitted after being found down at the T stop.
Here he was hypothermic with an elevated lactate and SPB ~70 and started on vancomycin/zosyn for presumed sepsis.
R rib fractures and his antibiotics were switched to levaquin/flagyl.
His labs were initially thought to be c/w a picture of DIC (low haptoglobin, low plt, low fibrinogen) but his OSH labs were eventually obtained and showed a chronic picture of liver failure (alt 71, ast 130, alp 719, tbili 1.2, alb 2.1, INR 1.6) along w/ pancytopenia (HCT 24.8 and plt 53).
HIV/AIDs with h/o PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] (CD4-23, VL 140K on [**5-1**]; [**9-30**] on viracept/combavir changed to truvata/reyataz/norovir [**1-31**] then to atrepla [**5-1**]) 5.
2) Re-identification of known ascites.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Lidocaine patchs were placed on the patient's right chest, and lumbar spine, and he was administered oxycodone.
They felt the compression was a result of chronic degenerative changes, and that the patient's only clinical manifestation was mild proximal weakness.
On [**7-29**], a therapeutic paracentesis was performed, draining 4800cc of fluid.
The patient was administered 37.5g albumin after the paracentesis.
On [**7-30**], the patient was reporting improved breathing and pain, however, he experienced further diminished urine output and his blood pressure dropped to 90-100.
hepatology initially diagnosed him with hepatorenal syndrome and recommended to discontinue the diuretics, and to add 25g of 25% albunmin [**Hospital1 **].
Since pt responded so well with IVFs and discontinuation of diuretics, the diagnosis was later changed to renal failure.
IV fluida at 125cc/ hour were administered.
He was given a warming blanket, and had blood cultures drawn.
Heme/Onc was cnsulted and they were not certain if the patient had DIC or HIT, reporting the patient's chemistries are difficult to interpret because he received blood products in the MICU prior to arrival on the floor, and the recent trends in coagulation studies may simply be the patient's return to his baseline values as opposed to a consumptive coagulopathy.
As pt developed a lower extremity rash zosyn was discontinued and aztreonam and flagyl was used instead.
From this point on the patients renal, and respiratory function steadily improved, was not requring oxygen, and diuretics was added on [**8-3**] with good effect.
Patient was temporarily placed NPO but had BM and was passing gas without nausea and vomiting; therefore his diet was advanced while ambulation was ecouraged.
On [**8-7**] vancomycin and aztreonam were also d/c'd after ID had ok'd this from their perspective.

Pt needs to start antiretroviral therapy for Hepatitis B once amylase and lipase have normalized.

- Pt needs to have potassium monitored in the close follow-up with his PCP since he is on a high dose of spironolactone which may cause hyperkalemia - Pt may need to be re-stared on HIV/AIS antiretroviral therapy
