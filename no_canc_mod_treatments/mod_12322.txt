AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
His medical regimen was adjusted after admission and he remained pain free.
Cardiac surgical evaluation was undertaken and surgery was scheduled.
A urinary infection delayed surgery and was treated with a course of antibiotics.
On [**3-26**] he underwent cardiac surgery  with an Aortic valve replacement (#25mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical)/coronary artyery bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery grafted to left anterior descending artery/saphenous vein grafted to Diagnal/obtuse marginal/AM, Aortic root enlargement with pericardial patch).
Cross clamp time= 162 minutes, Cardiopulmonary bypass time = 208 minutes.
He suffered cardiac arrest as preparations for evacuation were underway and the chest was opened at the bedside, with stabilization quickly.
There was a bleeding source from a vein graft found as the source for the effusion.
Epinephrine and Levophed were weaned off over 48 hours.
He remained in atrial fibrillation postop and Amiodarone was continued for rate control.
Zosyn, Cipro and vancomycin were give for 5 days after the reoperation.
He required extensive pulmonary toilet and continued with a poor, ineffective cough.
He spent nights on BiPap and occassionally daytime hours as well.
He was very difficult to induce a diuresis and required resumption of phenylephrine until [**4-4**] when he became hypercarbic to 60 and acidotic.
He was electively reintubated and aggressive diuresis attempted.
He became nonoliguric and a Lasix infusion was continued.
After aggressive diuresis of multiple liters he was awakened and ventilatory support weaned.
His metabolic alkalosis was treated with hydrochloric acid replacement and Diamox.
He remained stable with an effective cough and arrangements were made for a rehabilitation facility.
Mr.[**Known lastname 916**] continued to progress and on POD#20/17 he was transferred to the rehabilitation center for further increase in strength, endurance , and improvement in activities of daily living.
