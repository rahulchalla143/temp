Admission Date:  [**2104-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-10-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Celebrex / Plaquenil / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker upgrade Trans-esophageal Echocardiogram Cardioversion EGD (Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy) Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 83yo M with h/o HTN, DLP, CHF, A fib s/p permanent pacemaker (4/'[**04**]), anterior MI s/p CABG ([**2084**]), AAA with multiple repairs, CVA presents with shortness of breath.
He received a CABG in [**2084**] and has been chest pain free since then.
Patient first experienced shortness of breath on exertion about five years ago, when he was placed on Lasix with adequate management of his symptoms until recently.
He began experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion and had multiple medication adjustments of his HF regimen with suboptimal response.
Patient reported worsening of dyspnea following placement of ICD, with PND, orthopnea which was minimally relieved when sitting up in a chair at night, inability to sleep due to shortness of breath.
He has noticed a bloated abdomen with nausea and feelings of fullness for the past 4 months as well.
Patient was recently found by his cardiologist to have a low BP in the upper 70's and upper 80's, and his Lisinopril was discontinued and Lasix was stopped.
Lasix was reinitiated and stopped several times in an attempt to prevent hypotension while treating symptoms of dyspnea.
He was given IV fluids without any improvement of dyspnea, and was re-initiated on Lasix briefly.
On presentation, he was mildly dyspneic on 3L O2 NC with sats in the low 90's.
He has remained asymptomatic of chest pain since admission, and had one episode of dyspnea and drops of sats into 80's following bedside TTE, which resolved following elevation of the head of the bed and increase of oxygen to 4L.
He is currently breathing comfortably on 4L NC without use of accessory muscles.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: - Hypertension - Dyslipidemia - s/p Prior anterior MI [**2084**] .
Cardiac History: CABG ([**2084**]), anatomy as follows: - LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA .
Other Past History: - CHF, most recent Echo [**2104-9-23**] with EF ~15%, severe MR (Echo [**2104-5-5**] and [**2104-7-14**] with EF 30%) - Atrial fibrillation, diagnosed [**5-/2104**] - CVA [**5-/2104**] with UE hemiparesis x1 week - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm [**2095**] with multiple endograft repairs - [**Hospital1 **]-fem bypass several years prior - Bilateral inguinal hernias - h/o Rectal bleed [**2100**] .
[**Month/Day/Year **] enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, pacemaker in situ.
Clips of the bypass surgery, abdominal aortic stent graft in situ.
Amiodarone toxicity can present with similar imaging findings and can be considered if patient was treated with amiodarone.
Dense atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications, status post bypass graft procedure.
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with newly further depressed ejection fraction, severe mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation status post failed cardioversion in [**2104-6-5**], status-post ICD/pace-maker, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of dypsnea and his cardiac problems.
Hospital course is as followed by system:  #) Congestive heart failure, history of ischemic cardiomyopathy: Per report from patient's outside hospital, an echocardiogram was completed prior to transfer that demonstrated a worsened ejection fraction of 15%, with severe mitral regurgitation (as compared to echocardiogram from [**2104-6-5**] where his EF was approximately 30% and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]).
A chest x-ray was completed at admission as well as a bedside echocardiogram, which confirmed the above findings.
Patient was started on a lasix drip after he failed to diuresis to lasix boluses on night of admission; a goal urine output of 60cc/hr was maintained.
Hydralazine was added for afterload reduction as well given his severe mitral regurgitation.
The next day, patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for further monitoring and possible Swanz placment given that he was still very dyspneic with minimal exertion (eg moving in bed) and possible ionotropic support for diuresis.
He received Diuril in addition to his lasix drip, and continued to have good diuresis.
An electrophysiology (EP) consult was obtained, and plans were made for placement of a biventricular pacemaker to help his cardiac output, as he was being paced approximately 90% of the time.
Patient underwent an upgrade of his pacemaker to a [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker on [**2104-10-1**] and reported improvement in his symptoms.
He underwent a TEE with subsequent cardioversion on [**2104-10-3**] and again reported improvement in his symptoms.
He continued to diurese well on the lasix drip, which was transitioned to intravenous lasix doses and then an oral regimen (120mg PO daily).
His digoxin was stopped given his variable renal function and decompensated failure at time of admission.
He has an ICD in place for primary prevention given his low ejection fraction.
He is on anticoagulation for that as well as his atrial fibrillation and history of CVA.
If patient continues to have further symptoms from his mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement might be a consideration, however that was no pursued during this admission given the improvement in his symptoms with medical therapy and his multiple other co-morbidities.
Given concern for acute gastrointestinal bleeding from either an upper or lower source, patient's anti-coagulation was held (he had been on a heparin drip after his INR was <2.0); his diuresis and beta-blocker were temporarily stopped.
He was started on an intravenous proton pump inhibitor and maintained on clears.
The gastroenterology team was consulted for further evaluation, and on [**2104-10-2**], the patient underwent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.
Biopsies of the gastric mucosa and h. pylori serologies were pending at time of discharge and should be followed up.
He should continue twice daily proton pump inhibitor until follow up with his primary care provider or [**Name Initial (PRE) **] gastroenterologist.
#) Coronary artery disease: Patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy as evidenced by echocardiogram, and is status post CABG for a myocardial infarction in [**2084**].
He was continued on his aspirin once he had no evidence of bleeding, as well as metoprolol and his statin.
#) Rhythm: Patient has a Pacemaker/ICD in place for history of atrial fibrillation and for primary prevention given his low ejection fraction.
He had no further episodes once his electrolyte abnormalities resolved.
Patient underwent upgrade of his biventricular pacemaker as well as a TEE with cardioversion as described above.
He was started on an amiodarone load to prevent recurrance of atrial fibrillation.
His anticoagulation was continued for his history of atrial fibrillation.
His coumadin dose was lowered due to the fact that he was started on amiodarone.
#) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Based on records accompanying patient, his baseline creatinine appears to range between 0.9 - 1.4 until [**2104-6-5**], at which time it was in the mid 2's.
#) Hemoptysis: Patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for 2 weeks prior to arrival, which has been dark about half a spoonful of dark red blood mixed with sputum.
His outside imaging, including the CTA of this chest was reviewed, and a repeat CAT scan without contrast was obtained after diuresis to rule out any signs of malignancy, given his long tobacco use history and asbestosis exposure.
#) Elevated INR: Patient's Coumadin was held beginning [**9-21**], however his INR was still 3.4 at admission.
He was given vitamin K to further lower his INR in the event that he needed any procedures.
He was maintained on a heparin drip after his gastrointestinal work-up and bridged back to coumadin.
Iron studies were obtained and revealed an iron of 26, TIBC of 286, ferritn 260, and transferritin of 220.
He should continue to follow up with his primary provider for further management of his anemia.
He did not receive any blood transfusions, and his hematocrit remained stable in the 28-32 range.
#) Dyslipidemia: Continued home statin dose.
He had had a foley in place to monitor diuresis and due to his severe dyspnea with any exertion.
The foley was removed and he completed a course of treatment with vancomycin given his pencillin allergy.
Medications on Admission: - Toprol XL 25mg daily - Lasix 80mg tid (recently discontinued) - Lisinopril 5mg (discontinued 7/'[**04**]) - Metolazone 2.5mg 3x per week (M, W, F) - ASA 81mg daily - Coumadin 5mg daily (initiated 4/'[**04**], held since [**2104-9-21**]) - Simvastatin 10mg daily - Protonix 20mg daily (initiated 1 month ago) - PRN Nitroglycerin patch - Tylenol prn arthritic pain .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for further management of your heart failure, respiratory distress, and atrial fibrillation.
You underwent an upgrade of your pacemaker as well as cardioversion after transesophageal echocardiogram.
You will need to have your coumadin level (INR) followed closely (once a week until your amiodarone dose is stable) because of the effect amiodarone has on coumadin levels.
