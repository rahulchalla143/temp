He was intubated and brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of his prematurity.
Neurological:  Active, with reflexes and tone consistent with gestational age.
He was initially treated with the conventional ventilator, with maximum settings of peak inspiratory pressure of 24/PEEP 5, intermittent mandatory ventilatory rate of 30, 40-50%.
He remained on the high-frequency oscillator through the rest of his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit course thus far.
[**Known lastname **] has also been treated with Combivent metered dose inhalers, and he has also been started on Diuril to treat his chronic lung disease.
He was treated with dopamine, maximum 25 mcg/kg/minute.
On day of life number two, he received three empiric doses of hydrocortisone to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
The hydrocortisone was repeated again on day of life number seven due to his refractory hypotension and need for dopamine of 25 mcg/kg/minute.
Again with deterioration in his respiratory status, he received an echocardiogram on [**2107-3-21**], which showed a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with continuous left-to-right shunt and a 20 mm Hg gradient.
A repeat echocardiogram on [**2107-3-24**] showed the persistence of the patent ductus arteriosus measuring 1.5 to 2 mm, with continuous left-to-right flow.
The dopamine was discontinued on [**2107-3-4**].
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname **] was initially nothing by mouth, and maintained on intravenous fluids.

He was on full volume feedings and his calories were then gradually increased.
A percutaneous central venous catheter was placed on [**2107-3-23**] with the tip at the superior vena cava/right atrial junction.
His fluids at the time of transfer are total parenteral nutrition solution 9% glucose, 2.5% protein, with electrolytes, 3 mEq of sodium per 100 cc and 2 mEq of potassium per 100 cc, minimal acetate, maximum chloride.
He is also receiving intravenous intralipid 20% at 3 grams/kg/day.
His most recent serum electrolytes were obtained on [**2107-3-22**], and showed a serum sodium of 134, potassium 5.1, chloride 96, and total carbon dioxide of 32.
His blood culture remained no growth at 24 hours, and his antibiotics were discontinued.
Hematology:  [**Known lastname **] has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname **] required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
He receives fentanyl as needed for sedation.
Feedings:  Nothing by mouth, intravenous fluids via percutaneous central venous catheter at 130 cc/kg/day.
No immunizations have thus far been administered.
Refractory hypotension                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37237**], M.D.
