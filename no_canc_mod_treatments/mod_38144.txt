* You developed blood in your left chest requiring drainage with a chest tube *  Rib fractures can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
You will need an end expiratory chest xray for this appointment.
