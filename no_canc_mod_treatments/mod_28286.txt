History of Present Illness: Pt is a 76 yo woman w/ h/o known AS, recently diagnosed MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 71790**]c arch calcification/aneurysm s/p recent discharge after median sternotomy (planned AVR, but intra-op noted MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] aortic arch calcifications/aneurysm, so surgery aborted b/c needs AVR, MVR, aortic arch replacement at same time which is higher risk procedure - needed to d/w pt first), who presented on [**2126-7-1**] with new onset atrial flutter.
During hospital course, pt was treated with amiodarone gtt initially, then changed to PO amio, put on dilt gtt, on PO beta blocker, heparin gtt.
After ablation, pt had pacemaker placed due to sick conduction system that was noted during procedure.
She had been electively intubated for procedure given h/o sleep apnea, obesity, and likely inability to lie flat to tolerate procedure.
Following procedure, decision was made to transfer pt to CCU for overnight monitering.
Median sternotomy wires and surgical clips are noted.
Brief Hospital Course: This 76-year old female with known aortic stenosis recently discharged after median sternotomy for possible AVR presented with new onset aflutter, receiving ablation which induced complete heart block with subsequent pacemaker placement.
Rhythm - Patient had atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 130's on presentation and was placed on amiodorone, PO metoprolol, diltiazem gtt, and heparin gtt.
Patient had a catherization for ablation of the atrial flutter with His-ventricular delay, which prompted pacer placement.
Patient was transferred to floor with controlled heart rate and amiodorone was discontinued (TSH normal).
Patient was initially on heparin drip.
CT surgery spoke with patient and after discussion with team, decision was made not to pursue surgery at this stage.
Heparin to coumadin bridge was initiated with INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
