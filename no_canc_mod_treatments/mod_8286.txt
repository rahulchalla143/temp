Her hemodialysis was completed uneventfully.
# ESRD on HD: She underwent emergent hemodialysis following placement of the temporary catheter in the emergency department.
# Somnolence: Likely due to administration of morphine and droperidol in setting of ESRD as was reportedly mentating at baseline initially on ED arrival.
Her mental status quickly improved and sedating medications were avoided.
Pt currently without TTP on exam s/p morphine although somnolent.
Her anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting of GI bleed (see below), but labetalol and clonidine were restarted at her home doses prior to discharge.
# Diabetes Type I: Her fingersticks were initially low in the setting of receiving insulin for hyperkalemia.
She was restarted onher home insulin regimen of 12 lantus Qhs and insulin sliding scale.
She was continued on coumadin 4mg q 4pm until her episode of maroon stool described below.
At that time, risks and benefits of anticoagulation were weighed, and her coumadin was held.

GI was consulted and stated they would likely perform a colonoscopy after the patient has been stabilized and returned to the regular medical floor.
