Admission Date:  [**2117-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in patient with recurrent falls secondary to primary progressive MS   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture G-tube Intubation/extubation   History of Present Illness: 59 yo man with MS initially admitted with left basal ganglia hemorrhage, then developed hemorrhage on the right side with persistent encephalopathy, now with elevated wbc count and bilateral obturator muscle abscess who is being transferred to the medicine service from the MICU for overnight monitoring for hypotension/tachycardia and concern for sepsis.
He was tx for a LLL infiltrate (MRSA PNA) and finished a 10 day course of linezolid (vanco allergy), levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia).
This was switched to linezolid and zosyn  but he developed a rash and eosinophilia and was switched back to levo/flagyl on [**5-21**].
He received 5.5 L total of NS in the MICU with his BP now stable in the 110's systolic.
Wheelchair-bound at baseline but able to transfer  Family History: Unremarkable for neurologic disease.
In the upper extremities, strength full with exception of right finger extensors 4+/5.
[**6-9**] - CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are bilateral fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscles bilaterally.
Foley catheter in a nondistended bladder.
[**6-2**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is again seen within the bladder lumen.
[**5-25**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral peripherally enhancing fluid collections, likely abscesses, tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscles as described above.
Empiric therapy with cipro/flagyl helped WBC and fevers somewhat; interval reimaging 5 days later demonstrated collection that was a few mm smaller.
Antibiotics were held in an attempt to obtain optimal cultures&#8212;at which time he developed hypotension and spent a few days in ICU though did not require pressors.
Empiric therapy was reinitiated with linezolid/zosyn (vanc allergic).
T remained 98-99s but he had persistent WBC 18-21, with eosinophilia as high as 20%, so was placed on levo/flagyl in case beta-lactam sensitivity was contributing.
Derm followed and felt this was due to antibiotics (more specifically, the Zosyn already discontinued).
There are a few little chest lesions though not enough to explain leukocytosis.
The patient was continued on levo/flagyl with improvement in fevers and leukocytosis.
However, on [**6-3**], the patient suddenly developed hypotension and leukocytosis (10 to 24), requiring transfer to ICU for goal-directed therapy, including fluids and broad spectrum antibiotcs of levo/flagyl/linezolid/po vanc (tolerated well)/aztreonam.
He did not require pressors and stayed in the ICU only for a night.
The patient was started on Tobramycin and all abx except levo/flagyl were peeled off.
He responded to the antibiotics with stable vital signs, defervescene, and resolution of the leukocytosis.
The patient finished his course of Tobramycin for the UTI on [**2117-6-11**] (7-day course).
He continues to be on IV levo/flagyl for the OI abscesses with an open-end duration at this time, as etiology is unclear and it is uncertain how these abscesses will respond over time to abx.
The patient, as he is asymptomatic and stable serum calcium for over a month, should follow with an outpatient endocrinologist by calling the number included in the paperwork in the next 1-2 weeks.
He often required restraints at night.
At admission, he had an elevated CPK as well as BUN/Creatinine - for this early rhabdomyolysis, he was treated with IVF and this improved.
For presumed aspiration pneumonia, he was treated with 10 day course of flagyl and levofloxacin.
His sputum returned positive for MRSA for which vancomycin was started on [**4-23**].
However, due to papulomacular, blanching rash which developed after vancomycin, vancomycin was discontinued on [**4-28**] and started on linezolid, which was continued for a 10 day course.
The patient was briefly on acyclovir and ampicillin to empirically cover HSV and listeria until cx and HSV pcr came back negative.
The patient failed speech and swallow on [**4-26**] and NGT was placed for nutritional support.
The patient was intermittently hypotensive in the unit thought to be secondary to infection and responded well to IVF boluses.
Abdominal CT demonstrated possible left obturator internus muscle abscess, but attempted drainage by IR could not aspirate fluid.
Nevertheless, he was empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
He has failed repeat speech/swallow studies and needs to be NPO.
His pressures have stabilized off the anti-hypertensives, and he does not require them currently.
If he becomes hypertensive again, these meds can be restarted for a goal of SBP<140.
Patient was rehydrated with IVF and treated appropriately for his infections.
