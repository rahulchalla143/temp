She was treated empirically with vancomycin and zosyn due to concern that an occult infection may be the cause of her symtpoms.

They were concerned about an ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion, an iron overdose, cyanide poisoning, carbon dioxide and a tylenol ingestion despite the normal tylenol levels.
His acidosis was aggressive treated with sodium bicarbonate.
We gave antidotes where appropriate including foempazole, thiosulfate, thiamine and tried to initiate CVVH although this was unsuccessful.
