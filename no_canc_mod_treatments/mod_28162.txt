There was in stent restenosis of the proximal LAD to 70%.
A ramus demonstrated serial 90% stenoses.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and distal septal, anterior, and basal inferior akinesis.
Stenting of distal RCA could be done if recurrent ischemia 5.
CXR [**3-18**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], there has been placement of a Dobhoff tube that curls within the upper stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 82-year-old female with HTN, DM, CAD s/p VF arrest with anterior STEMI and LAD stenting in [**4-5**], pacemaker placement, h/o TIA, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] with NSTEMI, now s/p PCI with 2 DES to prox LAD ISR, and POBA/export thrombectomy of RCA, procedure complicated by retroperitoneal bleed s/p coiling of inferior epigastric artery, and delirium.
She was started on heparin drip, full dose ASA.
After a long discussion between CT surgery, patient, and her family they decided not to pursue CABG given high risk of procedure and pt's wishes.
Pt underwent repeat catheterization with PCI of distal RCA and proximal LAD, and POBA/export thrombectomy of RCA.
Brief CCU course: Patient underwent a planned cardiac catheterization on [**2139-3-13**] in which two drug-eluting stents were placed to her proximal LAD in-stent stenosis.
After the procedure the patient complained of back pain, was found to have a 5 point hematocrit drop and evidence of a large right-sided retroperitoneal bleed on CT. She was immediately taken back to the cath lab, and the bleeding artery (right inferior epigastric) was succesfully embolized with coils.
She did not require any blood products.
We continued her ASA 325mg daily, plavix 75mg daily, toprol XL 25mg daily.
Her amlodipine 5mg was changed to lisinopril 5mg for myocardial protection.
# Delirium: pt developed altered mental status and hypoactivity after transfer from CCU.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing with negative urine and blood cultures, and CXR without pneumonia.
Her Foley was pulled out to minimize delirium.
She was made NPO and meds crushed in apple sauce.
Neurology was consulted and believes that encephalopathy is likely hospital-related delirium vs post-cath microemboli vs medication-related (oxycodone and gabapentin were held after pt developed altered mental status).
An NG tube was placed and tube feeds were initiated, pt should have repeat swallow evaluation at rehab and NG tube can be taken out once she does not show aspiration.
Pt was initially diuresed with IV lasix and after cath/PCI, she remained overall euvolemic on exam.
We continued metoprolol and started an ACE-i on discharge.
She should continue lasix 20mg PO daily after discharge to maintain her volume status.
INACTIVE ISSUES: ---------------- # Hypertension - BP elevated to 180s/80s on admission, she was started on nitro gtt with improvement to SBP 130s/80s.
She was quickly weaned off the nitro drip and had well controlled BP's on toprol XL 25mg daily and amlodipine 5mg daily.
Prior to discharge, amlodipine was changed to ACI-i as above.
We placed her on diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale during hospitalization with control of blood sugars.
# Spinal Stenosis: pt has chronic pain from spinal stenosis, she was recently started on Ultram for pain at home which caused her GI upset.
She can continue on low dose oxycodone when her mental status improves.
# NG tube - pt was discharged with NG tube and tube feeds due to dysphagia in setting of delirium.
She should have a repeat swallow evaluation in [**3-5**] days and once aspiration is not noted, NG tube can be removed.
# [**Name (NI) **] - pt should have Chem 7 checked in [**3-5**] days at rehab to trend Cr, Na since she was recently started on tube feeds and is restarting gentle diuresis with PO lasix, as above.
Had good pain control initially with oxycodone, which was held after altered mental status developed.
Discharged with Lidocaine patch on back and tylenol prn.
Can restart oxycodone and gabapentin when mental status improves.

We started you on medications for your heart attack and did a cardiac catheterization, which showed 3-vessel disease of your coronary arteries (the vessels feeding your heart).
The surgeons discussed possibility of bypass surgery with you, but given the high risk of the procedure, you and your family decided not to pursue surgical treatment.
We did an MRI of your heart and decided to put stents into some of your vessels to help the blood flow to your heart.
You had successful stenting of your coronary arteries, but developed a small bleed in your abdomen which we repaired.
We placed a nasogastric tube for feeding, which can be removed once another swallow evaluation at your rehab facility shows that you can swallow well.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - START aspirin 325mg daily - START plavix 75mg daily (it is very important to take this medication daily without missing any doses, it helps keep your stents open) - START atorvastatin 80mg daily - START lisinopril 10mg daily and toprol XL 50mg daily for blood pressure and heart failure - TAKE lasix 20mg daily for your heart failure  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
