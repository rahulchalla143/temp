MRI and angiography may be helpful for further evaluation.
[**2189-3-31**] MRI Abdomen: 1) Limited study due to limited breath-holding capacity and lack of intravenous gadolinium.
3) Left renal cyst in question appears completely simple, but can be re- assessed at the time of MRCP with intravenous gadolinium.
Dedicated MRCP is recommended for further assessment when the patient is able and an IV can be placed.

She was placed on a heparin drip following the procedure.
She had an episode of desaturation immediately after extubation and received a bolus of Glycopyrrolate, and Neostigmine for suspected residual paralysis.
Sputum was obtained on [**3-22**] given worsening hypoxemia and thick secretions, grew Moraxella and ceftriaxone was started.
Passed bedside swallow eval, but due to high suspicion for aspiration a barium swallow was performed with aspiration of barium into the lungs.
Antibiotics were switched to Vanc/Zosyn and she required intubation for worsening respiratory distress.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation showed evidence of aspiration with deficits consistent with neurological deficit and it was decided to proceed with PEG tube placement on [**3-31**].
Hypoxemia was most likely [**2-9**] mucous plugging given that it resolved following ET suctioning.
She did have several episodes of acute desaturation due to mucous plugging which resolved with chest pt and suctioning.
At the time of transfer to rehab she is -continue with chest PT every 4-8 hours -continue standing guaifensin for thinning of secretions -physical therapy and ambulation -incentive spirometry -albuterol/ipratropium nebs -acapella device -oxygen by 4-6L NC or 40%-50% humidified face mask .
Stable throughout admission with no change on serial head CT.  She is s/p PEG placement for dysphagia and aspiration.
#Urinary Retention - she has had foley catheter throughout the majority of her admission.
On [**4-16**] her foley was discontinued and she was straight cathed q shift for urinary retention.
If her urinary retention does not resolve in [**1-9**] days she will likely require replacement of her foley catheter with outpatient urology follow up.
She was continued on PO iron supplementation after receiving 8 days of IV iron repletion.
She had this discontinued secondary to constipation and will continue on ferrous sulfate.
EGD performed during PEG placement revealed duodenitis for which she was placed on lansoprazole through the PEG tube.
She was continued on plavix and ASA, these were discontinued for placement of PEG tube and restarted following this procedure.
She will need outpatient psychiatry follow-up.
She was given an occasional one time extra dose of alprazolam for her anxiety.
