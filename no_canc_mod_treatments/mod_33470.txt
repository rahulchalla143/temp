Neurology was consulted and recommended Keppra for seizure prophylaxis although there was never any evidence that the patient was having seizures.
The patient was given Narcan 0.1 mg with immediate response.
The patient was made NPO, and all sedating medications were discontinued.
The patient's mental status waxed and waned throughout the day, requiring a second a third bolus of naltrexone with the third bolus followed by a Narcan drip.
The neurology service felt that he patient's intermittent unresponsiveness improved with naltrexone was clearly medication-related, with no need for repeat head CT and no concern for seizure activity, with no need to continue Keppra.
The neurology service felt that gabapentin could be discontinued as well.
On the morning of [**2190-11-2**] (the third day of admission), the naltrexone drip was discontinued, and the patient remained alert and oriented throughout the day.
Low dose gabapentin and hydromorphone were added for pain control in accordance with the recommendations of the chronic pain team.
It was hypothesized that a pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and fluconazole, with fluconazole increasing methadone levels, might be responsible for the patient's episodes of unresponsiveness.
The patient was swabbed for influenza and treated with oseltamivir until the swab came back negative.
The patient was continued on the antibiotics she came in on, cefepime and vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin was added for double pseudomonas coverage given radiograph was concerning for worsened pneumonia.

Her methadone and gapapentin were initially stopped in the ICU.
