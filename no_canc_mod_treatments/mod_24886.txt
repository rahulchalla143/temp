Patient was started on Levofloxacin, and had come to the hospital on 4L NC, which is a new O2 requirement.
He was also re-started on his home nebs, which he had been minimally compliant with (taking [**1-16**] nebs 1-2 times per day rather than 3 nebs tid), as it was believed the patient was having a COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA and non-compliance with nebulizer treatments.
However, the patient's oxygen saturation then decreased to the 80's on 4L NC and he was changed to a non-rebreather and sent to the MICU for respiratory distress.
Patient was started on steriod burst for component of COPD exacerbation.
A cardiac regimen was started with ASA and statin given CAD.
Patient's respiratory status improved and he was weaned to 4L NC and transferred out of the ICU back to the medicine floor.
He received a PICC and was discharged to rehab on Cefepime for a total 10 day course, as the patient's MRSA swab was negative and the suspicion for MRSA PNA was negative.
The patient was also discharged on a short Prednisone taper, for a total course of 6 days of Prednisone.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient with history of a fib on Verapamil (as patient becomes bradycardic on Toprol; listed as "allergy") and had a fib with RVR in the 100's in the setting of not receiving his home medications.
Coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR (see below) and patient was placed on home Verapamil.
In the MICU, the patient was placed on Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation, but this was discontinued and the patient was maintained on his home Verapamil at a higher dose of 80mg tid (up from 40mg tid) after the pt was called out from the MICU.

Coumadin was re-started in-house when the INR became sub-therapeutic.
The patient should discuss initiation of an ACEi and statin with his PCP as his outpatient; this was included in the patient's discharge instructions.
