Culture and sensitivity of the organism here at [**Hospital1 **].
I can be [**Name (NI) 653**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 24484**], beeper #39-515, and I will gladly look for you to see if the results have come back from the lab in terms of the specific identification and sensitivities of the organism, most likely Staphylococcus epidermis, but we do not have a positive ID, nor a positive sensitivity on the organism as of yet.
Vancomycin level should be checked today at 4 p.m. prior to giving the patient 1 gm of vancomycin intravenous today and then dosing of the vancomycin if she remains should remains on it should be based on that level that is drawn today or the patient may be switched to less broad coverage based on the return if it is Staphylococcus epidermis and it makes sense that the source would be Staphylococcus epidermis given not a contaminant for the gram positive cocci given the lesions on the patient's leg, the scratching and the cellulitis that she had had.
