PULMONARY/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was maintained on intravenous Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously q.8h.
She was continued on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q.4h.
Over the first evening of the admission the patient required nebulizers q.2h.
On the first morning following admission, the patient was started on continuous nebulizers as she was having very little air movement.
However, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for continuous nebulizers.
Thereafter, the patient maintained an oxygen saturation between 90% to 92% on approximately 1.5 liters to 2.5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
On [**2200-2-11**], it was determined that the patient's respiratory status had likely improved as much as possible and discussions regarding disposition ensued as described below.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  For likely pneumonia or tracheobronchitis leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient's pneumonia was treated with Levaquin 250 mg p.o.
Her Persantine was initially continued, but following the Intensive Care Unit admission this was changed to Plavix as Persantine can exacerbate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ENDOCRINE:  For the patient's diabetes, she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale.
Her sugars were monitored closely while on Solu-Medrol, and the patient was continued on glyburide.
PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was continued on her Ativan, Effexor, and BuSpar throughout the admission.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  For ongoing right-sided chest pain, the patient pain remained reproducible and controlled with Tylenol and morphine.
The patient and her family were informed that morphine may cause respiratory depression.
The patient's family and physician all agreed that the patient's comfort was more important, and the patient was advised to request morphine knowing of the risks of respiratory depression should she feel pain.
The patient agreed to this plan and utilized morphine as necessary.
On [**2-10**] and [**2-11**], it became apparent that the patient's lung function had reached the limits of improvement and would not permit the patient to undergo any physical exertion, as described above.
She also elected not to undergo further arterial blood gases and reported that she would not want to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for BiPAP or noninvasive ventilation.
