He was intubated and sent to the intensive care unit.
He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and started on vancomycin for one out of two blood cultures positive for "staph".
The patient was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV b.i.d.
He was placed on a dopamine drip for hypotension with systolic pressures in the 70s.
He was started on a diltiazem drip in addition to the dopamine pressor for rate control as well as a heparin drip.
The wife requested transfer to [**Hospital1 188**] where he was recently hospitalized [**2166-4-7**] through [**2166-4-19**] for left hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, stent to the right coronary artery, acute renal failure secondary to contrast dye requiring dialysis x 2, and repair of hip fracture with a left open reduction and internal fixation.
Upon transfer he was on SIMV 16-[**Medical Record Number 22113**], heparin drip, dopamine drip, diltiazem drip and insulin drip.
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**2166-4-7**], catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] with three-vessel disease, stent right coronary artery.
Chronic renal failure with acute renal failure [**4-10**] secondary to catheterization dye load requiring hemodialysis x 2 sessions.
Status post left open reduction and internal fixation [**2166-4-15**].
Status post a right THA.
Status post transurethral resection of the prostate.

Multivitamin q.d.
Lasix 100 mg p.o.
q.a.m., 60 mg p.o.
Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d.
Combivent 2 puffs b.i.d.
Foley catheter had yellow clear urine.
Chest x-ray showed a Swan-Ganz catheter tip seen in the right main pulmonary artery.
The patient required ventilatory support for several days.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**2166-6-10**] on a nitroglycerin drip and Lasix drip with a bolus.
At the time of discharge he was consistently saturating 98-100% on a two-liter nasal cannula and required minimal suctioning.
His brachial and Swan line were removed and replaced with a subclavian line.
He was weaned off of his diltiazem and dopamine drip with the initiation of Levophed.
After initiation of antibiotics as well as volume repletion with blood products, he was weaned successfully off of his Levophed.
Lasix boluses and required a Lasix drip at the time of extubation and given flash pulmonary edema.
He was started on a nitroglycerin drip with hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction.
At the time of discharge he received 20 of IV Lasix q.d.
Pneumonia:  The patient was under treatment for pneumonia with Levaquin and questionably vancomycin at the time of hospital transfer.
Both vancomycin and Levaquin were continued for a 14-day course with interval improvement on his chest x-ray and decreased leukocytosis.
Sputum culture did grow MRSA for which he was placed on precautions.
After this event his hematocrit remained stable with intermittent transfusions for iatrogenic blood loss.
Of note the patient had a similar episode of blood loss with his prior hospitalization.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has severe three-vessel disease status post recent stent x 2 to right coronary artery.
While in house he was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his outpatient cardiologist, who did not recommend repeat catheterization at this time.
He was medically managed with aspirin and beta blocker as tolerated.
At the time of discharge he tolerated metoprolol 25 b.i.d.
He should be started on a long-acting nitrate as tolerated as an outpatient.
At the time of extubation he was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation controlled with IV Lopressor.
No further anticoagulation was initiated at this time.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  At the time of admission the patient had elevated creatinine thought to be due to decreased perfusion from sepsis.
Renal function improved with increased systolic blood pressure and transfusion, however after aggressive diuresis with pulmonary edema, the patient's creatinine worsened.
This was controlled with IV hydration and insulin drip.
Throughout the course of his stay he was continued on an insulin drip for close glucose control.
At the time of discharge he was switched to subcutaneous insulin with q.
4 hour fingersticks.
His sugars should be followed closely and after his new insulin requirement is determined, he should be switched to a long-acting insulin.
Of note, the patient previously was on Lantus with Humalog sliding scale.
The possibility of a PEG tube was discussed with the patient's wife, however she is not ready to pursue this at this time.
A Dobbhoff tube was placed per fluoroscopy.
At the time of discharge he was on Nepro tube feeds and receiving p.o.
He should remain on stool softeners and p.r.n.
He was started on Flagyl in addition to Levaquin for acute cholecystitis and was kept n.p.o.
At the time of discharge he tolerated tube feeds.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o.
Hydralazine 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Epogen 4,000 units subcutaneous biweekly.
Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
Insulin sliding scale with q.
4 hour fingersticks to be converted to long-acting insulin per required dose.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Tylenol 325-650 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Tube feeds - Nepro solution at 35 cc goal.
Two-liter nasal cannula titrated to oxygen saturation greater than 92%.
