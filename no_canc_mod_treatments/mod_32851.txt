He was admitted to the acute care service with mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids and cat scan showed a contained perforation of a duodenal bulb ulcer.

Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole is above the esophagogastric junction.
GI felt that no further intervention was warranted at that time to dislodge the clot because if it were to dislodge, would likely be too big to control endoscopically.
He was started on a pantoprazole drip, which was continued until HD#3 and then converted to IV twice daily.
His sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated on HD#2 without incident.
#Choleduodenal fistula - Pt has recent dx of choleduodenal fistula ([**2200-8-21**]), which is not likely contributing to his bleed, but may need acute management while in the hospital.
Transplant surgery felt that this issue was non-contributory in his acute bleed, and recommended management as per GI and IR.
#Diabetes, type 2 controlled - Patient's FS were monitored and he was maintained on ISS with adequate glycemic control.
#HTN - The patient was intermittently hypotensive in the setting of his resuscitation, and as such his anti-HTN medications were held.
