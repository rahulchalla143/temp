Ischemia, his non ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**8-5**] was treated with Lovenox for 72 hours 120 mg b.i.d.
and he was also continued on a daily adult size aspirin and a beta blocker.
Sinus tachycardia, his rate was controlled with Lopressor, which was titrated up to 150 mg b.i.d.
It was a sinus tach secondary to a hypovolemia after his last skin graft at the end of [**Month (only) 205**], which is believed to have caused his non ST elevation myocardial infarction, so his rate was maintained with the Lopressor at a baseline in the 90s to low 100s with a baseline blood pressure of 80 to 90s/50s to 60s.
The patient was treated for 72 hours for his non ST elevation myocardial infarction with Lovenox and he was started on Coumadin.
Lovenox and Coumadin were overlapped until they became therapeutic on his Coumadin and INR between 2 and 3 at which point the Lovenox was discontinued.
Infectious disease:  In terms of the patient's necrotizing fasciitis as mentioned in the previous portion of this discharge summary the patient was treated with multiple skin debridement and a long course of antibiotics and a skin graft a donor site from his back to his right thigh.
The antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-8**].
On [**2171-8-17**] the patient had a PICC line in the right antecubital area, which was pulled, because the area of insertion was erythematous and slightly indurated.
A culture from the PICC line tip was sent, which on [**2171-8-19**] revealed an MRSA culture greater then 15 colonies.
Infectious disease was reconsulted and the patient was begun on a course of intravenous Vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours.
On [**8-20**] the patient had a PICC line placed in the left arm by interventional radiology for the administration of the intravenous Vancomycin.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  During his hospital course when admitted to the Medical Service on a intravenous fluids of normal saline with 40 milliequivalents of potassium chloride and was on Boost for breakfast, lunch and dinner and house diet.
Eventually the intravenous fluids were discontinued and the patient's electrolytes were followed closely.
Pain:  The patient was admitted on a Fentanyl PCA with Oxycodone in addition 30 mg every eight hours.
This was discontinued and the patient was placed on oral morphine 60 mg every eight hours with instant relief for breakthrough pain.
On [**2171-8-20**] this was deemed to be inadequate for the patient's pain coverage and he was placed on a morphine PCA.
The plan is pain wise is to monitor how much morphine he is using and then switch him back to the analgesic equivalent dose of oral morphine so that we can transition him to a po medication rather then a PCA.
Psychiatric:  The patient had a psychiatry consult while in the hospital and they recommended Remeron 30 mg every evening for depression and Zyprexa 2.5 mg as needed for anxiety.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 150 mg b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg q.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg q.h.s., Vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours delivered by intravenous today is day two of what should be a seven day course.
He is on a morphine sulfate PCA without a basal rate, a 1.5 mg injection every time he presses the button with a six minute lock out.
He is on a fluocinolone ointment and _________ ointment, sublingual nitro prn for chest pain, Benadryl prn for urticaria, Hydroxizine 25 mg b.i.d., _______________ 30 mg q.h.s., iron sulfate 325 mg t.i.d., magnesium oxide 800 mg t.i.d., calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d.
The plan is for Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is to follow up at his rehabilitation hospital to eventually wean him off of his PCA and to discontinue the intravenous Vancomycin once his blood cultures come back from [**8-19**] and he is to see the attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks for follow up to discuss the next skin graft, which should be in a few months.
