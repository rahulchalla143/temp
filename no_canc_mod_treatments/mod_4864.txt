The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, sigmoid colectomy and colostomy and Hartmann's for a perforated sigmoid colon.
Post-operatively the patient was taken to the ICU with a Propofol drip for sedation, was intubated especially considering the patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
The patient also required Neo and a Swan as the case intraoperatively was complicated by hypotension.
The patient was put on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Clindamycin and Protonix, subcu Heparin and a regular insulin sliding scale.
Over the next few days the patient was able to be weaned off of pressors and the SICU team continued to attempt to wean the patient from the ventilator.
The patient did receive some Lasix with a good effect as she had received a large amount of fluid perioperatively.
As of [**8-1**] the patient required 100% non rebreather with O2 sats greater than 90%.
The patient remained on Hydrocortisone as treatment for the patient's pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension and was also receiving Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Cultures on the patient's endotracheal tube grew out E. coli and Ceftriaxone was added to the Vanco, Levofloxacin, Clindamycin antibiotic regimen.
Levofloxacin was discontinued.
The patient was given Lasix and then was transferred back to the SICU.
The patient was found on CT scan to have a small fluid collection in the pelvis which had had a pigtail catheter in.
This drainage tube was clogged [**8-10**], interventional aspirated and flushed the tube and unclogged it and orders were written to flush his catheter tid.
The pulmonologist recommended continuing antibiotics, tapering Hydrocortisone, continuing general diuresis.
On [**8-13**] the patient was requiring C-pap to maintain oxygen saturation and at noon on [**8-13**] the patient was reintubated.
Patient's blood pressure dropped to 80/40 so the patient was put on Neo-Synephrine.
During the procedure the patient had episodes of hypotension and tachycardia.
At noon the family decided that in light of the patient's poor prognosis, she should be made comfort measures only.
The patient was thus taken off all pressors and was pronounced dead at 12:50 p.m. on [**8-15**] and the death certificate was filed.
