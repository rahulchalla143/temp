The patient was placed on a beta blocker and diuresed.
With known history, the patient got an echocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 20 to 30%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular cavity markedly dilated, and abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure volume overload, mild aortic regurgitation, severe four plus tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonic valve leaflets were thickened and end-diastolic regurgitation capacity was increased, suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The patient was placed on Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
twice a day and Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day with holding parameters.
Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have crackles and diuresed accordingly with lasix 20 mg and nebulizers of Atrovent and Albuterol q. four hours.

The patient was admitted for respiratory care to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received C-PAP and Bi-PAP and was called out the following day.
The patient's pulmonary status continued to improve while on the Medicine Floor, however, his oxygen requirements were consistent and the patient required nasal cannula to keep his O2 saturations between 90 and 93%.
The patient did undergo a transbronchial nodal aspiration on [**4-3**], without any complications.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was placed on levofloxacin 500 mg q. day secondary to original chest x-ray being read in the Emergency Room as inconclusive as to whether or not the patient had a consolidative pneumonia.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on heparin subcutaneously  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.
He is requiring oxygen to maintain his saturations between 90 and 94%.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
q. day; discontinue medication on [**2139-4-6**], for a ten day course.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
