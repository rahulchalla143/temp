Teh patient received a pre-op work up for the CABG including a UA, Carotid US, and CXR.
While pending CABG, the patient was medically optimized with ASA 325mg once daily, beta-blocker, and heparin gtt without bolus.
Due to an allergy to statin, the patient was not started on any anti-lipid lowering agents.
Since CT surgery was scheduled rather quickly it was determined to follow up outpatient lipid panels and decide on course of treatment as an outpatient.
HTN: The patient received a B-blocker (metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]) for control of BP.
Propylaxis: the patient did not require heparin sub Q TID for DVT prophylaxis due to the heparin gtt he was receiving for his CAD.
In addition, the patient also received colace and senna for a bowel prep and H2 blocker for GERD prophylaxis.
Please see addendum from CT surgery for the rest of the hospital course.
