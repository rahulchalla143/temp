He was given Acetaminophen for the fever, a chest xray was obtained which was reportedly non-diagnostic as was a U/A.
He continued to have right shoulder pain and was given Morphine 4mg IV x 1.
His blood pressure dropped to 87/56 after he received the morphine so he received a 500cc bolus with good BP response.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Aortic stenosis s/p AVR Anemia: baseline HCT 30-33 Hypothyroidism OSA on CPAP Depression CKD OA Gout IBS-diarrhea predominant Obesity PVD UGI and LGI bleeding secondary to AVMs  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
His wife died of a brain aneurysm  several years ago and he currently lives alone.
Evidence of prior CABG, including intact sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are present.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated.
Normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
EKG on admission [**12-28**]: Underlying atrial mechanism not certain with differential diagnosis including atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter variant versus atrial tachycardia with variable block.
Right bundle-branch block with left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
[**1-6**] Upper endoscopy/enteroscopy:  Antral erosions, no focal bleed [**1-6**] Flex Sig:  No source of bleed  Brief Hospital Course: 72yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG x 2 who presents from OSH with NSTEMI.
Possible etiologies included vasovagal episode (he was baring down in the bathroom at the time), arrhythmia given his a-flutter/a-fib and sigificant cardiac history.
Compressions were initiated and he quickly regained consciousness, and was lucid.
In the CCU, tele showed a-fib with RVR and was uptitrated to 75 TID of metoprolol tartrate and then initiated on a diltiazem drip.
He was put on a heparin drip and started on coumadin for a CHADS2 score of 3.
Of note, his anticoagulation was stopped in-house in the setting of developing LGIB (see below), and was discharged on beta blocker but no coumadin.
He will require follow up for reassessment of his need for coumadin given his recent bleed.
His troponins remained elevated in the 1's but his CK decreased and his CK-MB were normal.
In the setting of his renal function, cath was deferred, but may be considered in the future.
He was d/c'd on beta blocker (metoprolol succinate increased to 150mg daily from home dose of 100mg), asa, satin.
His Hct was noted to drop from 33.5-->26.5 over the course of 1 day and received a total of 1 U PRBC with good response.
His anticoagulation was held and he was continued on PPI which was increased to [**Hospital1 **] on [**Hospital1 **].
#Acute on chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Pt with echo in-house showing worsening LVEF to 40% compared to prior echo.
He was noted to be volume overloaded in house requiring diuresis with metolazone and toresemide, along with home dose of spironalactone.
He was discharged on a regimen of torsemide 60 mg daily, with instructions to take an additional 40mg as needed, as well as home spironalactone of 25 mg daily.
Antibiotics were initially held in the setting of a lack of source/bug, and given his hemodynamic stability.
# Hypoxia: He was hypoxic to the the high 80's on NRB initially on transfer to the CCU, and was able to be weaned without intervention to 2L NC and maintained sats in the low to mid 90s.
PE was considered as well as CHF exacerbation, ACS, hypoventilation, methemoglobinemia, and COPD.
He had increased crackles on exam and required diuresis with good improvement in his respiratory status.
Creatinine at baseline on arrival (1.7) and increased likely secondary to poor forward flow to as high as 2.3.
He was continued on home spironalactone, torsemide, and metolazone, and his Cr improved to 1.8 on [**Last Name (STitle) **] .
# DM II: He was continued on his home regimen of Lantus [**Hospital1 **] (40qAM, 50qPM) and ISS.
