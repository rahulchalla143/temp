Brief Hospital Course: CIRRHOSIS & PORTAL HYPERTENSIVE GASTROPATHY The patient had a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis, likely alcohol and non-alcohol induced steatosis, complicated by portal gastropathy with a history of transfusion support, no esophageal varices, no significant ascites, and no former diagnosis of encephalopathy.
He continued on nadolol, and strong acid protection including PPI [**Hospital1 **], H2 blocker, and sucralfate.
The patient was on low dose lasix and aldactone that was continued.
He was continued on rifaximin and lactulose while in our hospital.
At time of discharge, given concern that his seizure disorder could be an atypical manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy, TIPS was indefinitely postponed.
He required only one transfusion of packed red cells (1 unit) this admission.
He was started on iron supplementation 325mg PO TID after his iron studies showed that he was iron deficient.
He was loaded on dilantin and free dilantin levels were checked, aiming at the lowest dose that prevented seizures given possible hepatotoxity.
He had several psychotropic home medications, but he was continued on only the active medication(Lexapro) at time of interhospital transfer.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION/CYSTITIS The patient developed a UTI while foley catheter was in place.
He grew E. coli and was treated with fluoroquinolone but switched to bactrim to complete his 7 day course given that fluoroquinolones can lower the seizure threshold.
ASTHMA He was continued on PRN albuterol  SLEEP APNEA The patient intermittently used CPAP.
He did not have his home mask and felt uncomfortable, and unfortunately generally felt tired throughout the day.
HEALTH CARE MAINTENANCE The patient should be immunized against Hepatitis B by his primary care provider.
