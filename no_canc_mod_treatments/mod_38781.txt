Status post right frontal bolt removal with a small amount of residual blood products, but no large intracranial hemorrhage.
BIPOSY of L flank ([**2169-1-3**]): Skin, left flank; punch biopsy (A): Extravasation of red blood cells into dermis and subcutis.
Rotated duodenal anatomy- likely secondary to pancreatitisOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Successful placement of Dobhoff 10-French nasojejunal feeding tube   Brief Hospital Course: 48 y/o F w/ COPD and alcohol abuse who presented from an outside hospital with altered mental status, found to have fulminant hepatic failure and renal failure, initially requiring intubation and pressor support, then extubated with improving mental status, improvement in liver function, but interval development of pancreatitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ongoing volume overload due to persistent renal failure requiring dialysis.
She does report using standing tyelnol but no overdose.
She completed N-acetyl cysteine protocol for tylenol hepatotoxicity and supportive care.
She was treated prophylactically with hypertonic saline and mannitol.
Transplant surgery and hepatology evaluated her for liver transplant.
She experienced hepatic encephalopathy which was quite subtle at times (only recognizable to family) but completely improved with lactulose and rifaximin which she will continue.
As she was unable to take in greater than [**2157**] calories daily witout vomiting, a post-pyloric Dobhoff was placed and bridled for nutrition to improve recovery.
Renal placed a left femoral dialysis catheter and started CVVH on [**2168-12-27**] to help for clearance.
She is discharged with a tunneled HD line on a Tu/Th/Sa dialysis schedule.
The prognosis of her renal failure is still unclear; most likely she will be on hemodialysis permanently, but she still requires closely monitoring of intra-dialysis creatinine given that she may recover some kidney function.
Sputum cultures persistently showed yeast and she was treated with fluconazole from [**12-29**] to [**1-3**] and transitioned to micafungin from [**1-3**] to [**1-7**].
# Pancreatitis: The patient was noted to have a chemical pancreatitis on admission (lipase 164 on admission and 1237 on HD 2) which appeared to resolving by HD 9, however over the next few days the lipase was noted to be in the 1000s again.
She developed Grey [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] sign (flanks biopsied showing extravasation of red blood cells into dermis, consistent with pancreatitis).
She had a Dobhoff placed post-pyrlorically and bridled as she was not tolerating a full diet and will require > [**2157**] calories per day for recovery from fulminant hepatitis.
She was treated with Ceftriaxone for a 7 day course.
She did not receive albumin as she was already anuric.
She is discharged on ciprofloxacin for sbp prophylaxis.
She was initially placed on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
After transfer from the MICU to the hepatology service, she did not require any nebulizer treatments as she was breathing well on room air without wheezing, shortness of breath, or desaturations.
However given her improvement following extubation and lab value improvement, she was removed from the liver transplant list on [**2169-1-6**].
# Depression/Anxiety: Given fulminant hepatic failure, anuric renal failure, and concern for hepatic encephalopathy, the patient's mirtazapine, wellbutrin, and ativan were held for much of her inpatient stay.
Her mirtazapine and wellbutrin were restarted prior to discharge.
