# NSTEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 71328**] was admitted to the CCU with a chief complaint of chest pain without ST elevations on EKG and a significant coronary history including CABG followed by PTCA and stenting.
Cardiac catheterization showed proximal occlusion of SVG to OM and thrombus.
On initial catheterization, no intervention was attmepted because the interventional team was not able to protect distal to thrombus for emboli.
The patient was started on aspirin 325mg daily and will need to continue taking this indefinitely, as well as plavix which he will need for at least 1 year uninterrupted.
He was continued on his home carvedilol and atorvastatin as well.

He was counseled on maintaining a low sodium diet as well as taking daily weights to monitor his fluid balance.
He was continued on carvedilol at the time of discharge.
His Cr returned to baseline with diuresis in spite of contrast loads from two C.Caths.
He was given prednisone/azithromycin in ED for concern of COPD exacerbation that was later felt to be consistent with CHF exacerbation.
Patient takes Carvedilol, nifedipine, and Hydrochlorothiazide as an outpatient.
He was continued on carvedilol which was decreased from TID to [**Hospital1 **] dosing and his home nifedipine and HCTZ were discontinued.
