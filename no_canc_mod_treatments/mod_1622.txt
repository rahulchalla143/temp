She was subsequently given Atropine and started on a Dopamine drip.
Dopamine was titrated up with eventual conversion to NSR with rate in 70s and SBP>100.
By the family's account, Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] has had frequent dizzy spells at night, leading to changes in her BP meds dosing schedule.
At [**Hospital1 **],she was given Vecuronium 2mg IV, Lidocaine 100 mg IV, Succinylcholine 100 mg IV, Atropine 1 mg X 2, Ativan 2 mg, Zantac 50 mg, Zofran 4 mg, Dopamine up to 20 mcg/min, NS 2 liters.
Atrial fibrillation on chronic Coumadin therapy 3.
Peripheral vascular disease s/p bypass in [**2181**] 6.
Status post right THR 10.
CXR [**2188-2-21**]: Endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and nasogastric tube are in place.
[**2188-2-23**] CXR: There is interval placement of a dual-chamber pacemaker with the leads in the right ventricle and right atrium.
There is also an NG tube with the tip coiled extending beyond the limits of the radiograph in the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Dual-chamber pacemaker with the leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old female with a PMHx significant for HTN on multiple out-patient antihypertensives, atrial fibrillation now off Coumadin X 2 months, admitted with bradycardia and hypotension, as well as respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Per report, her HR and BP eventually responded to Dopamine and Atropine at the outside hospital.
In the CCU, however, she had recurrent bradycardia and hypotension when Dopamine was weaned, and she underwent PPM placement on [**2188-2-22**].
She tolerated the procedure well.
Amiodarone and Lopressor were resumed post procedure.
Amiodarone was increased to 400 mg PO BID for 3 days, and she is to be discharged on 200 mg PO QD.
On discharge, her blood pressure medication include lopressor, lipitor, hydrochlorothiazide and Diovan.
A CXR was initially suspicious for RML and RLL pneumonia, and she was started on Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.
Her cultures eventually grew E.coli in the urine, resistant to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin and Bactrim.
Hence, Azithromycin was D/C'd, and she was continued on Ceftriaxone for coverage of both, with plan to change to Cefpodoxime prior to discharge.
3) Respiratory failure: She was extubated following pacemaker placement, and did well post-extubation.
