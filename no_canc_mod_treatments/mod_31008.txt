PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 104.2; blood pressure 157/56; pulse 106; respiratory rate 30; 95% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was begun on broad spectrum antibiotics, initially started on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl and later broadened to Levofloxacin for possible pseudomonal infection, though none was documented.
Patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with anion gap that was presumably secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis on admission and was begun on an intravenous insulin drip.
The patient was converted to a regular insulin sliding scale.
The patient was given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix for diuresis.
All intravenous fluids were discontinued as the patient was felt to be in worsening congestive heart failure.
The patient's family, again, stressed the importance of the patient's comfort and changed the patient's level of care to comfort measures only.
Although, they decided that they wanted to continue with antibiotics as well as diuresis, though did want to have a morphine drip started for sedation and discontinuation of any blood draws for further laboratory analysis.
