His CXR was read as question LLL consolidation vs atelectasis, and he was started on octreotide and a PPI drip and admitted to the MICU for further management.
He then was noted to be acutely sedated in the setting of receving diazepam for ?withdrawal and underwent head CT that afternoon, which was again read as negative.
He was intubated and lost approximately 800cc of blood.
He underwent emergent EGD at this point, which was complicated by episodes of hypoxia; however, blood was found in the entire esophagus and no clear site of bleeding was noted, though bands appeared to have come loose.
He had a witnessed aspiration event and was started on imipenem emperically for aspiration pna and variceal bleeding.
He did receive ciprofloxacin on [**8-1**].
3 bands at 45 cm and 3 bands at 40 cm.
He received 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival.
He was placed on octreotide and pantoprazole ggt.
He was again placed on IV PPI and sucralfate, and he did not have any further episodes of bleeding.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially he was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.
He was empirically treated with vancomycin and piptazo for 14 day course (last dose [**2141-8-15**]).
His sedation slowly improved (with minimizing sedative medication use) and he was able to respond to questions and commands on discharge.
Another contributor to his AMS was hepatic encephalopathty, which was treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
Once his sedation improved he was noted to be agitated/restless and this was treated with seroquel and prn haldol.

Specifically, dilantin levels and albumin should be checked twice per week and keppra can be increased to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] once his renal function improves.
His encephalopathy was treated with lactulose and rifaxamin.
He was given folate and thiamine.
