He was given Unasyn and Ceftriaxone in the ED for swelling and crusting of his right ear, and started on steroids for concern of laryngeal edema.
He was felt to have acute pharyngitis with angioedema, right external cellulitis (sparing ear canal and TM), right upper cervical lymphadenitis, right supraglottitis with a probable soft tissue infection of the right neck.
His antibiotics were changed to Vanc/zosyn and for a time clindamycin IV ([**Date range (1) 82121**]) and bactroban to right ear; IV steroids were continued.
On [**2177-5-23**] he began to retain C02 and later had an ABG of 7.11/144 (attributed to underlying lung disease and increased amounts of morphine); at that time he went to the OR for an ET tube placed by ENT.
A trach was attempted but his trachea was in his thorax so an ET tube was sutured into his retropharyngeal area.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for thoracics surgery consult for placement of a tracheostomy as he had been intubated for 7 days.
Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus Obesity COPD/Emphysema CRI (Cr: 1.5) Hypertension Peripheral vascular disease Transient ischemic attack Carotid endarterectomy Appendectomy Hernia repairs Chronic low back pain Tonsillectomy   Social History: Quit smoking in [**2174**] Lives alone Denied any EtOH abuse Works as gas station clerk Lives Alone   Family History: Noncontributory   Physical Exam: VS - Temp 100.6 F, BP 137/45, HR 79, R 14, O2-sat 100% on 100%Fio2 GENERAL - Obese, intubated, sedated HEENT - Right ear erythema and induration with crusting of previously serous fluid.
Patient grimaces to pressure on right side.
The endotracheal tube also shows normal course, its tip appears to project approximately 3.5 cm above the carina, the definite tip position is difficult to determine because of projection effects.
MRI Neck ([**5-30**]): Diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema, consistent with cellulitis with a 1.6 X 1.0 cm right mylohyoid muscle collection and other smaller microabscesses.
Since the previous study, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the soft tissue edema is considerably decreased with slight decrease in size of a fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: A 73 yo man with history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed respiratory distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection now transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by thoracics.
# Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  He received 7-days of broad spectrum antibiotics at an outside hospital prior to transfer.
Although S. aureus and Group A strep grew from culture data, the referring hospital's ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that required broad spectrum coverage.
On admission to our hospital and ICU, he was seen by ID who recommended continuing vancomycin and Zosyn.
ENT recommended conservative management and repeat imaging.
He received a total 21 days of vancomycin and Zosyn, with improvement demonstrated by repeat neck MRI.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: He is not on home medication for COPD.
There is no record of home oxygen requirement.
- He does need frequent/vs continuous oxygen saturation monitoring and supplemental    oxygen.
- At discharge, he was on 15L of High Flow / 60% FiO2 estimated + supplemental NC  - His last ABG on the day of transfer was 7.50/ pCO2=50/ pO2=93  - We were diuresing him with lasix (he also takes home lasix 40mg QD), please consider additioanl doses beyond his home dose as he is still edematous at the time of transfer electrolyte repletion should be assessed and monitored daily.
# Extubation:  Patient has been difficult to extubate initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a cuff leak.
He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
Initially it was thought that he may require a trach given his upper airway swelling.
Thoracic surgery and ENT were consulted as above, and felt that tracheostomy was necessary due to prolonged intubation.
Thus, he remained intubated until [**6-6**] when he was fortunately successfully extubated with a high subsequent O2 requirement.
# Delirium:  After extubation he was delirious likely from orientation/ICU stay and toxic-metabolic etiology.
He was covered with insulin sliding scale during this admission with adequate BS control.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressures were not elevated initially, and anti-hypertensives were held.
We continued hydration with IVF as needed and initially held his home ACEI--this was restarted prior to d/c.
# FEN: He received tube feeds while intubated, diet was advanced after extubation.
- He will need repeat speech/swallow evaluation within [**1-24**] weeks  # Access: He had a PICC placed on [**2177-6-4**] at [**Hospital1 18**] in interventional radiology.
# PPx: He was given Subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots for prophylaxis, in addition to PPI for gastritis prophylaxis.
# Code: He was full code throughout this hospitalization   Medications on Admission: Amlodipine 5mg daily Furosemide 40mg daily Gabapentin 200mg [**Hospital1 **] DiaBeta 5mg daily Lisinopril 10mg daily Glyburide (unsure dose) HCTZ 12.5mg daily Prilosec 20mg daily ASA 81mg daily Naprosyn PRN  Discharge Medications: 1.

You were given three weeks of antibiotics to treat this, and improvement has been seen by MRI.
Because of your oxygenation status, you are being transferred for further recovery to a rehabilitation hospital.
Your medications will be continued at your rehabilitation hospital, and you should see your primary care physician to address any medication changes after discharge.
