Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 74813**] is a 82 year-old woman with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20-25% admitted to the CCU with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation resulting in respiratory failure.

She was intubated with succ/etomidate for mixed hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, then started on fentanyl/midazolam.
On the levophed, her BP initially rose and stabilized however dropped prior to transfer necessitating dopamine initiation.
Repeat ABG prior to transfer, 7.28/41/69 on 500/15, 100% FiOx, PEEP 8 On arrival to the CCU her MAPs>60 on combination levophed and dopamine; O2 saturations 100% on FiO2 100 Vt: 500 24/8.
Levophed and Dopamin were subsequently weaned and patient was treated with lasix gtt for duresis with good response.
The Patient was transfered to the cardiology floor where home meds were restarted.
She is discharged with torsemide, metoprolol, digoxin, atacand and warfarine as outlined below.
Amiodarone + digoxin were IV loaded with subsequent return to sinus rythm.
