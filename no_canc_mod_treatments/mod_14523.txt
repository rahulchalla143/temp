Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with provocative maneuvers (Trendelenberg and phenylephrine bolus).
POST-BYPASS: Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on phenylephrine infusion and AV paced.
No mitral regurgitation is noted after mitral valve annuloplasty.
[**2190-2-18**] ECHO The chest tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and mediastinal drains have all been removed.
Coronary artery bypass surgery times one; left internal     mammary artery to left anterior descending.
Mitral valve repair with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 405**] band annuloplasty,     size 26.
She was also known to have mitral regurgitation with medical management.
Recently, her symptoms increased and surgery was advised.
It was decided to do a band annuloplasty on this patient.
OPERATIVE DETAIL:  The chest, abdomen and lower extremities were scrubbed with Betadine and prepped with Betadine solution.
The chest was opened through a midline sternal- splitting incision.
Hemostasis was secured along the sternal borders and the left internal mammary artery was taken down.
The patient was cannulated with an ascending aortic cannula in the distal ascending aorta and a 3 stage venous cannula into the right atrium.
The temperature was allowed to drift down and an aortic cross clamp was placed in the distal ascending aorta and cold antegrade blood cardioplegia was now given.
Then 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed along the posterior annulus from one commissure to the other.
The aorta cross clamp was removed in the head down position and de-airing measures were taken.
Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed and atrially paced.
The hemostasis was checked with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 30565**] expander and the patient was taken off from bypass with some Nor-epinephrine.
The heparin was reversed with Protamine and successfully decannulated from the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
Chest tubes were placed through separate incisions; one in the left pleural and 2 in the mediastinum.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to the cardiovascular intensive care unit in stable condition.
[**MD Number(1) 1288**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-2-16**] and taken to the operating room where she underwent single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve repair.
She was weaned from her vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor on POD #1 for further recovery.
She was started on coumadin and amiodarone for rate controlled atrial fibrillation.
She became confused and was started on Haldol and required a 1:1 sitter.
She was started on macrodantin for a UTI.
Her INR became supratherapeutic and she was given FFP and vitamin K.  Her confusion resolved and her INR came down to 1.3.
She will receive 0.5 mg of coumadin today.
