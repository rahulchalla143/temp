Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mmHg at rest and > 90 mmHg with valsalva manuever, post-PVC, and dobutamine infusion.
Successful alcohol septal ablation with decrease in the left ventricular outflow gradient to < 25mmHg with dobutamine infusion.
The LVOT gradient was 80-90 mmHg on dobutamine infusion prior to ablation and 25 mmHg post ablation, both measured during the procedure (see results section).
A 70% concentric hazy lesion of the LAD was also noted during this procedure (and was known prior to admission).
On [**6-20**] she underwent a second cardiac catheterization for elective stenting of the LAD lesion with a drug eluting Cypher stent.
Her creatinine was slightly above baseline on admission and she received renal protection prior catheterization with mucomyst and iv fluids with bicarb.
Her verapamil was discontinued because of it's nodal blocking properties, and for blood pressure control, she was switched to amlodipine 10 mg daily.
