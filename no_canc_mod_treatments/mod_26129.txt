Admission Date:  [**2126-12-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: R basilic vein thrombosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R heart catheterization L internal jugular central venous line L radial arterial line  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] is a 46 year old woman with history of AML s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor in [**2124-10-24**], with TBI and Cytoxan for conditioning regimen.
Her course was complicated by graft versus host disease of the skin and lungs, hypertension and numerous steroid-related complications such as diabetes, steroid myopathy, and increased peripheral edema.
The PICC line was pulled and she was admitted for anticoagulation.
Of note, she was recently discharged after she was admitted with Enterococcal bacteremia (vanco sensitive); she finished her course of ampicillin yesterday.
2) Bronchiolitis Obliterans - PFTs [**2126-6-6**] showed FEV1 0.47 L/17% of predicted, FEV1/FVC 41% - developed due to GVHD [**6-29**] - at End Stage Lung Disease - severely limited functional status  40 (on prior admission) 3) Right lung abscess, s/p resection 4) Pulmonary nodules with geotrichum 5) Diabetes Mellitus, [**1-25**] steroid treatment 6) Hypertension   Social History: Patient lives with mother, but has been at rehab since her [**Hospital1 18**] discharge one week ago.
She was therefore started on sildenafil.
The nephrology service was consulted, and she diuresed well on a regimen on albumin, lasix, and chlorthiazide (then metolazone).
Her diuresis was discontinued on [**1-8**] because of development of hypotension occuring in the setting of a urinary tract infection.
UTI: She developed a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas on [**12-15**] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacin then ciprofloxacin.
Her foley catheter was changed, as she refused to have it removed.
She subsequently developed a fever to 101.3 on [**1-7**] and was started on cefepime, with addition of vancomycin and flagyl on [**1-8**].
A central venous line and arterial line were placed under sterile conditions.
Hypotension and tachycardia: She developed hypotension to the 70's sytolic on [**1-8**] which responded initially to fluid boluses.
Her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresis and possible urosepsis.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was given adenosine 6 mg X 2 with conversion to sinus tachycaria after the second dose of adenosine.
The following day, a dose of verapimil was tried given concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock (however the patient's extremities remained warm to palpation, which suggested likely septic shock) with conversion back to sinus tachycardia.
Right basilic vein thrombosis: The patient's PICC line was removed and she was started on IV heparin and then coumadin.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive stools and widely varying INR (thought likely to be due to interactions with her many medications).
A repeat ultrasound of the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.
AML with history of GVHD: She was continued on cyclosporine, Cellcept, and her prednisone was titrated down per BMT recommendations.
Elevated LFTs: Her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes of these findings.
Her creatinine improved with addition of albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this.
This study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 28 and she was subsequently started on sildenafil, which was subsequently d/c'd upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (see above).
Heme positive stools: As noted above, she had heme positive stools in the setting of anticoagulation with IV heparin and warfarin and recent C. difficile colitis infectoin.
In addition, she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and was receiving steroids for her GVHD.
She was started on a PPI and her Hct was followed closely.
Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency: The patient's PTH was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes noted on plain films included osteitis fibrosa.
She was started on weekly vitamin D and daily calcium.
Her pain was treated with oral dilaudid as needed for pain control.
She was started on cyclosporin eye drops and artificial tears.
She was evaluated by the opthalmology consult service who recommended addition of Refresh eye drops which she continued with relief of her symptoms.
