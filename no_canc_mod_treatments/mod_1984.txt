VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2194-4-4**] 1:04 PM OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW: An oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow pathology division.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2194-4-2**] 1:03 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-27**], the endotracheal tube has been removed.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU after being intubated and sedated for agitation as in HPI.
Briefly, he was delirious and required intubation for airway protection and to undergo imaging studies and LP safely.
He was placed on Vanco/Levo for UTI and aspiration pneumonia coverage.
After antibiotics were started, his delirium dramatically improved, but he was still moderately agitated.
He required soft restraints for agitation and protection of the patient himself and for the staff (he was hitting and scratching staff and pulling out foley and IVs).
A family meeting decided that the patient would become comfort measures only (CMO) (HCP is his son [**Doctor Last Name **], with no gastric tube for feeding, pain control prn, and completion of antibiotic treatment for his infections.
(see below for details under code status)  He responds well to Zyprexa 2.5 mg QAM and 5mg QPM standing, Zyprexa 2.5 IV/IM prn, and/or Haldol 0.5 IV prn.
Geriatric consult assessed the patient and recommended these medications for the patient.
Speech and swallow consult performed bedside assessment and video swallow, and recommended thin liquids and pureed consistency.
Family understands aspiration risk but wants to focus on comfort care at this point.
He was given morphine 2 IV prn, Tylenol 1 g prn with no change in patient's report of diffuse body pain.
He was maintained on ASA, metoprolol.
# Paroxismal afib: He was rate controlled on metoprolol, and anticoagulation was on ASA PR.
No coumadin given fall risk.
# Bilateral eye pain/blindness: The patient was assessed by ophthalmology consult who recommended glaucoma and prophylactic erythromycin eyedrops for the patient.
# Seizure disorder: Continued PO Phenytoin at baseline.
He has PAFIB and thus was not given Vitamin K.  # DNR/DNI/CMO: Family meetings including the HCP concluded that DNR/DNI/CMO was the appropriate goal of care for the patient.
