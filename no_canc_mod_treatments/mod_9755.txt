She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] immediately for surgical intervention.
She had a relatively uneventful perioperative course except for one unit of packed red blood cell transfusion postoperatively.
She had a total L1 vertebrectomy, fusion and segmental instrumentation of T12 to L3, cage placement at L1, and autograft during the first surgery.
About one month later, on [**2120-7-9**], she was readmitted for elective second operation to correct kyphoscoliosis.
The second operation included a posterior fusion of T9 to L3, multiple thoracolumbar laminectomies, segmental instrumentation of T9 to L3, and right iliac crest graft.
Postoperatively, however, she suddenly decompensated in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit while she was receiving a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound infection (which were documented with positive cultures on [**7-17**]).
After she was started on intravenous oxacillin on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures drawn on later days.
She also underwent incision and drainage of posterior wounds on [**7-23**].
MEDICATIONS:  Oxacillin, Lopressor, subcutaneous heparin, Zantac, Ativan, Haldol, Colace, Epogen, vitamin D, nasogastric tube feeds  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Differential:  71% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, 2% eosinophils.
Calcium 8.2, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 1.6.
Liver function tests:  AST 82, ALT 52, LD 319, alkaline phosphatase 201, amylase 29, lipase 22.
CT angio showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, increased left pleural effusion, ground-glass attenuation consistent with volume overload.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While on the Medical service, she was continued on oxacillin and showed improvement with decreased white blood cell count and decreased temperature.
Six weeks of intravenous oxacillin was recommended by Infectious Disease consult, given the patient's high risk of relapse due to the hardware placed inside the originally-infected wound.
A PICC line has been placed for the long course of intravenous antibiotic treatment.
So far, all blood cultures drawn after starting oxacillin were negative to date.
Her initial symptoms of tachycardia have also resolved, likely due to a combination of measures including intravenous hydration, improved pulmonary function with incentive spirometer.
After she was medically stabilized and weaned off all sedatives including Haldol, Ativan, Zantac, her mental status improved dramatically.
Given her questionable history of alcohol abuse and poor nutritional status currently, vitamin B12 and folate and thiamine and a multivitamin were given as supplements.
Psychiatry recommended restarting on Haldol to control psychotic symptoms and continue one-to-one sitter until the patient was no longer at high risk of eloping from the hospital.
Now the patient has been doing well without a one-to-one sitter for more than 24 hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Oxacillin 2 grams every four hours intravenously for a total of six weeks (until [**8-31**]), Haldol 2 mg every morning and 2 mg daily at bedtime, Trazodone 50 mg daily at bedtime, Lopressor 100 mg twice a day and hold for systolic pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 60, multivitamin one tablet once daily.
