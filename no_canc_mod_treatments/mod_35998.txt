When you got the hospital you required a lot of extra oxygen to help you breathe.
You were brought to the intensive care unit to be watched very closely and we started antibiotics to treat what we believe was a lung infection.
When you were stable enough, you were transferred to a general medical floor where we continued to decrease the amount of oxygen you received since you were breathing much better.
You will continue on antibiotics as an outpatient for a few more days.
We have made the following changes to your medications: START Cefpodoxime 200mg twice a day until [**2-22**] START Ciprofloxacin 250mg twice a day until [**2-22**] START Lidocaine patch as needed for back pain  Please continue to take the rest of your medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] to arrange a follow-up appointment if you'd like.
