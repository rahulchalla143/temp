At that time he had hypotension, bradycardia, altered mental status which was thought to be secondary to urinary tract infection and medication effect.
He improved with treatment of UTI and decrease in methadone and diltiazem doses.
An IO was placed and he recieved 1L IVF and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He was given IV vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam.
Past Medical History: - Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion C3-6 for cord edema in setting of fall (8ft from ladder) and subsequent quadriplegia, C6 level clinically - indwelling suprapubic catheter - s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter [**2130**] - s/p baclofen pump - COPD - OSA   Social History: Lives in [**Location 32944**] MA with his wife and son.

- neuro consult was obtained on [**2136-5-26**] and was started on LTM which revealed generalized spike wave as well as left hemisphere discharges and he had an event with right gaze deviation and body stiffening, unresponsiveness.
Due to these findings he was loaded with Keppra and his home Valium and Gabapentin were restarted, although at lower doses.
Contractures: Due to Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 69570**] and contractures of his hand, he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for botox injections (as well as for his Keppra for seizure control).
Baseline CO2 likely 50s - 60s.
He was initially intubated upon arrival and therefore admitted to the ICU, he was weaned from the vent and extubated without difficulty.
Upon admission to the ICU he was getting vanc and unasyn which was broadened to vanco and zosyn.
Whether treatment was required was discussed with ID as this may be a colonization and it was felt that since the pt is now clinically asymptomatic, has no pain and is clinically doing well, treatment can be deferred.
This was particularly questioned due to the concern for interaction of coumadin and fluconazole if treatment were pursued.
During his ICU course he was not significantly hypotensive while on propofol (for intubation).
Coumadin was continued at 5mg daily for goal INR of [**2-24**].
