Culture data ([**12-2**]) BCx negative UCx negative DFA influenxa negative, culture negative  Liver Bx [**12-8**]: Preliminary report shows acute and chronic inflammation, plasma cells, eos and neutrophilic infiltrate.
She was initiated on benadryl, steroids and H2 blockers and admitted to the MICU for overnight monitoring.
She remained respiratory stable and hemodynamically stable in the MICU and did not require intubation or pressor support.
Allopurinol had been discontinued since [**11-21**] as documented in previous notes.
In addition, zestril and lasix had been held since [**11-27**] as documented in OMR notes.
She was started on ursodiol given her hyperbilirubinemia and intense itching.
Itching persisted despite symptomatic management with anti-histamines, sarna lotion, H2-blockers and eucerin cream.
The only new medicine she had been started on was fexofenadine and levofloxacin (3 day treatment for UTI), both of which were discontinued.
Liver biopsy was performed and demonstrated acute and chronic inflammation, plasma cells, eoinophils and neutrophilic infiltrate.
Although allopurinol toxicity generally causes granulomatous hepatitis and there were no granulomas present, allopurinol was still thought to be the most likely culprit medication.
She was initiated on steroids with prednisone 40mg PO Qday on [**12-10**].
Following initiation of her steroid regimen, all indices of her LFT's began to decline.
She was discharged home with a steroid taper and follow-up scheduled with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Other potential precipitating medications included zestril, NSAIDS (naproxyn) and lipitor.
In addition, NSAIDS,zestril and lipitor should be avoided until her labs normalize and she remains clinically stable.
UTI- Urinalysis on [**12-4**] showed moderate leukocytes and >50 bacteria, so she was started on a 3 day course of levofloxacin which was completed on [**2166-12-7**].
Her blood sugars were noted to be >400 on several occasions after starting prednisone, despite increasing her NPH regimen.
Her NPH was eventually titrated up to 80mg qam and 80mg qhs.
In addition, she was switched from regular to Humalog sliding scale and her scale was titrated up as well.
Asthma- continued on albuterol inhalers prn 8.
Anemia- Given 1U PRBC on [**12-7**] in setting of her liver biopsy when she had a hct of 27 (hct=28 on admission).
Her hematocrit increased appropriately following transfusion and has remained stable at 33.
