Admission Date:  [**2192-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-7-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2161-9-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Incision and drainage of right forearm abscess [**2192-7-6**] - Intubation [**2192-7-1**] - Extubation [**2192-7-3**] - PICC line placement [**2192-7-3**] - PICC line removal [**2192-7-17**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 30 year old female with past medical history of hepatitis C, intravenous drug use, congenital birth defect, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with dyspnea.
She reports that for approximately the last three days, she has had poor appetite, nausea, non-bilious non-bloody vomiting, loose stools, and poor urine output.
Given the above findings, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management after getting 1 liter of NS with 40 mEq of KCl.
She received 40 mEq of KCl in 1 liter of NS at [**Hospital1 **] and as well as in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: - Hepatitis C - Polysubstance abuse, including intravenous: Heroin, cocaine, benzodiazapines, and barbituates - Urogenic malformation with single kidney: status-post surgery with iliostomy and urostomy used for self-catherization three times a day.
- History of E. Coli urinary tract infections - Depression - History of seizure in setting of metabolic acidosis and possible ingestion/overdose - Prior respiratory failure requiring intubation  Social History: Patient lives with roommate and boyfriend.
- Illicits: History of cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepine and barbituate use.
+ Ileostomy on right side with brown stool in bag, + ostomy catherization site in midline suprapubic area.
Evaluation is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
After administration of intravenous lorazepam on the afternoon of [**2192-7-9**], the electrographic status epilepticus resolved and an underlying slow and disorganized background in the theta frequency range suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy was seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 30 year old female with history of hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse, chronic renal insufficiency, cloacal extrophy s/p bladder augmentation with neoureter reconstruction with small bowel who presents with dyspnea, found to have significant acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure with hypokalemia.
This improved with fluid challenges and bicarbonate.
#) Hypokalemia: The patient also had severe hypokalemia, thus far has received 80 mEq in intravenous fluids.
She also has a history of hypokalemia based on her records from [**Hospital3 **] and may not have been repleting it properly prior to hospitalization.
She received over 500meq of potassium while in the ICU.
Her magnesium was repleted aggressively as well.
#) Bacteremia: The patient started growing out E. Coli in [**1-21**] blood culture bottles resistant to bactrim, ampicillin and cipro, and on initial presentation also had a profound leukocytosis.
The patient was intubated for airway protection and and was started on meningitis dosing of antibiotics - vancomycin/cefepime and acyclovir.
The patient was placed on droplet precautions.
#) Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline renal function per notes appears to be around 1.6, likely in part due to congenital malformation, which includes a solitary pelvic kidney.
Initial creatinine was greater than 8, which improved with IV fluids.
She received 1 unit of pRBCs while in the unit.
She received 2 mg of IV lorazepam with immediate improvement in mental status (asking "Where am I?
Patient initially required frequent electrolyte checks and supplementation of potassium, magnesium, calciium, and phosphate but electrolytes stabilized within 2-3 days following arrival to the floor.
Patient continued to experience right forearm pain/swelling after transfer to the floor, so repeat ultrasound was undertaken.
Incision and drainage was performed on [**2192-7-6**].
She was continued on her current course of IV antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime (started to treat her E. coli bacteremia), with plan to continue 7 days of therapy (ending [**7-13**]) with levofloxacin after IV course complete.
Because she cannot be catheterized by nursing staff due to complicated anatomy, urology was called for urgent foley placement under cystoscopic guidance.
Urology recommendations were for ostomy bag fitted to fistula site (as patient was exhibiting evidence of skin irritation and continued to leak urine from this site) as well as for follow up with pediatric urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 1810**] (for his greater familiarity with congenital anomalies such as this patient has).
She was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus on EEG and was sent to the MICU prophylactically in case phenobarbital arose overnight.
Neurology recommend that we continue EEG monitoring.
She was given a 1L NS bolus with good response of her HR.
However, she responded to ativan 2mg IV.
Patient was therapeutic on Dilantin at this time so she was loaded with Keppra 1g x1 and continued on a maintenance dose of 500mg [**Hospital1 **] based on renal function.
Patient had been started on treatment in the MICU for presumed meningitis but this was discontinued after 12 days of therapy given compromised renal function.
She was therefore started on standing sodium bicarb with improvement in her electrolytes.
#) Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline renal function per notes appears to be around 1.6, likely in part due to congenital malformation, which includes a solitary pelvic kidney.
#) Anemia:  She was started on Epoietin Alfa on [**7-15**] and discharged on weekly Epo to be administered by her mother, who is a nurse.
She was given the contact information for AA and for a drug treatment hotline.
#) Right arm abscess:  s/p incision and drainage.
She received a course of vancomycin and cefepime.
She was started on sertraline and received prn doses of ativan for acute anxiety while here.
She is to continue the sertraline after discharge.
As these were drawn in the setting of her acute illness and recent ICU stay, would repeat as outpatient after she has recovered.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had difficulty breathing and your kidney was not working well.
While you were in the hospital, you had a non-convulsive seizure and required phenytoin (dilantin) and keppra (also called leviteracetam).
You were treated with antibiotics in case you had an infection that might be causing the seizures.
It is important for you to take your seizure medications regularly.
It is very important that you take your medications consistently and as directed.
***Medication changes:*** Started phenytoin (also called dilantin) for seizures Started keppra (also called levetiracetam) for seizures Started Epo (erythropoietin) for your low blood counts; your mom can give you an injection once a week Started sertraline 25mg daily for anxiety Started sodium bicarbonate 650 mg by mouth daily to help keep your acid/base balance Started miconazole powder for the skin irritation around your ostomy bag.
[**Hospital 2514**] clinic: We will provide you with a letter to take to clinic so that you can continue your care there.
