He underwent a succesful cadaveric liver transplant on [**2180-9-21**].
He had been maintained at home on ursadiol and lactulose.
Complicating the picture, the patient had diarrhea on admission which led to volume loss thought to contribute to his acute renal failure; his diarrhea resolved after a few days with no organism found on stool cultures.
He was hypotensive (thought to be secondary to low serum osmotic pressure) and he required several infusions of albumin over the course of a few days.
On [**2180-9-21**] a donor was found and the patient underwent a cadaveric liver transplant.
