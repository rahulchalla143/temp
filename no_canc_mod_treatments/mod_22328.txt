Upon arrival into the Trauma Bay, the patient was intubated and nonresponsive (the patient received a small amount of fentanyl and one dose of paralytic in flight).
There was significant laceration on the patient's forehead and head down to the skull; however, no evidence of skull fracture on visual inspection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon arrival, the ET tube positioning was confirmed with CO2 indicator and bilateral chest tubes were placed for prophylaxis.
The patient started receiving blood products, initially untyped blood followed by FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate which improved his blood pressure to 120s- 140s and heart rate decreased down to 80s.
The Foley was placed easily; however, only a minimal amount of urine was obtained, so the Foley was left in place.
Orthopedic Service was consulted immediately and recommended external fixation of both pelvis and bilateral lower extremities.
More blood products were given.
Another chest tube with a 6- French was placed in the CT Suite.
The CT scan revealed, as above, persistent pneumothorax on the left which was fixed with another chest tube, hemothorax on the right with significant bilateral contusions.
Throughout that, the patient remained intermittently hemodynamically unstable, requiring continuous amounts of blood products, fluids as well as pressor support with epinephrine.
His groin arterial and venous line were changed and AV rewarming was initiated.
