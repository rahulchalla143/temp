He states he has a number of friends at the senior center program and denies drug and alcohol use now and in the past.
The patient also has a history of multiple elevated CK enzymes in the past thought to be from a muscle source as well as a markedly abnormal EMG which raised the concern of a neuromuscular component to his hypercapnia.
At the time of admission, the patient was on three liters of oxygen via nasal cannula chronically at home which he started several months ago.
Because of the concern about a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on his chest x-ray, a fever, and a cough, the patient was treated with a seven-day course of levofloxacin.
He is a carbon dioxide retainer, and one night after his oxygen was increased to ten liters per minute because of his desaturation, the patient became somnolent and confused.
He was briefly transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and placed on BI-PAP with resolution of his confusion and somnolence.
The patient was then continued on BI-PAP at night which he tolerated very well initially.
During the remainder of his hospitalization, the patient also had a high resolution chest CT to rule out pulmonary embolism which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
He was continued on his metered dose inhalers and theophylline and had no evidence of worsening of his asthma throughout his hospital course.
He did, however, start to refuse his BI-PAP at night as he became more agitated and paranoid, although he did not have evidence of desaturation at night after he had completed a course of levofloxacin.
PROBLEM #2:  Cardiovascular:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no known history of coronary artery disease and has had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure while at [**Hospital1 190**].

Two weeks prior to admission, his Paxil and risperidone were discontinued by his outpatient psychiatrist, and he was started on Zyprexa 15 mg p.o.
His mental status declined over several days into his hospital course when he was febrile and had become acutely hypercarbic secondary to being on ten liters of oxygen which caused him to retain carbon dioxide.
He was treated with BI-PAP briefly in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and had resolution of his hypercapnia and resolution of his mental status as well.
His evening dose of Neurontin was decreased to 300 mg q.p.m.
PROBLEM #5:  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had a slightly elevated potassium on admission and was treated with Kayexalate in the Emergency Room.
