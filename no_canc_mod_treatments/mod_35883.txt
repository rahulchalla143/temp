Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75-year-old female with ESRD, hypertension, COPD, status post LRRT [**2180**] w/ cardiac cath showing 3VD who was deemed a non-surgical candidate for her coronary artery disease, and was managed for respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD and dCHF.
She was placed on Bipap and did well.
She was also hyperkalemic on transfer, which improved with diuresis and kayexelate.
For blood pressure, would consider hydralazine as next medication (renal transplant team is okay with thims).
On transfer back to the floor, respiratory status was improved and patient was comfortable and satting well on nasal cannula.
Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and responded well.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for consideration of CABG.
Several studies were obtained for pre-op assessment and the pt was cleared for CABG on [**4-7**].
she was placed on duonebs q2hrs and advair was added.
considered starting a steroid course, but did not initially since pt was going to OR for CABG.
Once patient was thought not to be candidate for CABG, started prednisone 40mg qd.
she also completed a z-pack, a few days of levaquin and a few days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
pulmonary was consulted and recommended switching to IV steroids which were given for 24 hours.
she was started on a nonrebreather and given nebs.
hydralazine did not bring down her BP, but she was given 80mg IV lasix total and started on nitro drip which brought BP to 140s.
Patient was started on torsemide 20mg PO.
Her anti hypertensive medication regimen was adjusted.
On discharge, she was on Carvedilol 25mg PO bid, Isosorbide mononitrate 60 qd, Nifedipine 30 PO bid.
