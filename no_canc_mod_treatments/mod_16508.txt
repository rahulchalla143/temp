[**Name (NI) **] was twin number two of a dichorionic, diamniotic pregnancy.
He was delivered by cesarean section for breech presentation and unstoppable labor.
His neonatal course was remarkable for respiratory distress syndrome treated with high-frequency oscillator ventilation for nine days.
He had hypotension treated with dopamine.
He had a large patent ductus arteriosus at two weeks of life which was treated with indomethacin.
He developed severe necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgical treatment and was transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2158-12-11**] at 15 days of life.
He was found to have a perforation of the splenic flexure of the bowel and an ileostomy was performed.
The surgery was complicated by hepatic hemorrhage.
He was treated with high-frequency ventilation postoperatively and then transitioned to conventional ventilation and CPAP prior to transfer back from [**Hospital3 1810**] on day of life 32.
He developed problems with his feedings within two days of discharge with irritability and spitting of his formula from his mouth and nose.
He continued on these feedings for one week, taking approximately 60-70 cc every four hours and spitting up approximately 5-10 cc at each feeding.
He was treated with hourly feedings of Pedialyte and then transitioned to half and then three-quarters strength Neosure with recurrence of vomiting.
He was then transitioned to Enfamil formula and then Alimentum and then ultimately Neocate over the next two days.
Regurgitation and fussiness with feedings has persisted.
The ileostomy drainage previously was partially-formed stool and has changed to dark green watery output.
He was evaluated by his pediatrician on the day of admission and the decision was made to admit for further diagnostic work-up.
Respiratory:  He has always remained in room air with comfortable respirations.
At the time of discharge he is eating Pregestimil 22 calories per ounce on an ad lib schedule, taking approximately 140-200 cc per kg per day.
Currently he has spitting with three to four hour feeding intervals and has been restarted on Prilosec, Mylanta and Reglan.
He had stool cultures sent and they were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and Clostridium difficile.
At that time he was changed to Pregestimil formula and has tolerated that well.
A plan for a repeat esophageal dilation was planned for [**2159-5-4**].
His ostomy was noted to have some superficial skin breakdown on [**2159-4-22**] that was treated with topical skin barrier.
He is receiving supplemental iron of 2 mg per kg per day.
Infectious disease:  He has remained off antibiotics during his stay and his stool cultures are as above.
RECOMMENDATIONS:  Return to feedings of Pregestimil 22 calories per ounce made with concentration.
Metoclopramide 0.3 mg p.o.
Iron sulfate (25 mg per mL) 0.2 cc p.o.
Omeprazole (Prilosec) 1.3 mg p.o.
IMMUNIZATIONS:  He received his second cycle of immunizations during this hospital stay.
They are as follows:  DaPT on [**2159-4-13**], IPV [**2159-4-13**], hepatitis C vaccine [**2159-4-14**], pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) on [**2159-4-14**], and Hib [**2159-4-15**].
