He went to the operating room, where he underwent a three-vessel CABG; LIMA to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the oblique marginal, and also saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
The procedure was relatively uncomplicated.
Atrial wires were also noted to be capturing.
He was started on oral Lasix, Lopressor, and aspirin.
He had no pneumothorax in the immediate postoperative period with chest tubes in good position.
The patient had his chest tube removed by postoperative day #3.
Lopressor was titrated to effect, to keep the pulse and blood pressure well controlled.
The Foley was discontinued, however, he failed to void at eight hours and 500 cc post void residual, so, therefore, he was kept with a Foley times 24 more hours, after which time it was discontinued and he successfully voided spontaneously.
