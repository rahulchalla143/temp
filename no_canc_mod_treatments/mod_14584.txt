Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 59863**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer as well as recent admission for PNA, transaminitis, pancreatitis, MS changes, who presents from rehab with lethargy and was found to be hypotensive.
# Hypotension: Patient had SBPs of 80s-90s on arrival to the ICU depite 3L of fluid resuscitation in the ED.
The patient (with her family) elected to become DNR/DNI, but had not made a decision about the placement of a central line or the use of pressures on admission.
These interventions were therefore withheld, and the patient's blood pressure improved on its own with diuresis and antibiotics.
Toprol XL and nifedipine were held during her ICU stay.
On the floor pt was started on lopressor and amlodipine (rather than toprol xl and nifedipine [**2-28**] pt not swallowing pills).
She was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia, but antibiotics were discontinued on HD2.
Echocardiogram showed right heart failure and pulm htn and she received IV Lasix to promote diuresis with good effect.
The thought during her past admission was that this was from statin vs. hypotension.
Statin was held during this admission.
Improved with diuresis and antibiotics.
