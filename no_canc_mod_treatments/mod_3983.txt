Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after witnessed aspiration event with hypoxia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and NSTEMI.
He was initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics although culture grew out sparse commensals and imaging was thought to be more consistent with atelectasis and volume overload than pneumonia so antibiotics were stopped after two days.
He was given bumex boluses to maintain fluid balance a negative fluid balance until this volume overload resolved.
He was started on aspirin 325mg daily and high dose statin initially.
A heparin drip was continued for 48 hours.
He was started on low dose beta blocker and subsequently on clopidogrel.
The cardiology service was consulted and after discussion with the family the plan was for in-patient cardiac catheterization.
[**Hospital 21581**] medical management was pursued.
He was treated with bumex boluses and his volume overload resolved.
Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted regarding glargine and insulin sliding scale dosing.
He had several episoded of hypoglycemia on his home dose of glargine that were atributed to poor PO intake.
Glargine was subsequently decreased to 10 units at bedtime and his ISS was changed to humalog and adjusted for meals.
This was thought to be pre-renal azotemia in the setting of dehydration with osmotic diuresis due to DKA and poor forward flow due to his NSTEMI and acute CHF exacerbation.
His renal function returned to baseline with gentle IVF initially and then with diuresis.
His medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxic medications (enalpril) were held.
He was treated with low dose zyprexa prn which he received few doses of.
Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**].
He was continued on cellcept and prednisone.
Recurrent UTI: He recently completed a course of cipro for a UTI.
Urine culture grew out E.coli that was pan-resistant except to nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) ceftriaxone, ceftaz (allergy) and cefepime.
