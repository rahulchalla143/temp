Labs were notable for elevated Cr, borderline troponin elevations, and an EKG with signs of old MI.

Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation for AF presenting after a fall at home with subarachnoid hemorage.
His INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
In discussion with his daughter, goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures and his AICD was turned off.
Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis; levels were within normal limits.
Coumadin was held given bleed; was actively reversed with FFP.
On the day of discharge, mental status acutely changed and patient was transitioned to comfort measures only with IM ativan as needed for seizure activity.
2) Coagulopathy:  Coumadin was held given bleed.
Anticoagulation has been for hx of atrial fibrillation and also has a graft connecting his left ventricle to descending aorta placed at [**Hospital1 2025**]; cardiology was consulted and they felt that given his low CHADS2 score and after reviewing the graft, they felt that holding coumadin in setting of bleed was appropriate.
They noted that watching for ischemia/clots/emboli in the lower extremities was important, as emboli from the graft would be predisposed to going there.
During his hospital course, despite further vitamin K and FFP, he became more hypercoagulable in the setting of acute hepatitis and absence of clear DIC.
We performed a basic syncope work-up; chest x-ray revealed no sources of infection, UA showed growth of enterococcus: received 2 doses of ampicillin, however this was discontinued after it was noted colonies were < 100,000 and WBCs in urine were very few.
7) Dispo: extended care facility with comfort focus  Medications on Admission: 1) Citalopram 20 2) Clonazepam 0.25 mg daily 3) Gabapentin 100 mg daily 4) Potassium chloride 10 mg PO BID 5) Coumadin 6) Furosemide 120 mg QAM and 80 mg QHS 7) Metolazone 5 mg PO daily 8) Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID 9) Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO daily 10) Rosuvastatin 20 mg PO daily 11) Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO daily 12) Aspirin 81 mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

Due to further worsening of your mental status and changes in your respiratory pattern, the decision was made to discontinue aggressive care and to focus on comfort measures.
Please use morphine concentrate sublingual solution as needed for pain and ativan IM for any seizure activity.
