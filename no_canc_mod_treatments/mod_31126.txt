She did not lose pulses in the emergency department, and was placed with a right femoral triple lumen, started on amiodarone gtt, as well as levophed.
At that time, a head CT was negative for acute ischemic or hemorrhagic, and the team felt that MRI would not change the treatment MRI was not performed and she was continued on conservative treatment.
She at that tiem was also noted to have difficulty swallowing, as well as occasionally SBPs in the 180s, for which she was started on lisinopril.
At that time, she developed fever and as U/A was positive for bacteria she was started on ceftriaxone for 3 days, but was subsequently discontinued after urine culture reportedly came back negative, although cultures here appear to be positive for VSE.

Radiology See webOMR for final reports  Brief Hospital Course: 76F history of multiple systems atrophy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin, DM2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar spinal stenosis who was admitted for cardiac arrest.
The patient was treated with standard post-arrest protocol including cooling for neuroprotection.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia, C. difficile given toxic megacolon despite negative stool antigen, and urinary tract infection.
Code status was also changed to DNR/DNI as if the patient were to re-arrest, it would be unlikely that further resuscitation would be effective.
After re-warming, the EEG remained flat with intact respiratory drive on pressure support.
It was decided to pursue comfort-focus measures.
