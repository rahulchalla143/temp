She tolerated the procedure well.
She received lopressor and was placed on a diltiazem drip.

Also on the 23rd she had a drainage bag placed to her weeping left hand wound from a previous IV placement.
She was able to be weaned from ventilator and extubated [**5-25**] but then increasing respiratory difficulties prompted re-intubation morning of [**5-26**].
On [**5-27**] she remained intubated on CMV and a trach was placed due to her unstable respiratory status.
On [**6-2**] a hemodialysis catheter was placed and she was started on continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis.
She remained stable and is being medically managed by the SICU with renal service input including management of lasix drip for diuersis.
She was titrated on medications for her anxiety which helped with ventalator weaning.
On [**6-11**] she spent 12 hours on trach mask and on [**6-12**] was OOB to chair and much more interactive following commands with bilateral grasps and wiggling toes to command.
