Finally after completing a course of Zosyn and Vancomycin, both antibiotics were discontinued as well as Risperidone with the suspicion that one of these drugs may be causing the fever.
Prior to this the patient received 2 courses of Diflucan for positive urinalyses that grew yeast.
Before the above antibiotics were discontinued, the patient underwent full upper and lower endoscopy which revealed esophageal ulceration, negative for cytomegalovirus and inconclusive for herpes simplex virus by biopsy as well as inactive colitis.
The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitors and p-ANCA and ASCA were checked and were pending at the time of discharge.
Also while still on antibiotics the patient underwent a computerized tomography scan of the pelvis to look for possible osteomyelitis or fluid collection/abscess underlying the site of his sacral decubitus ulcers.
After review of old films, review of new plain films by both Orthopedic Surgery and Musculoskeletal Radiology it was concluded that what was being called a right subcapital femur fracture may actually just be osteophytes.
In any event, even if what was seen on imaging did represent a right subcapital femur fracture, review of films revealed that this fracture is old and due to the patient's inability to bear weight, no intervention would be necessary.
The patient was kept on total parenteral nutrition with excellent control of his fluid status and electrolytes until [**2149-3-15**] when he was switched to tube feeds.
On [**2149-3-14**] the patient underwent open gastrostomy tube placement in the Operating Room after a failed attempt by Gastroenterology to place a gastrostomy tube.
The reason for the gastrostomy tube was that the patient was noted to tolerate food relatively well with minimal aspiration or no aspiration while awake but since his mental status tends to wax and wane, he is unable to eat when he is weaning, it was thought best to place a gastrostomy tube for tube feeds.
He is interactive and is able to have a coherent, although sometimes nonsensical conversation with the team.
The remainder of this discharge summary will be addended by the next intern on service who will discharge this patient and provide the discharge information such as medications and diagnosis.
