Pt was treated with vanc and later discharged on nafcillin (day 1 [**6-17**] - [**7-29**]).
Csurg was reconsulted for evaluation for mitral valve replacement.
If patient is postmenopausal then further evaluation is recommended with pelvic ultrasound on a nonurgent basis (within 6 weeks).
There has been interval resolution of previously-seen ascites.
A gastrostomy tube is appropriately positioned (2:31).
Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery.
Right PICC tip is in the middle SVC.
Tracheostomy tube in standard position.

Large mucous plugs were suctioned along with albuterol nebulizer, 2 mg IV ativan, and 100% O2 to bring her up to O2 sats in the 80s.
She briefly required ventilatory support with a PEEP of 5cmH2O and pressure support of [**4-26**] cmH2O.
Her respiratory status improved with suctioning and humidified oxygen.
On the medical floor, her respiratory status stabilized, and did well with intermittent suctioning and maintained adequate cough.
As pt was afebrile and had no leukocytosis, ID team felt that there was no need for additional antibiotic coverge as this was most likely benign colonization.
CT, however, raised potential contribution of ?new thrombophlebitis in the right iliac; this was not immediately evaluated in ICU pending improvement in renal function (for contrast load) and lack of acuity not requiring MRA.
As patient continued to spike fevers, the PICC line was also pulled after placement of 2 peripheral IVs, and the PICC line tip was cultured.
Her outpatient nafcillin was held and she was initially empirically treated with vancomycin 750mg IV q12h and cefepime 2g IV q8h.
The antibiotic spectrum was again changed to nafcillin and cefepime in conjunction with ID, with a plan for a total of 17 days of cefepime for the HCAP, and a complete course of nafcillin of 8 weeks duration (ending on [**2168-9-28**]).
Cardiac surgery was again consulted in re: the timing of any MVR.
ID and Vascular surgery were asked for input as to further specific managment for this finding, if any, over concern for the possible need for anticoagulation given possible nidus of septic thrombophlebitis/ongoing endovascular infection, and recommended heparin drip and would readdress operation after MVR with cardiac surgery.
Heparin drip was started after vascular initially planned on operating on groin clot before C-[**Doctor First Name **].
Serial neuro checks were done while on heparin as pt had septic emboli to brain and had hemmorrhagic components.
Pt required a head CT after starting drip which ruled out hemorrhage.
Heparin drip was discontinued as risk of intracranial hemorrhage outweighed benefit of agressive anticoagulation for clot without interval change and not symptomatic (no wet gangrene of R LE and Doppler pulses of posterior tibialis).
Her pain was treated with oxycodone PRN, and antibiotic thearpy was continued as above.
5) Dry gangrene on extremities: The patient's hands and feet show evidence of dry gangrene secondary to septic emboli.
Betadine was placed on hands and feet [**Hospital1 **] to prevent conversion from dry to wet gangrene.
Pt's pain was controlled with OxyContin, oxycodone for breakthrough, and Tylenol.
She was started on gabapentin 300mg PO TID which was subsequently increased to 600 mg TID.
8) Trach/PEG: Per IP, was going to defer downsizing tube before surgeries as pt may need bronchoscopy and trach will be used by anesthesia for procedures.
In addition, IP also planned on taking out PEG tube after procedures as well.
PEG tube was not used while on medical floor as pt was able to swallow medications and food without difficulty.
SURGICAL COURSE: 47F seen by Cardiac Surgery on [**2168-6-17**] during an admission for MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis with multiple embolic events (brain, spleen, R kidney, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions), presumably secondary to IV heroin use.
At the time of evaluation, pt was septic; thus, the initial decision was to treat her medically (vanc/Zosyn -> nafcillin x 6 wks).
Her hospital course was also significant for Klebsiella pneumonia/respiratory failure requiring trach (treated with levofloxacin x 8d), acute kidney injury (Cr 3.1, presumed secondary to ATN, secondary to hypotension), E.coli UTI (treated with cipro x7d), and fungal peritonitis (treated with micafungin and Flagyl).
Csurg was reconsulted to re-evaluate for possible surgical intervention in the setting of continued septic emboli.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Later on the night of POD#0 she was taken back to the operating room for re-exploration for bleeding.
POD 1 she was weaned from the ventilator and able to maintain adequate oxygenation on trach collar.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was afebrile on IV nafcillin, tolerating a regular diet but remained on cycled tube feeds to maximize nutrition.
She was eating well and so the tube feeds can likely be discontinued soon.
Trach and G tube removal to be evaluated at rehab once procedures completed.
The sternal wound was healing and the pain in her extremities and sternum was controlled with oral analgesics.
She is to continue Nafcillin until [**2168-9-9**] via PICC and had infectious disease follow up arranged.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 5070**] team, who placed the tube on [**6-23**], asked for a tube study that revealed that the tube was in in good position.
They are hesitant to remove the tube in this malnourished patient until the tube has been in place for at least a total of 12 weeks due to the risk of peritonitis.
Cardiac surgery and vascular follow up have been arranged.
