The patient recieved 325mg of aspirin, 600mg load of clopidogrel, heparin eptifibitide and nitro drips were started and a total of 15mg of IV metoprolol was administered.
He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have a distal sub-total occlusion in the RCA into which an everolimus-eluting stent was placed after thrombectomy was performed.
The procedure was complicated by by a hematoma during sheath pull for which he received some protamine and the integrillin was discontinued.
EXTREMITIES: Right groin site with a small 1" palpable hematoma noted at catheterization entry site, no bruits, ecchymotic ring along right groin approximately 2.5" x1" diameter.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with a subtotal occlusion in the distal segment, with evidnet thrombus.
Successful primary angioplasty of a thrombotic subtotal distal RCA occlusion with catrheter-direcetd thrombectomy (large thrombus burden was retrieved), PTCA and stenting with a 3.5x23 mm Xience DES.
Successful primary angioplasty of the RCA with removal of large thrombus burden, PTCA, stenting with DES and restoration of flow (TIMI I to TIMI III).
He was found to have a STEMI with RCA occlusion found on emergent cardiac catheterization and an additional 70% ulcertated lesion of LAD was also identified.
Mr. [**Known lastname 80182**] received 325mg of aspirin, 600mg load of clopidogrel, heparin eptifibitide,nitroglycerin IV and 15mg of IV metoprolol soon after arrival to the ED.

The patient was also started on Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2180-9-20**] to review MIBI results and will discuss any additional interventions at that time.
Mr. [**Known lastname 80182**] had no signs or symptoms indicative of heart failure/CHF during his hospital stay.
He will plan to continue ACE inhibitor and beta blockade as indicated above to prevent additional remodeling.
He was given Neutra-Phos and his Phosphorus level bumped from 2.5 to 3.3.
For ongoing management of his CAD and dyslipidemia issues  atorvastatin 80mg daily was started for tighter control in the setting of ACS.
The patient will continue to monitor LFTs as outpatient given statin increase.
He was given additional SC heparin daily as DVT prophylaxis and his groin region hematoma pain was well-controlled with Tylenol.
A bowel regimen was started with colace to allow for stool softening and to avoid any excess strain during ACS recovery period.
He was offered therapy and given contact information for additional support.
