* Extensive paranasal sinus opacification, with fluid and/or mucosal thickening as described above.
However the patient's outpatient anti-epileptic drug, dilantin, was continued with a goal range of level [**9-11**].
Thiamine and folate were given.
He could follow basic commands and provide [**11-24**] word answers to simple questions.
Another explanation for the change in mental status is a worsening of baseline encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness.
Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and ampicillin was started for possible meningitis.
When the CSF cultures performed at [**Hospital3 **] were confirmed to be negative ([**2103-6-25**]), the ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin were discontinued.
In the absence of MRSA, vancomycin was subsequently discontinued in favor of clindamycin.
The patient had received 13 days of a 21-day course of antibiotics by the time of discharge.
The clindamycin was chosen as treatment of cellulitis for its dual coverage of aspiration pneumonitis.
