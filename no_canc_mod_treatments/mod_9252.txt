He was given levaquin and vancomycin.
Overnight, he received 3L IVF and SBP remained 80s-100s.
He was treated with continued IV ABx (vanc/zosyn).
MRI demonstrated pan spinal cord inflammation and he was felt to possibly have a myelitis of inflammatory etiology vs AVM; CT myelogram, CTA for AVM, and spinal cord biopsy were beign considered.
In the MICU, he had a marginal response to a cosyntropin stim test, so he was started on fludrocortisone for his hypotension.
His antibiotics were stopped, as he had completed 10 days of antibiotics directed at hospital acquired PNA.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-11-26**], allowing for lead placement variation, no diagnostic change.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male with hx of inflammatory spinal disease, EF 30%, recurrent UTIs, presents from neuro clinic for hypotension, low-grade fever, cough, UTI.
Sepsis also possible given pseudomonas UTI during previous admission, although no leukocytosis, normal differential, afebrile since admission; alternative source included decub sacral ulcer which grew MRSA.
Cardiogenic shock less likely given exam findings, no ECG changes, and troponins elevated only in setting of acute renal failure.
Briefly placed on fludricortisone during second MICU course.
Midodrine was considered by neurology but never administered as BP responded to IVF during each hypotensive episode.
Outpatient beta blocker and ACEi were held secondary to hypotension and renal failure and should be restarted outpatient once BP appears to be stable and renal function back to baseline normal.
Unclear why patient not on afterload reduction.
Monitored I/O's for goal of even post fluid resuscitation.
Symptomatic treatment with nebs/expectorant/cough suppresant.
Continue albuterol, advair, nebs, montelukast.
Continue incentive spirometry.
# Hx of UTI: Patient had a urinary tract infection on [**11-21**] associated with foley and completed a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin.
He has remained with indwelling foley.
U/A positive on admission, started on antibiotics.
# Constipation: On aggressive bowel regimen, along with daily lactulose and prn golytely.
Patient anticoagulated on coumadin, plus IVC filter.
IVC filter placed under IR on [**11-24**] for unclear reasons.
INR therapeutic on coumadin increased, likely from receiving ciprofloxacin on admission.
Coumadin was held, vitamin K was administered, and coumadin was later restarted with heparin bridge until INR was therapeutic again.
No improvement with prolonged steroid course during previous admission.
On tizanidine 4 TID and Neurontin 600 QID.
On MVI, Zinc, Vit C & tube feeds for wound healing.
# FEN: cardiac diet Poor PO intake, only taking sips.
Continue supplementing diet with tube feeds via PEG.
On aspiration precautions.
# Prophylaxis: bowel regimen, ppi .
