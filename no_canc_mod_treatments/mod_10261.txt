His INR was corrected with 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2.5 mg of Vitamin K, which brought it down to 1.4.
His hematocrit dropped from 41 to 28; the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix.
The patient's hypertension was difficult to control and he was started on Nipride, Hydralazine, Norvasc, Minoxidil, Toprol XL and Aldomet.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair, and renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy, who presents with a right adrenal hemorrhage in the setting of an INR of 2.3.
His hospital course up to this point has been notable for persistent malignant hypertension necessitating a Nipride drip and multiple oral agents.
We held the patient's Coumadin given this acute event.
Hypertension:  We started the patient on a regimen of Labetalol, Hydralazine and Norvasc.
The patient tolerated this regimen well without any difficulties.
However, given his recent hemorrhage, he is not currently a candidate for the anti-coagulation necessary for this procedure, therefore, we will control his blood pressure with oral agents and he will follow as an outpatient for further management of his renal artery stenosis.
We initially treated him with a five-day course of Zithromax for possible bronchitis.
We subsequently ended up starting the patient on a Prednisone taper.
He tolerated the Prednisone quite well and had a marked improvement in his respiratory status.
He was continued on his Metered-Dose Inhalers and had instructions by Respiratory Therapy for the appropriate use of the inhalers.
We have held his Coumadin given his adrenal hemorrhage.
However, they have recommended the patient to follow with his vascular surgeon in [**State 531**] for further management.
