DR. [**First Name (STitle) 2618**] [**Doctor Last Name **] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21884**]      Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-6-15**] via transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for surgical management of his coronary artery disease.
On [**2168-6-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 59043**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Cardiac: As his cardiac index was low, he remained intubated and sedated on pressors and inotropes postoperatively.
He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and cardioversion.
As he continued to improve from a cardiac standpoint, his chest was successfully closed on [**2168-6-25**].
As he fully weaned from pressors and inotropes, beta blockade was resumed.
He was continued on a statin and aspirin as well.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] required aggressive diuresis for fluid overload.
Subcutaneous heparin was used for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prophylaxis.
Nutrition: Tube feeds were started while he remained intubated for nutritional support.
TPN was started to help maintain his nutritional status.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] developed subcutaneous emphysema after his chest closure and chest tubes were positioned accordingly with slow resolution of his emphysema.
Infectious Disease: Vancomycin was used prophylactically postoperatively.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59043**] was treated for pseudomonas Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia(VAP) with intravenous cefepime.
Flagyl was started empirically for C. Diff prevention.
A blood culture from [**2168-7-2**] grew vancomycin resistent enterococcus and a catheter tip grew gram negative rods.
Linezolid was added for treatment and his lines were changed.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 59046**] infectious disease issues stablized, flagyl was discontinued.
Fifteen days of cefepime was recommended for complete treatment of his VAP which was completed on [**2168-7-6**].
On [**2168-7-10**] he drew gram negtive rods on his central line tip and cefepime was resumed.
Aquacell was used on the open portions of his sternotomy.
The colostomy nurse was [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] who cared for his sigmoid colostomy following his bowel surgery.
He also had lower sternal drainage and the lower portion of his wound was opened.
He responded well to diuretics and is currently on Lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **].
Endocrine: Stress dose steroids were used postoperatively.
Given these findings, it was elected to perform a CT guided percutaneous cholecystostomy on [**2168-6-27**].
He was taken to the catheterization lab for an angiogram where successful coil embolization of left sided rectal arteries and successful coil embolization of perineal branches of the left internal iliac artery was performed.
He was subsequently taken to the operating room on [**2168-6-28**] where he underwent a exploratory laparotomy with rectal resection, cholecystectomy, an end ostomy and J-Tube placement.
As his tube migrated up into the stomach, the tube was repositioned by endoscopy.
He is currently on TF at night and can take PO, but does not take enough to meet his nutritional needs.
