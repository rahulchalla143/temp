CXR [**7-17**] PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Multiple midline sternotomy wires are unchanged in appearance.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls..
He was treated initially with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia.
An echocardiogram was performed and was remarkable for a newly depressed EF of 35% and near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls.
He was started on a IV heparin drip.
Hypotension precluded use of a beta blocker, but he was adminstered aspirin and a statin.
Of note, he had been on levophed and dobutamine earlier in the day for blood pressure support -- and had recently experienced a myocardial infarction.
Urine output was initially poor but improved with dobutamine consistent with poor renal perfusion in setting of depressed cardiac function post-MI.
Goals of care were discussed the patient's family, and the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only consistent with the patient's previously stated wishes not to undergo aggressive/invasive medical care.
