HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year old female with end-stage renal disease secondary to IDDM and hypertension; on hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the [**Location (un) **] Hemodialysis Unit.
She was in her usual state of health, although had an extra hemodialysis session for volume overload.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy and a nephrectomy.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aricept 10 mg p.o.
at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
daily, Cozaar 100 mg p.o.
daily, Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
daily, insulin daily, Zantac daily, Glucotrol 5 mg p.o.
daily, Renagel 2400 mg p.o.
daily, Sensipar 30 mg p.o.
daily, hydralazine 100 mg p.o.
The patient underwent an excision and repair of right arm AV graft pseudoaneurysm with a 6-mm PTFE jump graft.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
She underwent hemodialysis without any problems; 0.5 liters were ultrafiltrated.
A central line was placed.
They recommended treating empirically with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for infection, as it was felt that it was unsafe to perform a LP due to a low platelet count and coagulopathy.
The patient was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 20.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed in radiology as the right AV graft thrombosed.
The patient continued to receive hemodialysis via the temporary catheter.
The patient returned on [**2-1**] to the OR for thrombectomy of the right upper arm AV graft with fluoroscopy.
Impression included proximal stenosis, and a venography was recommended with possible dilatation of more proximal stenosis.
She remained on IV antibiotics for possible infectious etiology for seizure; although this was less likely, this was a low probability.
On [**2-6**], the patient underwent a right arm AV fistulogram and a venogram via the right common femoral vein catheter.
A catheter was placed with the SVC that demonstrated an approximately 2-cm occlusion extending from the right brachiocephalic vein to the upstream portion of the superior vena cava.
The recanalization of occlusion with a 0.035 glide wire was unsuccessful.
Findings were noted to be possibly related to infection; although given thrombus seen within the central right veins, a septic emboli and infarct were also amongst the differential diagnoses.
A one-to-one sitter was stopped after her left groin temporary hemodialysis catheter was removed.
She continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for empiric treatment for meningitis; although this was felt to be low probability, and her mental status changes were attributed to uremia and dementia.
On physical exam, the patient's right upper extremity graft site was open to air with sutures without any redness, drainage or bleeding.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Donepezil 5 mg p.o.
at bedtime, losartan 50 mg p.o.
daily, amlodipine 5 mg p.o.
daily, hydralazine 25 mg p.o.
q.6h., glipizide 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
daily, Zantac 150 mg p.o.
daily, Senna, Calcet 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d., insulin sliding scale, Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Thiamine 100 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Included end-stage renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, left upper lung nodule, right brachiocephalic occlusive thrombus, status post creation of right upper extremity arteriovenous graft and repair of right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula pseudoaneurysm.
