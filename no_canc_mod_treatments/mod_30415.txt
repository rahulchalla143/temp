Admission Date:  [**2153-4-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2078-4-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old Russian speaking male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the LAD and left circumflex in [**2152-10-21**] in [**Location (un) **] who presents with worsening and more frequent episodes of chest pain.
Prior to the day of admission, the daily chest pain was responsive to 3 to 10 sublingual nitroglycerin per day, but over the last 24 hours his chest pain has been refractory to nitroglycerin and so he decided to come in.
The patient has had multiple cardiac catheterizations with the most recent one being done in [**Location (un) **] in [**2152-10-21**] at which time a stent was placed in the LAD and left circumflex.
His most recent catheter done at [**Hospital6 256**] prior to this admission was in [**2151-4-22**].
Status post pacer placement in [**2148-12-22**] for sick sinus syndrome which was upgraded in [**2152-12-22**] for lead upgrades and generator change.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day 2.
Lipitor 40 mg po q day 3.
Prevacid 30 mg po q day 4.
Prinivil 5 mg po q day 5.
Toprol XL 25 mg po q day  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There was concern for possible in stent restenosis given the patient's recent cardiac catheterization in [**2152-10-21**].
However, the patient refused this procedure and wanted to wait.
He was started on an Integrilin drip, as well as nitroglycerin and heparin drip.
He was continued on his beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
The hope was that his family could convince him to undergo cardiac catheterization and the medications would help protect against further cardiac damage.
The patient was chest pain free with the above interventions, however his platelets dropped after being on the Integrilin drip for 24 hours and therefore the Integrilin had to be discontinued.
There were no significant changes during the re-look procedure and no additional interventions were made.
His blood pressure medications were held for a period given his acute stroke, but has since been restarted at low doses.
This was new compared with prior echocardiogram.
Given the patient's new depressed ejection fraction, he was started on a low dose of Lasix to prevent congestive heart failure.
The patient is on Plavix 75 mg for one month given his stent placement.
He is also to continue on aspirin 325 mg q day.
The left pupils was 1 mm and could not be assessed for reactivity given how small it was.
Despite holding his blood pressure medications however, his blood pressure was never above the 120 to 130 range.
He was continued on heparin as a bridge.
He is noted to have a left hemiparesis, including face, arms and legs.
He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl and on [**5-10**] he was on day 9 of 14.
He is still having thick secretions, but is improving overall.
He is requiring only 2 liters of oxygen at this point and has been on room air during the day saturating 95% requiring oxygen only at night.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  An nasogastric tube was placed for tube feeds, given that the patient was not able to feed himself.
Gastrointestinal was consulted for possible PEG placement given that this will likely be a long term need for the patient.
They did not feel comfortable placing a PEG given that the patient cannot be taken off Plavix for 30 days given his high risk for restenosis.
A pediatric nasogastric tube was placed on [**5-9**] in interventional radiology.
The issue with the nasogastric tube is that the patient continues to grab at it when his hands are unrestrained.
In addition, we will see if interventional radiology would be willing to put in the PEG despite having Plavix on board.
If there was no way to place a PEG, then this would have to be done when his course of Plavix is finished.
His Coumadin is currently being held given the possibility of invasive procedures.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient is on ProMod with fiber at 75 cc an hour with 200 cc free water boluses 4x daily.
