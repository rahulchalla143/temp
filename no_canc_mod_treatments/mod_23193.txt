On admission, he was rehydrated and given IV levoflox and metronidazole.
He was bolused 2L NS and 2L LR, with response to the low 100s.
Because of the afib, he was given lopressor 1 mg iv, then 1.5 mg iv, then 2.5 mg iv.
Recent c. diff colitis, s/p treatment with both metronidazole and vancomycin 10.
In the MICU he required intubation for respiratory distress secondary to septic shock.
He was briefly extubated but required reintubation within a couple days for a second episode of sepsis.
His MICU course was complicated by acute renal failure, continued paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite cardioversion, ventilator associated pneumonia, sepsis, and extensive fluid overload likely secondary to EF 15-20% and repeated need for fluid boluses for hypotension.
Despite multiple attempts at diuresis and treatment of his pneumonia, he remained ventilator dependent in the MICU for ~ 30 days.
Given poor prognosis and in accordance with what the family felt his wishes were, his family made the decision to switch to comfort measures only.
He was extubated, started on a morphine drip on [**2129-12-15**] and died peacefully on [**2129-12-16**].
