She improved clinically prior to discharge after CT placement for her L effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her R sided pleural effusion.
# SOB/CP/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with most obvious etiologies being pleural, pericardial effusions, and .
Due to her effusions, it was thought she may have an underlying PNA and she was started on levaquin for CAP.
She was given a prolonged course due to concern that she may have had infection in her pericardial fluid.
The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for hemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for potential procedure for a possible pericardial window.
From a respiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation which was done under rapid sequence given signs of early tamponade.
She received metroprolol IV and dilt drip.

# Pericardial Effusion: Initially echo concerning for early but not overt tamponade physiology and exam was concerning.
Patient was given IVF to maintain preload.

She was restarted on NSAID therapy for viral pericarditis.
She was given a two week course of levofloxacin to finish on the date listed above.
Cholestasis and Hepatitis:  She was noted to have to have abnormal LFT's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic R sided abdominal pain.
