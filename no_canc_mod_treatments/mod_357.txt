Patient was admitted on [**2137-1-18**] and was continued on IV vancomycin and levofloxacin for presumed right above the knee amputation stump infection.
This required multiple medication maneuvers.
She was taken on [**2137-1-21**] to the Operating Room for an I and D of the infected leg and removal of her right thigh graft, which she tolerated well.
Postoperatively, she continued to receive her IV antibiotics and did receive a PICC line for easier administration.
Also postoperatively, the patient was seen by Psychiatry both for treatment of her severe depression as well as acute mental status exacerbations and need for a one-to-one sitter.
Cardiac service was made involved at that time because during her blood transfusion her systolic blood pressure decreased and the patient went into a junctional escape rhythm requiring telemetry and close observation.
The cardiac service made recommendations to hold beta blockers as well as began to make plans for possible pacer placement.
She was emergently coded, requiring artificial respiration and chest compressions.
She was shocked a number of times as well as received a number of cardiac inotropic medications.
She was started on tube feeds.
She did require IV blood pressure management and drips for severe hypertension.
She did remain vent dependent after resuscitation in the ICU, and finally on [**2137-2-4**] the patient was made comfort measures only by the family.
Patient's ventilatory support was removed and by the evening of [**2137-2-4**] at 9:55 p.m. the patient expired with no blood pressure and no respiratory effort.
