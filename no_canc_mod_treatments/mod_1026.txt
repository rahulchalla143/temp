He took nitroglycerin x 2 w/o relief.
Of note, during that hospitalization he was found to have patent stents and had a LM/LCx cypher stent placed.
Pt reports vigilantly taking all of his post discharge medications, including his ASA and plavix.
In the ED, the patient had EKG w/ST changes in V1 and V2 stable on serial EKGs, Cardiology was consulted and recommended starting heparin IV.
Pt was started on Nitroglycerin gtt and received Morphine Sulfate 4mg as well as ASA.
He denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 59 yo man with CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2-27**], PVD, ESRD on HD, DM who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and EKG changes.
His chest pain improved incompletely on nitroglycerin drip.
Given the EKG changes and persistent CP, heparin drip was started.
His nitroglycerin drip was stopped for hemodialysis.
His isosorbide mononitrate was increased to 120 mg daily with blood pressure paramaters.
He was taken to the cath lab on [**9-26**], where he had a LAD stent and D1 rescue as noted above, but after which he had bradycardia and hypotension, unresponsive to atropine.
He had temporary pacing wires placed and was placed on dopamine and transferred to the CCU.
Accordingly we discontinued labetalol and after observation in the CCU, started metoprolol and lisinopril, observed him to ensure there were no problems with these medications, and seeing good control and no episodes of hypotension, we discharged him to home.
We were initially concerned that an increased dose of labetalol might have been the problem but the acute timing of onset makes pure medication effects less likely because overload of medicine effects should occur more gradually.
After transfer back from the CCU, the patient had normal blood pressures, though strikingly this was off the considerable number of BP meds he was on prior without rebound, which might argue against purely transient vagal effect.
He had emergent dialysis at this point, after which he had a complete dialysis cycle the next day.
The renal service advised the CCU team and the [**Hospital1 1516**] service team, and the patient underwent dialysis on his usual T Th Sat schedule.
#) Congestive heart failure, [**Hospital1 7216**], grade II: Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] was clinically mildly overloaded by exam on arrival, with crackles at his lung bases.
His fluid status was controlled with hemodialysis; the inpatient renal dialysis team followed along with his care and provided [**Known lastname 7219**] to the primary team.
#) HTN: The plan was initially to continue outpatient labetalol and Imdur, while increasing Imdur and adding an ACEi.
However, as above, we were concerned that labetalol might have contributed to his episode of hypotension and bradycardia, and sent him home with metoprolol after a period of observation, as above.
#) PVD: The patient was s/p stenting of the bilateral CIA's, L EIA and PCI of the left SFA.
He was continued on his ASA and started on Plavix, which he will also need to continue as the result of the stent placed during this admission.
#) DM: QID fingersticks and sliding scale insulin provided generally effective control of his sugar levels.
#) FEN: He was placed on a cardiac diet; electrolyte monitoring and repletion was undertaken in conjunction with dialysis.
#) PPx: Heparin IV.
