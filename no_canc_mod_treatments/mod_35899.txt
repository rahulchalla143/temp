HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2147-5-22**], status post right coronary artery stent times two in [**2148-9-21**], and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**]) who presented with 10/10 chest pain (persistent pressure similar to his past acute myocardial infarction) starting around 8 o'clock in the morning on the day of admission.
He was given sublingual nitroglycerin for his chest pain.
He was given atropine and dopamine for bradycardia and hypotension in the Emergency Room, and he went into supraventricular tachycardia.
He was brought to the catheterization laboratory directly for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
During the catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon was placed for blood pressure support, and he was intubated for airway protection.
He also required pressors including Neo-Synephrine and dopamine during the catheterization.
A transvenous temporary pacing wire was also placed during the catheterization.
Coronary artery disease; status post 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2147-5-22**]; status post right coronary artery stent in [**2148-9-21**]; and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 75/25 50 units q.a.m.
and 30 units q.p.m., Imdur 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Cozaar 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Left groin arterial and venous sheaths with intra-aortic balloon pump and Swan-Ganz catheter.
Catheterization in [**2148-9-21**] revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Total occlusion of saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the distal right coronary artery and direct stenting of the mid right coronary artery.
Catheterization in [**2149-7-21**] revealed 2-vessel coronary artery disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 80% left anterior descending artery stenosis just distal to the anastomosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was weaned off pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump quickly in the Coronary Care Unit.
Metoprolol and Cozaar were added as his blood pressure tolerated.
He was evaluated by Ear/Nose/Throat and treated with a dose of intravenous Solu-Medrol with significant improvement.
He was also treated with a 7-day course of Levaquin for possible aspiration pneumonia given the prolonged course of intubation and a low-grade temperature.
Status post acute inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarct; status post proximal right coronary artery stent.
Insulin 70/30 50 units q.a.m.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
