The patient was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2167-1-1**] through [**2167-1-2**] for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and workup of a lung mass.
The patient was discharged on [**2167-1-2**] with an increased dose of spironolactone 50 mg p.o.
He was found to have a sodium of 106 and was admitted for further workup.
The patient was hydrated with normal saline overnight and sodium continued to slowly improve and was otherwise stable.
The patient had an ultrasound of his right upper quadrant eventually to assess for ascites and his flow.
The patient was then started on ceftriaxone but on the morning of the results was found to be less responsive and hypotensive.
The patient was hydrated with fluid boluses and pressures remained persistently in the 70s to 80s even after 2 liters.
We were unable to get IV access in the patient and a right internal jugular central line was placed and laboratories were sent.
In terms of supporting his blood pressure, the patient was started on a dopamine drip on the floor and eventually it transitioned to a Levophed drip in the unit.
The patient was transitioned to 100% nonrebreather eventually as he continued to desaturate on face mask.
Eventually, the patient was intubated by Anesthesia for airway protection and for increasing acidemia and hypoxia.
The patient was also initially started on ceftriaxone in the morning but coverage was broadened to conclude Zosyn and vancomycin for which was also started upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit.
His blood pressure remained in the 80s to 60s range and he started to receive boluses of albumin in attempts to help his fluid remain intravascularly.
However, with increasing lactate, hypotension, and white count concern for sepsis.
The patient was again transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on broad coverage antibiotics including vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl empirically.
KUB did not show any free air and the patient had a NG tube placed for suctioning and a rectal tube placed for decompression.
The patient also had an arterial line placed in his left radial artery for better blood pressure monitoring.
In the MICU the patient was switched over to Levophed with thoughts of adding Vasopressin if required additional pressors.
Again, the patient was continued on respiratory support via the ventilator.
Eventually, he went down for a CT of his abdomen with gastrografin which revealed dilated loops of colon and small bowel with colonic wall thickening and no evidence of microperforation.
Secondary to his end-stage liver disease and criticalness of his illness, the patient was not considered a liver transplant candidate and was given Lactulose for history of hepatic encephalopathy and with continued Lactulose mental status did continue to improve but did continue to wax and wane even upon transfer to the floor when his orientation waxed and waned.
The patient continued to receive fluid boluses once he was titrated off pressors and with increasing hydration, his abdominal girth continued to increase and with IV fluid replacement or free water replacement did not remain intravascular.
He continued to have episodes of hypotension once he was weaned off the pressors and transferred to the floor.
These remained as above with IV fluid boluses and occasionally with albumin boluses.
His pressures remained in the 80s/60s range and at that blood pressure the patient continued to talk and mentate and continued to have reasonable urine output.
He was almost complete with his vancomycin and Zosyn course for which he will complete on [**2167-2-24**].
However, his vancomycin trough was elevated and plans were to hold vancomycin until trough drops below 15.
Also of note was increasing fluid boluses for blood pressure support and hyperalbuminemia from his chronic illness and recent exacerbation of his illness.
he did continue to have signs of skin breakdown in his sacral and back region and was placed on a Kainair mattress and seen by the wound care nurses to help evaluate his sacral skin breakdown.
This workup will be deferred for now as the patient will likely be unable to tolerate treatment for the mass at this time.
ASTHMA:  The patient's respiratory wheezes were stable and clinical asthma was stable in-house while on his Combivent and Fluticasone regimen.
However, he did have some lability here, likely secondary to his end-stage liver disease but was stable and only continued on sliding scale insulin regimen.
Continue supportive care with goal platelets at least greater than 20,000 and hematocrit greater than 30.
ELECTROLYTES:  The patient initially came in hyponatremic and this resolved with normal saline hydration and eventually corrected to hypernatremia in light of recent dehydration, especially intravascularly.
The patient was started on free water boluses through his NG tube and also started on IV free water repletion.
The patient also had a CT, as described above.
and concerned for microperforation, tube feeds were held and the patient was started on PPN and had a stable lumen PICC placed and eventually his peritonitis and small bowel improved.
CODE:  The patient's family was updated daily with progress and prognosis in terms of the patient's condition.
However, continue supportive care in terms of fluid boluses and family is still to be updated daily on any changes and on progress and will continue to treat infection and hypotension as previously.
Will continue with physical therapy and supportive comfort care.
NUTRITION:  The patient's PPN was discontinued once his small bowel dilatation seemed resolved and he was started on tube feeds through his NG tube to be titrated up slowly.
The patient's albumin was most recently 2.1, consistent with his poor nutrition and chronic disease.
Will continue tube feeds and try to improve the patient's nutritional status as possible.
