Admission Date:  [**2190-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-10-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**] Chief Complaint: Elevated blood sugars, respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central venous catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 84 M russian speaking, h/o CAD, NIDDM, HTN, CKD (baseline cre ~1.3), h/o recurrent aspiration PNA, who presents from home, after his family noted elevated blood sugars.
history obtained from son, who states pt was feeling well until 3-4d ago, when he noted increasing LH/dizziness, drowsiness, and a feeling of "fog" attributed to recent increases in his neurontin dose (for LE pain [**2-12**] spinal stenosis, dose increased from 100mg tid to 300mg tid then 600mg in AM, 300mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Post intubation, SBPs initially stable, hwowever then dropped again to 71/49, felt partially [**2-12**] sedation, unresponsive to IVF (1L more), and pt started on levophed gtt with improvement in MAPs to >60.
Pt given levoquin 750 x 1. blood sugars in 500s.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting [**2186**].
- dCHF (EF>55% [**2188**], E/A 0.8).
- PVD - s/p R ICA stent ([**2186**]) with a stable moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis.
- h/o gastrojejunostomy tube; status post aspiration pna (removed) x 1 [**1-12**] yrs to reduce need for oral feeds and prevent recurrent pneumonia.
Tube fell out and was not replaced in [**2190**] as he had been eating gradually more food and a trial of oral feeding was chosen.
The cause of the aspiration pneumonia was thought to be disordered swallowing s/p XRT to his larynx yrs ago in the USSR.
- h/o syncopal episode [**2185**] s/p Holter [**11/2185**]= sinus brady.

His respiratory status continued to deteriorate on CPAP and non-rebreather so he was intubated in the ED.
A left IJ was placed and he was started on levophed for hypotension (MAP 65).
He received a dose of levofloxacin 750mg.
Initial ABG obtained after intubation showed appropriate oxygenation (7.23/40/242 on 60% AC 600x14, PEEP 5).
He was felt to have a PNA and was switched to ceftriaxone because of concern over a prolonged QTc.
He was also started on vancomycin to broaden coverage, but this was stopped on HD#4.
He responded well to aggressive chest PT.
The patient and his family were both made aware that he will continue to be at risk for further aspiration events.
He completed a 10 day course of ceftriaxone on [**2190-10-9**].
He still required occasional oxygen by nasal cannula overnight due to periodic desaturations while supine.
SBPs improved with decreased sedation, the patient require pressors into HD#2 (initially on levaphed, which was switched to dopamine as it was felt it might be contributing to sinus bradycardia below) but he was then weaned off and maintained his pressures throughout the rest of his ICU course.
His home BP medications were restarted when his pressures stabalized.
He was originally started on a heparin drip, but this was discontinued when the enzymes were negative.
He was maintained on ASA/plavix but beta blocker was deferred given his history of bradycardia.
He was started on a GI cocktail and ice packs were used on his chest as the discomfort was superfical.
pt not on BB at baseline (apparently h/o sinus bradycardia and syncopal episode, followed by dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]).
In the ICU, FSBS improved dramatically with 10U regular insulin, to 100s, but started on insulin gtt, and FSBS up to 300s.
His insulin gtt was continued x24h, his gap closed overnight, and pt was transitioned to NPH an HISS.
On the floor he was initiated on metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Further titration of dose was deferred until at least several days on therapy.
# ARF - baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3, up to 2.0 on admission, felt [**2-12**] dehydration from DKA, and rapidly improved with aggressive IVF hydration (total 11L given over initial 24 hrs).
We recommend that the patient continue a dysphagia diet; however, given his tendency toward dehydration when drinking pre-thickened liquids only, we also recommend the patient initiate full liquids as well.
He was treated w/ ceftriaxone x 10 days.
Home glyburide was discontinued and metformin was started.
