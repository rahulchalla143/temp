Narcan 2 mg x 5 was administered without in the 60% range.
Attempted intubation was unsuccessful in the field.
The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department with no difficulty.
The patient was placed on assist control at 600 x 20, PEEP at 10, at 100%.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
On the floor, the patient was hypotensive and started on Dopamine, in addition to requiring multiple fluid boluses on admission.
On admission the patient's arterial blood gas was 7.14, pCO2 of 67, pO2 94; CBC with a white count of 25.9, hematocrit 47.2, platelet count 343; CHEM7 was with a sodium of 146, potassium 4.8, chloride 110, BUN 23, creatinine 2.1, glucose 109, lactate 5.6, amylase 160; PT 15.5, PTT 27.2, INR 1.7.
Cardiovascularly the patient was on Dopamine for hypotension with ST segment elevations in II, III, and AVF, and elevated troponins.
The patient's BUN and creatinine resolved with fluid resuscitation.
Levaquin and Clindamycin were started for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
On [**2114-9-23**], the patient subsequently dropped oxygen saturations secondary to mucous plugging and required several therapeutic bronchoscopies.
The patient was found on bronchoscopy to have tenacious secretions in the ET tube, thick mucous plug occluding the left lower lobe orifice which was suctioned out.
The patient again dropped oxygen saturations to the low 50s and was subsequently "bagged up" requiring immediate bronchoscopy.
Subsequently on the morning of [**9-24**], the patient again desaturated to the 60s with difficulty raising saturations with aggressive bagging.
The patient was started on Captopril for afterload reduction and to prevent remodeling of the heart as per Cardiology recommendations.
On around [**2114-9-26**], and [**2114-9-27**], the patient became hypoxic with systolic pressures in the 70s requiring the start of Dopamine and multiple fluid boluses which were slowly weaned.
The patient was paralyzed with vecuronium and given Fentanyl and Versed.
The patient was switched to pressure support ventilation with driving pressures of 26, respiratory rate of 18, PEEP of 13, FI02 of 80%, with good tidal volumes anywhere from 600-700.
The patient was then successfully weaned off paralytics and his sedative medication requirement.
The patient's aggression was believed to be secondary to withdraw from sedative medication status post extubation.
The patient was continued on sedative medication which was subsequently weaned including Fentanyl at 100/hr, Versed at 2/hr, including p.r.n.
The patient was continued for a full ten-day course of Levofloxacin and Clindamycin.
Furthermore, the patient was very motivated to get well with the support of friends and family.
The patient will likely require outpatient counseling with the focus on substance abuse.
Note:  Subsequent dictation addendum will add further diagnosis and the patient's discharge medications and location of disposition at the time of discharge.
