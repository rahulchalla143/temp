Brief Hospital Course: 55F with DM, bipolar d/o on lithium, s/p right arm surgery c/b MRSA infection here with AMS, [**Last Name (un) **], and hand ischemia.
Lithium level decreased with aggressive hydration - pt received 6L in the ER and UO remains robust.

Ortho felt like this was an old fracture and non-operable.
She completed a 7 day course of abx which included ceftriaxone and then vanc and zosyn.
Diarrhea was not an issue while in house and may have been due to lithium.
