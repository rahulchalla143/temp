You are on many medications that can reduce your respiratory drive, or urge to breathe.
Notably, narcotics (oxycontin and oxycodone) and benzodiazepines (xanax) can do this, so these medications were reduced for your safety.
You were also given medications to treat a possible COPD exacerbation and reduce extra fluid in your lungs.
Please attend the follow-up appointment listed below with your primary care doctor to help determine a pain management regimen that does not cause as many respiratory side effects.
