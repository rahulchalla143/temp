Admission Date:  [**2139-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-11-5**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement w/ endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 87 year-old French Creole speaking man with a history of HTN, Parkinson's disease was transferred from OSH with lethargy,  difficulty speaking for 1 day and head CT with left basal ganglia hemorrhage for further management.
He was given 1gm dilantin, and received IV labetalol 10mg x4 for BP control, though was still in 200s for most of stay.
On arrival, BP 200/100, given 10 labetalol x1 and started on nipride gtt with good effect.
Right facial droop but does grimace to nasal tickle bilaterally.
Also, he was very lethargic and not following commands or speaking.
Likely cause of bleed was hypertension, given location and PMH.
His dose of Sinemet was increased in the first several days of his admission as it was thought that his increased tone and bradykinesia could be attributed to his Parkinsonism.
However, he became increasingly lethargic, and Sinemet was reduced to his home dose w/ a response in his mental status back to his baseline.
He has a history of lethargy w/ higher doses of sinemet in the past.
Dilantin was loaded but not continued - no evidence of seizures during this admission.
R arm flaccid but bradykinetic and rigid in remaining extremities; attends to both sides, and has blink reflex.
He will need intensive physical therapy and support but may not be able to return to baseline (which his son reports as ambulation w/o assistance).
His anticoagulation and ASA were held during admission and not restarted.
On follow-up, we will consider restarting the aspirin for stroke prevention once he is further out from his bleeding.
Will not likely restart coumadin in the near future.
Management of his BP has been challenging and has required sequential addition of anti-hypertensive meds.
He was on atenolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 40 qd - here, he was given metoprolol 100 tid, captopril 75 [**Hospital1 **] (for low GFR, less frequent dosing), HCTZ 50mg qd, Norvasc 5mg qd with a range between 140 - 150s.
His BP should be <140, and would recommend further titration of his meds to achieve that goal for future stroke prevention.
He received a 7 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl followed by a repeat U/A to assess resolution of UTI.
He became more alert after the first 2 days of antibiotics and discontinuation of his foley.
He should continue to receive chest PT and suctioning.
He completed this procedure w/o complications, and he is tolerating tube feeds at goal of 70cc/hr.
