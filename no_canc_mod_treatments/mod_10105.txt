2+ radial and DP pulses, symmetric.
Colonoscopy [**2190-9-21**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Potential bright red blood per rectum from internal hemorrhoids or diverticula.
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the fellow and the attending.
Flash pulmonary edema after significant fluid and blood resuscitation following lying flat for MR-scan requiring furosemide infusion with decreasing IV requirements to her dry weight.
Increased metoprolol and started high dose statin for this and led to much improved rate control.
Restarted home amlodipine on discharge to rehab.
She was given Vitamin K 10 mg IV (for INR 2.4), Pantoprazole 80 mg IV then ggt, 2 units FFP and 1 unit PRBC.
All of her anti-hypertensive medications and Coumadin were held in the setting of GIB, though she received IV Lasix.
GI was consulted, and she was prepared for colonoscopy and EGD to take place.
While prepping with GoLytely, she had one BM with bright red blood and two BM with maroon blood, which then became clear.
She passed additional clots and BRBPR on day 4 and 5 of her admission, resulting in Hct drop to 23.7, and received 2 more units of PRBCs with appropriate response in Hct.
She had no further episodes of GIB and did not need additional transfusions, and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital stay.
ANEMIA: Her Hct in the ED was 17.2 (baseline 31-33.5), likely secondary to the acute bleed superimposed on her known, chronic anemia due to CKD.
In the setting of acute GIB, all of her home anti-hypertensive medications (amlodipine, metoprolol, minoxidil, furosemide) were held in the ED and MICU.
On her third day of hospitalization, her BP elevated to the range 160-170.
As there was no active bleeding and Hct was stable, we placed her back on amlodipine 5 mg daily, but continued holding the rest of the regimen.
On day 4 of her hospital stay, she had an episode of sinus tachycardia, so we also started her on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect, HR stabilizing back to 80s-90s.
Pt transferred to MICU on [**9-24**] for respiratory distress, RR 30s-40s, hypoxia to 80s on 4-5L requiring NRB, tachycardia to 130s, bilateral crackles, minimal response to lasix (40mg Iv x 2, 80mg IV, 120mg IV) on the floor.
Upon trasnfer, pt started on bipap 8/5 and lasix drip with rapid improvement in symptoms and was weaned to 2L NC with RR 18-20.
She was on BiPap for approximately 6-8 hours.
She was diuresed a total of 1.5L and was transitioned to 80mg IV bolus lasix dosing with good response.
She continued IV furosemide diuresis on transfer to the floor and she was eventually euvolemic and started on her home furosemide dose.
Statin increased to atorvastatin 80mg qd and up-titrated metoprolol to her home dose with good bP control.
# ECG changes and tachycardia: Pt with TWI relatively diffusely inferolaterally, new compared with prior ECGs while on MICU, likely secondary to rate related demand and strain in setting of LVH and stress cardiomyopthy.
Too high risk for heparin or ASA in setting of GIB so continued to monitor, minimize stress on the floor.
Wasgenerally stable Cr 1.8-2.2 with normal K. We trended this and there was slight improvement on reducing diuresis.
1 day treatment with co-amoxyclav then d/c'ss as felt little evidence of UTI.
# h/o DVT: Holding anticoagulation in setting of GIB as above.
This was solely for DVT in [**2183**] and has contraindication so no indication for anticoagulation currently.
Continuing metoprolol for rate control at 200mg XL daily.
Cardiology felt trial of lisinopril would be appropriate if her renal function coped with this.
# Renal osteodystrophy and Osteoporosis: We restarted calcitriol and alendronate .
# Glaucoma: Continue combigan and travanost eye drops  Medications on Admission: Alendronate (Fosamax) 35 mg PO qSunday early AM Amlodipine (Norvasc) 5 mg PO daily Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 20 mg PO qPM Brimonidine-Timolol (Combigan) 0.2 %-0.5 % Drop both eyes [**Hospital1 **] Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) 0.25 mcg PO daily Furosemide (Lasix) 60 mg PO daily Metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 200 mg PO daily Minoxidil (Rogaine) 2.5 mg PO daily Tramadol (Ultram) 50 mg tab 1-2 tabs by PO q4-6h:prn for pain Travoprost (Travatan Z) 0.004 % drop both eyes qHS Trazodone (Desyrel) 25 mg PO qHS:prn for insomnia Warfarin (Coumadin) 3 mg tab 1-3 tabs PO daily as directed by the coumadin clinic to maintain INR Docusate sodium (Colace) 100 mg PO BID Senna 17.2 mg PO daily  Discharge Medications: 1.

You were given blood products.
You were treated for this extra fluid ("pulmonary edema" and "congestive heart failure") in the ICU with a mask to help you breathe and extra lasix.
You also had a capsule endoscopy (a capsule with a camera to record as it goes through your bowel and produce pictures of the bowel wall) which showed an abnormality in your small bowel that was not clearly bleeding.
It is unclear whether this was a small stroke but given previous problems with scanning and the fact that blood thinning treatment (one of the main therapies in stroke) coudl not be given due to your previous significant bleeding meant taht we did not investigate further.
