PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETER PLACEMENT: COMMENTS:     1.
Dobutamine 10 mcg/kg/min was started in the catheterization laboratory with systolic augmentation of the aortic pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with DM2, CRI, CAD s/p MIx3, ischemic CM, EF ~20%, with x5 months SOB not relieved by cath/PTCA, whose primary complaint is waking up extremely short of breath multiple times at night for the past few days.
He reports compliance to meds and diet.
However, he states that his primary doctor has told him that his regimen has not been adequate and may need to be changed.
His carvedilol and Captopril were discontinued during hospitalization in the setting of hypotension and acute renal failure during hospitalization.
During this time he continued to deteriorate and further diuresis was attempted with natrecor without response.
A pulmonary artery catheter was place with elevated PCWP and elevated right sided pressures and a mixed venous 02 saturation of 24%.
He was started on Dobutamine and within 24 hours his mental status improved, and the [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing episodes decreased in frequency as the cardiac index increased.
After several days on Dobutamine he was started on digoxin qd, level was 1.7 and so regimen was decreased to every other day.
Beta blocker was held as it was felt that it would not be beneficial to him in the current declined state of cardiac function.
He was monitored for three days off the docutamine before discharge.
2) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Episodes occurred in setting of apnea and also while on Dobutamine.
In a family meeting it was decided that Dobutamine would be continued despite the increased ectopy.
3) DM2: Glyburide and Lantus discontinued during episode of ARF but restarted on return to baseline creatinine.
