Admission Date:  [**2155-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-11-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: A.C.E Inhibitors  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: chestpain/nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]yo Russian speaking only F with MI x 3, s/p RCA hepacoat stents x5 [**8-24**] and RCA Cypher stents x 5 in same location on [**10-12**] for STEMI who presents with chest pain from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
The pain has been going on for days, but on day of presentation, the pain was not relieved with 3 nitro.
In the ED she got BB, MSO4 2mg, ASA, and a nitro drip with resolution of her CP.
Pacemaker (Pacesetter A-V pacer) placement for sick sinus syndrome (installed for bradycardia) 3.
Dense atherosclerotic changes, including coronary artery calcifications, with multiple areas of ulcerated plaque.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW: [**Age over 90 **] yo F h/o 3VD s/p stenting x 2 with a total of 10 stents in RCA.
She was started on reglan with some relief.
She had had a recent cath with known 3VD.
She was not a surgical candidate and a repeat cath was thought to be unlikely to have been helpful.
Because she had CP in the ED, she was started on a nitro drip to make her pain free.
Because her BP was 190-200 in the ED, she was started on an increased dose of metoprolol and hydralazine was added to her regimen.
Her BP was brought to the 120's overnight and in the morning, when the patient was seen to have had a baseline creatinine even after the dye load she received with her CTA in the ED, she was restarted on valsartan 80 (which was held at her last hospitalization for low BP).
Imdur was restarted at 120 qd after the nitro drip was weaned off.
Her EF in [**1-25**] was >65%, however her estimated EF in bedside echo at last admission immediately post-MI was around 50%.
She had received BB, Imdur and Lasix earlier in the morning.
She was not taking enough fluids and was given a small bolus of 250cc.
She was likely dry at this time and further diuresis should be held.
She is likely to need lasix at small dose as an outpatient.
c) rhythm- The patient has a h/o a/v pacemaker placement in [**2144**] for sinus brady.
After 2 shocks she remained in A. fib and was started on Amiodarone.
Following day she underwent AV node ablation to prevent her from becoming tachycardic.
She should also be continued on amiodarone with goal of amiodarone down to 200mg in 1 month time and decreasing the dose to 100mg in 6 months.
Pt had history of nosebleeds in coumadin however after contacting Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt's outpt cardiologist, she was started on coumadin.
She should have INR checked frequently initially until her coumadin dose is set.
All medications were renally dosed.
However with diuresis her creatinine increased and [**Last Name (un) **] was again discontinued.
Her [**Doctor First Name 48**] was thought likely secondary to aggresive diuresis and further diuresis should be held until repeat electrolytes show improvement in creatinine.
# Heme: The patient's anemia was previously thought to be [**1-22**] CKD and anemia of chronic disease.
W/U for iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, and hemolysis were sent.
Ferritin low, TIBC low, Transferrin low - likely mixed chronic dz, chronic kidney dz, and iron deficiency.
The patient should be started on EPO as an outpatient.
She may also need repeated blood transfusions to maintain her HCT given her history of low HCT and 3VD.
Colchicine and NSAIDS are contraindicated in renal failure.
