The Swan-Ganz catheter approached via right internal jugular sheath was advanced far into the left pulmonary circulation and the tip in location indicating a posterolateral branch of the left lower lobe.
The catheter is still in an unusual peripheral position and withdrawal was not effective.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 64 yo male PMHx significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR, DM, ICD, Afib on coumadin, gout, hypothyroidism, CKD p/w vtach and ICD firing, recently admitted for ICD firing, CHF w/ EF 20-25%% who presents from heart failure clinic w/hypotension.
Pt has ?Cdiff w/ continued diarrhea, vomitting and decreased PO intake w/associated dehydration and lethargy after recently being d/c'ed to [**Hospital 100**] rehab facility ~1wk ago.
# Goals of care: Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was started on a milrinone gtt, with some improvement in fluid balance and blood pressures.
A discussion was held with both the wife and the patient spelling out the patient's very poor prognosis; cardiac transplant was off the table secondary both to the patient's wishes in addition to his poor compliance in the past.
Palliative care was consulted, and the ptaient's nausea was treated with haldol/ativan/zofran PRN; he was given morphine boluses for pain.
All non-comfort medications were discontinued, and the patient was made DNR/DNI.
Started on vanco and cefepime.
Also received gentle fluid rehydration.
All BP lowering meds (holding metoprolol, amioderone) were held as was torsemide.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the ICU for a milrinone gtt in order to maintain pressures, particularly after the small bolus of NS he received caused him to go into pulmonary edema.
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab was contact[**Name (NI) **] and indicated that they had emperically started C. Diff treatment with PO vancomycin without cultures; C. Diff assay here was negative, and so antibiotics were discotninued on the patient.
The patient was noted to have nausea controlled with Zofran and Prochlorperazine; nausea was attributed to hepatic congestion secondary to heart failure.
Recently started on amiodarone so held but per pharm, unlikely to cause pancreatitis.
Was made NPO given ?pancreatitis, N/V and given gentle fluids given low EF.
Ultimately the patient was transitioned from NPO to thin liquids.
# CHF:  Pt has hx of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR.
Was recently admitted for CHF exacerbation and ICD firing in setting of running out of meds and non-adherence to low salt diet.
In ED, CXR now showed ?pulm edema vs atypical PNA (started on vanco, flagyl and cefipime on day of admission [**2180-5-23**]).
Decision was made by attending that pt should be transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring given tenuous fluid state, in addition to be monitored with a Swan for closer fluid management.
Milrinone gtt during Swan improved cardiac output, and so the patient was continued on milrionne gtt while in the ICU; after goals of care discussion, ths gtt was discontinued.
Started on vanco, flagyl and cefipime on day of admission [**2180-5-23**].
These medications were subsequently DC'ed after the patient was found to be C. Diff negative and was not displaying any other signs of infection such as fever or WBC count.
Likely bump related to dehydration due diarhea, N/V, decreased PO intake and getting home diuretics.
Received gentle fluids and improved, and subsequently the patient but fluid and diuresis were both discontinued after goals of care discussion.
# Afib: The patient was on coumadin on admission, and was continued on such until his goals of care discussion, at which point it was discontinued.
# Gout: Has a history of severe gout; did not require colchine on this admission.
# Hypothyroid: Continued home dose levothyroxine.
