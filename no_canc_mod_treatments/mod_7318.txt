HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old female with a past medical history of progressive multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes Type 1, obesity, saddle pulmonary emboli secondary to deep vein thrombosis, obstructive sleep apnea.
Due to recurrent falls she has been using a wheelchair.
Her multiple sclerosis type is relaxing and remitting and she has had in the past bilateral optic neuritis requiring multiple hospitalizations as well as treatment for multiple sclerosis with Cytoxan, adrenocorticotropic hormone and high dose steroids.
She has never returned to baseline after her initial flare at age 31.
A PICC line was placed and she was treated with a nine day course of high dose steroids.
Later that day she was felt to be volume overloaded and in light of her symptomatology she was started on Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d.
FVC was 90%, FEV 1 of 97%, FEV 1/FVC 108%, total lung capacity of 91% and DLCO corrected for lung volumes of 80% which were read as low normal.
Lower extremity noninvasive studies were read as negative for deep vein thrombosis.
