He was given 2g of calcium gluconate and 6L of IVF and a subclavian line was placed.
He was given 10mg of IV decadron for concern of adrenal insufficiency.
He was started on dopamine just prior to being sent to the ICU.

Multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] (almost 20 this year), for chest pain, hypotension with ARF, or aspiration.
Per prior records, has a h/o hoarding medications in the hospital and then surreptitiously overdosing while in house  Social History: Pt has been living on the street for the last several months.
Left subclavian catheter terminates at upper SVC without pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension +/- renal failure and aspiration presented with hypotension, bradycardia and acute renal failure, which is thought to be due to beta blocker and ACE inhibitor over dose.
Per review of his records, he has a history of episodes of severe hypotension with systolic pressures in the 50s and 60s that prompt intubation, sepsis treatment, and ICU admission with extremely rapid clinical improvement.
In addition, he was noted to hoard medications and take many pills at once during his last admission and there was an episode in the ED in which the team was concerned he was trying to take in an entire bottle of colace.
He required dopamine initially which was stopped on [**12-16**].
He was briefly on antibiotics for possible sepsis but these were stopped the morning after admission due to low clinical suspicion for infection.
His systolic blood pressure was 130-150s while off his blood pressure medications and it is clear that the risks of him continuing on these medications far outweght the risks.
Bronchiectasis: Bronchiectasis was found on chest CT during this admission.
Due to multiple drug allergies, he was started on Vancomycin for suppressive therapy on [**12-16**] with planned course of 10 days.
He was also started on bronchidilator therapy and may benefit from pulmonary hygiene therapy.
His renal function recovered fully within few days and the acute failure is thought to be due to Lisinopril overdose.
# Seizures: He was continued on Keppra during this admission.
# H/o HTN:  His home BP meds (amlodipine, metoprolol, imdur and lisinopril) were held, and discontinued upon discharge, as the self inflicted harm from this medication is thought to be greated than potential long term benefit.
He was seen by psychiatry who did not feel that he needed 1:1 supervision but that he likely had difficulty managing his medications as an outpatient.
# Chronic pain and spinal stenosis:  Continued oxycodone  # Neurogenic bladder:  Continued ditropan  # Access: He had a left subclavian CVL placed in the ED.
