A CSF examination revealed Hemophilus influenza meningitis and she was cotniued on Ceftriaxone, after Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued.
However, her course was complicated by persistent fatigue, hyponatremia (deemed secondary to meningitis-related SIADH), fever, leukocytosis and an inflammatory CSF.
Bacterial Meningitis/Fever: Again, the patient presented with obtundation and an inflammatory CSF after URI symptoms.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a short course and improved dramatically on Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Acyclovir.
Once Hemophilus influenza was cultured from her admission CSF and BCXRs, Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued.
Her antibiotics were changed to Meropenem, Levofloxacin and then empiric Vancomycin.
Her persistent fever was thought to be [**1-8**] drug fever from meropenem, as a screen for other sources of infection  (UA/UCXR/BCXR/CXR/Liver CT) was negative.
Given signs of improving meningitis by CSF studies and likely drug fever from meropenem, meropenem was d/c and the pt was placed back on levoflox with good effect.
She will continue levofloxacin after d/c until f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic.
Her sodim levels downtrended intiailly with normal saline hydration and she nadired at 123.
She improved slightly with fluid restriction but also required small boluses of hypertonic saline.
She will need to continue fluid restriction to < 1 L per day after d/c, and will also continue NaCl tablets until f/u with her PCP.
They were checked as a screen given her persistent fever.
After levoflox was resumed towards the end of her hospital course, LFTs were followed and were stable.
She will require ongoing monitoring of LFTs while taking levoflox.

Hypothyroidism: controlled w/ her outpt dose of levoxyl during her admission.
