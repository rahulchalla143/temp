STUDY:  CT of the head without contrast; images were acquired in soft tissue and bone algorithms.
COMPARISON:  [**2121-8-22**] chest radiograph and chest CTA.
Evaluation of the right lung apex is obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over this region.
CXR portable [**9-6**] Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery disease, CVA, hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 65F with PMHx significant for recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation (discharged [**2121-8-26**]), CVA with residual R facial droop/dysphagia s/p G-tube, and CAD s/p PCI of RCA in [**2114**], who presents to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with palpitations and suprapubic pressure, and was found to have a UTI and afib with rapid ventricular response.
Dual nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] control with metoprolol and diltiazem was initiated, but pt continued to be tachycardic.
Regimen was changed to metoprolol tartrate 100mg TID and digoxin with more effective HR control.
After loading dose of digoxin, tachycardia resolved to HR in 60-90s, however, loading digoxin was elevated level (1.6, goal is 0.8), thus digoxin was stopped until digoxin levels were therapeutic (digoxin level 0.7 on [**2121-9-15**]).
She was re-started on digoxin 0.0625 mg PO daily (half of prior dose).
She continues on aspirin 325 mg PO qD for stroke prophylaxis despite her CHADS2-VASC score, which indicates that she should be on coumadin.
However, coumadin was not initiated given recent prior GIB from AVMs.
The risks/benefits of coumadin therapy should be discussed as an outpatient.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient reports developing suprapubic pressure/lower abdominal discomfort on the afternoon of presentation.
She received a dose of levofloxacin 500mg in the ED.
Pt was treated with 7d of levofloxacin.
PT completed 7d course of levofloxacin prior to culture data.
Got lasix diuresis with good urine output and improvement in respiratory symptoms.
DC-ed lisinopril due to insufficient systolic BP room in the setting of metoprolol uptitrate and dilt for afib.
She was covered with levofloxacin both urinary tract infection and ?
She is scheduled for endocrinology follow-up, and will need repeat testing including thyroid function tests, spot urine iodine/Cr, and serum metanephrines for adrenal incidentaloma.
Statin was deferred due to transamnitis.
# H/o CVA w/chronic aspiration: Strict NPO, all meds through g-tube, gets tube feeds.
Tube feeds initially held, restarted.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow-up with endocrinology regarding thyroid and incidental adrenal mass from prior CT abdomen - The patient should undergo lab testing in 2 weeks for the following: [ ] TFTs [ ] spot urine iodine/cr [ ] consider blood work for adrenal incidentaloma such as pheochromocytoma screening at the same time [ ] follow-up digoxin levels on [**9-17**] or 4th [**2120**] for goal of 0.8 blood dig levels - consider anticoagulation with coumadin as outpatient for atrial fibrillation after risk/benefits discussion - consider addition of statin and ACEi for systolic CHF if liver function remains normal and BP room for lisinopril - repeat CXR in [**3-21**] weeks to establish clearance of pulmonary edema and any possible pneumonia  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

For these issues, you received medications to decrease your heart rate and help remove the fluid from your lungs.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection which we treated with an oral antibiotic.
