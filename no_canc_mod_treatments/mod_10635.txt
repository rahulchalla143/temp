Prenatal course was significant for spontaneous dichorionic diamniotic twins, cervical shortening and preterm labor at 28 weeks.
She had received Betamethasone and Magnesium Sulfate.
The mother had received antibiotics intrapartum four hours prior to delivery.
The infant emerged without respiratory effort, no movement, heart rate of 100, positive pressure ventilation was started with excellent color response and heart rate up to 100 to 120.
Due to the lack of respiratory effort, the infant was intubated at four minutes of life, grimace was noted at the time of intubation but no spontaneous movements.
The infant was initially on SIMV upon arrival in the NICU with subsequent weaning of respiratory support as she exhibited more respiratory effort.
She was extubated to nasal cannula and subsequently to room air at approximately 20 hours of life and has remained in room air since then.
Cardiovascular - The infant had transient hypotension initially requiring two normal saline boluses and Dopamine.
FEN - Given question of perinatal depression, the infant was not started on enteral feeds until day of life one when her apnea resolved and she was extubated.
She has been advanced to full feeds as of day of life six tolerating total fluids 140cc/kg/day of PE20 maintaining good blood glucose.
She was transfused with packed red blood cells.
Phototherapy was discontinued on day of life four with a rebound bilirubin of 7.7.
Infectious disease - Given her perinatal depression, the infant was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for sepsis rule out.
Her blood culture remained negative at 48 hours at which time antibiotics were discontinued.
She is not on caffeine and tolerating full feeds of PE20.
Feeds at discharge - Total fluids 140cc/kg/day PE20.
