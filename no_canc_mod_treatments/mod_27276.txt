He was treated for COPD exacerbation with combivent neb x 1, solumedrol 125mg IV x 1, albuterol neb x 1.
In cath lab, pt was found to have 50% mid and proximal LAD disease, subtotal occlusion of L Cx from origin to mid vessel w/ severe disease extending into LPDA and OM2, slow flow in LPDA, 80% ostial/proximal OM1 lesion, 80% proximal RCA lesion (RCA noted to be small, non-dominant).
Cardiac cath course was c/b persistent hypotension and pt was started on dopamine gtt and dobutamine gtt, and had IABP placed for presumed cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **].
Intra-cath ECHO prelim demonstrates good LV fxn (EF>55%), no WMA (although could not exclude inferlateral hypokinesis).

HTN and tachycardia treated with nitro gtt and lopressor PRN.
Pt placed on bi-pap temporarily.
Completed 10d course of Vanc/Zosyn for nosocomial pna.
He was continued on a long steroid taper for his presumed COPD flare with atrovent MDI's prn.
He was started on standing lasix for diastolic heart failure and diuresed well.
However, was able to be weaned off balloon pump and pressors.
He was continued on aspirin, plavix, toprol, lipitor, and lisinopril as an outpatient.
Lisinopril and lopressor doses can be increased and titrated as necessary as an outpatient.
However, intra-cath ECHO demonstrates good LV systolic fxn (EF>55%).
He was started on standing lasix and lisinopril for his presumed diastolic dysfunction with good volume management.
He became tachycardic with ventilator weaning and developed sinus tachycardia.
This improved with standing metoprolol (he was also on diltiazem briefly).
He will continue on lopressor as an outpatient.
Since admission, pt initially treated with agressive IVF hydration, broad spectrum abx (vanc, zosyn) with improvement in lung fxn.
Septic physiology improved, but he continued to have low grade fevers.
Completed 10 day course of vanc and zosyn for nosocomial pna.
# DM2:  Patient hyperglycemic on initial presentation, borderline elevated AG, acidemia (although likely [**2-2**] hypotension, not DKA).
Initially managed on insulin drip, weaned off.
He was started on metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], glucose under fair control.
Resolved w/ treatment of sepsis above w/ IVF hydration.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need titration of his medications as an outpatient and close monitoring given new medication regimen.
