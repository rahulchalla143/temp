Her COPD exacerbation was successfully treated with steroids, nebulizer treatments, and 1 week of CTX.

She should continue this for 2 more days, then decrease to prednisone 10mg daily for three days.
Her Advair, Spiriva and nebs should be continued.
She was given 1 week of post-op antibiotics empirically.
She was initially on Lovenox once daily for DVT ppx given her hip fx, but this was converted to fondaparinux 2.5mg SC qD given concern for HIT (see below).
Her dressings are to be changed as needed as these have been draining serous discharge from her wound.
Her Lovenox SC qD was switched to Fondaparinux 2.5mg SC qD and a HIT Antibody was sent out.
If this returns negative, she may be re-challenged with Hep SC tid and her platelets should be closely monitored.
DM: She was on an aggressive Insulin sliding scale given FS in teh 300s while on the steroids for her COPD exacerbation.
Given her elevated BS, she was started on NPH 7 units qAM and 4 units qhs along with her Humalog SS tid with meals.
Please follow up on her BS and adjust her scale accordingly as she is tapering off of the steroids over the next week.
Her nephrotoxic meds were held and all other meds were renally dosed.
