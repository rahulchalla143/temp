She was treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia with cefepime and vancomycin; this was narrowed to cefepime after sputum cultures returned positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa.
A 14-day course of cefepime was planned.
For some concern of c. diff colitis she was initially treated with PO vancomycin, but this was discontinued after toxin assays returned negative.
Other sources of infection considered included her various decubitus ulcers, her burn-related ulcer, and her necrotic great toe.
Her ventilator settings were gradually weaned and she was extubated on HD#7, which she tolerated.
She was discharged with the plan to continue her IV antibiotics via PICC for a 14-day course.
Heparin was begun and changed to lovanox on HD#7, but it was then decided that the risks of anticoagulation exceed the benefits, and this was discontinued.
