After a discussion with her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4720**], amiodarone was started after her MAZE procedure per our cardiac surgery protocol, digoxin was decreased to 0.125, and her statin coverage was changed from simvastatin to pravastatin given that she will now be on amiodarone.
Since amiodarone was started on the day of discharge and her INR has not yet shown much effect from the coumadin (1.3 today), her INR level should be closely followed over the next couple of weeks.
On post-operative day she was discharged to rehab for further diuresis and strength training.
