Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43-year-old morbidly obese male with gout, DM, and HTN who presented to OSH with DOE, abdominal and chest pain on [**6-14**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring ventilation and pressor support.
# Respiratory failure: patient presented with dyspnea and intubated at OSH.
Reportedly, it was a difficult intubation and his ventilation support was not adequate.
PE was suspected at OSH, but V/Q scan showed low probability and heparin drip was discontinued since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He was empirically treated for HCAP pneumonia with vanc, cefepime and azithromycin for 8 days and kept on ventilator support with high PEEP.
Septic or cardiogenic shock was suspected to result in hypotension, and he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, pressor support, and fluid boluses.
With volume resuscitation and support for blood pressure, his AST and ALT have been trending down.
# Altered mental status: He remained unresponsive when he was off of Fentanyl and midazolam.
There was a concern for anoxic brain damage or sedation effect, and continuous EEG was obtained.
# Hypernatremia: He developed hypernatremia in the setting of lasix diuresis and inability to access free water.
