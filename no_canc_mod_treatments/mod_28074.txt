She does have diarrhea which is at baseline secondary to epoprostenol therapy vs. scleroderma.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Anticoagulated with warfarin with goal of  [**12-29**] 6) Hypertension 7) Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule and mediastinal LAD on CT in [**10-1**].
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Moderate elevation of right-sided filling pressures, with RVEDP 15 mmHg.
Drug therapy noted above entailed increasing flolan dose from 38 ng/kg/min to 41 mcg/kg/min, with resultant hemodynamic measurements noted above after 15 minutes at new dose.
[**2126-9-24**] Paracentesis, US guided IMPRESSION: Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis with removal of 1.5 liters of ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 64 yo female with severe pulmonary hypertension (multiple etiology- CREST, diastolic heart failure), chronic atrial fibrillation, emphysema, diastolic heart failure, and large ventral abdominal hernia presents with exertional dyspnea.
# Pulmonary artery hypertension - The patient was continued on her sildenafil and epoprostenol.
The patient's epoprostenol was increased to 41 ng/kg/min while maintaining her weight at 67 kg (weight should always remain the same as weight the patient started medication).
The patient had difficulty with orthopnea and early satiety.
It was felt that although the patient's overall hemodynamics had worsened, she may get improvement in her symptoms with a therapeutic paracentesis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was aware of this, and it was felt that she should be discharged home with followup and a decision for further paracentesis can be made in a future appointment.
She was maintained on her home dose of lasix to remove excess fluid.
She will continue her other outpatient medications at her current home doses.
During a future appointment, a discussion will be made with the patient and family as to a trial of inotropes and diuresis for improvement in symptoms.
This was consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites and she was treated with antiobiotics as recommended.
She was treated with a 7 day course of levofloxacin 250 mg daily.
# Atrial fibrillation - The patient's rate was well-controlled on her digoxin dose.
Her warfarin was held prior to her catheterization, and she was restarted on her coumadin while on a heparin bridge.
Currently it is unclear as to whether this is due to her epoprostenol (known to cause diarrhea), or to her CREST syndrome.
The patient was started on a 10 day regimen of Rifaximin per GI request.
She will continue supplemental O2 at 6L (home dose).
# GERD - The patient will continue her home dose of omeprazole.
The patient was aware that her long term prognosis is poor, and at this point most of our therapeutic interventions are aimed at symptom control and palliative care.
