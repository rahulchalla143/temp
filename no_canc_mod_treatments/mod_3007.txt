Admission Date:  [**2199-7-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-4-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Cellulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC line placed on [**7-8**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 74 y.o.
At that time she was discharged on 2 week regimen of PO Augmentin.
She reports ulceration and purulent drainage from ulcers.
Colon cancer [**2187**] s/p colectomy, treatment with 5-FU, in remission since.
HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD s/p bilateral fem [**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses Bilateral cataracts Obstructive sleep apnea Urge incontinence  Social History: Patient is retired and formerly worked at [**Location (un) 8599**]Hospital in computers.
PICC line tip difficult to visualize.
ET tube and NG tube removed compared with [**2199-7-17**].
Respiratory distress/decreased oxygen saturation: Pt noted to have decreased oxygendation saturations on HD #[**1-5**], dropping into the 70s while on RA with improvement to the 90s on oxygen.
On HD #6, pt was sent to the ICU for hypoxia and for initiation of BiPAP with the thought that OSA was contributing to the hypoxia.
She was initially treated empirically for a PE with a heparin drip but this was stopped after a VQ scan was low probability.
She was diuresed with a lasix drip, treated with cipro and vancomycin for possible aspiration pneumonia and she was successfully extubated on HD#14 after eight days.
She continued to be diuresed with 80mg of IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] but when her urine output dropped, Diuril was added to the lasix, 30 minutes before.
She should continue to be diuresed with lasix and diuril to maintain goal of 1L negative per day.
She was treated with 14 days of vanc and 10 days of cipro for her aspiration PNA.
# Obstructive Sleep apnea: Pt had been on CPAP 3 years ago but discontinued due to repeatedly having to take the mask off at night due to urinary incontinence and repeated trips to the bathroom.
As above, it was thought that OSA was contributing to her hypoxia but she was not tried on BiPAP while in ICU.
She cannot tolerate beta blockers due to bradycardia.
She was continued on diltiazem, norvasc, lisinopril and hydralazine.
Her hydralazine was discontinued due to poor outpatient choice for BP control and clonidine patch was started.
Due to bradycardia, her diltiazem was decreased to 60mg qid and clonidine patch increased.
She tolerated these adjustments well and her BP was stable in the 130s/80s.
She is very well rate controlled on calcium channle blocker.
Her digoxin was stopped as it was thought that is was not needed for rate control and is not indicated for her diastolic heart failure.
Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine increased to 1.5 from baseline of 1.3-1.4.
This increased to 2.0 and her lasix was held due to thought of volume depletion.
This remained stable even with reinitiation of lasix and ACE.
Urinary incontinence: Foley was kept in to watch I2 and Os carefully.
Oxybutynin was stopped due to foley and incidence of orthostatic hypotension.
Likely due to antibiotic associated diarrhea.
