Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with HTN, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, recurrent DVTs on indefinite Coumadin, Mobitz II s/p pacemaker.
He initially required BIPAP and 100% O2 via non-rebreather.
CXR was unremarkable, but he was initially covered empirically for HCAP with cefepime and vancomycin.
He was also empirically treated for PE on admission given his history of recurrent DVTs and recent pausing of coumadin for an elective procedure.
Cefepime was discontinued after transfer out of the MICU and he was continued on vancomycin (for cellulitis) and heparin drip.
He received vancomycin throughout this admission and was transitioned to oral keflex/doxyclycine for 7 more days at the time of discharge.
Given that he presented in extremis because of cellulitis, an argument for a full course of vancomycin could be made, but the patient's family reported that he has a history of pulling out catheters and lines.
Although he has a listed allergy to penicillins (rash), his daughter [**Name (NI) **], his HCP, states that he has tolerated keflex previously.
# h/o DVT: On coumadin chronically as an outpatient.
Subtherapeutic on admission and started on a heparin drip for empiric coverage of PE.
Because of his history of DVT recurrence and possiblity of PE, he was discharged on a lovenox bridge (1.5mg/kg daily) and 5mg coumadin daily.
Arrangements were made for close surveillance of his INR given the concomittant use of anitbiotics (particularly doxycycline): he will have his INR check on [**3-30**] by VNA and on [**3-/2061**] at his PCP's office.
# Anemia: He had a Hct drop after fluid resuscitation in the MICU.
# Hypertension: His lisinopril was held on admission because of hypotension and renal failure.
# BPH: Tamsulosin was continued.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**],  You were brought to the hospital with acute respiratory failure which required ICU-level support.
You improved very quickly with the initiation of antibiotics and supplemental oxygen was weaned over 2 days.
You received antibiotics while you were in the hospital and will need to continue oral antibiotics for one week following discharge: you have received prescriptions for keflex and doxycycline.
You will be prescribed lovenox injections until your INR is therapeutic.
