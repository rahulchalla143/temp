He was started on a heparin drip and given a plavix load and ASA, and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was arranged.
In the cath lab he was found to have a dominant LCx with an ulcerated 90% distal lesion prior to the bifurcation of the PLBR and PDA that was stented with a drug eluting cypher stent.

Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information section).
He was therefore started on dobutamine after catheterization, which was titrated over over the course of the next 5 hours, with maintenance of CI >2.0, and was quickly discontinued.
The patient was discharged on an increased dose of atorvastatin (20 mg) and an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril 2.5.

Amiodarone was initiated prior to cardioversion and was continued post-discharge.
Post discharge plan was to continue the patient on amiodarone at 200 mg TID for one month and subsequently to decrease to 200 mg QD.
The patient had a therapeutic INR at discharge after several days of 5mg coumadin and was sent home on 3 mg coumadin with a plan for INR check in 2 days post discharge.
Coumadin could be continued at the discretion of the patient's PCP and cardiologist, dependent on bleeding risk.
GI was informed, and because of the plan to send the patient home on long-term coumadin for atrial arrhythmia, a GI workup was initiated.
