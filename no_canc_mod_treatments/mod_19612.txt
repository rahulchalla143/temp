Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Swan ganz catheter placed in R IJ.
At [**Hospital3 4298**] he received lopressor 5 mg IV X 2.
At that point, his BPs dropped to 60/40 and he was placed on dopamine with recovery of pressures in to the 90s systolic.
ABG showed 7.32, pCO2 30, pO2 307, FiO2 100%, He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **]; en route, dopamine was turned off and patient was switched to levophed on arrival here.
A right femoral line was placed in the ED.
An a line was placed in the left radial artery.

Most likely, arrest was precipitated by fluid overload in the setting of medication noncompliance (patient reportedly was not taking meds for a few days prior) and ETOH binge.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation upon admission and had episodes of tachycardia,(as high as 160s, and sustained in 130s) so esmolol drip was intiated for HR control (goal 90-110) but discontinued shortly thereafter due to hypotension.
On [**5-27**] the patient was started on amiodarone to prevent arrhythmias; however, cardioversion x 5 was done in attempt to convert the patient back to sinus rhythm.
Amiodarone was restarted until [**5-30**] when the team opted for rate control via metoprolol instead.
The patient was maintained on heparin gtt for anticoagulation.
#) Cardiac/ pump: Patient was initially started on levophed to maintain BP after hypotension occurring during resuscitation ([**12-30**] lopressor administration), but was then started on dopamine drip that was weaned off.
The patient was aggressively diuresed with milrinone (weaned off) and lasix to a total of negative 6.5L, guided by swan-ganz catheterization.
Digoxin and captopril were started to maximize hemodynamic status.
A hard trauma collar was placed per neuro (concern for c spine injury).
Seizures/myoclonus were controlled with versed and fentanyl boluses and prn ativan to treat for concurrent EtOH withdrawal.
He was started on propofol for sedation, with good relief of these signs, however by [**6-2**], neurology determined that chances of neurological recovery were poor, and a family meeting was held as discussed below.
Vancomycin was started on HD4 and zosyn was added on HD5 for empiric treatment.
The patient did not respond to treatment and it was thought the the etiology of fevers may be central (secondary to anoxic brain injury).
#) Respiratory status: The patient was intubated by EMS and was maintained on ventilation with assist control with Tv 600, RR 14, weaning FiO2 as tolerated.
#) DM: outpatient meds were held; DM was managed with an ISS.
#) During his hospital course the pt was maintained on tube feeds with a ppi, heparin gtt, and bowel regimen for prophylaxis.
#) Patient's code status was initially FULL, but given his poor prognosis, lack of recovery and the low likelihood of any meaningful neurological recovery, a family meeting was held on [**2197-6-2**] and his family decided to change his status to comfort measures only.
