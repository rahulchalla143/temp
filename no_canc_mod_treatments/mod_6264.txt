ASA, Plavix and Coumadin were held.
He was continued on Protonix gtt.
He received 2u PRBC's after the procedure (5 total) and no further bleeding was seen, and his Hct stabilized.
We discussed the patient's anticoagulation with the GI team and Vascular Surgery and they collectively agreed that we discontinue his ASA and Plavix until follow-up with GI specialist Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] given the recent bleed.
On discharge, we will be sending him home on 3MG/day of Coumadin monotherapy for his Atrial Fibrillation, giving his CHADS2 score of 4.
He was treated for hyperK as below.
There was no immediate need for renal replacement therapy though given he was improving steadily and UOP was in acceptable ranges.
There was also question of post-obstructive element given reports that he had a prior Foley in place at OSH that a nurse had removed, with poor UOP thereafter, in the setting of known BPH.
ACEi, Lasix, [**Last Name (un) **], Bactrim were held as all could contribute to worse renal funciton.
On discharge, we restarted the Lisinopril at 20 MG/day (down from 60 MG/day) and his Lasix at 20 MG/day (down from 40 MG/day).
He was making good urine and his urine output was nearly balanced with intake fluids (clinically euvolemic), suggesting that these medications would be well tolerated by his kidneys and put him closer back to his home regimen.
We continued to hold his Atacand and Aliskiren, but he will discuss these medications with his PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16258**] next week on [**2111-9-9**].
In the MICU, Kayexalate was held given GIB, but pt received scheduled albuterol, D5 in his IVF's and insulin, and his K trended downwards with blood/IVF resuscitations.
We are restarting him on his Lasix and Ace Inhibitor, but his K+ will be initially followed by VNA services.
Then, he had metoprolol held in the ICU with limited control over his atrial fibrillation.
Rates improved after both blood products and IVFs.
Patient was slowly uptitrated on his beta blocker for better rate control.
After 4 days of stable HCTs and no GIB after he underwent EGD with clipping of duodenal ulcer, he was restarted on his home coumadin.
He has a chronic right arterial ulcer: S/p surgical debridement by vascular surgery on [**8-18**] which was his last hospital admission.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], was notified of the admission and agreed Bactrim could be discontinued as clean wound and no fevers or leukocytosis at time of discharge.
As noted above, he was discharged on 3MG/day of Coumadin and his ASA and Plavix were discontinued for now and patient will re-address need to restart ASA/Plavix in near future with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and his PCP.
On home oral hypoglycemics, which were held, patient was given Humalog ISS while in house.
At discharge he was restarted on usual Januvia at home.
Gout: Held allopurinol given ARF, and once Cr near baseline 2 range at discharge he was placed on a reduced renal dose of 100mg daily, down from his prior 300mg daily dosing.

While here, you were treated for a upper gastrointestinal bleed.
You also received a number of blood transfusions, and over the course of your hospitalization, your red blood cell level (hematocrit) improved significantly back to your baseline level.
You were aggressively treated with fluids and we carefully watched and repleted your electrolytes.
In particular, we paid close attention to your potassium given that it was also elevated.
Both your creatinine and potassium have now come down nicely to their appropriate baseline levels.
We started you on Metoprolol and this brought your heart rate down and we subsequently increased the dosage back up to your home dose of 50 MG twice a day and you tolerated this well.
Given the bleeding that you experienced in your small intestine, we have recommended that you STOP taking your Aspirin and Plavix which thin your blood.
We recommend that you continue on the Coumadin alone, at 3 MG/day.
In addition, we have outlined other medication changes and the appropriate doctors to follow up with.
The MEDICATION CHANGES that we have suggested are the following:  1) STOP taking Aspirin until you are seen by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] 2) STOP taking Plavix until you are seen by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] 3) STOP taking the Atacand until you see your PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16258**] 4) STOP taking your Bactrim 5) STOP taking your Texturna until you see your PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16258**] 6) CONTINUE taking Protonix 40 MG/day.
