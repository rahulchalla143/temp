She is known to have have multiple access issues/failures and an attempt was being made to place an AVG in her left arm as the right arm has been deemed unusable for dialysis access.
She was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] who placed a left upper arm graft initially without complication.
She remained in the PACU overnight and experienced hypotension for which she was started on pressors.
She was extubated but was still requiring some pressor support.
In addition cardiology did not feel a cardiac cath was indicated as she was a poor candidate due to her co-morbidities.
Medical management was initiated and she was started on [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Plavix.
In addition a heparin drip was initiated x 48 hours.
The patient received CVVH while in the ICU and then was transitioned back to intermittent hemodialysis once transferred back to the surgical floor and more stable.
She also had a R groin temporary dialysis catheter that was removed just prior to discharge to the Nursing Home on [**2-20**].
It was deemed low suspicion for compartment syndrome as the calf was soft and pulses dopplerable.Blood pressures returned to more normal readings (SBP in 110s) Heparin drip d/c'd after 48 hours.
