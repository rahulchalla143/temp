Admission Date:  [**2127-5-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-5-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2127-5-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOG HISTORY:   Baby Girl [**Known lastname 42256**] was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on the second day of life for evaluation and treatment of significant hyperbilirubinemia.
She was born on [**2127-5-18**], as a 3.09 kilogram product of a term gestation to a 34 year old gravida III, para II to III  Prenatal screens were complete and unremarkable except for group B Streptococcus positive status and blood type O positive antibody negative.
The infant was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery with Apgar of nine and nine.
Given maternal group B Streptococcus colonization and antibiotic treatment of less than two hours, the infant was count was unremarkable and the infant was transferred to the Newborn Nursery.
The infant was admitted to the NICU at day two for further care and evaluation.
The patient remained comfortable breathing in room air without need for supplemental oxygen.
Hematology - Initial complete blood count on day one of life revealed a white count of 11.0 with a hematocrit of 54.0, platelets 313,000, and differential of 58 neutrophils and 2 bands.
Coombs was described as strongly positive with an anti-B antibody.
Gastrointestinal - The patient was treated for significant hyperbilirubinemia presumed secondary to ABO incompatibility with intensive phototherapy and intravenous fluid hydration.
Hyperbilirubinemia was responsive to this therapy and bilirubin level decreased to 18.0 by the morning after admission and then to 15.0.
Phototherapy was gradually diminished and finally discontinued in the morning of [**2127-5-26**], day eight of life.
Bilirubin level twelve hours later was 11.9 and bilirubin level 24 hours after discontinuation of phototherapy was 12.7/0.4.
FEN - The infant was initially maintained on intravenous fluids of 140 ccs/kilogram/day of D10 water with electrolyte supplementation.
The initiation of quadruple phototherapy and the possible need for an exchange transfusion, the patient was initially maintained NPO.
With the response seen to phototherapy with gradually decreasing intravenous fluids, the patient was allowed to begin enteral feedings again of Enfamil.
Repeat electrolytes shortly after reinitiation of feedings revealed a bicarbonate of 10 with an anion gap of 23.
At that time, the patient was made NPO and placed back on intravenous fluids.
An extensive metabolic workup was performed (see below) and in the interim bicarbonate replacement was begun with intravenous fluids of D10 water with 3 mEq of sodium bicarbonate of 1 mEq of potassium chloride per 100 ccs.
At that time with the initial results of the metabolic screenings as described below negative, feedings were reinstituted.
The patient was initially restarted on soy formula given one pending test for galactosemia still pending at the State Laboratory.
Electrolytes shortly prior to discharge on [**2127-5-27**], revealed a sodium of 138, potassium 5.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 17.
Serum was sent for aminoacids and urine was sent for aminoacids and organic acids.
With the results of these tests, feedings were reinitiated on day five of life as described above.
The infant is now tolerating Enfamil formula, eating well with normal urine and stool.
FOLLOW-UP: 1.
Hepatitis B vaccine was given on [**2127-5-20**].
