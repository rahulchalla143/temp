Given these findings, the patient was continued on his vancomycin 1 gm intravenous q 12 hours and ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After consultation with cardiac surgery, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**8-25**] where a radical sternal debridement and open packing of the wound were performed for a sternal wound infection with associated sternal osteomyelitis.
An infectious disease consult was also requested which also recommended continuing of the vancomycin, ciprofloxacin as it appeared to be adequate coverage for the patient's infections.
The plastic surgeons recommended flap closure of the wound and the patient was taken to the Operating Room once again on [**8-29**] where an omental flap closure of his sternal wound was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Postoperatively, the patient was continued on his vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and was doing well, transferred to the floor.
