The on-call physician at the nursing home gave the patient lasix 80mg IV, albuterol, and morphine prior to transfer.
She was given nitroglycerin and placed on Bipap.
The patient had an [**Name10 (NameIs) 10718**] of shortness of breath at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2-7**] which reoslved with lasix 90mg IV and morphine.

As shown earlier, there is a moderately compressed vertebral body at level T12.
Dietary indiscretion and medication non-compliance are likely not causes given patient is presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Pt was diuresed w furosemide 80mg IV at first for a goal of -1L/24hrs, then with furosemide with HCTZ 30 minutes prior, as pt stopped responding to furosemide only.
PICC line placement was deferred to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
# Shortness of breath: Pt required BiPAP on admission, transitioned to Venti mask within hours.
Distress treated with morphine PRN.
After discussion with family, decision was made to treat with oral levofloxacin but not to aggressively pursue blood cultures or intravenous access for antibiotics, which had been difficult.
Pt is to continue to take levofloxacin through [**2-19**].
# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient had a brief [**Month/Year (2) 10718**] of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that was controlled with beta blocker and returned to sinus after 4 hours.
The decision was made not to anticoagulate with warfarin given that this was likely precipitated by her acute illness and she was already on Plavix and full-dose aspirin.
