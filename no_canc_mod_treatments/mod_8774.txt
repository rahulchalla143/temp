Admission Date:  [**2190-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Paxil / Benadryl / Buspar / Levaquin / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion s/p SVT ablation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: electrophysiology study with incomplete ablation   History of Present Illness: 66-year-old lady with history of breast and bladder cancers was admitted for elective EPS with ablation for SVT.
However, on the day of her most recent cystoscopy on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 69**], she experienced a tachycardia, which was terminated after she received intravenous Lopressor.
The same tachycardia occurred on [**3-9**] for which she presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] Emergency Room, where the tachycardia was terminated with intravenous adenosine.
During the procedure she developed hypotension to SBP of 77 mm HG.
This responded to IVF and dopamine infusion to SBP of 130s.
Her heparin was reversed with protamine.
Patient was admitted to CCU with PA catheter for close hemodynamic monitoring.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingoophrectomy [**2164**] r/t endometriosis - Left breast cancer diagnosed [**2180**] s/p Left lumpectomy and radiation therapy - Papillary bladder cancer diagnosed [**2180**] s/p multiple resections and chemotherapy, finished [**2190-4-28**] - [**2190-3-5**] s/p right ureteral stent, ?
IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate loculated anterior pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence for increased pericardial pressure.
Ablations were performed primarily at the entrent atrial acitivation site during Vpacing.
Also slow pathway  ablation were performed to prevent initiation of the AVRT.
Ablation procedure was incomplete given hypotension as above.
Right femoral line with tip located at the cavoatrial junction.
# Pericardial Effusion/PUMP: Patient was found to have a 1.4 cm anterior pericardial effusion after she became hypotensive during SVT ablation procedure on [**2190-10-8**].
Emergently, patient received a right heart cath that was consistent with a non-hemodynamically signicant effusion w/o tamponade physiology, so pericardiocentesis was not felt to be indicated.
Swan-ganz was initially left in place to monitor for development of tamponade physiology.
Arterial line was also placed for blood pressure monitoring.
Patient was initially hypotensive, but her blood pressure was responsive to IV fluid hydration and dopamine.
Chest pain secondary to the pericardial effusion was well-controlled with Toradol and patient was discharged on ibuprofen prn for pain.
During the procedure, it was difficult crossing the AV, and ablations were performed primarily at the entrent atrial acitivation site during Vpacing.
Also slow pathway ablation was performed to prevent initiation of the AVRT.
The ablation procedure was incomplete given hypotension as above.
# Extensive groin manipulation:  Due to extensive groin manipulation during cardiac procedures on [**2190-10-8**], patient was monitored closely for evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable throughout hospital stay.
FEN:  Patient was maintained on cardiac prudent diet.
