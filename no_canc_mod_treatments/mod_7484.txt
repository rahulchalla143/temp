He had a right femoral line and a left arteriovenous fistula.
He was being resuscitated with blood products and fluids and GI was following.
The patient ended up leaving against medical advice and was given a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor and advised to follow up with his nephrologist on Monday morning when he got hemodialysis, to recheck his coagulation studies.
GI recommended a proton pump inhibitor to treat his reflux and an esophageal biopsy was obtained at that time.
He was sent home on a proton pump inhibitor and Zofran for nausea.
He required one unit of packed red blood cells on admission and his INR over his course here was reversed with one unit of fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K was currently at 1.3 when he left the hospital.
Renal:  He is a type 1 diabetic with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and he is anuric.
He did not complete that treatment at that time and we could not check his electrolytes any more because we lost access because he insisted on having his femoral line removed.
