The patient is status post treatment with intra-arterial TPA.
The patient was then transferred to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit where, after TPA, he was noted to have improvement in right extremity strength, speech pressure was closely monitored, with a goal of systolic 140 to 160, titrating intravenous labetalol and Neo-Synephrine.
Anticoagulation with heparin drip and Coumadin, with an INR goal of 2 to 3, and PTT goal of 40 to 60.
The  patient was continued on vancomycin for endocarditis (MSSA) diagnosed in [**3-17**].
Otherwise denies fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache.
Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer which was removed one month ago secondary to endocarditis 3.
Status post appendectomy 8.
History of atrial fibrillation  ALLERGIES:   Oxacillin, penicillin, codeine  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Colace, amiodarone, Protonix, aspirin, Proscar, vancomycin, Motrin, Lopressor, Megace, Coumadin, Captopril, Atrovent, albuterol, lasix.
On transfer:  Heparin drip, Protonix, amiodarone, Megace, vancomycin, Atrovent, albuterol nebulizers, Coumadin, Colace, Epogen, Proscar, and Haldol.
On the day of transfer to Medicine service, [**2108-5-1**], white cells 13.1, hematocrit 27.8.
IMPRESSION:   87-year-old male with extensive past medical history, who presented with aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis and found to have a left MCA cerebrovascular accident on MRI status post intra-arterial TPA treatment and then subsequent monitoring in the Neurology Intensive Care Unit, who is now transferred to the Medical service for further management.
Repeat eval done [**5-22**] showed noimprovemend so a PEG tube was placed.
Lastly, the patient was noted to have intermittent periods of delirium with marked sundowning, which was treated moderately well with Haldol as needed.
He did not receive haldol for the last 2 weeks ofstay due to concerns of sedation with increased risk of aspiration.
The patient was maintained on his cardiac medications, including aspirin and beta blocker.Isordil was added.
Congestive heart failure service was consulted and plan on [**2108-5-6**], was to have the patient transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for right heart catheterization and subsequentadjustment of  therapy.
The patient was maintained on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, and the doses of both were titrated upwards based on blood pressure tolerance.
The patient's Coumadin was held until the patient trended down into the therapeutic range, and then restarted.
In addition, the patient was maintained on his outpatient amiodarone dose.
d.  Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure was well controlled during his hospital stay, and the patient was maintained on Lopressor and Captopril.
In addition, the patient benefited from the use of albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as needed for dyspnea.
The patient was maintained on his vancomycin dose to complete a course on [**2108-5-4**].
In addition, at the time of transfer to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2108-5-6**], the patient's poor respiratory status and the inability to rule out an infiltrate in the left lower lobe, the patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and Flagyl in spite of no fever spike at that time.
The patient was maintained on those antibiotics, and had the addition of vancomycin when methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus sparse growth was isolated from a sputum obtained in the Coronary Care Unit.
In addition, it was noted that the patient had a PICC line in his right upper extremity for the past six weeks, and the decision was made to remove the PICC line with culturing of the tip.The cx was neg and pt did not have further fevers.
The patient was initially repleted with intravenous fluids, however, hypernatremia did not improve on this regimen.
The patient was then hydrated via a nasogastric tube with free water boluses, and the patient's hypernatremia resolved to a value of 140 at the time of this dictation.
The patient's hematocrit has remained relatively stable during his hospital stay, and the patient has been transfused only one unit of packed red blood cells without complication.
