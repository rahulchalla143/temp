Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Atrial fibrillation ablation and placement of a pacemaker.
She was initially electively admitted for an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure and pacemaker placement on [**2195-6-4**].
The ablation procedure was apparently unsuccessful, but pacemaker was placed.
En route and at the scanner, the patient became noticeably worse, with the development of right arm plegia and a question of sensory deficits over her hand as well.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism Atrial fibrillation Syncope S/P Caesarian section   Social History: Pt lives with her husband.
CTA NECK: The internal, common carotid, and internal carotid opacify without evidence for hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysmal dilation.
CT PERFUSION: CT perfusion studies including calculation of blood volume, mean transit time, and blood flow demonstrate no perfusion abnormality.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**] would help for further evaluation.
Pacemaker wires are seen within the heart.
Assessment of the abdominal organs is limited by lack of intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter as well as nondependent air is seen within the bladder lumen.
Stroke: As detailed in the HPI, the pt was transferred from the cardiology service to the Neuro ICU where IV tPA was administered.
She was in the ICU for five days over concern of low blood pressure (treated intermittently with a neosynephrine gtt) and anemia (work-up as detailed below).
Given likely cardioembolic source of the stroke, she was started on a heparin gtt and warfarin.
On hospital day ten, she was transitioned to sc lovenox and warfarin and discharged.
She will have her INR checked by her PCP after discharge, at which time lovenox may be discontinued once INR is in the therapeutic range ([**1-23**]).
Anemia: The pt developed progressively declining hematocrit after tPA administration and institution of anticoagulation.
She was transfused one unit of PRBCs in the ICU when her hematocrit dropped to 22.1 (to which she responded appropriately) A femoral ultrasound was performed on hospital day nine when the pt developed right groin and thigh pain which demonstrated hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
She was discharged on iron supplementation.
