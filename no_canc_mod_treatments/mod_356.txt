HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 82 year old white female with coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery stent, peripheral vascular disease, had undergone a right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with PTFE on [**2132-11-27**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
After the patient developed gangrene of her lower saphenectomy site with two ulcers.
The patient did well until she had a catheterization via her right groin in [**2135-4-28**].
In the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed with an infected pseudoaneurysm and was admitted for emergency surgery.

Vancomycin  FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.
She was taken to the Operating Room for emergent repair of her infected right groin pseudoaneurysm.
The proximal prosthetic graft was removed.
The distal prosthetic graft could not be separated from the surrounding tissue and therefore was ligated.
A right common femoral to profunda femoris artery bypass graft with right superficial femoral artery was done.
The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively for her hematocrit of 22.
The patient was kept on heparin infusion.
She was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
He discussed the necessity of an above the knee amputation in the future with the family.
Tube feedings were started via oral gastric tube.
In the meantime, until renal function improved all medications were to be dosed for a creatinine clearance of approximately 25 cc/hr.
She was diuresed with Lasix prn and then a Lasix drip.
She had a bronchoscopy on [**2135-6-27**] and secretions grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On [**2135-7-2**], large pleural effusion was seen and the patient underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of the left pleural effusion.
Possibility of a tracheotomy was discussed with the family who refused to consider it at that time.
Following the pleural tap, the patient continued to improve and was finally extubated [**2135-7-6**].
Postoperatively she did fairly well with Albuterol and Ipratropium inhalation as well as Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizer treatment as needed.
Aggressive chest physical therapy was also used to help clear her secretion.
After extubation, the patient continued to receive total parenteral nutrition.
Aspiration precautions were put in place.
The patient's family consented to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
Family discussed right above the knee amputation and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement with the patient on [**2135-7-15**].
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were added to her Vancomycin.
Her abdominal staples had been removed on [**2135-7-1**].
This was treated with three days of intravenous Fluconazole.
The patient was started on a two week course of Flagyl on [**2135-7-11**].
Staples should remain for one month from surgery before removal.
The patient should continue her Vancomycin through [**2135-7-27**].
At the time of dictation she has a random Vancomycin level pending and should receive 1 gm of intravenous Vancomycin today.
