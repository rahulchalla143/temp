Pericardial effusion, status post pericardial window.
Rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve    replacement (21 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) mitral valve replacement (29    [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]).
Status post MAZE procedure.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old gentleman with a history of rheumatic heart disease, who underwent an AVR, MVR, MAZE procedure on [**2150-3-12**] without significant complication in his postoperative course.
He had a significant amount of jugulovenous distention and his heart sounds were distant.
The effusions seemed loculated and it was felt that interventional attempts at drainage would be unsuccessful.
The liver function tests subsequently normalized without any intervention after his pericardial window.
We initially held his Coumadin until his INR drifted back down towards 2.5.
To note, the patient developed an increase in oxygen requirement towards the latter part of his hospitalization and chest x-ray showed accumulation of a large right pleural effusion.
A pig-tail drain was placed in this effusion and approximately 2.2 liters of old blood and serous fluid were drained.
To note, he was treated empirically with Vancomycin and levofloxacin throughout his hospitalization for the question of infection of his pericardial effusion, given that his white blood cell count was elevated.
