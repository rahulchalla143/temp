He has a report of a BP of 59/34 there, but all other BPs were 100s/80s.
Given this, he was transfered to here for further management.
He was bolused with lidocaine 100 mg IV x1 and started on a drip at 1 mg/min with no improvement in his VT.

-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: None -PACING/ICD: AICD implantation for ventricular tachycardia in [**2094-6-9**] at [**Hospital1 18**], generator placement in [**2098**] upgraded device due to battery depletion in [**2106-6-10**] with [**Company 1543**] AICD and new RV lead placement.

Brief Hospital Course: 65M with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF, HTN, HLD, VT s/p prior ablation and recent placement of an [**Company 1543**] AICD initially admitted to the floor, but transferred to the CCU with stable, perfusing VT, refractory to lidocaine for VT ablation procedure.
He complained of palpatations but was mentating well and not presyncopal.
He was bolused with Lidocaine 100mg and started on a lidocaine drip without improvment in VT. On arrival to the CCU, he remained in VT in the 110-130 range and was normotensive.
Home dose of Mexilitine and sotalol were discontinued and he was started on quinidine 324 mg PO Q8H and metoprolol 25mg TID.
Warfarin was intitially held prior to the procedure, then restarted with LMWH bridge, to be continued as an outpatient at his home dose with routine INR checks.
He will be continued on quinidine 486mg daily, which may interfere with metabolism of coumadin, requiring a lower dose to keep his INR within proper range.
These dose adjustments will need to be followed by his PCP or coumadin clinic.
He will follow-up with EP as an outpatient in about 1 month and should continue to hold the sotalol and mexilitine until his follow-up appointment.
# Blood pressure control: While in the CCU, his BPs were borderline hypotensive, so it was not aggressively controled and he was given B-blockers as tolerated.
He will continue on metoprolol at half-dose of his home regimen.
# CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI and CABG x3 in [**2094**].
ASA and simvastatin were continued on discharge.
