RCA got 2 heparin coated stents w/good result.
He also got atropine in cath lab on presentation.
Cervical laminectomy   Social History: Lives alone in independent living facility.
A 5 French temporary pacing wire was placed in the right ventricle with successful capture and pacing at 60 bpm.
The patient's heart block resolved and the pacing wire was was removed at the end of the case.
Successful stenting of the mid RCA was performed with overlapping 3.0 x 18 mm and 3.5 x 18 mm Hepacoat stents.
Successful closure of the right groin was performed with a 6Fr Angioseal device.
Did not require pacing afterwards.
He was slowly started on an ACE-I as his BP would tolerate.
A beta-blocker was then added and increased to his current dose of metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He tolerated these well.
His ACE-I was continued for afterload reduction.
Again, was decided that we would not restart coumadin due to GIB risk.
He was started on amiodarone (loading with 400 [**Hospital1 **] x7d, then 400 qd x7d, then 200 qd ongoing)and kept on his B-blocker.
Baseline LFTs and TFTs were obtained prior to amio.
He will have a Holter monitor for 24 hours in several weeks after his amio load is complete, and will then follow-up with EP to have this reevaluated and further treatment prescribed.
His Flomax and Detrol were also continued.
He responded well to prn albuterol and atrovent MDIs.
He was sent out on atrovent MDI for this.
This will need to be followed with a repeat Pa/lateral as an outpatient in 1 month to determine significance and whether it needs to be further worked up.
