History of Present Illness: 67 yo with recent history of diverticular abscess (s/p IR drainage [**2-21**]) and HIT developed during that admission who presented to an OSH ED with dyspnea.
Due to her HIT allergy, she was started on lepiridun and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of lepirudin and close monitoring.
CT guided drainage of abscess at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] [**2-21**], transferred back to [**Location (un) 620**] for remainder of IV abx therapy (Levo/Flagyl).
On discharge from hospital [**2-29**], patient was transitioned to po antibiotic regimen including levo+flagyl.
On [**3-1**], patient developed an impressive morbilliform rash on her trunk, visited primary surgeon the next day who removed flagyl antibiotic, suspecting this was cause of drug rash, given prednisone course + benadryl.
Since this time, maintained on levofloxacin monotherapy.
Patient notes that this was after receiving IV levofloxacin in the ER.
Past Medical History: 1. gout 2. gerd 3. htn 4. s/p hip replacement  Allergies:  Flagyl (rash as above), ?levofloxacin.
Abd: Soft, NT, ND, drain in place in LLQ.
[**2144-3-12**] IVC filter placement: 1.
Successful placement of a Gunther Tulip retrievable inferior vena cava filter in the infrarenal position.
Given history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, started on lepirudin - now on argatroban.
Antimicrobial therapy is complicated by appearance of drug rash.
PE: Left leg DVT seen on U/S seems like the most likely source - likely from venous stasis due to recent immobility following her diverticular abscess and drainage placement.
Lepirudin switched to argatroban [**3-11**] (after placement of filter - did not want to reinitiate lepirudin due to risk of anaphylaxis), started coumadin evening of [**3-10**] - overlapped with argatroban and coumadin per protocol in front of chart.
Came in on levofloxacin monotherapy, but given recent increase in drug rash today (off flagyl), started on zosyn ([**3-9**]).
Rash: Unclear source although suspect drug induced - likely flagyl but also potentially levo.
