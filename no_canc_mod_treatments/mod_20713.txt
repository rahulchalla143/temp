Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) cardiac catheterization [**2124-8-18**] 2) temporary pacemaker implantation [**2124-8-18**] 3) electrophysiology study [**2124-8-24**] 4) PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 79 yo male with bioprosthetic AVR in [**2116**], CAD s/p CABG x2 in the past(cath [**2124-8-18**] all three grafts are patent), bifascicular block, recent redo total L hip who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-8-18**] from OSH where he was admitted [**8-7**] with acute MSSA endocarditis.
The patient was intially admitted to [**Hospital 4068**] hospital on [**8-7**] s/p fall at home with sepsis, MS changes and hypotension SBP in 70's, CVP 5.
He was diagnosed with LLL PNA which was initially thought to be the source of his infection and was given Ceftriaxone/Vanc and IV hydration with response (no pressors).
Blood cx then grew MSSA and Abx were changed to Oxacillin on HD #2.
Pt continued to be febrile and on HD #4 Gentamycin/Rifampin were added.
His outside hospital course was complicated by 1) enzyme leak without ECG changes for which he was started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], heparin 2) anemia (guaiac +) for which patient received trnasfusions 3) plt drop 145 -->95-->72 over two days - heparin products were held, HIT Ab later came back negative, and he was restarted on SQ heparin without problems 4) PR prolongation HD #8  The patient was seen by orthopedic consultants and his L hip was aspirated but culture was negative for infection.

The patient was continued on Oxacillin, Rifampin and renally dosed Gentamycin.
Gentamycin was stopped one day early 08/25 per ID recommendations (expected end of therapy [**8-24**]) because of worsening renal function.
Oxacillin/Rifampin were continued with the plan to complete a 6wk course (expected end [**9-20**]) until the patient and family decided to change his code status to CMO.
The antibiotics were stopped the day of transfer to hospice.
LFTs were monitored in this paitent on Oxacillin and were WNL.
CT surgery was consulted regarding valve replacement because it was felt that given aortic root abscess and conduction abmormalities the patient may benefit from early surgical intervention.
CT surgery was reluctant to operate because of concern that the patient may have another site of active infection separate from his cardiac abscess.
Dental service was consulted to evaluate the patient prior to surgery and they recommended extracting 2 molars prior to surgery.
The patient had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2124-8-18**] which revealed that all 3 venous grafts were patent.
The patient was continued on [**Date Range **], low dose beta-blocker, and lipitor.
Temporary pacing wire was placed [**2124-8-18**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] electrophysiology study on [**8-24**] which showed AVN and HIS disease, but given the dynamic nature of his problem in the context of abscess, the decision was made to re-evaluate the patient in 2 weeks and to leave temporary pacer wire in place for now.
Procardia 10 mg po qd was added on [**8-21**] to help with afterload reduction/improve forward flow.
They did not feel that the patient is depressed and recommended adding Haldol 2.5 mg IV bid to his regimen while monitoring QT prolongation.
The patient was not given any sedating medications.
On discharge he was given prescriptions for morphine, haldol, ativan and scopalamine.
The patient's antibiotics were renally redosed.
CT abd/pelvis done because of concern for thromboemboli did not show any retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Heparin products were initially held but heparin sc was restarted on [**8-22**] after HIT serology came back negative.
The patient was not fully anticoagulated because he was >2 months after his hip surgery.
S/p left THR revision [**2124-6-30**] - Orthopedic surgery was consulted.
R knee pain/effusion - R knee was tapped [**2124-8-23**] by Orthopedic surgery and fluid culture was negative results suggestive of non-inflammatory effusion.
Rheumatology was consulted [**2124-8-25**] and they recommended Tylenol but this was not scheduled b/o concern that it would mask fevers.
The patient was discharged to hospice with instructions on dressing changes for his ulcers.
His oral meds were dc'd per patient and family request on [**8-28**].
Prophylaxis - Has been receiving prophylaxis with PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.
On [**8-27**] after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the family decided to change the patient's status to comfort measures only.
