About three weeks later, he developed a UTI and was treated with a course of levofloxacin.
Initial blood cultures were negative, but on fourth day 1 bottle grew enterococcus Patient had initially been treated with levofloxacin, then was changed to vancomycin when enterococcus grew from culture.

[**1-11**]+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
FNA of T spine lesion has not yielded any organism, although infection probably can't be excluded as patient had been treated with antibiotics for more than a week when biopsies were taken.
Regardless, Ortho-Spine felt surgery is not indicated currently for diskitis.
ID consulted for medical management (see below).
Ortho-spine consultant recommends continued PO pain medications for now, with possible epidural steroids in future once infections resolved.
Patient should follow-up with ortho spine in [**2-12**] weeks.
As the patient is allergic to penecillins (unknown type of rash 50 years ago), he was started on vancomycin at the outside hospital for enterococcus bacteremia.
It was unclear if the bacteremia was related to the diskitis, as only one of four bottles grew organisms, and therefore a work-up for other sources was undertaken, including TTE/TEE (no vegetations seen), chest x-ray, urine culture.
Thus, the patient was treated with a course of IV Ciprofloxacin in addition to the Vancomycin.
Given likely need for long-term antibiotics for infected knee hardware as well as need for good enterococcus coverage, ID recommended desensitization so patient could be treated with ampicillin.
The vancomycin was stopped and patient was continued on ampicillin, which he will need for 6 weeks (PICC line in place).
He will follow-up at the [**Hospital **] clinic for recommendations concerning possible longer-term oral antibiotic coverage given his knee hardware; this decision will be made in conjunction with either [**Hospital1 **] orthopedics (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] or [**Hospital1 2025**] orthopedics (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23001**] ) depending on patient preference.
