Borderline P-R interval prolongation.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o F with minimal mitral regurgitation presents with substernal chest pain after snow shoveling with troponin elevation and no EKG changes consistent with NSTEMI, now s/p cath showing non-obstructive plaque rupture at the LAD bifurcation, not amenable to stenting, and upon attending review unchanged from previous study in [**2175-6-15**].
Cardiac surgery was initially involved for possible intervention, but further review of a previous catheterization in [**2179-6-15**] for her anginal symptoms show a very similar, unchanged lesion.
Her cardiac enzymes were downtrending and she was discharged on medical therapy and anticoagulation, with close cardiology follow-up.
She will continue on ASA, plavix, lisinopril, and metoprolol as an outpatient.
This will need to be followed up an as outpatient with likely increase of her current levoxyl dosing, dependent on her symptoms.

Initially we considered cardiac surgery but a stress test was done that did not show any concerning abnormalities of your heart which would require a procedure to fix.
You will be treated with medications for your heart.
Increase aspirin to 325 mg daily 2.
Increase Atorvastatin to 80 mg daily 3.
Stop using Ibuprofen and Vitamin E 4.
Start Metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack 5.
Start Plavix at 75mg daily for your heart.
It is very important that you take Aspirin and Plavix every day for your heart without missing any doses.
Do not stop either of these medications unless specifically instructed by your cardiologist.
