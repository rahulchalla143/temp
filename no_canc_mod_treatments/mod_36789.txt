A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present with thickened leaflets and markedly increased gradient (peak 100mmHg) c/w severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
He was given ASA 325mg, ceftriazone (to cover SBP), zofran and ativan in the ED.
On the floor, he was given Azithromycin (to cover CAP), lasix 10mg (to diurese pulmonary edema and ascites), albuteral nebs (for wheezes) and multivitamin.
He then appeared to seize and was incontinent of urine and stool.
The echo showed that the patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis was present with thickened leaflets and markedly increased gradient consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis.
Cardiology and cardiac surgery were consulted so that a plan could be developed to replace the patient's sclerosed aortic valve.
The patient was then transferred to the CCU for close monitoring of his hemodynamics.
In the CCU he was diuresed with a heparin drip and diuril 500mg IV to a total -3.5L.
This provided symptomatic improvement in his respiratory status and abdominal distention, and his LFTs continued to trend down.
He was cleared by hepatology and ID for surgery and carotid ultrasounds were negative.
lasix gtt was stopped on [**7-2**] [**1-24**] hypotension (SBP 80s), sinus tachycardia (Hr90s) and Creatinine bump to 1.4.
Creatinine went back down to 1.2 that same day but lasix gtt continued to be held.
On admission his statin was held due to concerns of liver toxicity.
The 2nd day of admission his HIV medications and Buspar dose was reduced from 15mg to 10mg for toxicity concerns.
Upon transfer to the ICU, more of the patient's medications were weaned, including buspirone and paroxetine.
After he was transferred out of the unit his LFTs slowly trended down with diuresis and improving hemodynamics.
------------------- Cardiac Surgery: He was taken to cardiac surgery on for a re-do sternotomy for placement of mechanical AVR on [**2163-7-6**].
He received vancomycin perioperative as he was in the hospital preoperatively.
