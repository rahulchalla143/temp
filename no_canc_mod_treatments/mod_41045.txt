Admission Date:  [**2197-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Right cerebellar hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-3-21**] Suboccipital crani for evacuation of the Right cerebellar hemorrhage [**2197-3-21**] Right frontal EVD placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old man with hypertension and vascular disease transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with reported cerebellar hemorrhage.
He reportedly was brought to the OSH after developing nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis at his apartment complex.
ECG remarkable for obvious LVH (voltage criteria) and ?RBBB (RSR' in III), with NSR.
He was given Zofran and labetalol, and when his systolics remained elevated in the 200s, he was started on a nitroprusside drip.
He was continued on the Nipride gtt en route, and paralyzed for transport using rocuronium and propofol gtt.
AAA endovascular repair c/b R ext iliac pseudoaneurysm, also s/p repair [**2195**] 4.
Interval occipital craniectomy with increased but residual hyperdense blood in the cerebellum and ventricles; evaluation of mass effect is suboptimal on this study due to portable technique.
Interval placement of a right frontal approach ventricular catheter with persistent hydrocephalus.
Parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right cerebellum with extension into the fourth ventricle and biparietal/bitemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to 20 hours prior.
Interval removal of the right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with hyperdensity along catheter tract, representing minor parenchymal hemorrhage with trace intraventricular extension.
Otherwise, the appearance is largely unchanged with biparietal and bitemporal subarachnoid blood, likely redistributional, related to the right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with fourth ventricular extension, status post occipital craniectomy.
Unchanged minor parenchymal hemorrhage along the prior ventriculostomy catheter tract.
Left subclavian line tip is terminating in the mid-to-distal superior vena cava.
Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage with decreased density of right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage, and near complete resolution of subarachnoid and ventriculostomy catheter tract hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was taken to the OR emergently for suboccipital craniectomy and evacuation of ICH.
Prior to this procedure a R frontal EVD was placed without difficulty.
Post operatively he remained intubated and was taken to the ICU for further care including SBP control and q1 neurochecks.
On post op exam he was not following commands but moved everything to noxious.
Bipap ventilation was started at 930 am.
A CXR was consistent with worseing consolidation and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated for for Ventilatory Aquired Pneumonia.
The External Ventricular Drain was discontinued as there was no drainage of CSF from the EVD and the patient's 4th ventircle was noted to be patent on head CT.
The patient was electively extubated after diuresis with lasix.
He tolerated extubation well.
The steroids were discontinued as the patient has pneumonia and Cdiff concurrently.
He was agitated on [**3-27**] and seroquel was increased.
Staining was noted on his pillowcase and there was a concern for CSF leak.
A clean dressing was applied and scant staining only was noted.
He had some hypotension on [**4-1**] that responded to fluid bolus.
On [**4-3**] his abdomen was found to be distended and post void bladder scan revealed 1000cc remaining in the bladder so a foley was replaced and the patient was started on Flomasx.
He was given a fluid bolus and placed on low IV maintenence fluids.
His sutures were removed on [**4-4**].....He had screening LENIs on [**4-4**] that were again negative for DVT.
nystatin and second alpha blocker were discontinued.
He was given an IVF bolus and standing IVF due to his continued poor PO intake.
He was started on calorie counts.
This responded well to Zofran and fluid resuscitation.
On [**4-25**] a foley catheter d/c trial was once again initiated but the pt failed to void so it was replaced.
They recommended keeping the foley in place for an additional 6 days then following up in the urology clinic.
On [**5-16**] the patient failed another voiding trial and the foley catheter was replaced.
They also recommended intermittent catheterization, which is preferred over indwelling foley catheter but this was not possible due to patient's lack of participation.
Patient is ambulating safely over short distances and has been given a wheelchair for longer distances.
