Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for a malfunctioning AV graft as well as shortness of breath, which was thought to be due to fluid-overload from congestive heart failure.
You had to briefly go to the intensive care unit for management of your breathing and heart failure, after which you were evaluated for the malfunctioning AV graft.
The graft could not be repaired but, you can continue hemodialysis through another catheter you had placed in your neck.
