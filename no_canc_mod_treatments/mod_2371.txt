HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-year old female with history of CAD status post CABG, end-stage CHF on chronic dopamine, status post biventricular pacer with an EF of 20%, a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11/2127**] and diabetes mellitus.
The decision was made with ID to not to treat her systematically and to leave her Hickman line intact.
Her dopamine was increased to 20 and was given IV fluid bolus 500 cc x1.
CAD status post CABG in [**2120**], redo in [**2123**].
MR, CHF on chronic dopamine drip, status post biventricular pacer in '[**23**].
GI bleeds with AVM status post cauterization in 04/[**2127**].
Prosthetic mechanical mitral valve, requiring coumadin anticoagulation 8.
Aldactone 5 q.d.
Lasix 120 q.a.m.
Zoloft 100 b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 q.d.
Enalapril 15 b.i.d.
Carvedilol 6.25 b.i.d.
Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
Trazodone 100 mg q.d.
Dopamine 8 mcg/kg/minute chronic home IV infusion  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 13588**].
She is continued on her aspirin and statin since she was admitted.
Her beta blockers and ACE initially were held in the setting of low blood pressures.
She was challenged with IV fluid boluses 250 cc each time and the Bumex and Lasix were held at that time initially, and continued with the aldactone for now.
Dopamine drips were increased with a titration goal given a systolic blood pressures of greater than 60 with IV boluses and dopamine drip.
There was much discussion of her Hickman line previous admission.
On admission, she was started on empirical Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl to cover the GI scan and Clostridium difficile, and she was added for stool studies.
Her Coumadin was held at the time because she was supertherapeutic, INR of 4.0.
She tolerated that well and sugars within acceptable goals.
For her cardiovascular, we will still continue with her aspirin and statin.
Considering restarting beta blocker as she can tolerate her blood pressure.
In terms of her ID status, she was continued on her Vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Zosyn for broad coverage, and ID was consulted for further input.
ID recommended to discontinue Zosyn, discontinue Vancomycin, and discontinue Flagyl, to continue levofloxacin and to change the dose to 250 q.24h., also check the stool for Clostridium difficile.
It is recognized that access for Hickman is formidable issue, requiring prior replacement in operating room.
On [**8-8**], her levofloxacin was increased from 250 to 500 given that 2/3 bottles from [**8-6**] grew gram-negative rods.
Her blood pressures with dopamine drip was much improved by [**8-8**], and she was back to her home IV dose of 8 mcg/kg/minute, which she continued to be on that dose until discharge date.
On [**8-9**], ID suggested to continue levofloxacin, and also because the blood cultures also grew budding yeast.
They also recommended to start fluconazole at which point, she was started on fluconazole 400 mg IV q.24h.
with close [**Month/Year (2) 7941**] of INR because of the interaction of fluconazole with Coumadin.
Though her blood cultures from the previous gram-negative rods actually grew Klebsiella, she was continued on levofloxacin to cover the Klebsiella, which was sensitive to levofloxacin.
Balancing risk/benefit, surgery disagreed and wanted the Hickman line in thinking that since the patient has been asymptomatic and afebrile, and because of the need for dopamine drip and the need for central access that medical management may suffice for the time being including antibiotic coverage.
Patient was started on Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.d.
On discharge date, all cultures have been negative, and patient was setup with followup with both Cardiology and [**Hospital **] Clinic, and patient was sent home with an extra two weeks of antibiotic treatments.
Ongoing formal followup - both telephonic and clinic- planned in detail with advanced Heart Failure Clinic program FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Septic shock.
