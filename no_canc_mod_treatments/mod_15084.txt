HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman with a history of type 1 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease, status post failed renal transplant in [**2137**] (on hemodialysis three times per week) with deep venous thrombosis (status post bilateral below-knee amputations) and retinopathy.
The patient was discharged home with plans to have aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] at a future date.
A dental examination determined the need for dental extractions in preparation for his aortic valve replacement.
The patient was discharged home with two weeks of clindamycin and vancomycin.
He was given antibiotics and left that facility against medical advice because no doctor came to see him for an entire day.
Deep venous thrombosis; status post bilateral below-knee amputations.
Status post kidney transplant in [**2137**]; status post failure in [**2138**].
Clindamycin 600 mg by mouth three times per day (times two weeks).
Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Calcium acetate by mouth three times per day (with meals).
Amlodipine 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Vancomycin 1 gram dosed at dialysis (times two weeks).
Bilateral below-knee amputations with well-healed wounds.
Right subclavian dialysis catheter was nontender.
The initial diagnosis was felt to more HHNK rather than diabetic ketoacidosis.
In summary, the patient had a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm mosaic porcine bioprosthetic valve.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The patient had a fair amount of bleeding from his chest tube following his surgery.
The patient was treated with multiple units of packed red blood cells as well as some fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
He arrived to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, and insulin drips.
His Neo-Synephrine was quickly weaned to off, and he became hypertensive requiring nitroglycerin and Nipride infusions to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg.
Given the patient's chest tube output the decision was made to keep him sedated until the morning on postoperative day one.
He also underwent hemodialysis following this surgery.
On postoperative day one, the patient remained hemodynamically stable on low-dose milrinone, nitroglycerin, and Nipride infusions.
On postoperative day two, the patient was started on beta blockade as well as an ACE inhibitor.
His Nipride was weaned to off, and his nitroglycerin was also weaned.
On postoperative day three, the patient was also started on Norvasc, his ACE inhibitor, and beta blockade.
His remaining chest tubes were discontinued.
However, the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next several days because of a remaining need for intravenous insulin infusions.
Finally, on postoperative day five, the patient was able to come off of his insulin drip and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days, the patient's insulin regimen continued to be modified.
The extremities were warm with bilateral below-knee amputations.
