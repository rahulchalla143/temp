Admission Date: [**2167-5-1**]          Discharge Date: [**2167-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-1-5**]          Sex:  F  Service:  SURGERY  THIS IS A DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM  On [**2167-5-12**] the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with extended lysis of adhesions, an open cholecystectomy, a common bile duct exploration, a choledochoscopy, and an intraoperative cholangiography, and a choledochoduodenostomy.
A stone was found in the ampulla and pushed through intraoperatively.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and intraoperative and postoperatively was placed on 5 mg of metoprolol intravenous q 6 hours.
She received 2 mg of intravenous Dilaudid plus 1 mg of subcutaneous Dilaudid which helped with her pain.
Dilaudid and the dose was increased to 2 mg subcutaneous q 2 hours.
A nasogastric tube was placed postoperatively because of the choledochoduodenostomy.
The nasogastric tube was ultimately removed on postoperative day six.
The patient reported no flatus indicating a lack of bowel function up until postoperative day six when the nasogastric tube was actually pulled.
On postoperative day two the patient was switched from lactated Ringer's to maintenance intravenous fluids.
The patient also showed a low urine output the previous day and required fluid boluses to maintain her urine output.
The patient was started on albuterol nebulizers for her wheezes.
The patient was given a dose of Lasix to help diurese her.
A set of electrolytes were drawn which were normal except for a magnesium of 1.4 for which she got 3 grams of magnesium sulfate.
On the following day, postoperative day six, the patient had continuing shortness of breath, and her intravenous fluids were stopped.
On postoperative day seven the patient continued to have expiratory wheezes bilaterally and having tolerated a clear diet the previous day after nasogastric tube was pulled out, she was begun on a regular diet.
TPN was also begun on postoperative day six and continued into postoperative day seven with a 1 liter starter solution.
Early on postoperative day seven the patient's Dilaudid PCA was stopped and the patient was begun on oral Percocet.
When this failed to control the patient's pain she was started on intravenous Dilaudid.
However, the patient did not receive a dose of intravenous Dilaudid.
Extra doses of Lasix were given.
The patient was diuresed extensively and intravenous metoprolol was stopped as this was thought to be possibly a confounding factor leading to her wheezes.
The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells to bring her hematocrit just above 30.
The TPN was also stopped in the intensive care unit along with levofloxacin that had been given for 12 days to treat a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
The patient was continued on Lasix 20 intravenous per day but received no additional intravenous fluids.
The patient's pain was also well controlled on acetaminophen with P.O.
The patient's past surgical history includes a colectomy with ileostomy reversal in [**2161**], an appendectomy, a left wrist open reduction with internal fixation, a spinal fusion times two, and a Billroth II operation.
