Was started on bactrim, as well as steroid taper.
The patient frequently desatted while in the unit to the mid 80s in the context of taking off her nasal cannula or any physical activity.
Her O2 sats improved with putting on NC and resting.
The patient had an interesting affect in the unit and based on CD4 count, it was decided that brain imaging was indicated.
Received 40 mg IV lasix on transit to ICU.
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**]: While she was there she was continued on her bactrim and prednisone taper for her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
ID was concerned about cryptococal meningitis, but the patient has been refusing LP.
ID did not want to start HAART before cryptococal was ruled out because of [**Doctor First Name **].

COMPARISONS: MR brain of [**2102-11-3**] and CT brain of [**2102-11-4**]  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the brain were obtained without intravenous contrast at 5-mm slice thickness.
Subclavian central venous line, evaluate pneumothorax.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without the indication for intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], read in conjunction with conventional chest radiographs as recent as 2:20 p.m. on [**11-7**] and a preceding chest CT on [**10-24**].
An endotracheal tube is in standard position.
Nasogastric tube passes to the mid stomach, the lowest level of imaging.
ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Respiratory failure: Required multiple intubations and admissions to ICU.
There may also have been CMV pneumonia as well given CMV antigen from BAL.
-- Completed 21 day course of bactrim and steroids -- Will continue additional 5 days of steroids to taper -- Will start prophylactic dose Bactrim after therapy is completed .
# Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Developed late in course of hosptilazation and required reintubation but responded rapidly to antibiotics.
# Diarrhea: Extensive workup for stool pathogens was unremarkable.
Given that patient had CMV viremia and severe diarrhea in the setting of CD4 count of 11, the patient was started on treatment for CMV colitis.
-- 3-6 weeks of Gancicyclovir IV with duration to be determined at ID follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] -- PRN loperamide now that most infectious causes ruled out.
Multiple causes may be contributing including acute illness, suppression from virus (CMV, HIV) or medications (antivirals, bactrim).
CD4 count 11.
Patient was started on HAART with darunavir, ritonavir and truvada.
Will be followed-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with medication changes made if neccessary.
-- continue prophylaxis with azithromycin and bactrim .
-- 3-6 weeks of Gancicyclovir IV with duration to be determined at ID follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] .
Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from severe illness that improved with treatment of underlying conditions.
- Home dose of sertraline was increased to 150mg daily - Aripiprazole 2mg daily was added as adjunctive therapy - Home clonazepam was stopped - Patient will need outpatient follow-up after resolution of acute illness .
Testing for acquired predispositions to arterial thrombosis was unremarkable.
# HSV2 vesicles: Improved with antivirals -- There should be less chance of reactivation with initiation of HAART -- Gancyclovir also provides coverage for HSV2 .
# Limb ischemia: s/p thrombectomy for ischemic left foot and fasciotomy caused by an acute arterial thrombus.
-- Patient non-weight bearing on the left -- continue heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin.
Discharge INR 2 after receiving 3 mg warfarin x 3 days.
Please monitor INR closely and adjust warfarin as necessary.
Her sensitivity to warfarin at discharge was high, requiring a very low dose.
Complication of subclavian line placement.
Patient had chest tube placed, which was removed on [**2102-11-10**].
While inpatient she was aspirating initially and therefore had a NG tube placed for feeding.
Most likely the etiology is her severe underlying illness including AIDS and the other superimposed infections causing increased caloric needs and decreased appetite.

During an operation for this, you developed difficulty breathing and were eventually diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia.
Your pneumocystis pneumonia was treated with a course of antibiotics and steroids.
During your stay, you also developed a secondary bacterial pneumonia which was treated with an additional course of antibiotics.
Once your acute issues were stabilized and you were able to take oral medications, treatment for your HIV infection was also started.
You will need eventual followup with Vascular Surgery for surgical treatment of your ischemic foot, likely with an amputation.
Your home medication regimen was significantly changed during your stay.
You should refer to your discharge medication sheet for your new medication regimen and dosing instructions.
