Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology service on [**2185-10-17**] when he presented with palpitations, dyspnea, some URI symptoms, which was associated with substernal chest pain, found to have evidence of volume overload and peripheral edema consistent with decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy.
He was started on a Nitro gtt and aggressively diuresed, requiring a Lasix gtt with conversion to PO Torsemide prior to discharge.
Additions to his medication list at that time included an ACEI, beta-blocker and spironolactone.
He was also loaded with Digoxin and was uptitrated to 375 mcg PO daily.
The patient's 2D-Echo was repeated on [**2185-10-31**] showed similar findings after initiation medical therapies.
In the ED, his tachypnea progressed and he required RSI (etomidate, succinylcholine) for airway protection and increased work of breathing.
In the MICU, patient was started on heparin gtt following bolus for small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus.
They continued Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia given CT findings of right lung base consolidation.
Cardiology recommended discontinuing anti-hypertensives and continuing anticoagulation.
He was extubated on [**11-13**] and his heparin gtt was bridged to Coumadin with some mild hemoptysis.
At this point, his outpatient Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], recommended transfer to the CCU for IV Lasix and Milrinone therapy given his biventricular cardiac failure.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red stools.
He is student studying international relations and economics; he has a girlfriend, and he is sexually active with her monogamously.
Mucous membranes dry with dry-blood at mouth edges.
[**2185-11-15**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 19M with no significant PMH presents with likely famlial dilated cardiomyopathy with recent hospitalization for acute failure who responded to diuresis who now returns with shortness of breath found to have pneumonia and subsegmental pulmonary embolus with evidence of biventricular failure and volume overload.
He responded to aggressive Lasix gtt with conversion to PO Torsemide with improvement in symptoms at that time.
Etiologies for his cardiomyopathy included: ischemic (unlikely given age and no risk factors; no cardiac cath data) vs. infectious (HIV, Lyme, viral, Chagas - last admission his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative) vs. toxic (alcohol, cocaine, medications - unlikely given no prior medication; prior toxicology screens negative, although moderate alcohol intake was noted) vs. familial (most likely possibility given strong family history noted above; genetic vs. autoimmunity-related).
He now returned with dyspnea on exertion and at while at rest without overt volume overload symptoms, but was found to have a subsegmental LLL pulmonary embolus requiring heparinization.
He also had significant abdominal pain and transaminitis which was attributed to cardiogenic-hepatic congestion or congestive hepatopathy.
He was admitted to the CCU after transfer from the medical ICU, and was initiated on a Milrinone infusion of 0.25 mcg/kg/min following an initial loading dose of 50 mcg/kg over 15-minutes.
Simultaneously, he was started on a continuous IV Lasix infusion at 5-7 mg/hr and together with the inotropic effect of Milrinone, he diuresed roughly 6-8L of fluid to a weight of 90.2 kg (95 kg on admission; dry weight 89.8 kg).
He will continue on Milrinone therapy and will be transferred to [**Hospital3 90505**] Center for Cardiac Transplant Surgery evaluation.
His ACEI (Lisinopril) and Spironolactone therapy were held in the setting of acute heart failure, but his Metoprolol was titrated back at 12.5 mg by mouth twice daily; we also continued his Digoxin therapy.
He received heparin gtt and he was bridged to Coumadin.
He was started on Coumadin 5 mg PO daily and his dose was titrated to an INR of [**1-20**].
Nonetheless, he was given IV Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin (started [**11-13**]) for healthcare associated pneumonia coverage.
He did have some evidence of hemoptysis, likely from his infectious alveolar process and anticoagulation needs.
He will continue on healthcare associated PNA coverage with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levofloxacin for a total of [**9-30**] days.
He has no indication for Aspirin - [**Location (un) 47**] risk score calculates to 10-year risk of 1% - given HDL 44, cholesterol 167, age < 20, male, no smoking history and no indication for statin at this time.
Continue Lasix gtt at 5 mg/hr and titrate to adequate diuresis.
Continue Vancomycin, Levaquin and Cefepime for 10-14 days for coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia; start date of [**2185-11-13**].
Morphine IV for pain control.
His ACEI and Spironolactone were held while his acute biventricular failure was managed.
