She tolerated the procedure well, was placed in a cervical collar, and was managed post-operatively by neurosurgery.
Her post-operative course was complicated by a new O2 requirement (low 90s on 4L NC on call-out) due to decompensated dCHF in the setting of COPD, low grade post-op fever to 100.5, delerium, typical CP ruled out for MI, and sinus tachycardia likely due to pain, ruled for PE.

Placement of [**Location (un) 8766**] head holder for axial spinal stabilization.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Post-operatively she became hypervolemic due to IVF and was transferred in respiratory distress on NRB to the MICU for close monitoring and diuresis; CXR at that time was equivocal for possible infiltrate and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible CA-PNA.
The patient improved with diuresis and was transferred to the floor.
She continued diuresis on the floor and O2 sats improved, being discharged on RA with sats in the low 90s.
Diuresis resulted in [**Last Name (un) **] as detailed below.
