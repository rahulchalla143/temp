Following initial stabilization, patient had another episode of significant hematemesis and melena on the afternoon of [**2144-12-4**], and was hemodynamically unstable, requiring additional packed red cell transfusions.
An emergent conference was held involving attending physicians from the hepatology, interventional radiology, ICU and surgical services to discuss possible therapeutic interventions.
It was felt that no endoscopic options were possible and that, due to multiple varices and very difficult/calcified/aneurysmal anatomy, IR options were not optimal.
