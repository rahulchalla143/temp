VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing video fluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.
Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid and pudding were administered.
Penetration was observed with thin liquids but no aspiration was identified.

A right-sided subclavian line has its tip projecting over the SVC.
Abdomen, two views including portable supine and left lateral decubitus portable.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evidence of ischemic bowel, inflammation, obstruction, diverticulitis, etc.
There are no prior cross-sectional abdominal studies for comparison.
The colon is largely decompressed, containing small amounts of stool and air material.
There is a Foley catheter within the bladder, and air within the bladder likely related to instrumentation.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case.
The decision for exploratory laparotomy was made and he had a gastrostomy tube placement.
POD 3 he was started on tube feedings at a slow rate and his rate was slowly advanced while watching his residuals.
His tube feedings were held on POD 5 and POD 6.
After a bowel movement with aid of a Fleet enema, tube feedings were started back at 20cc/hr.
We were able to increase his tube feedings and reach his goal of 70cc/hr.
A Speech and Swallow Video Oropharyngeal evaluation revealed that he could tolerate thin liquids and pureed solids.
Yet, he had minimal PO intake and will need to continue on the tubefeedings.
He also was started on Reglan IV to help with motility and we held his ASA.
Blood, urine and central line catheter tip was cultured and were all negative.
[**8-25**] CXR increased moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and atelectasis at the left lung base has worsened.
- Continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
After the OR he was initially on Vancomycin and then this was D/C'd as his cultures were negative except for Staphylococcus, Coagulase Negative, isolated from one set only.
- Hold metformin and lisinopril - Hydration prior to CT with contrast, as well as mucomyst .
# HTN - He was normotensive to hypotensive on admission -  His lisinopril and atenolol were held until GIB stable and the was managed on IV Lopressor as needed, until he was able to receive his pills thru the G-tube.
# DM - On metformin as outpatient - Hold metformin in setting of mildly elevated Cr and contrast from CT - ISS .
# Psych - Dementia based on outpt meds - Restart Aricept once taking PO - Ativan HS .
# PPX - - Hep SQ - Bowel regimen - PPI .
