PHYSICIANS: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 26181**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 380**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
The preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.
Standard sterile prep and drape of the ventral abdomen and in situ gastrostomy catheter (18 French Foley catheter).
The guidewire was passed through the Foley catheter and the Foley catheter was removed.
The bright-tip vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire and with the aid of a Kumpe catheter, the pylorus was intubated and the wire and catheter were advanced through the duodenum and into the jejunum.
The Kumpe catheter was then exchanged for an MPA catheter and the wire and catheter were advanced to the level of the jejunostomy.
The jejunostomy was then intubated and efferent limb was cannulated using the dilator from the vascular sheath and a Bentson guidewire.
A 22 French MIC catheter was then advanced over the guidewire and positioned with its tip in the jejunum distal to the jejunostomy site.
A dressing was applied.
Contrast was injected through the tube and confirmed catheter tip positioned in the jejunum beyond the jejunostomy site and the position of the balloon within the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of the in situ gastrostomy catheter with a 22 French MIC catheter with balloon in the stomach, gastric port in the gastric antrum, and tip of catheter within the jejunum distal to the site of the jejunostomy.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54747**] [**Name (STitle) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2153-2-15**] 1:39 PM     Brief Hospital Course: Assessment - 28yo quadraplegic woman with cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation, chronic trach (not on home ventilation), who was admitted for respiratory distress and found to have a tracheal obstruction and possible PNA.
Pt was placed on PCV with good oxygenation.
7.0 ETT at bedside; if needed in emergency, can place through stoma to 12cm.
During her hospital course, during trach care where the velcro securing device was removed she coughed out her trach tube, it was promptly replaced, and IP was consulted, a cxr confirmed it was in appropriate position and the cuff was reinflated with good maintenance of her oxygen saturation.
She was to be maintained on intermittent trach collar and pressure spport, with attempts to maximize trach collar time as tolerated, she was also continued on albuterol and atrovent.
She had Central line and this was discontinued given low grade fevers.
She was started on vanc/ceftaz flagyl initially, sputum culture grew pseudomonas and received 5 days of this, however with worsening renal insufficiency and concern for AIN and pt with persistent infiltrates from previous records antibiotics were discontinued for pneumonia.
[**Doctor First Name **] likely colonizer as pt not on treatment from [**Hospital1 **];  she was given albuterol, atrovent prn.
The pt was started on meropenem on [**2-14**] to cover pseudomonal PNA, and on Vanc on [**2-15**] to cover for any potential line infection.
She was continued on meropenem and levaquin was added for further persistent fevers and double gram negative coverage.
She was continued on flagyll for empiric C diff coverage while her cdiff cultures were negative at time of discharge and her C diff toxinb B was still pending.
She was discharged to finish 2 more days of meropenem and 4 more days of levaquin and to finish a 14 day course of flagyl for presumed c. diff .
# J tube dislodgement - On presentation her J tube had fallen out, this was replaced by Interventional radiology on [**2153-2-1**].
Surgery evaluated the pateint and on [**2-7**] changed tube for Malecot (larger diameter), then performed J tube check.
IR decided to [**Last Name (un) **] ther G tube to a G-J tube, however, given her anatomy and previous surgeries recommended that this would likely need to be done by surgery.
Surgery has requsted records from [**Hospital1 **] regarding previous abdominal surgeries, previous anti reflux surgery?, ?
why she has G and a seperate J tube as well as her aspiration risk.
These records need to be obtained prior to surgery at [**Hospital1 18**].
Tube feeds were held.
On [**2-12**] the pts J tube was pulled, and on [**2-13**] a GJ tube was placed by IR.
The pts J tube fistula site willl close over time and will need an ostomy bag over the site until then.
Her G- tube was placed to suction.
Her J-tube feedings were to be held until there was no drainaged from the J tube ostomy site.
# Erythema around J tube - Patient was noted to have erythema around the J tube site.
This was thought likely inflammation from bile, expect improvement with replacement of ostomy bag.
Given fevers there was concern for cellulitis she was started on vancomycin (PCN allergy) [**2153-2-2**].
Rare eosinophils in urine initially and all potential meds were stopped as above, repeat showed no eos, so less likely AIN.
# CP, mental retardation - continue ativan prn, valium [**Hospital1 **]  #.
Seizures - continue phenobarbitol, topamax .
FEN - Patient was on TPN while inpatient, will consider Tube feeds when J tube ostomy site is decreasing.
PPx - Zantac, sc heparin, bowel regimen  Access - very difficult, finally with L subclavian CVL.
