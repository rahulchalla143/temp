Found to have an INR of approximately 8 possible secondary to the medications that she had been taking; however, the patient was unclear what medicine she had been taking.
She had been given vitamin A and fresh frozen plasma times two.
She has chronic renal insufficiency; she had been started on an ACE inhibitor approximately six months ago.
She is status post nephrectomy (which is old).
She is status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications on admission were Vioxx 12.5, warfarin 2.5, Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
twice per day, lisinopril 40 mg p.o.
once per day (this was started in [**2162-10-29**]), digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
once per day, allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
every day, Lasix 40 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination on transfer to the [**Hospital1 139**] team, her blood pressure was 84 to 91/30 to 50.
The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 unit of vitamin K.  Her Coumadin was held.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Gastroenterology was consulted who recommended an outpatient colonoscopy as there were no signs of brisk bleed, and the patient's hematocrit was stable for greater than 48 hours status post the initial transfusion.
She was started back on her Coumadin at 2.5 mg when her INR was 1.7.
The patient was discharged on iron supplements.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Congestive heart failure: Initially the patient had hypotesion and was not given any treatment for her congestive heart failure after the blood transfusion and improvement of the patient's blood pressure to 120 to 145/50 to 60.
The patient was started on intravenous Lasix 40 by 20 intravenously then converted over to 40 p.o.
The patient was initially started on nitrate for afterload reduction.
This was converted to oral nitrates and hydralazine.
An ACE inhibitor was initially not used given the patient's elevated creatinine.
The goal will be to start an ACE inhibitor and place on hydralazine and nitrates when the patient's creatinine is less than 1.5.
When the patient was euvolemic, her beta blocker was titrated up for rhythm control for atrial fibrillation.
Repeatedly during the admission, the patient refused surgery at the current time and preferred to have medical management.
The patient was to follow up with the Congestive Heart Failure Service as an outpatient, at which time an ACE inhibitor will be added to her regimen.
Beta blocker was titrated up as the patient was diuresed, and on the day of discharge her heart rate was in the low 90s, and her blood pressure was 112/70.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was initially dialyzed and then renal function improved; most likely secondary to the ACE inhibitor that had been titrated up in the context of the patient having one kidney.
When the patient was discharged, she was instructed to stay away from [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitors, to not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and to not take digitalis, and that she could start an ACE inhibitor as an outpatient.
Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis.
She did have the echocardiogram (as stated earlier), and she was on dialysis (as stated earlier).
Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.
Furosemide 40 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets as needed.
