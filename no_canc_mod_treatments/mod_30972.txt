Received 2 L NS and 6 u insulin IV and started on insulin gtt at 6 u/hr.
Underwent multiple attempts at access (PIVs, 2 EJs, SC line, IJ line, femoral line); eventually required use of dialysis catheter for hydration and insulin administration.
Her DM is complicated by peripheral neuropathy, proliferative retinopathy (left eye blindness), and nephropathy.
History of osteomyelitis, status post left transmetatarsal amputation.
Family History: Mother - DM Sister - breast ca, DM Brother - HTN [**Name (NI) 2957**] - SLE, d. renal failure  Physical Exam: VS- Tc 96.8, 100, 160/59, 13, 100% RA HEENT- flat neck veins, poor skin turgor over sternum.
Given 1 amp calcium gluconate and 1 amp bicarb for hyperkalemia.
Started on ciprofloxacin IV for suspected UTI.
Given 15 u * 3 insulin IV boluses (over 3 hrs) and started on insulin gtt 10 u/hr.
Given NS at 500cc hour.
In the ED, she received 4 L NS and 6 units of insulin and was started on insulin gtt @ 6 units/hr.
On the floor, she was continued on NS and insulin gtt was uptitrated to 30 units/hr.
She also received an additional 75 units of insulin in boluses of 15 units.
She was started on IV Cipro for UTI.
Her insulin drip was then decreased to 2 units/hr.
Her potassium was initially elevated but dropped substantially with insulin and fluids.
Given her underlying renal disease, her 1/2 NS w/ KCl was stopped and she was changed to D5 1/2NS to be continued with her insulin drip.
Her potassium was greatly elevated on admission but was likely falsely elevated from extracellular movement due to insulin deficiency.
Upon arrival to the floor, she was given Calcium gluconate and sodium bicarb with resolution of her peaked TWs.
As above, her hyperkalemia corrected rapidly with insulin and fluid administration.
She was started on 325 mg daily aspirin and cardiac enzymes were cycled.
She was also given IV metoprolol to replace her po metoprolol while she had altered mental status.
Her enzymes remained flat but she had evolution of her EKG changes with development of TW inversions in her lateral precordial leads.
However, as her cardiac enzymes were negative, these were considered nonspecific changes and no further interventions were pursued.
Patient's line became infected due to emergent access in the ICU, so it was removed and a temporary HD cath with VIP port was placed in IR.
Vancomycin given by level.
After 2 days of antibiotics the catheter was replaced with a permanent tunneled catheter.
