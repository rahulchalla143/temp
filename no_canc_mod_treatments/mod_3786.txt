At the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital she had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse which was broken with IV diltiazem.
Her friend was then admitted to hospital which made it difficult for her to obtain meals.

AORTIC VALVE: BIleaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
female with h/o CRI, htn, hyperlipidemia, chronic AF and s/p mechanical AVR w/single vessel CABG w/VG to OM 92 (s/p stenting of SVG to OM [**2142-11-12**]), hypothyroid, anxiety d/o, anemia who is transferred from OSH for BiV pacer/ICD.
Initially ([**2-7**]) presented with decomp CHF and ARF, also went into af with RVR at OSH.
After ruling her out for ischemia we attempted to diurese her with IV lasix without success.
* Ms. [**Known lastname 4401**] was admitted to the cardiac care unit for tailored therapy since she failed to sufficiently diurese on the floor.
A swan ganz catheter was placed which revealed high left and right sided pressures with a low CI so she was started on pressors and lasix.
She was initially started on dopamine but failed to have improvement in her cardiac output or urine output.
Once she was switched to milrinone she diuresed well on a lasix drip.
She was also started on digoxin at renal doses to improve her inotropy.
She was started on a low dose beta blocker upon arrival to the floor.
Upon transfer to the CCU and successful diuresis a biventricular pacer was placed without complications and then she was DC cardioverted.
She was then started on amiodarone in attempt to promote pharmacological cardioversion.
She tolerated the placement of the procedure well without the formation of a hematoma.
She was given darvocet prn for pain which she was already taking for her rib fracture.
* Ishemia: After ruling out for an MI she was continued on aspirin and a statin.
Once on the milrinone and after aggressive lasix diuresis, her creatinine fell to 1.6.
We lowered the parameters of her beta blocker dosing to enusre that she received those meds.
The patient was started on celexa and seen by social work.
* Osteoporosis: She was continued on fosamax, calcium and vitamin D. * Ppx: She was continued on her PPI.
She was switched from coumadin to IV heparin and she was then re-started on warfarin for her atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement thus she did not receive sub Q heparin.
