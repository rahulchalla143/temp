Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension: Thought to be related to two factors, 1) hypovolemia from recent diarrheal illness and 2) medication effect from multiple anti-hypertensives as well as decreased clearance of atenolol due to Acute on Chronic Renal failure.
Patients was volume resucitated and anti-hypertensives as well as narcotics were held and his SBP (nadir was 70) increased eventually to 140 upon discharge.
His Diovan was restarted at half of his home dose (80mg [**Hospital1 **], home dose was 160mg [**Hospital1 **]), his norvasc was held (normally takes 5mg po daily) and his HCTZ was also started at half of his home dose (20mg po bid of oxycontin rather than his normal dose of 40mg po bid).
# ARF- Acute on Chronic renal failure, likely due to pre-renal causes as patient had a diarrheal illness for 5 days which resolved a few days prior to admission, and his renal failure improved with 4 liters of fluid resuscitation- back to his baseline.
He was not using his cane at the time.
Per PT he should use his cane at all times from this point forward.
He has chronic ankle pain from previous trauma and is scheduled for surgical correction in roughly 1 week.
Pain medications were decreased to oxycontin 20mg po bid from 40mg po bid, patient's pain was well controlled on this regimen, he should uptitrate as outpatient with his PCP as his blood pressure allows if his pain worsens.
