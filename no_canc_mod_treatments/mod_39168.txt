TTP, complicated by renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and acute encephalopathy: She was intially admitted to the ICU and a pheresis line was placed.
She was started on daily plasma exchange on [**4-25**] and high-dose steroids.
Rheumatology, Hematology, and the Pheresis team followed closely.
Her mental status improved, and her platelet count began to recover with this treatment, but plateaued.
She will be discharged on a slow steroid taper with bactrim and PPI prophylaxis as well as new insulin because of elevated blood sugars while on prednisone.
During her hospitalization she did require multiple blood transfusions.
Further clarification with her outpatient providers revealed that she does NOT have a history of lupus, but instead had a history of relapsing polychondritis and possible pulmonary vasculitis.
Several rheum markers were positive, including SSa and RNP, but she had no other evidence of systemic rheumatologic illness.
She will follow-up as an outpatient with her [**Last Name (un) **] opthalmologist and then Rheumatology for further management including timing of re-initiation of plaquenil.
The patient's hypertension was poorly controlled off of lisinopril and atenolol (due to renal failure).
