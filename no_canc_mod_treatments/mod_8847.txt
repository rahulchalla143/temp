Admission Date:  [**2144-8-23**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2079-9-13**]       Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 64-year-old female, status post renal transplant in [**2138-3-5**] and more recently a repeated renal transplant in [**2143-12-6**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3400**] at the [**Hospital1 69**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post renal transplant in [**2138-3-5**] and [**2143-12-6**], chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4 in [**2144-6-5**], coronary artery disease with a moderate anterior reversible defect and an EF of 58%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post appendectomy, status post TAH BSO.
MEDICATIONS:  Home medications included Prilosec 20 mg po q d, Glipizide 10 mg po bid, Sodium bicarb, Plavix 75 mg po q d, NPH 15 units q a.m., Prednisone 10 mg po q d, Prograf 2 mg q a.m., 1 mg q p.m., Rapamycin, Lasix 40 mg po q d, Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg po q d, Norvasc 10 mg po q d, Ceftaz 2 gm po bid, and Timentin 2 gm po q 4 hours.
ALLERGIES:  Macrodantin which causes rash.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was status post myocardial infarction, heparin drip and Aspirin were continued.
The patient was continued on Lopressor for beta blockade.
Her original outpatient antihypertensive regimen was continued.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was maintained on Prilosec for GI prophylaxis.
Renal:  For her increased creatinine which was felt to be secondary to over diuresis in the setting of possible congestive heart failure or graft rejection or sepsis.
Her intravascular volume was carefully repleted and creatinine was monitored.
Heme:  The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 23.7 given her history of recent myocardial infarction.
Endocrine:  The patient was continued on her NPH and Glipizide and a regular insulin sliding scale for additional coverage.
On [**2144-8-24**] a central line placement was attempted.
After several attempts eventually the line was placed successfully.
The patient was on Heparin for her recent myocardial infarction throughout the placement of the central line.
After successful placement of the line the patient was transferred to the general medical floor.
A packed red blood cell transfusion was initiated for this hematocrit.
The patient received 80 mg of IV Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of IV Zantac, 50 mg of IV Benadryl and 1 mg of Ativan.
The patient required intubation for airway protection.
She was continued on Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid.
Because of her history of large bleed into the neck, Aspirin and Heparin were held.
The patient did require a brief amount of Dopamine and normal saline boluses, both of these were met with good results and improvement in the blood pressure.
The patient did continue to have intermittent hypotension throughout the next several days and began to experience hypotension after hemodialysis which had been started as described below.
The patient did occasionally require Neo-Synephrine infusion after hemodialysis.
There was concern that an infected Quinton catheter may be causing the hypotension related to dialysis vs poor fluid mobilization after dialysis.
The Quinton catheter was changed and after this there were no further hypotensive episodes requiring pressors after hemodialysis.
The patient was continued on her course of Ceftriaxone which had been started for gram negative sepsis.
She ultimately completed a 14 day course of Ceftriaxone for this.
Urine culture ultimately revealed enterococcus for which the patient was treated with Vancomycin for three days.
The patient was started on Flagyl for suspected anaerobic infection.
Levaquin was added but then discontinued after several days.
Ultimately, culture data which had been taken on sputum from around the time of the patient's initial temperature spike revealed Enterobacter which was sensitive to Imipenem and indeterminate to Quinolone.
For this reason, the aforementioned antibiotics were discontinued as mentioned and the patient was started on Imipenem.
The patient continued on Imipenem for one day and then this was changed to Meropenem because of concerns that Imipenem can lower seizure threshold in patients in end stage renal disease.
The patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who recommended no antibiotics with the exception of the Meropenem.
Legionella and cryptococcus were evaluated and these tests were negative.
She received mechanical ventilation on a variety of modes including assist control, SIMV and pressure support.
Propofol was eventually weaned off in order to clarify the patient's neurologic picture.
After this she was maintained on pressure support with her own respiratory drive and she did not receive any further sedation.
Initially her urine output responded and increased to normal saline boluses.
She was continued on her immunosuppressants which included FK506, Rapamycin and Prednisone.
Rapamycin and FK506 levels were followed and dosages were adjusted as necessary.
Eventually the patient's urine output began to decline and eventually stopped responding to normal saline boluses.
Lasix and normal saline boluses were then tried and these did increase urine output for a brief period of time.
However, ultimately the patient's urine output tapered down and was unresponsive to both boluses and Lasix.
Continued normal saline boluses and a Lasix drip met with moderate success.
Hemodialysis continued throughout the remainder of the hospital admission.
She continued to be maintained on her immunosuppressant drugs as above.
Following the aggressive transfusion after the hematocrit of 11.8, the patient's hematocrit ultimately remained stable.
Over the course of the next several weeks the patient's hematocrit did slowly trend downward, occasionally requiring transfusions of one unit at a time in order to keep her hematocrit over 30.
For the patient's diabetes mellitus she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
When the patient began TPN, she was also maintained on regular insulin sliding scale with insulin and the TPN.
When TPN was discontinued, she was converted to a regular insulin sliding scale again which was titrated upwards in order to maintain glycemic control.
The patient initially began on tube feeds with Criticare.
Around [**2144-8-30**] it was felt that the patient was not properly tolerating her tube feeds and she began a regimen of total parenteral nutrition.
This was met with success and within several days after this the patient's TPN was stopped and she was maintained only on tube feeds.
Phosphorus was generally high throughout the admission and was managed with hemodialysis, Phos-Lo and ultimately Amphojel.
On [**2144-9-3**], the patient was found to be hypercalcemia and she received a dose of Pamidronate in order to manage the hypercalcemia.
Following the development of the large neck hematoma, very low hematocrit and need for aggressive resuscitation for hypotension and low hematocrit, there was concern that the patient suffered anoxic/ischemic brain injury.
The patient was unresponsive, but was also intubated and sedated.
MRI of the head performed on [**2144-8-27**] revealed no evidence for a large territorial infarct but two foci of infarctions in the left cerebellar hemisphere which were new compared to a prior CT scan in [**2144-7-5**].
These activities did decrease with empiric Ativan and so patient was empirically started on Dilantin.
Nonetheless, with reversal of all of these potential confounding factors, the patient's neurologic condition did not improve.
There was a progression to slowing with less prominent suppression which was felt to suggest a lessening of medication effect from Propofol or Lorazepam or other medications.
At that time it was decided to continue caring for the patient, move forward with a tracheostomy to examine options for placement in a ventilation facility closer to the patient's family's home in [**Doctor Last Name **].
