Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o F with a history of COPD on home oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive of green sputum, diagnosed and treated for COPD exacerbation.
Active Issues: # COPD exacerbation: She has severe COPD (stage III) on home oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive of green sputum.
She was treated with prednisone 60mg and q2h nebulizer treatments however her symptoms progressed over her first two days in the hospital and she was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress on [**2124-7-8**].
In the MICU she was initially treated on bipap for three hours with significant improvement in her symptoms, and her pCO2 improved to the 70's.
She was diuresed with 120mg IV lasix with good effect as she is -1.6L during her MICU stay.
She was continued on her steroids, azithromycin and duonebs.
There was discussion about keeping her in the ICU overnight for bipap titration, however as it was thought that she likely had a complex sleep apnea, so will need a full sleep study with titration prior to bipap initiation.
She was maintained on the same treatment course and completed course of azithromycin while in house.
She was placed on home dose lasix 120mg daily.
She was continued on strict I/O's, daily weights measurements.
# OSA: Likely contributing to hypercarbia in addition to her COPD, no bipap for now but will make sure outpatient sleep study is arranged on discharge  # Fibromyalgia: she was continued on home morphine, oxycodone, carisoprodol, gabapentin, ibuprofen.
TRANSITIONAL CARE: - Will need evaluation for BiPAP as an outpatient due to worsening hypercapnea and OSA.
