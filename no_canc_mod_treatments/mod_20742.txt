Patient describes shortness of breath with exertion (transfering to and from wheelchair) that was at its worse today, and was associated with chest burning which lasted one hour.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patients ECG obtained and concerning given worsened ST elevations in setting of LBBB.
Code stemi called, patient given 40mg lasix IV, 1 inch nitro paste, Heparin bolus given only 6K, integrilin bolus 18, 600 plavix load, aspirin 324mg more given.
history of partial colectomy from ischemic colitis (looks like appendectomy on CT scan) s/p amputation of 2nd left toe   Social History: Retired automechanic.
Imaging: C Cath ([**2142-6-11**]): COMMENTS: 1.
The RCA was a non-dominant vessel with sequential 80% stenoses.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severelydepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Contribution of drug reaction, for example amiodarone toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration cannot be assessed in the setting of cardiac decompensation.
Previously described left internal jugular approach central venous line as well as a similar right-sided line persist.
The latter still carrying the Swan-Ganz catheter seen to reach the central portion of the right PA. No evidence of pneumothorax or newly developed discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates that would indicate the presence of pneumonia in this patient with leukocytosis.
Brief Hospital Course: ** PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE ON [**2142-6-23**] **  Mr. [**Known lastname 17029**] is a 65 year-old man with CAD s/p previous CABG who was admitted w/ shortness of breath, transferred to the CCU for SOB and hypoxia.
He was treated with an 8-day course of vanc/cefepime for aspiration pneumonia.
He was initially diuresed with lasix boluses and lasix drip, but due to poor urine output and increasing creatinine, drip was discontinued.
On [**6-13**], diurses with lasix boluses and metolazone was initiated and renal was consulted, who recommended starting CVVH.
On [**6-14**], pt started diuresis with CVVHD for pulmonary edema in setting of worsening MR. CVVH was continued until [**6-18**].
Patient had little diuresis with IV lasix on the general medical floors, and was transfered to the CCU due to increasing oxygen requirement.
He required intubation in the setting of aspiration while on facemask, with desaturation to 70%.
He was maintained on beta blocker, plavix, and statin.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: This was likely in setting of poor forward flow (Fe Urea 16%) s/p CVVH.
CVVH continued until [**6-18**] and pt underwent hemodialysis on [**6-19**].
He underwent bedside cardioversion on [**6-15**] and converted to normal sinus rhythm.
For rate control, beta blocker and amiodarone were initiated.
Initially he was maintained on heparin gtt which was later transitioned to coumadin.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider intervention for subclavian stenosis as outpatient (not done as inpatient in cath given the dye load and renal failure)  6.
There could be some component of congestion, but could be also medication effect from Statin or Zosyn.
Atorvastatin was decreased from 80mg to 40mg daily and initial zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage was changed to cefepime.
Pt underwent abdominal CT on [**6-14**] to rule-out retroperitoneal bleed given recent catheterization on [**6-11**].
His blood pressures and HCTs remained stable throughout the remainder of his hospital course and he did not require further blood transfusions.
Diabetes mellitus type II: insulin was continued per outpatient regimen  9.
Seen by vascular surgery as inpatient, who recommended outpatient follow-up.
