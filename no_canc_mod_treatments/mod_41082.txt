Admission Date:  [**2106-5-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-6-1**]   Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who is a resident of the [**Hospital3 1186**] who has a history of Alzheimer's dementia, tardive dyskinesia, at baseline nonverbal, and was noted at the nursing home to be having increasing wheezing with 02 saturations in the 80s to low 90s.
Given Albuterol nebulizers and was still with wheezing.
Of note, the patient was on tube feeds.
She has stage III left heel ulcer and was on morphine for pain management during dressing changes for them.
While she was in the Emergency Room, the blood pressure was in the 90s, temperature of 102 and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl for a urinary tract infection as she was noted to have pus in her Foley.
She was continued on nebulizers and Solu-Medrol was started while in the Emergency Room.
She received fluids and had improvement in her blood pressure.
Multivitamin with minerals.
Oyster shell with vitamin D. 6.
Morphine sulfate prior to dressing changes.
SEPSIS:  The patient was stable and initially admitted under sepsis protocol to the VICU where she received aggressive hydration, transfused 2 units of blood for a hematocrit less than 30.
She also had a subclavian line placed for access for neurosepsis protocol.
Under sepsis protocol, the patient was started on broad antibiotics including ceftazidime and levofloxacin.
The patient was noted to have gram-negative rods growing from her urine culture and eventually this grew out Citrobacter .................... which was sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime and was the likely source of her sepsis.
However, the patient's oxygenation improved with diuresis and was otherwise stable.
The patient was adrenally insufficient on the admission to the VICU and is to complete a five day course of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was weaned off pressors pretty quickly and did not require further fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.
This improved with 3 liters of 02 and then after aggressive hydration for her blood pressure was in mild respiratory distress, transferred to the VICU but remained respiratory stable on 2 liters and a cool nebulizer face mask.
She was on [**3-9**] liters of nasal cannula, continued on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
She was given three doses of 10 mg of IV Lasix throughout her stay on the floor and was weaned off oxygen and was saturating 97% on 1 liter with minimal 02 requirements, very comfortable respiratory rate.
However, the plans are to complete a ten day course of levofloxacin for the urinary tract infection, discontinue the ceftazidime.
