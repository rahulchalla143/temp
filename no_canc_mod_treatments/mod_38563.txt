She was administered 40 mg of Lasix, 2 mg of morphine and .25 inch of nitropaste and transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
The patient was then intubated at approximately 5:00 a.m. on the morning of admission and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room.
She had arrived on a Dopamine drip at 5 mcs with a systolic blood pressure in the 50s.
The Dopamine drip was increased and nitropaste was removed with an increase in blood pressure and an increase in her heart rate to the 130s.
Chest x-ray performed was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia and she was administered Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital1 882**] and Levofloxacin/Flagyl at the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.
On review of nursing notes from [**Hospital1 882**] it appears that the patient was initially diuresed with Lasix 40 mg times two, and then she had a decline in her blood pressure and several normal saline boluses were given.
The Dopamine was started after the normal saline boluses did not raise her blood pressure.
Status post left hip fracture and repair - open reduction and internal fixation [**2097**].
Osteoarthritis - status post humeral fractures, vertebral compression fractures.
Seizure in the setting of SIADH, which ocurred postop after her open reduction and internal fixation and once again in [**2103-12-3**].
History of zoster on the right chest and back.
Hypertension - blood pressure on medications approximately 120/60.
Potassium supplement.
ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Blood pressure 90/33 on a Dopamine drip at 5 micrograms, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 100% on SIMV, respiratory rate 12 with tidal volume 500, PEEP of 5.
First set of cardiac enzymes demonstrate a CK of 127, MB of 5, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8.
Calcium 7.8, phosphorus 2.7, magnesium 2.3.
The valve area calculated prior to valvuloplasty of the aortic valve was 0.45 cm squared.
Cardiovascular:  On presentation Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was hypotensive requiring support with fluids and pressors.
To assess Ms. [**Known lastname 93058**] hemodynamics a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**2106-2-17**], which demonstrated a mixed venous sat of 65 to 67%, cardiac index of 3.8 to 4, cardiac output at 4.8.
Despite the limited efficacy and a mortality of this procedure the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy wanted to pursue this option for the patient as this would have been the patient's wishes.
Throughout Ms. [**Known lastname 93058**] hospital course she had required blood pressure support with vasopressors.
Initially she presented with a Dopamine drip, however, this was changed to a neo-synephrine.
Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] required vasopressor support with neo-synephrine throughout the admission intermittently.
However, Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was noted to be adrenal insufficient and was placed in cortical and mineral corticoids and remained normotensive not requiring vasopressors for approximately one week prior to discharge.
She had received multiple fluid boluses to sustain her blood pressure prior to the initiation of steroids.
She was initially started on a heparin drip and administered aspirin.
Pulmonary:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] arrived to [**Hospital1 190**] on mechanical ventilation.
She required mechanical ventilation throughout this admission.
I was very difficult to wean the patient off of her mechanical ventilator.
A valvoplasty was pursued secondary to an inability to manage her congestive heart failure, which was likely the underlying pulmonary process preventing weaning.
Status post valvuloplasty the patient still required a significant amount of ventilatory support.
She was maintained on assist control for the majority of her hospitalization.
This procedure was complicated by some bleeding in to the trachea, which formed a blood clot.
Significant amount of blood clot and tissue was removed from the patient's airway, several cm above the carina for several days status post trach, the patient required more vigorous tracheal suction, but she had no further episodes of blood clots obstructing her airways.
Prior to discharge the patient tolerated up to 12 hours on a tracheal tent with arterial blood gases demonstrating adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
She [**Known lastname 1834**] thoracentesis to evaluate this pleural effusion secondary to her difficulty weaning.
Chest tubes were placed after each procedure to drain fluid and air that had accumulated in the spaces.
The left chest tube that had been placed on [**2-23**] did not drain a significant amount of fluid despite chest x-ray decrease in lung volumes and increasing fluid.
A repeat chest tube was placed on [**2106-3-1**].
This chest tube drained a significant amount of fluid from the left space.
Initially, the left chest tube had a high output up to 600 to 800 cc per day, as these volumes decreased significantly the chest tubes were placed to water seal, which demonstrated a significant amount of output.
The patient's chest tubes were removed on [**2106-3-6**].
Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was felt to have a right lower lobe pneumonia and was given Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on presentation.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 346**] she was administered Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
During her hospitalization she was continued on Levofloxacin initially and cultures were followed.
She was switched to Vancomycin and treated with a fourteen day course of this antibiotic.
Throughout her hospitalization she initially had spiked fevers despite treatment for her VAP.
After completing a course of Vancomycin for her VAP, the patient no longer developed any fevers and has remained afebrile for approximately one week prior to discharge.
Neurological:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] remained sedated while on the ventilator with Fentanyl boluses and Versed boluses.
The majority of her stay she was on a low level of Fentanyl drip secondary to significant amount of appearance of discomfort.
As her alertness improved, she was initiated on a Fentanyl patch with Oxycodone prn.
Much of the discomfort is likely related to the areas of chest tube insertion and the goal is to wean her off of these pain medications as she tolerates.
She was disimpacted manually and has remained on aggressive bowel regimen.
Secondary to her prolonged intubation and poor mental status access for feedings was required.
She had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed on [**2106-3-5**].
She tolerated this procedure very well.
Of note, the clip at the end of the tube should be at 2.5 to 3 cm to maintain close approximation of this tube with her stomach.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] required a significant amount of electrolyte repletion of potassium, and magnesium throughout this hospitalization.
However, upon initiation of her tube feedings with Respalor these electrolyte abnormalities were not commonly requiring repletion.
Nutrition was consulted during this hospitalization and the patient's goal nutrition is maintained with Respalor at 30 cc per hour.
She is currently receiving Hydrocortisone and Fluticasone secondary to multiple episodes of hypotension, which were felt secondary to her adrenal insufficiency.
As she was significant deplete in her adrenal corticoids, a slow steroid taper is recommended.
Hematologic:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] required multiple blood transfusions throughout this admission.
In total the patient received 12 units of packed red blood cells.
Prophylaxis:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] remained on subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker and pneumocompression boots during this admission.
