# Hypoglycemia s/p Unintentional Insulin Overdose: Patient with long-history of diabetes, previously on insulin pump s/p failed pancreatic transplant who had insulin pump removed last admission and was started on Glargine and Humalog sliding scale.
Patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabiliation from prior admission where she was reportedly given an unintentional dose of approximately 1000 Units of Glargine.
Patient received 3 Amps of D50 and was started on D10 drip prior to admission.
The D50 drip was continued until the second hospital day and discontinued when her sugars remained stable in the 200 range.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended for restarting her home [**Last Name (un) 8472**] regimen at 22 units qhs.
She was also started on humalog sliding scale with meals, at the recommendation of the [**Last Name (un) **] consult service.
Ultimately, she would benefit from being back on an insulin pump, however at this time with intermittent delirium, this is not an option.
Patient was previously on Lasix but was stopped during her last admission given problems with hypotension.
Afterwards, her oxygen saturations improved and no further diuresis was felt to be necessary.
# Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient developed acute hypoxia during her last admission on [**2184-11-15**] and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The regimen was modified several times during her hospitalization with the patient being discharged on Vancomycin, Flagyl and Cefepime to complete a full 14-day course (to be stopped on [**2184-11-30**]).
Given her clinical improvement and clear chest x-ray at the time of this admission, the antibiotics were stopped after approximately an 8-day course.
Will need outpatient f/u with neurosurg as previously planned.
# Type I Diabetes: Patient with long-standing diabetes as per above.
Her insulin regimen was modified as above.
Mycophenolate, and prednisone were continued per her home regimen.
# Hypertension: Patient's medications were adjusted during last admission as had problems with hypotension during admission.
Lisinopril dose was decreased from 10 mg to 5 mg. Labetalol was started at 200 mg PO TID.
Lasix 20 mg PO daily was discontinued.
We continued the lisinopril at 5 mg daily and labetalol at 200 mg three times daily.
