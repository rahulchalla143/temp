She required vasopressor support and was noted to have an obstructing left renal stone.
Urology was consulted and Infectious Disease was consulted and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed to facilitate urinary drainage.
The patient improved with antibiotics and was transferred to the floor to complete a 14 day course of IV Meropenem with Ertapenem to be used to complete course following discharge.
Although it was noted that without removal or the left renal stone the patient would be at risk for recurrent infections, the patient was felt to be at too high risk for surgical nephrolithotomy or extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
Therefore, the patient was discharged with percutaneous nephrostomy tube to be changed every 3 months and the patient will follow up in [**Hospital 159**] clinic.
