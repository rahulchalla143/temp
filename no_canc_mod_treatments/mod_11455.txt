Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Aortic stenosis--status post aortic valve replacement with    a 19 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tissue valve.
Coronary artery disease--status post coronary artery    bypass grafting x1 (saphenous vein graft to posterolateral    branch of right coronary artery); history of stents.
Bilateral pleural effusions--status post tube drainage.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Her aortic valve area was about 0.3 cm to 0.4 cm on her preoperative catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2189-2-18**], and on that same day underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm CE tissue valve, and also coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery.
Her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 102 minutes, and her crossclamp time was 82 minutes.
She had no    episodes of confusion or agitation, and had adequate pain    control with a combination of narcotic medications in the    initial postoperative period, followed by Tylenol and    ibuprofen as needed.
She did    well initially post extubation on postoperative day 1, but    by postoperative day 4, she began to have worsening oxygen    saturation with increased work of breathing, and was found    to be in mild respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia.
She was subsequently transferred to the    intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring and, in    fact, required BIPAP ventilation.
Her pleural effusions    were drained via insertion of pigtail catheters.
Her respiratory    status stabilized after insertion of these catheters, and    she began to improve subsequently after more aggressive    diuresis was started.
The drainage catheters were left in place for 2 weeks, but at that time there was only about 100 cc to 200 cc of fluid draining from these catheters and; therefore, it was determined that they should be removed.
She did not require reintubation postoperatively, and her respiratory acidosis did improve.
CARDIOVASCULAR: On postoperative day 0, the patient    experienced brief runs of nonsustained ventricular    tachycardia, at which time amiodarone was started, but    after the immediate postoperative period, these episodes    resolved.
Her congestive heart    failure was managed with aggressive diuresis and afterload    reduction with ACE inhibitors.
There was a question as to    whether her pleural effusions were secondary to congestive    heart failure from a problem with her aortic valve, for    which she underwent repeat echocardiography.
Her aortic valve mean gradient was    36 mm.
Her CHF, as noted, was    managed with a combination of beta blockers and ACE    inhibitors.
We added calcium channel blockers for some    time after consultation with congestive heart failure    service, but prior to her discharge it was felt that the    combination of beta blockade and ACE inhibitor alone would    be adequate for her control, along with diuretics.
She    never had any evidence of postoperative cardiac ischemia,    and her bypass graft seemed to be functioning well.
Prior to her discharge, as noted, she was in sinus rhythm on a stable dose of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor with amiodarone.
Her Coumadin was not restarted, as she had remained in sinus rhythm, and otherwise not reverted to atrial fibrillation, and also due to the fact that there was concern that there might be some risk of instability while walking, or falls while on anticoagulation.
Regarding her nutrition, the patient's albumin was 2.5, which may have contributed to some of her edema.
She was given nutritional supplementation with each meal to assist her in returning to appropriate nutritional status.
As    noted, her Coumadin was not restarted, given the fact that    she had been in sinus rhythm, and also while ambulating at    one point she had a fall where she did hit her head.
She    had no neurologic deficit, and otherwise no lacerations,    or subsequent consequence of the fall, but given the fact    that she may be at risk for this again, it was felt that    the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the benefits.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: During her hospitalization, the    patient had a urinary tract infection  for which she was    treated with Bactrim and levofloxacin.
It was felt that if she was hemodynamically stable with a stable respiratory status on her regimen of medications that she could be discharged to rehab in fair condition.
