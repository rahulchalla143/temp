Fetal decelerations were noted in an office visit on day of delivery, prompting admission and eventual c-section delivery.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Infant was begun on IVF of D10 as well as continued on enteral feeds following admission to th NICU.
Intermittent hypoglycemia with occasional Dstiks in the 30s and 40s persisted, however, despite advancement of calories and addition of polycose to enteral feeds, to maximum of enfamil 28 calories/oz.
Extensive laboratory evaluations were performed during hypoglycemic periods, with the results largely normal as follows:  - Blood gas normal x 2:  7.40/37, 7.39/32; - Initial lytes normal on [**12-26**]: 139/4.2/106/22, repeat on [**1-8**] with mild metabolic acidosis: 137/4.6/108/15 (not repeated); - Cortisol normal (9); - Growth hormone normal; - Insulin level appropriately low x3 (all values <2 uiu/mL); - Lactate mildly elevated x3:  3.6, 3.9, 4.4 mmol/L, last specimen arterial on [**1-8**]; - Pyruvate normal (0.36); - Ammonia normal (44 mmol/L); - Urine ketones negative x2; - Urine organic acids normal except for elevated 3-hydroxypropionic acid, thought to be insignificant; - Serum amino acid profile with several low values but overall thought to be normal; - Plasma acylcarnitine profile, normal; - Thyroid function tests, normal (TSH 3.8); - Newborn screen metabolic panel, normal x 2.
Formula composition was changed to E28 with 6 calories by enfamil powder and 2 cals by corn oil in an attempt to limit carbohydrates and increase fat intake, without notable improvement in blood sugar stability.
Increased irritability and discomfort with feeds was also noted during this time, and was thought to be due to reflux.
Infant was treated initially with zantac and reglan and subsequently with Enfamil AR with improvement in symptoms.
With persistent hypoglycemia, the diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was reconsidered despite the repeated low insulin levels.
Two additional tests were performed to assess insulin activity: a glucagon challenge, with a rise in blood sugar seen of approximately 30 following glucagon administration, and free fatty acid levels, found to be relatively low at 0.47 mmol/L during a period of hypoglycemia.
Both of these were thought to be suggestive of inappropriate insulin activity.
Due to these results, a trial of diazoxide therapy was started on [**1-10**].
No improvement in glycemic stability was seen, and the diazoxide was discontinued on [**1-15**].
The diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was thought to be unlikely, although it was thought that repeating the tests, including insulin level, glucagon challenge, and free fatty acids, might be valuable should hypoglycemia persist.
Thus, on [**1-17**], enteral feedings were changed to Enfamil AR 24 calories per oz, made with 2 cals/oz formula powder and 2 cals/oz corn oil.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The infant did develop moderate indirect hyperbilirubinemia, requiring several days of phototherapy with improvement.
The CBC was within normal limits, blood culture remained negative dates for 48 hours and infant was not started on antibiotic therapy.
Feeds at discharge is Enfamil-AR 24 cal's made with     Enfamil-AR 20 cal's with 2 cal's of Enfamil Powder and 2     cal's of corn oil with every three hour feedings.
Immunizations received.
The patient has received a     Hepatitis B vaccine on [**2171-12-23**].
Immunizations recommended.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in      the Fall for all infants once they have reached 6      months of age.
For this age and (for the first 24      months of the child's life) immunizations against      influenzae is recommended for household contacts and at-      home care givers.
Family will continue with the current feeding regimen, and will monitor blood sugars twice daily, pre-feeding.
