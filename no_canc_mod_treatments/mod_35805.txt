HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with a history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**], abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular stent graft in [**2165-2-2**] now being evaluated for total occlusion of right iliac limb graft.
On the day prior to admission the patient presented for CT angiogram, which revealed total occlusion of his right limb of his graft with collateral flow from contralateral iliac artery branches.
The patient subsequently had a guidewire passed through occluded right limb graft and then underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator.
Coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**].
Left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 and obtuse marginal one with subsequent cardiac catheterization [**2165-1-5**] demonstrating an occluded saphenous vein graft D1 graft with patent jump graft to obtuse marginal one.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular stent graft [**2165-2-2**].
Lipitor 10 q day.
Aspirin 81 q day.
Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
Zestril 40 q day.
Allopurinol 150 q day.
Peripheral vascular disease:  The patient was evaluated for presume occluded right limb graft of previous endovascular stent repair from [**2165-2-2**].
Transfer to the Coronary Care Unit overnight where tissue plasminogen activator infusion continued as well as heparin.
Subsequent relook angiography on [**12-20**] showed successful thrombolysis of the previously occluded right limb aortic stent graft with persistent and widely patent aortic stent graft.
The patient was subsequently placed on systemic heparin therapy times four days.
The patient subsequently underwent successful PTA and thrombectomy of his right posterior tibial artery.
Post intervention the patient was placed on anticoagulation and intravenous heparin later to Coumadin with goal INR change 2.3 to 3.
He was placed on aspirin and will be on life long Plavix.
He was subsequently bridged with Lovenox 80 mg q 12.
He was sent home on 5 mg of Coumadin q.h.s.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in several weeks time who will determine the duration of his Coumadin therapy likely four to six weeks.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was maintained on his preexisting cardiac regimen throughout his hospital course.
During his hospital course he was continued on aspirin, beta blocker and statin and ace inhibitor.
The patient was given intravenous fluids, atropine and responded appropriately.
Hematology:  The patient was treated with tissue plasminogen activator for occluded right limb graft as mentioned above.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells earlier during his hospital course for a decrease in hematocrit in the setting or recent tissue plasminogen activator.
He was anticoagulated with intravenous heparin and later to Coumadin.
He will be using Lovenox as bridging therapy for his Coumadin with goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
His Allopurinol dose was increased from 150 to 300 mg q day.
Peripheral vascular disease status post occluded right limb graft, status post successful localized tissue plasminogen activator thrombolysis complicated by right posterior tibial thrombus, status post successful thrombectomy and PTA.
Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
Lisinopril 40 mg q day.
Lipitor 10 q day.
Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
Plavix 75 mg q day.
Indocin 25 mg t.i.d.
Aspirin 81 q day.
Vitamin E 400 q day.
Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous q 12.
Allopurinol 300 mg q day.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
