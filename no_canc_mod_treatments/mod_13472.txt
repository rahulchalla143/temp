Initially was put on vanc/clinda however pt continued to be septic with WBC count trending upwards (17 on [**8-2**] to 33 on [**8-4**], day of transfer) and with spreading of his cellulitis, so his abx were changed to vanc/zosyn.
He was seen by surgery at the OSH who felt that he likely did not have nec fasc and recommended adding IV diflucan.
He became increasingly toxic overnight and was transferred to the MICU for dropping pressures in the setting of afib with RVR.

Upon admission, he was found to be hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.
CV: At admission, his pressures did drop and upon transfer to the MICU on [**8-5**] he required three pressors to maintain his BP.
His rhythm at this point was afib; he was started on an amiodarone drip.
He remained on pressors post-operatively, but they were able to be significantly weaned.
He was weaned off the amiodarone drip on POD 1 and remained in sinus rhythm.
He was weaned off pressors and remained in sinus rhythm.
He was kept intubated postoperatively initially due to the need to return to the OR for washout.
However he did continue to require high PEEP, and attempts to wean off the ventilator were unsuccessful.
At time of discharge patient with stable 02 saturations on trach collar at 40% FiO2  GI: The patient was initially kept NPO with IVF.
On [**2183-8-9**] he was started on tube feeds via NGT.
Patient was tolerating tube feeds at goal at time of discharge and was advanced to a soft solid diet with trach cuff inflated while taking po intake.
GU: Urine output was monitored with a foley catheter.
He was started on vanc/zosyn/clinda/flagyl for broad spectrum coverage and ID was consulted.
His antibiotics were narrowed to vanc/zosyn/clinda.
Patient was continued on antibiotics until time of discharge and was discharged without antibiotics, afebrile with stable WBC.
Patient was discharged to Rehabilitation facility with trach collar, tolerating tube feeds at goal with a soft diet and vac in place.
Vac will be changed every 3 days tube feeds will be managed by the rehab facility pending po intake requirements.
