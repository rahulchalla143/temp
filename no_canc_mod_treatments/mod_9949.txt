No HA, URI sxs, cough, sore throat, chest pain, SOB, orthopnea, PND, dysuria, hesitancy, urgency.
Past Medical History: # Primary sclerosing cholangitis - s/p CBD excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
Biliary drain placement in [**11-27**] with biopsies that revealed fibrosis, but no evidence of a tumor.
Replacement of his biliary tube x 1 in [**2-25**].
Abd: diffusely jaundiced, soft, +BS, very tender to palpation in lower quadrant diffusely, not tender around catheter drainage site, dressing in place and clean and dry, no rebound or guarding, no ascites extr: warm well perfused, 2+ dp pulses, no cyanosis, no LE edema.
Replacement of an 8 French external-internal biliary drain with a 10 French external-internal biliary drain which was capped.
[**Name (NI) 44264**] PTC drain extending from stably dilated left-sided intrahepatic ducts into the proximal duodenum.
[**4-11**] CXR: Moderate-sized right pneumothorax.
Interval decrease in size of appendix and reduction of free pelvic fluid.
[**Name (NI) 44264**] PTC drain in an unchanged position, with stable intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
[**4-12**] Chest tube placement CXR: Moderate-to-large right hydropneumothorax, increased in size following chest tube replacement.
[**4-12**] Pleural drain placement CXR: After placement of pleural drain, there is now a combination of moderate right pneumothorax with layering pleural effusion or hemothorax.
The tip of the right apical pleural tube projects over a triangular lucent area, which is probably residual pleural space containing air, although hyperlucency in aerated lung apex distal to a row of suture could give exactly the same appearance.
There is minimal filling of side branches in the left lobe and this raises the likelihood of progression of the PSC with significant obstruction to many more intrahepatic ducts, Clinical correlation recommended to decide if additional duct drainage should be attempted.
Free passage of contrast was noted through the biliary/enteric anastomosis without evidence for biliary leakage.
Replacement of the 10 French external-internal biliary drain with a 10 French external-internal biliary drain, which was capped .
[**4-12**] RUL wedge resection specimen: Emphysema with bleb formation and subpleural fibrosis.
He was started on empiric Unasyn and maintained on his outpatient Colazal and metronidazole.
He continued to spike fevers and was subsequently started on Zosyn to increase gram negative coverage to cover Pseudomonas, and oral vancomycin for the possibility of C. diff resistant to Flagyl.
He was also kept NPO for bowel rest.
It was decided to give him a trial off ursodiol to see if this may be contributing to his diarrhea.
He completed a course of ciprofloxacin and was discharged on no antibiotics.
His pneumothorax was increasing on chest x-ray.
A chest tube was placed by Thoracic Surgery.
He was taken for VATS with blebectomy and pleurodesis on [**4-12**].
His chest tube was discontinued on [**4-18**] after it stopped draining.
# PSC:  He is s/p biliary drain placement, found to be functioning well without leak.
He was continued on his ursodiol initally.
Eventually the T bili began to rise again as well, and he underwent a second cholangiogram with replacement of the biliary stent.
# Ulcerative Colitis: He was initially continued on colazol and flagyl at his outpatient doses.
The flagyl was then discontinued after a long course.
No acute UC was found, only chronic inflammation, pan-colonic diverticulosis, and esophageal varices.
He was continued on his outpatient propranolol and rifaximin.
He was treated with daily vitamin K, and discharged on every other day vitamin K. .
He was later able to advance his diet to solids with supplemental shakes.
# Ppx: He was on a PPI while not eating, and heparin SQ while not ambulating.
