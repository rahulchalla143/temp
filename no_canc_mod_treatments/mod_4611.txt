700cc of fluid was suctioned from his throat and there was concern that he was not protecting his airway therefore he was intubated.
BPs stayed low despite 4 liters of fluid so a right subclavian line was placed and he was started on phenylephrine.
Surgery evaluated the patient in the ED and felt no surgery was indicated at this time.
Flexiseal was placed to contain copious liquid stool.
He received a dose of Vancomycin and Zosyn prior to transfer.

3. diffuse SB thickening (beginning in prox jejunum) as well as distal colonic wall thickening - near target sign - no signif bowel dilation- target sign suggests acute inflammation or ischemia - vessels appear patent - no free fluid in abd/pelvis may relfect enteroclitis.
4 -large rectal fecal load with rectal tube in palce.
Lactate elevated to 5.8 on admission, required large volume fluid resuscitation and pressors to maintain adequate MAPs.
He was started empirically on Vanc/Zosyn in ED, then switched to vancomycin (IV and PO), cefepime and flaygl for possible infectious causes.
Lactate trended down with fluids and pressors were weaned off by hospital day 2. .
He was seen by surgery on admission to evaluate for possible mesenteric ischemia, but it was felt that he was not imminently in need of surgery nor was he a good candidate for surgery.
PO vanco and IV flagyl, cefepime were started empirically, and stool was sent for C diff, O&P and cultures (all were negative).
Aspirin was held and GI was consulted, who felt that this delayed hematochezia was consistent with intestinal ischemia, perhaps due to infectious enteritis causing profound volume depletion and low flow state.
They recommended continuing IV cefepime and flagyl for a 8 day course (day 1 [**8-17**]), and PO vancomycin was DC'd after c diff cultures were negative.
CT chest shows area of consolidation in LLL concerning for necrotizing PNA vs aspiration, so he was started on vancomycin cefepime.
He did continue to have copious amounts of sputum that he had trouble clearing and required frequent suctioning.
He appeared to be having further aspiration events, so speech and swallow recommended keeping him NPO with tube feeds.
He should continue the vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HCAP vs aspiration pneumonia until [**8-25**] for a 8 day course.
A right-sided PICC was placed on [**8-21**] for continuing IV abx therapy at rehab.
His mental status improved throughout his hospital stay with treatment of his other active issues.
Cr returned to [**Location 213**] of 0.9 after aggressive fluid repletion.
He was then gently diuresed with lasix following return of kidney function to bring him back to euvolemia.
Lisinopril initally held due to [**Last Name (un) **], however was restarted on hospital day 5. .
# Hypertension:  Initially held home lisinopril due to [**Last Name (un) **], however this was restarted on [**8-21**] prior to discharge.
# Decubitus Ulcer of Coccyx: Seen by wound care nurse, frequent turning, and dressing changes daily.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Echo reported preserved systolic function.
Given small amounts of lasix for help with diuresis following large volume resuscitation for shock.
TRANSFER OF CARE ISSUES: - Abx:  continue IV vanco, cefepime and flagyl until [**8-25**] - GI bleed/diarrhea:  if further work of hematochezia/diarrhea is desired, consider repeat CT scan of abdomen in [**1-10**] weeks to ensure resolution - Aspiration/secretions:  monitor swallowing ability and advance diet as tolerated.
In the meantime, continue tubefeeds w Fibersource HN w goal rate 60ml/hr - RUE swelling:  Venous duplex ultrasound showed no clot.
Keep elevated and monitor - Aspirin: held in setting of GI bleeding, can restart in 1 week ([**8-28**])  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg Daily Omeprazole 20mg PO Daily Senna PO Daily Sinemet 25/100mg half tablet TID Lisinopril 2.5mg PO Daily Ergocalciferol 50,000units Q3weeks Tramadol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] plus Q4h PRN Tylenol 650mg PO Q6h PRN Dulcolax Suppository 10mg Daily PRN   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

We thought that it was a from of infection nad not even blood flow, so you were given antibiotics and fluids to help your blood flow.
Over time, your blood pressure normalized and the breathing tube was removed so that you could breath on your own.
