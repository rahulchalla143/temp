She is currently beginning to take feedings by [**Known lastname **] and is doing so very taking approximately half of her bottle volume when offered the bottle which is about twice per day.
She was transfused at this point secondary to having had multiple blood draws for blood cultures and drug levels given her prolonged antibiotic therapy course.

She has been Oxacillin throughout and currently on the day of transfer is on day 27 of 42 of Oxacillin therapy for right tibial osteomyelitis.
She has a Broviac placed in her left chest which is in the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.
During this time a blood culture was sent both from her Broviac as well as peripherally and Vancomycin and Gentamicin were started in addition to the Oxacillin.

We used this value in conjunction with a negative blood culture to discontinue her Vancomycin and Gentamicin each time after 48 hours of blood negative cultures.
