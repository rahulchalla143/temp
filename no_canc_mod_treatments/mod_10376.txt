Had IVC filter placed on [**12-9**] in setting of Afib and not able to anticoagulate d/t bleed.
While in the SICU the patient has had intermittent episodes of hypotension supported by fluids, blood, and neosynephrine ([**Date range (1) 35685**]), felt to be d/t blood loss vs. sepsis.
Also with repeated episodes of A fib, the first treated with diltiazem gtt, the second amiodarone load, and the third repeat amiodarone load.
Of note, the patient first became febrile to 101.5 on [**12-11**] and ppx cefazolin was changed to vanc/levo/flagyl and PICC and swan pulled.

Currently the patient is intubated and sedated and unable to answer ROS questions.

The tip of an enterostomy or gastrostomy tube projects over the left paramedian abdomen and appears to cannulate either a loop of bowel or a length of tubing, which is directed superiorly projecting over a collection of air above the diaphragm presumably in the thoracic portion of a gastric hiatus hernia.
As I discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], I am unfamiliar with any such appliance, and it is important to review these radiographs with the surgical team in light of their description of patient's abdominal procedure yesterday.
Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.
Right internal jugular line tip projects over the upper right atrium.
A caval umbrella filter projects over the inferior vena cava, close to the level of the renal veins.
Gastrostomy tube is seen adjacent to the anterior wall of the stomach.
There is a discrepancy in gastric wall thickness covering the gastrostomy tube retainer compared to the thickness of the gastric wall elsewhere.
While this is most likely located within the stomach, with thinning of the anterior aspect of the gastric wall due to tethering by the gastrostomy tube, location of the PEG tube retainer within the gastric wall cannot be completely excluded.
Consultation with the surgery service who placed the tube should be performed prior to using the tube for tube feeds.
Tracheostomy tube cuff appears slightly hyperinflated.
L2 compression deformity, as described on prior [**2104-12-27**] MRI.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2404**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

She was taken to the OR again the following day, [**2104-12-9**], with exploration of right hip wound, removal of surgical packs, irrigation and closure of wound.
At times during diuresis with Lasix, she became hypotensive with SBP in 70s, requiring levophed to help with further diuresis.
She continued to require ventilator support due to pleural effusions and muscular weakness (ICU myopathy).
She is on Vancomycin currently for a 2 week course (start date [**1-2**]).
If her level is still >15, then her Vancomycin 750 mg q 24 hr dosing will need to be adjusted.
The pt was also treated with 1 week of meropenem whichw as discontinued at the time of discharge due to no gram negative growth in any culture.
Continue diuresis as able.
She was treated with 2 weeks of Vancomycin and meropenem at that time.
Her blood pressures remained borderline and she intermittently required levophed and 250 cc IV fluid boluses while being diuresed.
On [**1-2**], the pt spiked a temp and again had an increased WBC and was restarted on Vanc/Meropenem for presumed VAP and possible sepsis (had increased resp.
She remains on amiodarone and coumadin.
Her coumadin was restarted after trach, so INR will need to be monitored.
The pt was started on digoxin for her CHF.
She was also diuresed with IV Lasix as per above until she was overall negative in her fluid balance.
She was started on po lasix 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.
She was also started on low dose metoprolol.
#FEN:  PEG was placed on [**2105-1-6**] by general surgery.
Pneumoperitoneum on xray reads is expected s/p PEG placement.
Surgery felt the PEG was in proper position without complication (after CT of the abdomen was performed), so tube feeds were initiated in the pt without difficulty.
