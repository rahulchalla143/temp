You had a temporary pace maker placed and were monitored in the cardic intensive care unit.
You then had a procedure to put in a new pacemaker and take out both the old pacemaker (but not the old wires), and the temporary pacemaker.
As for follow up apointments, you should get blood work done on Monday to check your INR which tells us whether to adjust your Coumadin dose.
