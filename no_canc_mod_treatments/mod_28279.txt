HYPOTENSION: Initially BP stabilized after NS and PRBCs, but intermittently became hypotensive during the begining of his hospital stay thought to be related to sepsis.
Continued to be hypotensive during CVVH only, but later was able to maintain his BP during HD sessions as time went on.
Blood pressure meds should be held on his HD days for more effective ultrafiltration.
He was able to tolerate small doses of hydralzyine 10 q 6 hours (holding for sbp than 90) and was recently started on toprol 12.5 mg qd.
He has been aggressively dialyzed and bp meds should be held during hd days.
Percutaneous gallbladder drain placed by IR on Febuary 3 & drained well, and initially covered on levo/flagyl/amp.
IR study showed good drainage contrast into duodenum, so drain was clamped and LFT's/AlkP were followed with the surgery team.
After the labs remained stable, this drain was pulled.
Remained afebrile without abdominal pain after his course of antibiotics was completed.
Initially on levo/flagyl/amp and vanco for empiric coverage for cholecystitis, pneumonia, and skin flora.
He later was treated for 2 full courses Vanc and Meropenem for PNA which was completed on [**3-6**].
Sputum grew MRSA and he was started on a 10 day course of vancomycin for MRSA tracheobronchitis.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: With his worsening respiratory difficult a trach was re-placed at the site of his prior trach site and he was vented as tolerated in the setting of CHF and PNA.
He was gradually weaned off the vent with removal of fluid through hemodialysis / ultrafiltration and treatment of his pneumonias.
Digoxin was held for serum level 2.2 and evidence of dig toxicity on EKG (accelerated junctional rhythm).
He required two doses of digibind before his rhythm improved.
His bioprosthetic aortic valve was noted to be well seated.
He has improved with aggressive ultrafiltration as alluded to above but still requires ultrafiltration at least 3 days per week.
Hydralzyine was started in hopes of providing afterload reduction for improved forward flow - given his marginal pressures, he does not have much room to titrate up.
In consultation with cardiology and given his atrial fibrillation, he was restarted on digoxin.
Finally, he was started on low dose beta-blocker, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] to help w/ ventricular remodeling.
He later became anuric, and underwent CVVH for fluid removal.
A tunned HD line was placed by renal, and he later tolerated full HD sessions without difficulty.
He continues to require hemodialysis and hasn't made any signs of renal recovery.
Nephrology feels that he may regain his renal function and have recommended that he not be placed on an ACEI.
It was presumed he was on coumadin for AVR & Afib.
Coumadin was stopped and was not be restarted during his stay.
GI was consulted who recommended an outpatient coloscopy.
He required two rounds of digibind before this resolved and dig was discontinued.
He was started on IV amiodarone (load) and was tolerating PO amio but maintained in atrial fibrillation.
Later in his hospitalization, cardiology (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**]) was reconsulted regarding the utility of continuing amiodarone in the setting of likely chronic afib w/ enlarged atria, chf, and respiratory failure (making conversion to SR unlikely).
It was recommended to d/c amiodarone and to restart his digoxin at a low dose 0.625 qod while checking dig levels frequently to keep his dig level <1.5.
Subsequent rate control will be through beta-blockade, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
His rates have generally been well controlled although occasionally noted to be in low 100's during HD and during pain.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initiated on metoprolol for CHF and rate control.
He was s/p CABG 1 month ago prior to admission w/ bioprosthetic aortic valve placed during [**11-30**].
He was continued on an ASA and statin.
GIB/ANTICOAGULATION: he was restarted on Coumadin and then began to have bright red blood per rectum, and hypotension in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Coumadin was stopped, vitamin K IV, FFP, and PRBCs administered.
It was questioned what his true need for Coumadin is since he has a bioprosthetic valve with Afib.
After his GIB is was felt that Coumadin should be held during this hospitalization, and that he should continue an ASA and re-address risks of Coumadin after discharge.
He has no further bleeding during the last [**1-29**] weeks of hospitlization and no further transfusion requirements.
We have been increasing his fentanyl patch and using morphine IV for breakthrough pain.
Zinc and vitamin C were given orally daily.
His fentanyl patch was increased to 200mcg/hr on [**3-17**].
It will be important to titrate this medication upwards but mindful not to avoid oversedation.
Diabetes: He was maintained on sliding scale insulin and Lantus 10.
Given chronic tube feeds, this dose may be titrated according to sliding scale measurements.
As such, he should continue on current tube feeding recommendations.
Only one port is flushing at this point but not clear that pt requires a great deal of IV medications so this will suffice.
GOALS OF CARE: it was addressed several times about the goals of care, and the family repeatedly insisted that all aggressive measures should be taken.
