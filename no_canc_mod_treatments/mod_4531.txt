He was thought to be coagulopathic due to his unmonitored use of plavix, aspirin, and coumadin for his left ventricular wall motion abnormalities.
His INR improved with administration of vitamin K and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.
He also received 4 units of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 21.
His coumadin, aspirin, plavix, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor were discontinued.
Placed on a twice daily PPI, he stabilized quickly and once his coagulopathy resolved, he required only one additional transfusion of packed red blood cells.
His plavix and aspirin were restarted once his hematocrit had been stable for 2 days.
He had been doing well until a few days ago when he noticed the onset of intermittent chest pain, mostly at rest.
At admission, he was on aspirin, plavix, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta blocker.
The ACE inhibitor was held until his kidney function normalized.
If his renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuing ACE inhibitor.
For this reason, he had been placed on coumadin during his previous hospitalization.
In addition to aggressive diuresis to avoid volume overload, he received at least 8 units of blood products for his GIB and to prevent further myocardial ischemia.
He was emergently intubated for flash pulmonary edema and upon introducing the endotracheal tube, large quantities of foamy red secretions emerged.
The patient was restarted on coumadin, however, given his past medical history, he may not be a candidate for coumadin therapy.
Please verify with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] whether to send the patient home on Coumadin prior to discharge form rehabilitation hospital.
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed and norepinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine drips were started.
His pulmonary artery catheter revealed pressures consistent with volume overload and cardiogenic shock (CVP 18, RA 15, RV 58/20, PA 58/27/40, PCWP 24).
The patient's cardiac markers were cycled and were consistent with new ischemia, although a later transthoracic echo was unchanged.
The dobutamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine were turned off.
Neosynephrine was started and a liter of normal saline was bolused with improvement in the BP to the 90's and 100's.
Concomittently, electrical cardioversion with 100 then 200 joules was initiated, whereupon sinus rhythm was recovered.
Once off pressors, beta blockade was initiated to rate control the patient.
Respiratory Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed flash pulmonary edema in the setting of receiving several units of blood and fresh frozen plasma.
He was emergently intubated and sedated.
He remained on the ventilator until his cardiogenic shock was resolved and then was weaned.
He did well until he became febrile and developed the onset of increasing secretions and oxygen desaturations.
His endotracheal secretions grew out serratia and he responded well to piperacillin/ tazobactam.
Once the patient produced fewere secretions and his ventilator requirements decreased, he was successfully extubated.
His ACE inhibitor had been started during his previous hospitalization in [**Month (only) 216**] and likely contributed to the increase in the creatinine.
Both his ACE inhibitor and the lithium were held until his renal failure resolved.
He also briefly became hypernatremic, which was thought to be due to increased insensible losses during his febrile state (ventilatory associated pneumonia) vs RTA and resolved with free water boluses and administration of IV D5W.
In the interest of preserving his renal function, his lithium was discontinued and other medications were initiated.
