Sepsis: The pt was initially empirically treated with Ceftriaxone for a presumed SBP, along with Vancomycin and Flagyl to cover possible secondary SBP and/or cholangitis.
Because the WBC decline was not as substantial as anticipated on Levofloxcin, Flagyl and Vancomycin were continued.
She was given a course of sepsis dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days.
Flagyl was stopped on [**9-26**].
Levofloxacin will be continued for a total of 14 days from the start and she will be placed on Cipro 500 qd for SBP ppx.
On HD1, after aggressive fluid ressucitation and receiving blood products, she became increasingly hypoxic secondary to pulmonary edema, and required increased PEEP's to 10 for adequate oxygenation.
On HD3 she was requiring minimal pressure support and PEEP, and was successfully extubated.
Lasix was held pts ARF resolved, with Cr returning to 1.0 and brisk UOP daily.
She received an albumin infusion on HD 1 and 3 per SBP protocol to prevent hepatorenal syndrome sequelae.
Given that she was NPO for several days, this was thought to be secondary to malnutrition, and she was given Vit K. However, the patient had repeated doses of vitamin K over a few days and her INR failed to respond.
For her extravascular volume overload, her aldactone was restarted and she was discharged on her home dose of Lasix - 40 po qd.
HCT decreased progressively to 19 on HD2 with guaiac + stools and NG lavage with blood clots.
Protonix continuous infusion was started for GI protection.
Stress dose steroids were started in setting of sepsis in place of budesonide for total of 7 days.
The patient was tapered to 10mg of prednisone and will continue on this.
Allergies/Pruritis: Cetirizine, hydroxyzine as needed  11.
She was started on Lopressor 25 PO TID with good response.
After receiving aggressive fluids, albumin, blood and platelets, she became volume overloaded with pulmonary congestion and subsequent hypoxemia.
