She was intubated for airway protection (ABG 7.02/23/69), sugar >1000, SBP 100/83, HR 87.
A femoral line was attempted but resulted in a femoral stick.
In the ED, she was also given calcium gluconate, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone.
Her DM is complicated by peripheral neuropathy, proliferative retinopathy (left eye blindness), and nephropathy.
History of osteomyelitis, status post left transmetatarsal amputation.

A [**Last Name (un) **]/orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of endotracheal tube, which should be retracted a few centimeters.

/nkg  ******** Micro: Blood cultures X 4 NGTD Urine cultures X 2 negative  Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo female with long-standing DM type 1 with triopathy, admitted with DKA of unclear precipitant and profound metabolic dissaray.
She was started on a regular insulin drip (required as much as 20 units per hour), and aggressively hydrated with close monitoring of her electrolytes, with eventual closure of the gap.
She was transitionned to subcutaneous insulin on [**7-2**] with NPH, then Lantus at out-patient dose with Novolog sliding scale.
Of note, Lantus was recently decreased to 12 units QHS on [**6-20**], resumed at 14 units QHS in hospital with Novolog sliding scale as above, with good glycemic control.
She was given Levo/Vanco and Flagyl in the ED, not continued in the MICU.
2) Hypotension: As noted above, her blood pressure dropped in the ED following intubation, and she was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support.
Her hypotension was most likely [**2-20**] hypovolemia, exacerbated by sedative medications peri-intubation.
She was restarted on ASA, Metoprolol and statin, then Nifedipine.
5) ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine in 2s.
She was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs, with appropriate response, and was placed on Protonix [**Hospital1 **].
8) Hypernatremia: Patient with corrected sodium >150 in the setting of DKA and volume depletion.
Her central line was kept in place given inability to obtain alternative peripheral access, finally removed on [**7-5**].
