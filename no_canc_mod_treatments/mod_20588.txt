It was determined that a pacemaker was not currently indicated and recommended avoidance of the coughilator machine and to not agressively deep suction Mr. [**Known lastname 56636**].
On admission, the patient was found to have a UTI which was treated with 3 days of Levofloxacin 500mg.
For this, completed an 8day course of intravenous ceftazadime and flagyl, as well as 5 days of intravenous vancomycin.
Heparin and then lovenox was given until he was therapeutic on coumadin.
His INR has been stable at 2.2-2.3 on coumadin 5mg po qhs.
On [**2154-9-19**], he had a fever spike which was attributed to his pneumovax and flu vaccines given [**9-18**].
For his respiratory failure, Mr. [**Known lastname 56636**] was continued on mechanical ventilation.
By [**2154-9-17**], he was tolerating extended periods of pressure support ventilation with short periods on trach collar.
For his quadraplegia, during a previous admission (on [**2154-8-26**]) the patient had a vertebral fusion of C1-C7 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] of Neurosurgery.
Mr. [**Known lastname 56636**] was admitted wearing a cervical collar which was continued.
We confirmed with Neurosurgery that he would need to continue wearing a cervical collar for 12 weeks post surgery which means it can be discontinued in mid-[**Month (only) **].
For pain, the patient was continued on gabapentin, methadone 15mg tid and dilauded q2 prn.
For the patient's anemia, ferrous sulfate was continued as he has a history of anemia.
For anxiety, which was mostly related to his respiratory status, klonopin was continued.
Because it gave him too much sedation, he asked that it be discontinued on [**9-20**] and replaced with ativan prn.
Access was obtained with two periperhal IV's, his PEG, his tracheostomy and a foley catheter.
Mr. [**Known lastname 56636**] was given continuous tube feeds at 80cc/hr.
Once he uses pressure support or trach collar more regularly, he will likely tolerate some of a PO diet.
For prophylaxis, he was started on heparin drip followed by lovenox 70 subcutaneous twice a day.
These were all replaced with coumadine once he was therapeutic.
In addition, prior to discharge, the received the pneumovax (right deltoid) and influenza vaccine (left deltoid)on [**2154-9-18**].
