Unclear whether she was evaluated as inpatient by CT surgery but was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] as outpatient re need for open AVR vs TAVI.
She received IV lasix 20mg x1.
After further diuresis her O2sats improved to 94% on 3L.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment and surgical evaluation.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: off-pump CABG x 2: Saphenous vein grafted to LAD and saphenous vein graft to PDA -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: PCI and stentx3 (?BMS) to RCA ([**2145**]) PTCA to LAD ([**2138**]) Aortic stenosis Carotid stenosis status post right carotid endarterectomy [**2137**] Chronic kidney disease (unknown baseline Creat) Left subclavian steal syndrome Glaucoma Sleep apnea (no longer uses CPAP)  Past surgical history: Tonsillectomy, Left ankle repair, Right carpal tunnel release, Total abdominal hysterectomy, Laser eye surgery, CABG as above   Social History: Non-smoker, rare brandy, no drugs.
Brother passed away from GI bleed and PUD and another with liver cirrhosis.
surgical scar s/p right endartrectomy CARDIAC: s/p CABG, RRR, 4/6 systolic crescendo murmur loudest at LUSB radiating to carotids, No r/g.
ABDOMEN: Hysterectomy scar, abd is Soft, non-tender, non-distended.
EKG: Sinus rhythm, LVH, 1-2mm ST depressions in I, II  TTE [**2156-8-16**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Median sternotomy wires are unchanged.
She was initially requiring BiPAP to maintain O2sats >90%, but this improved and by discharge she was maintaining O2 sats >90% on NC at 15L/min, with occasional episodes of SOB requiring face mask.
She was continued on her home BP meds to reduce afterload, with her metoprolol tartrate increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone.
She was also treated with IV morphine to increase pulmonary venodilation and improve her sensation of dyspnea.
This was later changed to IV dilaudid due to concern for poor clearance in setting of renal failure.
She was then considered for TAVI, but there was concern that she may not be a candidate for the procedure given her known atherosclerosis of femoral vessels and h/o difficult access for cardiac cath.
Review of her echo demonstrated that her MR was more significant than AS and she would likely get little benefit from intervention on her aortic valve.
Patient clearly expressed her wishes to not pursue further invasive treatments and to focus on her comfort at a hospice facility.
The following day, however, she appeared to be very uncomfortable and it was thought that interventions at hospice may not be enough to keep her breathing more comfortably.
She was initially continued on aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, atorvastatin and clopidrogel.
Patient was started on CVVH on HD3 and tolerated this well.
On HD5 CVVH was held when her dialysis line malfunctioned and renal function did not improve.
She did respond to bolus doses of 200 mg IV lasix and metolazone with some improvement in respiratory status.
The renal service discussed the possibility of resuming dialysis with the patient, but she elected not to continue as she did not want to be on dialysis long-term.
# Hypertension: BP stable on home amlodipine, and metoprolol.
Imdur dose modified as described above.
These meds were continued after goals of care transitioned to CMO in hopes of improving patient's respiratory status.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Atorvastatin was initially continued throughout hospitalization but discontinued on changing goals of care to CMO.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient's blood sugar was well controlled throughout admission on home lantus and insulin sliding scale.
She was contined on ISS in hopes that glucose control would improve her mental status and quality of life.
