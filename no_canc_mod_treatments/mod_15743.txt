She was subsequently taken on that same day for debridement in the Operating Room and underwent subsequent serial debridements on [**3-14**] and 22nd.
She remained intubated postoperatively after this and a repeat CT scan on the 23rd showed persistent peritoneal gas; therefore, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
When she arrived at [**Hospital1 69**] her T-max was 100.1 degrees; otherwise, patient was intubated and her heart rate was in the 70's to 80's with a systolic pressure from the 100's to 140's and, as noted, patient was intubated.
Otherwise, her electrolytes were notable for potassium of 4.7, BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the nature of the patient's extensive infection, it was determined that she needed to be taken to the Operating Room somewhat urgently for surgical debridement of this deep seated infection.
As noted on [**2139-3-17**], patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
A ventral and umbilical hernia were found which were both reduced and repaired primarily and sigmoid colostomy was created.
Also a G-tube and J-tube were placed along with the extensive debridement of the necrotic tissue.
The patient tolerated the procedure and there was no note of excessive blood loss.
She remained intubated in the Operating Room and was subsequently taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
Otherwise, aside from standard sedation when the patient was intubated and postoperative pain control with narcotics, the patient really had no neurologic issues.
It was felt that her prolonged weaning may have been secondary to the severity of her infection and it was not until postoperative day five the patient was actually taken off pressure support and changed over to CPAP although she did remain on CPAP for some time up until postoperative day eight when she again required some additional pressure support which she stayed on until postoperative day 11 at which time again she was converted back to CPAP.
By postoperative day 13 the patient was actually off any additional support which had been keeping her in the Intensive Care Unit.
She was otherwise maintained on beta blockade and by the time of discharge was doing well on a course of Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o.
She was given Protonix during her hospitalization as ulcer prophylaxis.
The J-tube that was placed for tube feeds intraoperatively was removed three days prior to patient's discharge.
In terms of patient's fluid, electrolytes and nutrition status, electrolytes were repleted as needed but, notably, in terms of her nutritional status given the knowledge the patient would require excellent nutritional support postoperatively, she did have a feeding jejunostomy placed.
She was actually on total parenteral nutrition postoperatively and also subsequently given Impact tube feeds.
intake we were able to stop the TPN and tube feeds and patient was able to meet her caloric requirements.
We did keep the Foley catheter in place in order to keep the wound relatively clean.
From a hematologic standpoint, patient did require blood transfusion on postoperative day two of two units given low hematocrit and her history of coronary artery disease.
Otherwise, she was on heparin subcu and Venodyne's for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and there was never any evidence of deep venous thrombosis during the course of her hospitalization.
From the outside hospital their cultures were noted to grow Clostridium perphringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
When she was at the outside hospital she was on vancomycin, levofloxacin and clindamycin.
The choice of this was also noted based on her allergies to a number of medications which include Demerol, Keflex, Valium, phenobarbital, Flagyl and meperidine, as per the patient.
Further subsequent characterization was not carried out.
Given the extent of patient's infection and species as noted, patient's broad spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, Pen-G and clindamycin were carried on as per Infectious Disease recommendations.
She continued this course from postoperative day one up until postoperative day ten at which time vancomycin was added for the following combination of vancomycin, clindamycin, Pen-G and levofloxacin.
In terms of management of her infected wound, initially after the debridement the wound was again cared for aggressively with dressing changes.
Plastic Surgery recommended Dakin's solution which was carried out for some time though prior to discharge she was back to normal saline wet-to-dry dressing changes with irrigation of the drain placed in order to irrigate any sort of purulent material.
There was question as to whether a Vac would be appropriate for the patient but after extensive consultation with Plastic Surgery, their recommendation was to continue with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
Once the patient had stabilized in the Intensive Care Unit and had transferred to the floor, the Infectious Disease recommendations were to continue on vancomycin, levofloxacin and Zosyn in terms of antibiotic coverage.
She did have a PICC line placed for the intravenous antibiotics.
