Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Insulin regular 8 units b.i.d.
and NPH 30 units in the morning, 20 units in the evening.
Metformin 1,000 mg q.a.m.
Diltiazem 360 mg q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was subsequently referred to Cardiac Surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on [**2142-11-20**].
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary artery and reversed saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the obtuse marginal coronary artery.
The patient was transferred in stable condition to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on propofol and milrinone.
The patient also had decreased urine output and a blood pressure of 65 for which he was administered 2 mg of Neo-Synephrine and administered Lasix for the decreased urine output.
The patient was still on Neo-Synephrine at 1 and milrinone.
Renal came by to see the patient for the patient's decreased urine output, at which time they recommended to increase the intravascular volume and increase the patient's blood pressure by transfusing [**11-29**] units of packed red blood cells and starting Epogen 5,000 t.i.w.
They did not feel that there was any indication for dialysis that day but it may be an issue in the next few days.
They also recommended to continue the Neo-Synephrine drip with a goal blood pressure of 130-140.
They recommended to hold off on diuretics for now as the CVP and PADs are low.
They thought that the metabolic acidosis was secondary to acute renal failure and, therefore, to administer the bicarbonate as suggested earlier.
On postoperative day number two, 24-hour events included administering 2 units of packed red blood cells as well as administrating bicarbonate.
The patient was still with variable urine output and acidosis.
They did not feel that there was the need for hemodialysis at that time.
However, they stated that they would continue to monitor for hemodialysis potential.
They also felt that since his blood pressure was improved, Lasix could be administered 100 mg IV in order to increase diuresis.
They also recommended to avoid magnesium and potassium and to give Amphojel 30 cc q.o.d.
Renal came by to see the patient again, at which time they recommended to transfusing to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30, continue Amphojel at 30 cc p.o.
The patient underwent hemodialysis after a Quinton catheter was placed on [**2142-11-23**].
The patient underwent hemodialysis that day which he tolerated with a blood pressure around 140-150.
with meals and snacks for hyperphosphatemia and the patient received Epogen yesterday for his mild anemia.
They wanted the goal to remove 3 kilograms today during hemodialysis and to check the phosphorus and if it is less than 5, they will be discontinuing the Amphojel and during hemodialysis which was planned to be performed that day they will be administering 5,000 of Epogen.
They recommended to check the patient's calcium and phosphorus and to avoid NSAIDs, to use Lactulose for constipation and to avoid magnesium-containing compounds due to his renal failure.
The plan was for the patient to undergo hemodialysis that day.
The patient did undergo hemodialysis with the plan to undergo hemodialysis for three hours.
They recommended to repeat a stat potassium and if the potassium was better to hold off on hemodialysis with the potassium being 5.0 with slight hemolysis that day.
They also recommended to elevate the legs as much as possible and to continue aluminum hydroxide until the phosphorus is less than 5.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Insulin NPH 30 units q.a.m., 20 units q.p.m.
Insulin regular 8 units q.a.m., 8 units q.p.m.
Ferrous gluconate 300 mg p.o.
Epogen 4,000 units subcutaneously two times per week, [**Year (4 digits) 766**] and Thursday.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient to have drawn a CBC, Chem-7, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2142-12-3**], with the results to be sent to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 47285**] at [**Hospital6 **] with the patient checking daily weights and daily blood pressures.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three on [**2142-11-20**].
