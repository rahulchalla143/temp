For refractory hypertension and fluid overload on chest x-ray, he was started on nitroglycerin gtt, which was turned off after blood pressure improved.
For hyperkalemia, ECG was unchanged and he received calcium gluconate 1 gram and Kayexalate 30gm PO.

Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 181/58 HR: 72 RR: 20 O2Sat: 94% Gen: alert and oriented, NAD Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft, NT, +BS Ext: 2+ oedema BL   Pertinent Results:  Laboratories: Notable for Creatinine of 2.7 (baseline 1.7-2.0), potassium 6.3, lactate 2.1, UA negative for Leukocyte esterase or nitrites, WBC 18.5 with 85% PMN and 1% Bands, Hct 30.7 (baseline 34-36), normal liver enzymes.
He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible complicated/MRSA UTI.
He had one blood culture on [**8-2**] positive for coag-negative staph in one bottle but this was ultimately thought to be a contaminant and ceftriaxone was D/Ced at this point.
The copper wire grew out coag-positive staph which was speciated as MRSA and was the reason he was initially put on vancomycin, and this was continued until [**2131-8-8**].
At this point the vancomycin was D/Ced and switched to bactrim becasue the copper wire cultures showed the staph was also sensitive to bactrim.
He also received IV fluid hydration.
Urology removed a long copper wire from the patient's bladder.
Vancomycin and then bactrim were given as per above.
No growth on urine culture, but patient was nevertheless treated empirically with ceftriaxone for complicated UTI as well as with vancomycin and then bactrim for MRSA on copper wire as per above.
