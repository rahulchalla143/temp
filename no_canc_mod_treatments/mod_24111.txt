*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Do NOT smoke  *  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves.
Inform the office that you will need a standing end expiratory chest xray for this appointment.
