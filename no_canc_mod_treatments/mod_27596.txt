Limited study due to patient immobility and intubated status.
Tip of the intraortic balloon pump in good position.
Post percutaneous intervention ejection fraction is slightly improved.
R IJ tunnelled catheter placement [**2124-3-10**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided tunneled hemodialysis catheter placement via the right internal jugular venous approach with the tip positioned in the right atrium   Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male w/ HTN, DM, s/p recent NSTEMI who presented to OSH after developing chest pain and SOB, intubated at OSH for increasing hypoxia and concern for pulmonary edema.
He was not a CT surgical candidate, so he underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with atherectomy and placement of BMS to the LAD.
He had elevated cardiac enzymes and severe 3 vessel CAD at cath, felt not ammenable for stenting initially.
He received rotational atherectomy with stent placement x2 (BMS).
Initially he had increased R and L sided pressures, w/ extremely elevated PCWP of 65; this improved after diuresis and placement of IABP.
He was started on CVVH for volume removal.
His blood pressure remained stable and he was started on low dose b-blocker and ACEi.
He underwent repeat cardiac cath for high risk intervention, and had rotational atherectomy and placement of 2 bare metal stents, to the LAD and diagonal branch.
B-blocker and ACEi were begun once the patient was stabilized.
# Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated on arrival at [**Hospital1 **] for increasing shortness of breath and dropping O2 sats.
He received > two weeks of IV antibiotics (cefepime/cipro, then switched to vancomycin, then to nafcillin).
# Thrmobocytopenia: Platelets dropped significantly during the hospitalization.
He was placed on CVVH for volume removal, and followed by the Renal Service.
After extubation, a tunnelled catheter (R IJ) was placed and he began hemodialysis M,W,F, which will be continued after discharge.
Iron studies revealed mixed AOCD with iron deficiency (iron 32, TIBC 191, ferritin 215, transferrin 147).
Folate was >20, and vitamin B12 was 795.
# HTN - He was initially on pressers and had a balloon pump.
After these were weaned, low dose b-blocker (metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]) and ace-inhibitor (captopril 6.25 tid) were begun.
He was on NPH and regular insulin at home; while on CVVH and TPH, he was given an insulin drip.
This was changed to a sliding scale.
NPH was not re-started during the hospitalization as pt's intake was moderate and sugars were controlled with the sliding scale.
# FEN - He was placed on TPN while intubated, but restarted on a renal/cardiac diet after extubation.
# Prophylaxis - The patient was on a heparin drip while on the IABP.
