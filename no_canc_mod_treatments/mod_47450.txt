Name:  [**Known lastname 15054**],[**Known firstname 1911**]                     Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 15055**]  Admission Date:  [**2114-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-9-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-7-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfur / Norvasc  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2097**] Addendum: Discharge Instructions:  You were admitted with a Crohns flare and you were evaluated by our gastroenterologists.
You were evaluated by surgery, but you decided that you did not want surgery for this issue, with the understanding that this will likely be a terminal condition.
You also experienced an abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation during your hospitalization.
Although this condition places you at risk for strokes, anticoagulation with blood thinners was not started in the setting of your acute Crohn's flare because of the possibility of sending you for surgery at that time and the potential risk of bleeding that would have resulted from starting an anticoagulant.
