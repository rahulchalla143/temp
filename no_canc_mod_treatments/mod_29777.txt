Althought this is not documented in recent discharge summary, apparently patient has been using oxygen for the last month since her most recent discharge, and using 2L while sleeping and ambulating.
She was started on a nitro drip and given lasix 40 mg IV x1.
Cipro was stopped and cyclosporine was decreased, and patient was discharged on antiepeleptics.
Patient was note to have right lobar consolidation with associated effusion which was transudative, and negative for infection and malignant cells, and was treated with Piperacillin x 8 days.
In regards to renal failure, Cr was slightly elevated from baseline, but u/s unchanged and biopsy complicated by perinephric hematomoa, but biopsy did not show acute rejection, but did show chronic allograft nephropathy.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Borderline P-R interval prolongation.
[**4-28**] AV Fistulogram AV FISTULAGRAM WITH VENOPLASTY  MEDICAL HISTORY: Swollen left arm, potential angioplasty for stenosis.
Carbon dioxide fistulogram and central venogram.
Balloon angioplasty of stent stenoses and cephalic arch band like stenosis/web.
MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided by administering 100 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of midazolam throughout the total intraservice time of 78 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
1% lidocaine was used for local pain control.
In order to minimize contrast exposure given renal failure, carbon dioxide venograms were also performed.
TECHNIQUE: After discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure with the patient, written informed consent was obtained.
A 4.5 French Angiodynamics micropuncture sheath was exchanged for the needle.
A 4 French straight flush catheter was advanced over the wire, and the wire removed.
Based on the results, the flush catheter was removed and a 6 French [**Last Name (un) 2493**] Tip sheath exchanged for the pre-existing sheath.
All wires, catheters and sheaths were removed after a 0 silk pursestring suture was placed at the puncture site.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
Upon plasty of this stenosis, the graft was demonstrated to collapse and the character of flow change from pulsatility to thrill.
Brief Hospital Course: 60F w/HCV, HTN, HL, ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant that presented with flash pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension secondary to renovascular disease.
Secondary issues was left upper extremity swelling s/p AV fistulogram with successful venoplasty of two focal tight stenoses.
Troponin was at relative baseline given her renal dysfunction and remained stable, though EKG did show some signs of demand.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] BP was treated aggressively with nitro gtt and uptitration of antihypertensives as below.
Patient was diuresed aggressively, including with lasix gtt started [**2160-4-24**] and metolazone.
On the [**Month/Year (2) **] floor, she was converted to furosemide 100 mg PO BID and metolazone PO BID.
She was discharged on furosemide 100 mg PO BID with metolazone PO qAM 30 minutes before home lasix dosage.
Her blood pressure was treated aggressively with nitro gtt titrated to SBP 180-200.
Increased labetalol to 300mg TID, and continued patient on home regimen norvasc.
Patient's ASA dose was increased to 325mg daily while ruling out MI.
Started clonidine for additional BP control, and nitro gtt weaned [**2160-4-25**].
On the [**Month/Day/Year **] floor, she was continued on clonidine 0.1 mg patch, amlodipine 10 mg PO BID.
AV fistulogram performed on [**2160-4-28**] showing two focal tight stenoses within long stent which extended from left subclavian to SVC and band-like stenosis at cephalic arch s/p balloon angioplasty with post-procedural venograms demonstrating resolution of band-like stenosis and improvement of stenoses within long stent.
Given outpatient volume management has been difficult, she is likely approaching need for renal replacement therapy.
She was continued on her home prednisone, cyclosporine, epoetin alfa and calcium acetate.
No plan for further therapy per recent hepatology notes.
- assessment of renal function on diuretic regimen and in setting of recent contrast load (50 mL).
