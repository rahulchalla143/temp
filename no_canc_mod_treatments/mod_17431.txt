The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical, mid-distal anterior, septal, and lateral akinesis.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2) with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps.
POST BYPASS The patient is receiving milrinone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine by infusion.
Initially after separation from bypass one trace valvular and one trace paravalvular jet of aortic regurgitation were seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 70223**] is a 73 year old with a history of coronary artery disease status post a stent placed in the mid RCA, LAD, L Circ who presented to an OSH on [**2186-5-23**] for shortness of breath.
He was found to have critical aortic stenosis and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for aortic valve replacement and a coronary artery bypass.
On [**6-2**] he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve and a coronary artery bypass grafting.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.
He extubated and was weaned from his pressors.
His chest tubes were removed.
His epicardial wires were removed.
