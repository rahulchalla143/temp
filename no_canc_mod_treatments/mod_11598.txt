HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old Caucasian female whose recent medical course was significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed at [**Hospital3 7362**] one and a half weeks prior to admission.
The patient had a sphincterotomy and a stone extraction.
She also had a stent placed.
She was treated with Lasix 20 mg intravenously with good urine output.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications at home included verapamil-SR 240 mg p.o.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Her medications at the outside hospital on transfer included cefotetan 1 g q.12h., Flagyl 50 intravenously q.8h., verapamil 240 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Her admission examination to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressure was 110/60, heart rate was 95 (in sinus), respiratory rate was 18 to 22, oxygen saturation was 91% to 94% on 100% nonrebreather.
She did have a troponin which went from 1.2 to 4 and back to 1.1.
Subjectively, the patient was feeling much better throughout her course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and her supplemental oxygen was weaned from an initial 35% face mask down to 2 liters nasal cannula, and ultimately to off; during which she remained 99% oxygen saturation even on room air.
Given those findings, the patient was given another 20 mg of intravenously Lasix; to which the patient did diurese approximately 2 more liters.
It was after this that the patient did finally come off of all supplemental oxygen.
She started on a clear liquid diet on the morning status post procedure and tolerated this well.
She was also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19731**] in Gastroenterology for removal of her stent in six weeks' times.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to remain on a low-fat diet for two weeks' time.
She was also sent out on levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
