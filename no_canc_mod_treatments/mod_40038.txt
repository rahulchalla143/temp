Patient has AF and had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab planning to restart at 1mg tonight.
Patient BP then settled in 160s/100s and given INR 2.0 was reversed with Factor 9 Complex and 10mg IT vitamin K. He was started on a nicardipine drip.
Past Medical History: - Atrial Fibrillation on warfarin - TIA [**11/2195**] - C. Cath for STEMI found to have non-occlusive CAD - Alcoholic cirrhosis s/p portal shunt in [**2154**] (TIPS?)
- [**3-14**]  ERCP - [**2-29**] I&D and linear exchange L knee - CKD - baseline Cr of 1.5-2.3 (also interstitial nephritis s/p Nafcillin) - Gout - prior alcoholabuse sober for 24 years - Fall and underwent left hip hemiarthroplasty [**2196-3-24**] for femoral neck fracture - TKR '[**88**]  Social History: He has been at rehab since discharge in [**Month (only) 547**].
Extremities: Scar and reecnt procedure on left knee.
Very dysarthric almost anarthic initially and initially not verbalising other than incomprehensibbel noises but this immproved and now very dysarthric but reasonable naming but still non-fluent broken speech in 1 word phrsies suggestive of non-fluent aphasia but predominant feature is dysarthria.
Note is made of an atelectatic right maxillary sinus, with inward retraction of the sinus walls and convex lateral bowing of the right nasal cavity.
There are periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, hypodensities are compatible with small vessel ischemic disease.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2196-4-26**] 4:33 AM FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], the nasogastric tube has been removed.

Patient was initially admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring and IV nicardipine.
# Neurology: At rehab, patient had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab since.
He was started on a HISS with goal of normoglycemia.
In the ED his warfarin was reversed with factor 9 concentrate and 10mg IV vitamin K and 2 units of FFP and was started on IV nicardipine for hypertension.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU for BP control and close monitoring.
His warfarin was held on admission due to his IPH and he was continued on Nicardipine gtt.
An NGT was placed and his home BP medications lisinopril was started and Metoprolol was introduced at a reduced dose.
In the ICU he clinically improved and although was initially fed with an NG tube he later passed his speech and swallow assessment for a pureed and thin liquid diet.
Prior to transfer to floor he was started on heparin sc.
We further uptitrated his anti-hypertensives and was discharged on lisinopril 5mg qd (home dose) and metoprolol 50mg qid (dose at rehab was 75mg qid).
He was started on aspirin 81mg qd on the day of discharge.
His metoprolol was gradually uptitrated and was discharged on 75mg qid and this will likely need to be further increased at rehab.
Lisinopril 5mg qd was restarted.
He was not started on empiric Abx and did not show signs/symptoms of infection.
He had a PICC on admission which had been used for hydration at rehab and this was removed prior to transfer.
# Nutrition: Patient initially had an NG tube and was evaluated by SS eval and was passed for pureed solids and thin liquids.
# Heme: Patient was hemodynamically stable during his admission after correction of his hypertension.
# GI: Patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis s/p portal shunt in [**2154**] and encephalopathy and seemed encephalopathic on admission with prominent asterixis.
He was started on lactulose and continued on his home dose and this improved.
A urinary catheter was inserted prior to transfer with a plan for a voiding trial at rehab.
# PPx: Given his hemorrhage, he was initially only on pneumoboots and was restarted on heparin sc on transfer.
Transitional issues: - We stopped warfarin and patient was continued on s/c heparin and aspirin 81mg qd - Up-titrating anti-HTN medications and will need further uptitration at rehab - Catheter inserted on transfer and for voiding trial at rehab - Trend CBC at rehab given slight decrease in WCC and PLT  Medications on Admission: Was on warfarin INR 3.3 on [**4-22**] and holding Acetaminophen 650mg PRN Allopurinol 100mg qd Aspirin 81mg qd Docusate [**Hospital1 **] Lactulose 10ml [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 5mg qd Metoprolol tartrate 75mg qid MVI Omeprazole 40mg qd Bisacodyl 10mg PR  qd Senna HS  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Secondary diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation - warfarin stopped and changed to aspirin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We felt that this was likely due to high blood pressure and you being on warfarin which increases the risk of bleeding.
You were initially admitted to the Neuro ICU and your blood thinner (warfarin) was reversed to reduce the risk of further bleeding and you were initially treated with an IV medication to lower your blood pressure.
You were found to have swallowing problems and you initially required a feeding tube and latterly after you were seen by the swallowing specialists, you were passed for a pureed and thin liquid diet.
We stopped your warfarin and started aspirin in its place given too high a risk of bleeding on warfarin.
You were seen by PT and OT and deemed to benefit from rehabilitation and were transferred to rehab on [**2196-4-27**].
Medication changes: We STOPPED warfarin We REDUCED metoprolol to 50mg four times per day and this will likely need to be increased further Please continue your other medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please see your PCP soon after discharge from rehab.
