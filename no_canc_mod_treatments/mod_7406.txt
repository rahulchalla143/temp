STUDIES: .
Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the ostium RCA with a Vision (3x28mm) bare metal stent postdilated with a 3.5mm balloon.
Right heart cardiac catheterization following successful PCI demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP=23mm Hg) and left (mean PCWP=28mm Hg) heart filling pressures.
Following successful PCI, the pressors were able to be weaned down and the cardiac index was 2.4 l/min/m2.
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a 6F Mynx closure device.
During the case the patient had several episodes of atrial flutter (150 bpm) treated with amiodarone and lopressor.
She is transferred to the CCU s/p BMS to her RCA, still hypotensive but with decreasing pressor requirments, on dopamine drip.
As above, she was initially on a dopamine drip to maintain MAP >60.
However, this was quickly weaned down on HD 1 as her right ventricular function improved.
An echo on HD 1 showed a preserved LVEF of 70%; however, there was right ventricular cavity dilatation with depressed free wall contractility and possible posterior wall hypokinesis.
As her blood pressure tolerated, she was re-started on a BB and ACEI.
However, on HD 1 she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and thus she was started on metoprolol and heparin drip.
Her metoprolol was gradually increased to its present dose of 150mg P.O.
Metoprolol XL .
Amiodorone was loaded and will be continued at a dose of 400mg TID for 4 more days until [**2148-9-21**] and will then be continued at Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing x7 days and then will be weaned to 400mg daily.
At time of discharge she had an INR of 1.3 and will continue to have daily INR checks via PICC line while on Lovenox and Warfarin with an end INR goal of [**1-21**].
Also of note, liver function tests and pulmonary function tests should be obtained as outpatient now that she is starting therapy with amiodorone.
She had diffuse ecchymoses at time of admission from venipuncture and central line trauma in the setting of antiplatelet therapy for ACS.
We suspected that her anemia was due to bleeding as well as marrow suppression given her acute inflammatory state.
Haptoglobin was elevated and bilirubin WNL making hemolytic process unlikely.
.. # NAUSEA / VOMITING:  This was treated with Zofran prn and the patient's GI symptoms had abated by the time of her discharge.
While hospitalized, we continued her on RISS and patient will plan to restart her prior metformin and glyburide and Januvia medications.
However, she continues to have occasional sbp ranges into the 170-190 range, so patient will also restart her usual Diazide BP medication after discharge.
.. # DYSLIPIDEMIA:  We continued her home statin at a dose of 80 mg once daily.
She was anticoagulated on heparin drip and switched to Lovenox as a bridge to coumadin; thus there was no need for DVT prophylaxis.
She was kept on a cardiac heart-healthy diet with QID fingersticks.

We increased your atorvastatin to 80 mg 2.
We stopped your diltiazem 5.
We started Warfarin to prevent blood clots.
We stopped your Tramadol as it interacts with warfarin You need to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the next few weeks.
