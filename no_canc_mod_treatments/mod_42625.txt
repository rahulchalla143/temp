She has not undergone any therapy for this.
This dyspnea was very slowly progressive and did not require supplumental Oxygen.
In the ED she was given flagyl to cover anaerobic infection and bedside eccho did not appear changed.
A trigger was called and bedside eccho showed large 3cm effusion with RV collapse and emergent bedside pericardiocentesis was performed with 390 cc serosanguinous fluid drained.
Right lower lobe lung CA - found incidentally in [**2132**] on a preoperative chest x-ray in anticipation of surgery for a ductal carcinoma - Resected [**2132-10-17**], path: stage IIIa T2, N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer - s/p 3 cycles of adjuvant carboplatin and Taxol, complicated by  thrombocytopenia and anemia.
The patient received concurrent radiotherapy.

[**2135-1-17**] pericardial fluid:  [**2135-1-15**]: BCX x2 NG .
Given h/o TB and + MAC on culture it is also possible that the patient could have mycobacterial pericarditis.
She was treated with azithro and cefpodoxime for the MAC (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]- outpatient  pulm) and new infiltrate on CXR for 7 days and is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
She was also sent home with home oxygen and nebulizer machine to help with her dyspnea.
Diarrhea: C diff high on differential, although post abx diarrhea also possible.
She was given pepto bis for symptom relief with good effect.
A fib/flutter with RVR: to 140's and ventricular trigeminy-always hemodynamically stable.
This was likely secondary to irritation of pericardial catheter initially.
She was rate controlled with metoprolol 75mg TID in CCU but again had a.fib with RVR again [**2135-1-21**].
Rate control discussed and decided to be kept strictly on BB so was switched to ToprolXL for discharge 225mg.
Anticoagulation was considered but initally held off given question of need for pericardial window.
When effusion resolved, anticoagulation was still held given h/o cancer with no head scan recently to rule out mets to brain.
Head CT was done and negative so she was discharged on coumadin and will have levels checked by her PCP.
