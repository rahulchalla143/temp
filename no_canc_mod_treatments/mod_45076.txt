At the time of discharge, he had been tapered on his prednisone to 5 mg q.d.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was treated with Coumadin in variable doses for a goal INR of 2 to 3 for his low ejection fraction.
A notation had been made on page "1" that the patient will need to have his INR followed closely with his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly to meet the INR goal.
At the time of discharge, the patient was continued on Casodex (his hormonal therapy) for prostate cancer.

The patient has outpatient followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Orthopaedics for his neck fracture including further imaging studies to assess healing.
His weights will need to be monitored as an outpatient and nutritional supplements continued.
