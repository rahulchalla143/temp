There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%) with inferior/infero-lateral akinesis.
A bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present.
On [**11-25**] he was taken to the Operating Room where redo mitral valve replacement was accomplished via a median sternotomy.
He weaned from bypass on Milrinone, Levophed and Propofol in stable condition.
The Milrinone was turned off and Lisinopril begun.
He remained well and invasive lines were removed, diuresis were begun and he was mobilized.
Anticoagulation was started for the mechanical valve and fibrillation on POD 1 and intravenous Heparin on POD 2.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] right pleural chest tube was unable to be removed and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**12-2**] for removal of trapped chest tube and exploration of inferior pole of sternotomy incision.
The inferior pole of the incision was opened and it was discovered that the tube had been caught on the Vicryl midline fascial closure suture.
That suture was cut, and the tube was pulled back from under the drapes.
The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.
A small fluid collection at the inferior aspect of the wound substernally was noted and the patient was started on ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for a 7 day course empirically.
Coumadin was held and Heparin drip was started.
Heparin and Coumadin were resumed post procedure.
He progressed well and Heparin was discontinued once the INR rose above 2.0.
His antibiotics were continued for a seven day course.
Arrangements for Coumadin follow up at the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 197**] clinic were made, as this was his routine before this surgery.
Discharge medications and restrictions were discussed with him prior to leaving the hospital.
He was discharged on 5mgm of Coumadin 12/4,5 and 6 to have an INR checked on [**12-12**].
