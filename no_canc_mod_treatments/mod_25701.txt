History of Present Illness: 56 year old man with HIV, DM2, CAD, h/o seizures, alcoholic cirrhosis and known varices s/p banding on [**2169-9-18**] initially presented to OSH with bright red hematemesis.
He continued to have hematemesis with worsening hypotension (SBP 60s) despite IVF and PRBCs (7L NS + 5units PRBCs total).
Femoral CVL placed and he was started on Dopamine and Octreotide gtts and given protonix 40mg IV.
He was intubated and repeat endoscopy with successful sclerotherapy and placement of 2 bands (reportedly [**4-24**] bands fired).
He was transferred here for further care and concern given passage of maroon stool per rectum.
In our ED, initial vs were: HR 108 113/56 on dopamine 20 100%.
He was continued on versed and fentanyl added for sedation.
He had no further bleeding and received ceftriaxone 1g and 2 units FFP.
Seen by GI who recommended octreotide and pantoprazole drips, ceftriaxone, q4hour HCT and plan for repeat scope in am.
On the floor, he is intubaetd and sedated but opens eyes to commands.
