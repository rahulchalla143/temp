[**2101-8-28**] C-spine plain film: No fractures.
Plain film imaging was done and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy.
Of note, due to inability to secure an airway the patient underwent an emergency cricothyroidotomy with tracheostomy tube placement.
His post-operative course was notable for hypotension which initially required pressor support (an echocardiogram was done which was normal) and ventilary dependence.
He was started on trophic tube feeds via a post-pyloric dobhoff tube on post-operative day 4.
He was treated empirically with Zosyn for 2 weeks for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He was weaned off his ventilary support after 2 weeks.
He was discharged to home on post-operative day 25 with a visiting nurse aid for tracheostomy tube care.
