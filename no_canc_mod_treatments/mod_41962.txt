In the viable lymphoid gate, CD19 positive B-cells are extremely scant (less than 1% of lymphoid gated events ) and clonality cannot be reliably assessed.
No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified on post-gadolinium images.
These findings could represent a recent intervention such as a lumbar puncture.
She was initially covered with CTX/vanco/amp(tolerated augmentin as outpatient)/acyclovir and dexamethasone.
The dexamethasone was discontinued on [**8-10**] given the low suspicion for a bacterial process.
The antibiotics were discontinued after the lab results returned and were negative for bacteria and HSV.
Notable events in her course include intubation for LP.
