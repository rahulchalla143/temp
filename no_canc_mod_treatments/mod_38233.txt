No compressions were started at that time.
He was shocked three times and given Epinephrine 1mg x 3, Atropine x 3, and Lidocaine 100 mg once with return of sinus tachycardia.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 1443**] where he was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia at 120, BP 80/50, agonal, and was placed on a lidocaine drip.
A right femoral line was placed.
Artic Sun cooling protocol for neuroprotection was initiated.
STUDIES: CARDIAC CATH [**2120-1-24**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Mitral valve prolapse cannot be excluded.
Chest Xray [**2120-1-24**] IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema, adequate placement of the endotracheal tube.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 52 yo M with reported hx of cardiomyopathy s/p Ventricular Fibrillation cardiac arrest in the community, transferred to our facility, found to have no hemodynamically significant coronary disease, preserved ejection fraction, who underwent cooling protocol for neuroprotection.
Family member decided to withdraw life sustaining measures and pursue comfort measures as goals of care.
He was intubated in the field and initially brought to [**Hospital3 19345**], then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he immediately went for cardiac catheterization, which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
He was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and started on the Artic Sun Therapuetic Cooling Protocol for neuroprotection (detailed below).
He was monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
His labs were closely monitored for the expected hypokalemia and hyperglycemia during cooling and hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia during rewarming.
He was started on insulin sliding scale for tight glucose control.
He received continuous video EEG, which revealed seizure activity consistent with status epilepticus.
Neurology was consulted and provided recommendations regarding anti-epileptic agents and dosing.
Given his poor prognosis, his only living family member and health care proxy decided to withdraw life sustaining care and focus on comfort measures.
He was started on Fentanyl and Midazolam for sedation.
He was initially started on broad antibiotics, which were tapered to Vancomycin (cefepime and flagyl discontinued) once the speciation data returned.
# Hypotension: The patient had a brief period of hypotension requiring transient use of pressure support with norepinephrine.
This was likely secondary to hypovolemia, and improved with fluid boluses.
# Coagulopathy: The patient was on coumadin for atrial fibrillation as an outpatient.
He presented with a supratherapuetic INR, which increased during the cooling process, but then trended down with vitamin K. Labwork was negative for DIC.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Likely pre-renal in etiology as improved with IV hydration.
Vancomycin for positive sputum culture continued.
# Reported History of Cardiomyopathy: The patient presented with a history of cardiomyopathy, and on an outpatient regimen of digoxin, toprol, lisinopril, aldactone, aspirin, and lasix.
His outpatient medications were held during this admission.
# HTN: We held his antihypertensives which were started HD 5 after warming as patient became hypertensive.
The patient was evaluated for organ donation following the Health Care Proxy's wishes.
