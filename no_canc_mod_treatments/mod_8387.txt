She takes no medications at home.
She did have a Troponin that was found to be 35.6, a CK value of 235 and MB of 20 with an MB index of 8.5 suggesting a possible cardiac injury verses an acute coronary syndrome.
Given this, this prompted the actual sending of the cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram which showed possible anterior cardiac injury by electrical signature.
A Foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring.
She did have an A-line that was placed to correlate with her cuff pressures in the left radial position.
Additionally a subclavian catheter with Swann-Ganz hemodynamic monitoring device was placed showing that she had a Central venous pressure of 11 with a cardiac index of 3.2 in the setting of these previously mentioned cardiac findings and cardiac enzyme values.
She had excellent urine output, was given 60 mg of intravenous Lasix due to her depressed left ventricular function found to be approximately 40% by EF on her echocardiogram.
They recommended artifical tears to be applied p.r.n.
Chest x-ray was done after PA line placement showed the line the be in appropriate position.
She was supported on the ventilator over night and had oxy Swann in place.
At this time she was on IMV and pressure support with a PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of 40%  Arterial blood gases on this was 7.43 with a pCO2 of 39 and pO2 of 167, bicarbonate 27, base axis of 2.
This was weaned to CPAP and pressure support with 5 and 5 and she was ultimately extubated.
She was still being supported with Levophed which is utilized for blood pressure monitoring after being given the 60 mg of Lasix which had quite a profound diuretic effect and in fact caused her to be somewhat hypotensive therefore, requiring some volume resuscitation.
She was started on a beta-blocker including Lopressor and continued on aspirin.
Social Work consultation had been obtained on her presentation in the Emergency Room prior to her becoming hypotensive and intubated therefore, their services were continued throughout her hospitalization, she was already being referred to an outpatient referral center that deals with assault patient's where she will continue to have counseling and support.
A decision was made at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31471**] to have the patient discharged to home with her to have follow-up in the Center for Violence and Prevention and Recovery with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31472**] to continue her social work and psychosocial support.
The patient will continue her beta-blocker and aspirin.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Artificial tears one to two drops OU p.r.n.
Possibly Lasix and an ace-inhibitor but please refer to     the final record to see if the Cardiology service in fact     wished the patient to be on these agents prior to     discharge.
Status post assault with strangulation and asphyxiation,     attempted drowning sustaining multiple petechial     hemorrhage and possible demand ischemia verses acute     myocardial infarction in the setting of polytrauma.
