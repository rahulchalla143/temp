Admission Date:  [**2155-2-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-2-12**]   Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old, Caucasian, female patient with history of early Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes mellitus type II, a remote history of breast cancer, but previously otherwise independent who was recently admitted to the Neurosurgical Service on [**2155-2-1**] status post a head trauma with right frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral edema.
The patient was followed by the Neurosurgical Service and was loaded initially with Dilantin for concern of seizures as well as Decadron for cerebral edema demonstrated on a head CT.
Prior to discharge, today, the patient was noted to have a low-grade fever of 100 degrees for which she was started on levofloxacin for possible pneumonia as she failed a recent speech and swallow evaluation in-house and self-discontinued her nasogastric tube with possible aspiration.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was unable to provide an adequate history but received 1 gram of ceftazidime, 500 mg of Flagyl, and two liters of normal saline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, Alzheimer's dementia, breast cancer status post mastectomy, atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS:  (On discharge) Aricept 5 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o.
q.day, levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q.day, Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
q.day, subcutaneous heparin, Lentis 20 units q.h.s., regular insulin sliding scale, Colace 150 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  PROBLEM #1:  Fever:  The etiology of the patient's fever was considered likely aspiration pneumonia given her history of self-discontinuing her nasogastric tube during her previous hospital stay.
The patient was continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl throughout her brief hospital stay.
The patient will receive a 14-day course of both levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
PROBLEM #2:  Neurologic:  The patient was admitted with a questionable history of altered mental status.
The etiology of the patient's mental status changes is likely multifactorial including her cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, hyponatremia on admission, as well as her underlying dementia.
Her hyponatremia resolved with intravenous hydration.
PROBLEM #3:  Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation and diffuse ST elevations noted on [**2155-2-6**].
The patient had stable tachycardia and was rate controlled with a beta blocker.
Her rate improved once she received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and her beta blocker could be administered.
She was noted to be normotensive and hemodynamically stable on her outpatient doses of an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.
PROBLEM #4:  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was noted to have significant dysphagia.
It was therefore recommended that the patient receive a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, which she did on [**2155-2-11**].
She was restarted on tube feeds which were eventually titrated up to goal.
The patient tolerated these tube feeds.
It is anticipated that this percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube will not significantly improve the patient's risk of aspiration, but will allow her to receive adequate nutrition.
The patient was also admitted with hyponatremia which resolved with intravenous fluids.
PROBLEM #5:  Hypothyroidism:  The patient was noted to have a TSH of 13 on admission.
Her levothyroxine dose was increased to 125 mcg q.day.
She will need to have a repeat TSH and free T4 checked approximately one month after this medication change.
PROBLEM #6:  Diabetes:  The patient was previously evaluated by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
Her insulin regimen was continued per their recommendation, and she was noted to have well controlled sugars throughout this admission.
PROBLEM #7:  Gastrointestinal:  As noted above, the patient received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy by the Gastroenterology Consultation Service on [**2155-2-11**].
During the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she was noted to have mild gastritis and erosions, and her H2 blocker was switched to a proton pump inhibitor.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she will continue all medications as prescribed.
Levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
