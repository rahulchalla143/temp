PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension; history of ventricular fibrillation with cardiac arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.4 Fahrenheit; heart rate 84; blood pressure 108/64; respiratory rate 20 and breathing 97% on room air.
Neurologic exam revealed the patient to be alert and oriented to person and place but not time and occasionally seemed confused and disturbed by the situation at hand.
This was done by the gastroenterology service; thus, the patient required an emergent trip to the operating room.
The patient was consented and brought to the operating room urgently after intravenous fluids and antibiotics were instituted.
Under general anesthesia, the procedure was performed which included a right colectomy, a repair of a sigmoid perforation, primarily an end ileostomy and an end transverse colostomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia and received 4500 ml of Crystalloid.
A drain was also placed at this time and her estimated total blood loss was 250 ml.
Her sedation was weaned and she was extubated on postoperative day number 2.
She was placed on Metoprolol at this time and she was continued on intravenous fluids and antibiotics.
They suggested using Haldol as needed for agitation.
They also suggested starting Klonopin when the patient was taking p.o.
She was on a Nitro drip at this time for blood pressure elevation.
The Nitro drip was weaned.
She was continued on hydration with intravenous fluids.
She was started on full liquids and her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed.
Following their recommendations, we began Tylenol as a standing order, 1 gram 3 x a day and Oxycodone 2.5 mg 3 x a day.
They also suggested starting her back on her home medications which were Klonopin 0.5 q. h.s.
and Lamictal 25 mg q. day.
She was off all intravenous fluids and all intravenous medications.
This also began to improve as she resumed her home medication regimen.
The case was discussed at length with her daughter, [**Name (NI) 2048**] [**Name (NI) **], who agreed with this plan.
The patient was to take medications as directed.
