Significant workup as outpatient with possibly some component of asthma based on flow/volume curves on recent spirometry.
Post nasal drip present causing cough, as well as GERD.
She was transiently treated with BiPAP in the ED with improvement in her symptoms.
The morning after admission, she was not requiring oxygen and her wheezing had improved.
The patient tolerated CPAP in house, so getting her CPAP machine at home would be beneficial.
She will need to followup with the sleep clinic for further titration of her CPAP settings.
The patient is closely followed by allergy, but she would likely also benefit from further evaluation by ENT to address the issue of chronic sinusitis and post nasal drip to see if there are any other options available.
She will continue her home medications.
The prednisone will be tapered off rapidly (40 mg on [**5-6**] mg [**5-7**], 10 mg [**5-8**], then off).
# GERD - [**Hospital1 **] PPI  # HTN - cont home HCTZ, lisinopril, atenolol  # Anemia - Currently stable.

It is thought that this is likely due to your post nasal drip and chronic sinsusitis causing a cough and leading to reactive airways.
You were transiently on BiPAP and then treated with inhalers and a rapid steroid taper.
You were also started on CPAP at night for your likely obstructive sleep apnea.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
