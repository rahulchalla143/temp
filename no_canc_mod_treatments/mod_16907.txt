Her pain began to worsen over the holidays causing her to visit her primary care physician on [**12-28**] following an episode of substernal chest pain, which lasted ten minutes and was also relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerins at that time.
Following catheterization the patient was referred to be evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting.
