Admission Date:  [**2178-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-2-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] where she was admitted for atypical chest pain and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Central venous line insertion into R IJ -Multiple attempts at securing arterial access   History of Present Illness: 62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in [**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and COPD who was admitted to OSH [**12-23**] for atypical chest pain and SOB.
She was assessed as having severe decompensated R-sided CHF and was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix in the ED but later that day experienced [**9-9**] back pain with desat to the 50's and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring with HR in the 60's and BP's in the 90's.
Interestingly, about 1 month ago she was started on sildenafil for treatment of her pulm htn but felt she became more short of breath when taking that medication and stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago when she started feeling acutely more short of breath.
She states that she has only gained about 2-3lbs in the past two weeks but noticed increased ankle swelling, increasing need for oxygen (she is usually at 88-92 on 3LNC at home but prior to these past 2 weeks she has only used oxygen at night).
She denies dietary indiscretion, recent illnesses, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, or other symptoms.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR Portable [**12-27**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-25**], there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the upper clavicular level, approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube extends into the upper stomach, though the side hole is within the lower portion of the esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: 62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in [**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of right-sided diastolic CHF exacerbation with background of severe pulmonary hypertension who rapidly decompensated and passed away despite maximal medical therapy.
She was ruled out for ACS at OSH with negative enzymes and non-ischemic EKG's and was transferred on dopamine drip for pressure support with max O2 on venturi mask in moderate respiratory distress satting in the low 90's.
On arrival to the CCU, R IJ was placed without complications and she was started on sildenafil 20mg QID with the hope that pressor support and vasodilatation of the pulmonary vasculature would increase cardiac output and allow for gentle diuresis.
In the late morning the day following transfer, dobutamine was added in an attempt to improve ionotropy but after this medication was started her BP began to drop and over the next few hours norepinephrine had to be added to maintain MAPs >65.
These medications were up and down titrated to try to achieve a stable blood pressure but this kept ranging from 70/40-140/50.
The CCU team (including the CCU attending) attempted to place an arterial line for better BP monitoring given very severe peripheral vascular disease but this was unsuccesful via the radial aproach.
Anesthesia was contact[**Name (NI) **] to attempt an axial arterial line but this was not deemed feasible.
The anesthesia attending attempted to obtain a L femoral arterial line without success.
A 250 mL NS bolus was given without response and phenylephrine was started at this point.
Also at around this time her oxygen saturation began to drop and BiPAP was started.
At this point the patient was on dopamine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine for BP support and BiPAP for respiratory support with BP in the 79/55-101/57 and O2 sat of 90%.
Given her worseining cardiopulmonary status the CCU team recommended intubation to try to achieve better oxygenation, prevent respiratory colapse and to allow us to manage her worsening heart failure while maintaing a patent airway with adequate oxygenation.
At this point the anesthesia attending was asked for assistance in placing an arterial line given the need for better blood pressure and oxygenation parameters.
At around 0100-0130 her BP began to drop, milrinone was stopped and vasopressin added.
Despite these 4 pressors her BP continued to drop.
At this point she was given 4 amps of bicarb, 1 mg epinephrine and 1 amp of calcium carbonate.
Despite all of these additions her BP continued to drop and at this point a bicarb drip and an epinephrine drip were started.
She was continued on max doses of 5 pressors throughout the day with maximal respiratory settings for the sake of oxygenation.
Her condition continued to deteriorate despite maximal medical support.
Her family was made aware of her grave circumstances and started to carefully consider her code status.
She coded in the later morning 2 days following transfer for pulseless electrical activity and was coded briefly until resuscitative efforts were halted per family request.
# Anuric Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.8 on admission with oliguria/near anuria, 0.6-0.7 at baseline.
Thought to be due to her brief hypotensive episode after receiving bolus of 40mg IV lasix at OSH.
She ended up ventilated for respiratory support as above.
Managed on HISS while in-house as well as lyrica and gabapentin prior to her hemodynamic compromise.

Code was called for PEA with initiation of chest compressions and epi x 1 at which time code was called off per family preference.
