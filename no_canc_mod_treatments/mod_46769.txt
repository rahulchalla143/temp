After informed choice, she was to proceed with surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - Hepatitis C liver cirrhosis - Esophageal varices - Hypertension - S/p cholecystectomy - S/p hysterectomy - S/p appendectomy  Physical Exam: At admission: AVSS Well appearing, NAD, comfortable BUE: SILT C5-T1 dermatomal distributions BUE: [**6-1**] [**Doctor First Name **]/Tri/Bic/WE/WF/FF/IO BUE: tone normal, negative [**Doctor Last Name 14416**], 2+ symmetric DTR bic/bra/tri All fingers WWP, brisk capillary refill, 2+ distal pulses BLE: decreased sensation in L5 distr.
CT CHEST [**5-3**]: AIRWAYS AND LUNGS: The tip of endotracheal tube extends to the carina, almost encroaching into the right main bronchus.
Consider retracting the endotracheal tube by 3.5 cm for better seating.
The main pulmonary artery before bifurcation measures up to 34 mm, suggestive of mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Left-sided PICC line ends at the level of cavoatrial junction.
ABDOMEN: This study is not designed for assessment of subdiaphragmatic pathologies; however, limited views revealed surface irregularity and heterogeneity of the liver, multiple perigastric and perisplenic collateral vessels and mild ascites distributed in the perihepatic region which consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (known cirrhosis per clinical history).
Tip of the endotracheal tube ends extends to carina, almost encroaching into the right main bronchus.
Consider retracting the endotracheal tube by 3.5 cm for better seating.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
An IJ central line was placed in OR given poor IV access.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol.
She was switched from oxycodone to dilaudid with good effect.
The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating  PO diet.
Foley was removed on POD#3.
The medicine consult service recommended further diuresis (received a totoal of 90mg IV lasix over he course of the morning) without good urine output or symptomatic improvement.
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU on [**5-1**] for further management.
She was started on a lasix gtt on the day of transfer to the MICU with good urine output.
She was started on BiPAP for ventilatory support but her work of breathing persisted and given her diffuse infiltrates on imaging she was intubated on [**5-4**].
She also underwent bedside bronchoscopy in the ICU which was without any obvious abnormality and her BAL was negative.
Given her aggressive diuresis on the lasix ggt, she also developed problems with hypotension requiring levophed support and the lasix gtt was stopped on [**5-4**].
Due to the ATN lasix ggt was restarted on [**5-6**] with good diuresis and BPs remained stable.
On [**5-8**] she was extubated successfully and lasix ggt was stopped.
Urine output improved with diuresis and Cr trended down to 2.6 on discharge  # Hypernatremia: To 150.
She was encouraged to take PO after extuabation and this improved.
She was maintained on lactulose/rifaximin, and restarted on her home nadolol after BPs stabilized.
She will need close liver follow up  # Chronic LBP s/p L4-L5 laminectomy with posterior spinal fusion.
pain control was with fentanyl during intubation and she was transitioned to PO oxycodone after extubation  Transitional issues: - Will need hepatology follow up  Medications on Admission: Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY Amlodipine 2.5 mg PO/NG DAILY Sertraline 100 mg PO/NG DAILY Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO/NG DAILY Spironolactone 50 mg PO/NG DAILY Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG Q8H Lactulose 45 mL PO/NG DAILY:PRN constipation  Discharge Medications: 1. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Forty Five (45) ML PO 3 tbsp daily.
