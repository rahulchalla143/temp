At any rate, Neurosurgery was consulted, but did not believe there was an indication for surgical intervention at this time.
The patient was placed on keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and an EEG reportedly showed non-specific slowing without epileptiform discharges (final interpretation pending).
The decision was made to start her on low maintenance fluids (normal saline at 50 cc/hr) to maintain urine output.
She continued to have some headache related to the bleed, and was given tylenol for analgesia.
It was decided that further management could be done as an outpatient.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient and recommended rehabilitation to regain strength and steadiness.
