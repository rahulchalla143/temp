She recovered from that operation and was doing well until she presented last month with a small bowel obstruction neccesitating extensive adhesiolysis, enterectomy and completion subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy on [**2201-6-11**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].
GYN HISTORY: LMP: [**2201-4-11**], regular menses with cramping OB HISTORY:G:0  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Fundoplication end colostomy (hartmans pouch), R  salpingoophrectomy, TAH, removal of pelvic mass [**2201-4-17**]   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: No T/ETOH/IV drugs   Family History: Breast cancer  Physical Exam: PE:  98.9  114 119/84  18  93%/RA Gen: NAD, A&Ox3, MM dry, (-)scleral icterus Pul: CTAB Cor: tachy, regular Abd: soft/ND (+)mild suprapubic tenderness (-)guarding(-)tympani      stoma viable (-)stricture or prolapse on digital exam   Pertinent Results:       36.2  12       138 101 12       Lactate 1.2 11.2 >----  --< 1.0  ---|---|--< 111  UA(+)LE/NO3; WBC>50       221   27       4.6 28  0.4  AXR: mildly dilated small bowel with scant air-fluid levels  [**7-16**] CXR Limited, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Then around noon of HD 2 on [**7-17**], she developed hypoxemia to the 70's and was triggered.
The patient was placed on 100% NRB and given 20IV lasix.
The patient was then given digoxin IV and another dose of lasix with minimal response.
A bronchoscopy and BAL was performed while she was intubated which showed growth of oropharnygeal flora as well as a right lower lobe opacification and mucous plugging of the right main stem bronchus suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia.
Given no growth of MRSA or hx of such, she was mainatined on a 10day course of IV Zosyn for this aspiration PNA which was completed during her hospitalization.
She continued to require supplemental oxygen following this slowly resolving aspiration event and was discharged home with home o2.
A repeat S&S eval showed risk of aspiration for all consistencies.
She was kept NPO and mainatined on TFs through an NGT during her stay.
A discussion regarding the results of her S&S eval was had with her HCP mother who emphasized that she is careful about having her sit upright at all times while eating at home and that she has not had an episode of aspiration at home and rather felt that her aspiration events while hospitalized were in the setting of her acute illness.
A family meeting during her hospitalization was held with attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], speech/swallow team, and case management.
A full discussion regarding her risks of aspiration were discussed as well as the option of having a PEG placed for enteral nutrition.
Her mother [**Name (NI) 382**] did not want PEG tube placement at this time, but did state that if she developed aspiration events at home she will consider this in the future.
5) ARF: Developed acute renal failure while hospitalized, felt due to temporary hypoxia and ATN while being intubated along with contrast nephropathy.
A workup including urine eos to exclude AIN and renal U/S to exclude hydronephrosis was performed and negative.
6) CHF: Known underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 35%.
Takes Lasix at home but due to her NPO status through much of her stay and anticipated difficulty maintaining hydration at home, lasix has been held.
Discussed with pt's family, recommend re-evaluation as an outpt to determine when and if lasix should be restarted.
Discharge letter has been written to her PCP  DISPO - Discharged home on supplemental oxygen to follow up with her PCP.
