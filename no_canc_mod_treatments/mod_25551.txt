Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with h/o COPD, tobacco use, found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on toilet after several days of progressive SOB; intubated at [**Hospital3 4107**] (first attempted by EMS); admitted to the ICU upon arrival due to persistent hypotension and need for mechanical ventilation.
Etiology uncertain but would consider COPD exacerbation (worsening SOB x several days with steroid burst per PCP); PNA (not visualized on CXR but may be dry); cardiac ischemic event (EKG without concerning changes but no prior); PE (CTA preliminary negative); aspiration (but was upright on toilet) or seizure (but reportedly worsened over several day period).
Intubated at [**Hospital1 **]; wheezing and tight on initial exam.
Treated with steroid burst, antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and nebulizer treatment (Ipratroprium / Albuterol).
He underwent bronchoscopy with removal of thick mucous secretion.
He continued on nebulizer therapy and was discharged with a planned course of antibiotics and 15 days steroid taper.
He was also scheduled to see Pulmonary as outpatient to continue further treatment for his COPD and continued tobacco use.
Considerations included sepsis (infectious vs cardiogenic; obstructive but no PE on CTA) vs. breath stacking with ventilator / COPD vs new process such as pneumothorax s/p line placement.
Though chest imaging never developed a true infiltrate, was treated for community acquired pneumonia.
# COPD: Unclear level of control or severity.
# Tobacco Use: Recommended stopping tobacco use and was given a Nicotene patch while inpatient.
Cholesterol as above.
LDL < 100 but could consider addition of statin medication as outpatient to push LDL < 70.
