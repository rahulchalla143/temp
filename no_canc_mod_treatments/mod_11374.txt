Admission Date:  [**2111-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2111-2-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2034-6-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] is a 77 year old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who originally presented to [**Hospital1 69**] with a several month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and increased lower extremity edema.
He underwent an aortic valvuloplasty on [**2111-1-27**].
He had minimal diuresis and was started with Lasix and Natrecor.
He was then, subsequently, on the Cardiac Care Unit Service for medical management while awaiting aortic valve replacement.
At this point, it was decided by CT Surgery that he would not currently be a candidate for a valve replacement due to the need to use heparin during the operation.
He was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for closer monitoring and possible Swan placement and hemodynamic guided therapy.
A line originally could not be placed due to coagulopathy, and while awaiting his coags to return to baseline, Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] expressed wishes for no more procedures or interventions.
At this time, he was started on peripheral Dobutamine through an IV that had previously been placed.
Despite explanation of the risks and benefits of central line and PA catheter placement, Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] insisted that he did not want anything else done and that he was tired and just wanted to go home.
These options included doing everything possible medically with a goal of getting Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] to the possibility of an aortic valve replacement.
The other option included comfort measures only with him going home with Hospice.
