Sildenafil was continued while patient was hospitalized and we also got in contact with patient's pulmonologist, who recommended continuing sildenafil at the current dose and regimen.
Heparin gtt was initially started for possible PE, but discontinued shortly thereafter.
His dyspnea most significantly responded to diuresis, and patient was maintained on Lasix 40mg PO BID.
We discussed various treatments for PAH in addition to Sildenafil and ultimately got in contact with patient's outpatient pulmonologist as per above.
The patient was continued on sildenafil and did not have any side effects.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium appears to run in upper 5s and occasionally lower 6.
On admission his potassium was elevated and reached a peak of 8.5 despite receiving calcium and Kayexelate in the ED with no ECG changes.
The patient received additional kayexalate on the floor but when he peaked at 8.5 required emergent dialysis with placement of a temporary HD catheter in his right IJ.
After dialysis his potassium was monitored twice a day and remained at an acceptable level between [**4-12**].
The patient did not require any further dialysis during the admission.
Lasix was continued as tolerated by renal function and pressure.
He was started on iron 325mg [**Hospital1 **] in the hospital and will continue upon discharge.
# OSA: Patient with history of noncompliance of CPAP in past.
The patient tolerated CPAP well (with his home machine and settings) and will continue with CPAP after discharge.
# Acute renal failure: Concern for poor renal perfusion given possible fluid overload (BNP did not support) versus over-diuresis with recent increase in Lasix at home.
As above, he did require dialysis for hyperkalemia.
