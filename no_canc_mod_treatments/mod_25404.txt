DELIVERY COURSE:  This pregnancy was reportedly uncomplicated until the mother presented very early on the day of delivery in active labor.
She was treated with magnesium sulfate and given betamethasone.
The baby emerged vigorous with good respiratory effort and cry, was bulb suctioned and given bag mask ventilation followed by intubation with a 2.5 ET tube due to ineffectivieness of breathing.
This infant tolerated the procedure well.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The infant required dopamine at 2.5 cg/kg/min to 5 mcg/kg/min for the first 24 hours of the infant's life.
The     infant was treated with a single course of indomethacin.
The infant does present     with a murmur on occasion and active precordium on     occasion.
No further indomethacin therapy has been given due     to a worsening IVH and a gastric perforation post Indocin     therapy.
