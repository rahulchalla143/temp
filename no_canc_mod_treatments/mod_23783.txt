(R)[**Name (NI) **] PTC drain capped.
[**2146-10-22**] CXR patchy consolidation of the RUL, bigger R pleural effusion [**2146-10-22**] CXR: large R pleural effusion, additional loculated pleural fluid [**2146-10-23**] CXR: large focal consolidation in the right lower lobe with loculated pleural effusion and multiple chest tubes on the right, no appreciable change since prior study.Small L pleural effusion [**2146-10-23**] CXR: Dense opacification of the right hemithorax with three chest tubes on the right.
Right chest tubes remain in place.
No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, theupper margin of this film.
[**2146-10-27**] AM CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the right-sided chest tube is unchanged.
He was made NPO, an NG Tube was placed, started on IV fluid, a foley catheter was placed, and he was started on IV Unasyn.
Routine labwork, CXR, and ECG were performed.
A PICC line was placed, and TPN was started.
The patient was started on a Heparin infusion, titrated until therapeutic.
On On [**2146-9-20**], the patient underwent open pancreatic necrosectomy and peripancreatic abscess drainage, open cholecystectomy with fluoroscopic intraoperative cholangiography, and placement of both a gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tubes, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, J-Tube and G-Tube to gravity, a JP drain in place, and a Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
He was continued on IV Unasyn.
On POD#1, he required multiple IV fluid boluses totalling 1.5 Liter as well as Metoprolol IV for tachycardia and low urine output with good response.
He accidentally self-discontinued his NG tube the as well, but did not require replacement.
Heparin infusion was restarted post-operatively.
He was started on trophic tubefeeds via the J-tube on POD#6, which were advanced to goal.
TPN was continued until POD#7, then discontinued.
Heparin was stopped.
Gastroenterology was consulted, recommending holding heparin, transfuse, continue PPI, and holding off on colonoscopy as inpatient unless bleeding re-occurs.
On [**2146-10-4**], the patient underwent PTC drainage of the perihepatic fluid collection with drainage catheter placed to gravity.
Given history of GIB on Heparin infusion, it was determined to start subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis only.
Foley catheter was discontinued.
On [**2146-10-7**], the PTC was capped, but then later uncapped and G-Tube vented for abdominal pain, nausea and dyspnea.
By [**2146-10-13**], he was able to tolerate a clamped G-tube, capped PTC, J-tube feeds, and sips.
The PICC was discontinued on [**2146-10-9**] and the tip sent for culture for a temperature spike.
IV Vancomycin was added to Unasyn.
The pigtail drain was replaced with a new drain of the same size for better bile drainage, as the patient did not tolerate upsizing of the drain at that time.
He was also started on IV Reglan to improve his GI motility.
IV Vancomycin and Unasyn were discontinued, and discharge planning underway.
On [**2146-10-21**], the patient initially underwent an unsuccessful thoracentesis attempt of the right side, followed by a successful right video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) decortication of loculated right pleural effusion (See Operative Notes for full details).
Three chest tubes were placed; anterior apical, posterior apical, and basilar chest tubes to suction.
Lasix x2 given with good diuresis.
[**2146-10-23**]: Restarted tubefeeds via J-tube, PCA for pain with good effect, CXR for this afternoon.
Antibiotic discontinued.
PTC drain clamped.
He was tolerating a full liquid diet PO and tubefeeds at goal via the J-tube, the G-tube was clamped, PTC drain was capped, and he had three chest tubes in place 10 15cm suction, an anterior apical, posterior apical, and basal.
He was voiding without assistance, and ambulating well with assistance due to legal blind status, and not weakness.
Also, he continued to receive Lasix approximately every other day for gentle diuresis.
On [**2146-10-26**], the culture of the pleural tissue returned with pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii complex; Flagyl was added to Cipro for more comprehensive gram negative coverage.
All three chest tubes were placed to water seal, which he tolerated.
The anterior apical chest tube was discontinued, and pneumostats were placed on the remaining chest tubes (posterior apical and basal).
He will continue on Fexofenadine and Singulair for one week to prevent recurrent delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, albeit not with completely adequate intake, and tubefeeds at goal via the J-tube, G-Tube was clamped, PTC was capped, and posterior apical and basal chest tubes had pneumostats in place.
Infectious Disease has recommended that he continue on Ciprofloxacin for at least 3 weeks, preferably for 2 weeks AFTER all his drains have been removed.
