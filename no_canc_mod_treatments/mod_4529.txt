Prominence of the common bile duct is again noted which is likely related to post-cholecystectomy status.
Subcutaneous opacities in the anterior abdominal wall likely reflect medication injection sites.
The strategy was to predilate and stent both focal lesions with bare metal stents.
Bivalirudin was administered for anticoagulation.
The LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 12 mm Voyager at 8 atms and stented with a 2.5 X 15 mm Vision stent deployed at 18 atms with no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow.
2.5 X 12 mm Voyager was used to predilate the lesion at 6 atms and a 3.0 X 15 Vision stent was deployed at 16 atms with no residual stenosis.
the patient experienced a brief episode of hypotension that responded to atropine and IV fluids after LCX stent deployment.

Successful stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5 X 15 mm Vision bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
Successful stenting of the proximal LCX with a 3.0 X 15 mm Vision bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
Successful stenting of the mid LAD and proximal LCX with bare  metal stents.
A sinus tract is seen to extend from this skin defect (series 15, image 27) and extends approximately to the plantar surface of the neoarthrosis where it communicates with a fluid collection (series 15, image 32).
As seen before, the patient is status post arthrodesis with the tibia fused to the talus.
Sepsis/Charcot foot: Underwent debridement fo plantar ulcer and was started on clindamycin and cipro.
She was covered with broad abx including vancomycin and cefepime until sensitivities revealed MSSA and antibiotics were tailored to nafcillin.
Patient was seen by ID who recommended a 6 week course of antibiotics.
Hypoxia / Pulmonary Edema: The patient was admitted initially to the medical intensive care unit for concern for sepsis, and was transfused 2 units of packed red cells and given 3L of IVF in the emergency department.
Cardiac/CAD:She developed 7/10 chest pain, and she was given SL NTG for CP Pt with exaggeration of pre-existing ECG changes, suggestive of ischemia.
Underwent stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5 X 15 mm bare metal stent and proximal LCX with a 3.0 X 15 mm bare metal stent with no residual stenosis.
She was started on flagyl 500mg TID.
She should continue flagyl for duration of nafcillin as well as 2 weeks after competion of nafcillin.
DM: Labile finger sticks with both hypoglycemic episodes and hyperglycemia requiring short term insulin gtt while in unit.
