Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
If your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
