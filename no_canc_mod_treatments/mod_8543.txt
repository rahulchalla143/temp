The patient was admitted on the 13th for a work-up of her aortic murmur and her known four plus aortic insufficiency and three plus mitral insufficiency.
She was admitted to the Cardiology Service for elective catheterization prior to her double-valve surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When she was admitted to Cardiology she was noted to be thin with a blood pressure of 124/53, saturating 98% on room air with a heart rate in sinus at 81; respiratory rate of 20.
The patient had hemodialysis one day preoperatively while also on the Cardiology Service and was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**], the Renal attending, for monitoring of her renal status.
She did have a left arm AV fistula in place and she was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery for her valve replacement.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 32377**]5th, she underwent double valve replacement with a 19 CarboMedics mechanical aortic valve and a [**Street Address(2) 11599**].
She was transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip, Propofol drip and a protenin infusion.
She was also treated perioperatively with Linezolid for her allergies and intolerance of Vancomycin and penicillin.
The patient was started immediately on Amiodarone on postoperative day one and was extubated.
She received intravenous heparin to cover her valves in preparation for starting her on Coumadin, but her platelet count continued to drop.
The patient began to require a little bit of increased amount of pressor support other than the Neo that the patient had come up on.
The patient was also started on Dopamine on postoperative day six for blood pressures that waned in the 90s over 50s.
The patient went back into sinus rhythm after the amiodarone was started and then went back into atrial fibrillation the following day.
Also of note, the central line was pulled from the right internal jugular site and there was some purulence at that site.
The patient was then immediately started on triple antibiotic therapy, Ceftazidime, Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
Pressor requirements were such that she was now on Neo-Synephrine at 5, Dopamine at 5, and she continued to be V-paced.
As sensitivities came back, the patient was switched back only to Ceftazidime, then Amikacin was added in at the recommendation of Infectious Disease on postoperative day 11.
Bilateral chest tubes were placed with a decrease in the amount of effusions.
Pericardiocentesis fluids were also sent for culture.
All of these volume management and hemodialysis issues continued to be followed on a daily and sometimes twice daily basis by the Renal Service.
The patient, at that point, had a right Quinton catheter and a left femoral A-line.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin at this point, Ceftazidime and Amikacin.
The Hyperalimentation attending saw the patient and recommended TPN changes.
The patient was on Levophed at 0.6, Neo-Synephrine at 6.0, and Dopamine at 5.0.
Pitressin was added in to the pressor regimen at 0.04.
The patient was started on Linezolid again and the Vancomycin was discontinued as it was resistant.
The patient continued to look more grave and increasingly septic as the antibiotic regimen was shifted again in an attempt to bring her sepsis under control.
On postoperative day 16, she required continuing pressor support and was increasingly more jaundiced.
She was on Dopamine at 3.0, Levophed at 0.2, Neo-Synephrine at 0.3 and Pitressin at 0.04.
She was receiving maximal pressure support with aggressive antibiotic therapy and control of her renal status and volume management by the Renal Service.
On postoperative day 17, the Quinton catheter tip came back positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
The patient continued to be followed very closely by all services, including the GI Service, General Surgery, Renal, and daily consultations by the Infectious Disease service for management of her sepsis and multiple antibiotic therapy.
She also remained on Ceftazidime and Linezolid.
She required platelets and fresh frozen plasma and heart disease increasingly worse oxygenation.
She was passing clotted blood and frank blood from her NG tube and had a systemic anasarca picture.
She was on Neo-Synephrine at 4.0, Dopamine at 4.0, Levophed at 0.5.
Prior to this day, discussions had been had by the Renal attending and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] as well as the Infectious Disease Services input as to her prognosis and maximal aggressive therapy had been attempted to try and reverse her picture, but the patient expired in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit at 05:50 a.m. on [**4-20**].
Status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement.
Status post Streptococcal infection of dialysis catheter.
Status post bilateral deep venous thromboses with placement of IVC filter.
Status post intraperitoneal bleed.
