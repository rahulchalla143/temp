Admission Date:  [**2185-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-1-4**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted [**2185-12-22**] with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.
The patient developed respiratory distress in the Emergency Department requiring supplemental oxygen, Lasix and a trial of a noninvasive ventilator.
Symptoms of congestive heart failure were controlled with a nitroglycerin drip initially.
The patient has required no further diuresis in the MICU.
Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued on [**2185-12-22**] upon arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Speech and swallow evaluation on [**2185-12-23**] recommended nectar thick liquids since the patient was considered to be at aspiration risk.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2181**] complicated by a left ventricular aneurysm status post patched graft and third degree heart block.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Cozaar 25 mg po q.d., Lasix 40 mg po q.d., enteric coated aspirin, Ambien, Lipitor, Levoxyl.
MEDICATIONS AT MICU:  Protonix 40 mg q.d., Tylenol, subQ heparin and enteric coated aspirin.
Reflexes, biceps 2+ bilaterally, brachial radialis 2+ bilaterally, patellar 1+ bilaterally.
The patient was administered tissue plasminogen activator in the Emergency Room without benefit.
She was continued on aspirin during this admission.
Captopril was added shortly after the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the floor for treatment of congestive heart failure.
Following diuresis the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 70s and 80s with mildly depressed level of alertness and responsiveness.
She was ultimately taken off of maintenance hydration and required no further fluid boluses to maintain a blood pressure in the 110s to 120s.
She also maintained good urine output and was considered to be essentially euvolemic with a creatinine at or near baseline of 1.6 at the time of discharge.
She was initially loaded on Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d.
On [**2185-12-27**] electrophysiology was consulted for adjustment of the patient's pacemaker as she was conducting her atrial rate at approximately 120 beats per minute to the ventricle.
We also discussed the possibility with anticoagulation with the neurology service given the patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter and risk for further embolic stroke.
However, after the patient was more then ten days out from the stroke on the day of discharge [**2186-1-4**] the patient was initiated on Coumadin anticoagulation at a low dose.
After the patient achieves a goal INR of 2 to 3 the patient will be considered for reattempt at cardioversion.
This will be done after a therapeutic INR for three to four weeks by the electrophysiology service.
She then responded to fluid boluses and continuous intravenous fluids for several days.
During the latter several days of the admission the patient was taken off intravenous fluids and maintained good po intake to support her blood pressures.
The patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a fourteen day course.
She should complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin and Flagyl and should be reimaged if she becomes febrile or new respiratory complaints develop.
Infectious disease:  As noted the patient was treated for a possible aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl.
She was requiring no supplemental intravenous fluids and was maintaining good urine output.
She should be continued on her prior dose of Lasix, however, should she become hypovolemic, Lasix should be discontinued and the patient should be further hydrated especially if her po intake should taper off.
From an electrolyte standpoint the patient's magnesium and potassium should be closely followed especially given current Amiodarone use.
Thin liquids should be avoided for the most part.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was maintained on Protonix during this admission for ulcer prophylaxis.
Her TSH was seemed to be elevated with a low T4 and her Levoxyl dose was subsequently increased from 50 to 75 mcg po q.d.
Coumadin 2.5 mg po q.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
Senokot one tab po q.h.s.
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.
Captopril 3.25 mg po b.i.d.
Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d.
Levaquin 250 mg po q.d.
Levoxyl 75 micrograms po q.d.
Lasix 40 mg po q.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d.
Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn pain.
Diet:  The patient should be maintained on pureed food and thickened liquids only diet.
Thin liquids should be avoided.
Coumadin is just being initiated at the time of discharge at 2.5 mg q.d.
Low dose Coumadin should be continued with potential further adjustment to achieve goal INR of 2 to 3.
Follow up will be scheduled with the electrophysiology cardiology team in several weeks for evaluation of pacemaker and potential override atrial pacing.
