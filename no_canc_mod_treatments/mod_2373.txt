She is on a home dopamine drip for the last 2.5 years.
She has had a recent admission from [**2129-3-4**] to [**2129-3-5**] for PICC line replacement and hypotension.
She was loaded on Amiodarone during her first hospital stay and DC cardioverted into a completely AV paced rhythm at a rate of 60.
She was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells on her first day of admission for a hematocrit of 21 which bumped her appropriately.
The Gastroenterology Service saw her in the hospital and will either do an upper endoscopy here while she is an inpatient and on heparin or she may have it done at a later time.
She was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells on her first day and a total of 5 units overall.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient's course of thrombocytopenia coincided with initiation of linezolid to treat her Nocardia bacteremia.
Her linezolid was subsequently discontinued and her Infectious Disease doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who follows her as an outpatient, was consulted and involved in her care and changed this medication to sulfadiazine.
She is on a home dopamine drip at 8 at baseline.
She initially required a larger dose of dopamine at 10 and has been titrated down to her home dose of 8 with good blood pressure control with a systolic from 80-100s.
She continued Enalapril, spironolactone, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**], her outpatient cardiologist, will see her in the morning.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to profound hypotension when she was admitted Her ACE inhibitor was initially held when she came in and her creatinine subsequently improved.
HISTORY OF SEPTIC PULMONARY EMBOLI SECONDARY TO LINE INFECTION:  The patient has had this from a prior admission from [**Month (only) 956**] of this year when blood cultures grew both Nocardia and a gram-negative rod nonfermenter not further identified.
She was initially on Bactrim high dose but did not tolerate this and was changed to minocycline and Ciprofloxacin but the sensitivities subsequently returned and the organism was intermittently sensitive to minocycline so she was changed to linezolid and Cipro for the last three weeks but her linezolid was discontinued during this admission as it has likely caused her thrombocytopenia.
She was continued on sliding scale insulin while she was here.
The patient's discharge follow-up plans and discharge medications will be included in a further discharge summary dictating the remainder of her hospital course.
