HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old male with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in 12/99, with peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure, who is admitted with left sided chest discomfort today, status post taking Lopressor 50 mg for an episode of atrial fibrillation.
He was given Lopressor 50 mg, Coumadin 5 mg and advised to discontinue his Plavix.
He was brought to the Emergency Department where he received a bolus of normal saline 500 cc times one and was placed on a Dopamine drip.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**].
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral popliteal bypass [**1-/2136**].
Status post right toe osteomyelitis, begun on a six week course of Vancomycin [**2136-8-12**].
Quinidine 324 mg b.i.d.
Zocor 20 mg q.d.
Celexa 20 mg q.d.
Coumadin 5 mg day number one.
Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
Captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d.
Procrit 20,000 units t.i.week.
Prednisone 10 mg q.d.
Iron 325 mg q.d.
Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
Plavix 75 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Procainamide with gastrointestinal symptoms, Amiodarone caused agitation and confusion.
Intravenous dye caused acute renal failure.
Vital signs revealed pulse 84, blood pressure 95/48 on 5 of Dopamine, respiratory rate 24, saturating 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
OTHER PREVIOUS HISTORY:  The patient has a history of an ejection fraction of 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation, status post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**] and aortic valve replacement [**1-/2135**].
Coronary artery bypass graft anatomy was left internal mammary artery to the D1, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 77 year old with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% and 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension with multiple admissions for right greater than left sided heart failure, status post a recent admission [**8-12**], to the [**Hospital1 882**] for osteomyelitis complicated by a bacteremia on a six week course of antibiotics, recently discontinued two weeks ago, now admitted with hypotension, chest pain in the setting of a beta blocker, treatment for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation [**2136-10-10**], and likely a hypovolemic state.
Cardiovascular - The patient has known coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, no angina, with prior myocardial infarction, aura at home over the last year, presents now with complaints of chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, may be related to atrial fibrillation symptoms or demand ischemia related to decreased blood pressure.
Troponin eventually increased to 3.7 possibly consistent with a non Q wave myocardial infarction secondary to a demand ischemia from hypotension.
His hypotension may be secondary to hypovolemia consistent with diarrhea as well as increasing diuretic dose as well as a beta blocker dose given yesterday.
The plan is to continue Aspirin and Heparin until rule out myocardial infarction, titrate off Dopamine as blood pressure improves with normal saline boluses, hold his ace and diuretic while hypotensive, continue Quinidine, hold Coumadin if remains in normal sinus rhythm, consider echocardiogram to evaluate for any worsening of function to explain worsening paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms and weight gain, continue Zocor.
Recently worsening secondary to possibly Vancomycin treatment or Torsemide.
Hold antibiotics at this time.
Positive diarrhea in the setting of long antibiotic course.
Heparin as above.
Endocrine - On chronic Prednisone for temporal arteritis.
The patient was given stress dose steroids in the Emergency Department without effect.
Will continue standing dose of Prednisone.
Prophylaxis - On Zantac and Heparin.
Lines - Will place a left A line, peripheral intravenous times two, Foley.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stable after admission except for mildly decreased systolic blood pressure with decrease to 70s but responded to a fluid bolus at 4:00 p.m.
The patient continued to be in normal sinus rhythm with episodes of atrial fibrillation, continued to be treated on Quinidine and anticoagulation was held.
The patient was transferred to the floor once he was weaned off Dopamine and his creatinine began to decrease.
After arrival to the floor on [**2136-10-12**], the patient was placed on telemetry and noted to have a run of 10 beats of asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia at 4:00 a.m. on [**2136-10-13**].
Also we discussed the possibility of placing the patient on Heparin drip if he was still in atrial fibrillation after 24 hours.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was continually treated with Aspirin and Zocor.
His creatinine decreased throughout the course of the hospital stay, however, it was still 3.2 on [**2136-10-13**], continue to hold his ace inhibitor for now.
The patient was started on Keflex during hospitalization which will be continued for seven days.
Zocor 20 mg p.o.
Celexa 20 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Procrit 20,000 units Monday and Friday.
Iron 325 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one tablet p.o.
Quinidine 325 mg p.o.
Prednisone 10 mg p.o.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
