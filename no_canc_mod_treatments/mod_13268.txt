She was given 4 baby aspirins, [**Name (NI) **] 150 mg PO X 1, Lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 3, then Heparin bolus 1400 units then drip 400 cc/ hour.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factors of HTN and age, with a PMHx also significant for lung cancer and colon cancer both status post resection, now admitted with AMI, found to have TO of LAD, status post stent/PTCA on [**2188-3-4**].
In the CCU, she was started on ASA, [**Known lastname **], high-dose Lipitor and continued on low-dose Captopril, later held in the setting of worsening renal failure.
She was also started on Dobutamine for inotropic support.
Integrilin was not given post-procedure given her age and high bleeding risk.
Beta-blockade therapy was held.
Both medications were eventually stopped on [**2188-3-8**], and she remained hemodynamically stable.
Beta-blockade therapy was subsequently reinitiated, along with ACE, and both were titrated up in hospital.
Given her low EF with concomitant apical akinesis, she was started on Heparin IV.
The latter was stopped in the setting of dropping hematocrit and guaiac positive stools.
She was also deemed a poor candidate for long-term anticoagulation given a prior history of falls, and anticoagulation was not resumed in hospital.
She was discharged on ASA, [**Date Range **], Lisinopril 10, Toprol 50, and Lipitor 80.
She will need follow-up LFTs given high-dose statin therapy.
Consideration could be given to titrating beta-blockade therpay as an out-patient.
She initially responded poorly to Lasix boluses for diuresis and was started on Natrecor in addition to Dopamine.
Lasix diuresis was resumed on [**2188-3-8**] with doses of 20-40mg IV per day and good diuresis.
ACE inhibitor therapy was temporarily held in the setting of renal failure and reintroduced for afterload reduction.
She was also placed on standing Lasix 20 mg PO qd prior to discharge.
