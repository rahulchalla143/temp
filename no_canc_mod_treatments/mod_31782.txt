Admission Date:  [**2101-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-2-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Temporary pacer wire placement [**2101-2-20**] Permanent pacer placement [**2101-2-21**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with history of CHF (EF 50%), hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, SSS, HTN, and COPD, who presented to the ED s/p syncope.
She then had a second episode requiring sustained transcutaneous pacing, at which time the EP fellow was called for temporary pacer placement (patient still DNR/DNI but wanted a pacer).
CXR [**2-21**]:  A right internal jugular temporary pacing lead has been placed with the distal tip extending into the right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Status post temporary pacing lead placement with lead extending into right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, SSS, CHF with EF 50%, HTN, COPD, who presented s/p syncope, with sinus arrest in ED.
On the night of admission she had a temporary pacing wire placed into her RV.
She fortunately had external pacing wires attached in anticipation of the possibility of malfunction of the internal temporary wire, and she was therefore able to be paced externally until a new temporary wire could be placed later that night.
The following night she had a permanent VVI pacer placed in her RV, set at 60 beats per minute.
Her coumadin was held during the admission for the procedures, and has been restarted on the day of discharge at 5 mg.  She will need frequent INR checks until her coumadin becomes therapeutic.
2) CHF:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] received 2 L NS during her ED course, initially for presumed dehydration causing syncope, and also for mild hypotension during the placement of the temporary pacer wire.
She was maintained on her usual 80 mg PO lasix daily, and diuresed 1.8 L on the first day, 1.3 L on the second day, and another 1.4 L on the third day.
4) HTN:  The patient was occasionally hypertensive to 140s systolic during the admission, however it was not felt that new medications were warranted.
She was maintained on 3L via nasal cannula with O2 sats 97%.
7) PPx:  She receieved SQ heparin for prophylaxis of DVTs.
