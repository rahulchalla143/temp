1.
Respiratory distress: multifactorial --> afib exacerbation, CHF exacerbation, r/o aspiration, r/o MI, pleural effusion, chronic lung disease (obstructive/restrictive) -r/o MI with enzymes/ekg's -r/o aspiration with bedside swallow exam --> f/u with video swallow if needed; previous swallow study was WNL and pt's mental status is much improved now, so will transition from IV to PO meds and monitor for aspiration as we await speech/swallow recs -continue supplemental O2 -treat CHF/afib as per below -hold on aspiration pna treatment for now -consider thoracentesis if pleural effusion does not respond to diuresis [**5-19**]: echo performed shows normal EF but increased TR (moderate to severe) [**5-20**]: diuresed a little more overnight, trying diamox today given increased bicarb; checking PA/lat CXR to r/o other process and assess interval change in pleural effusion [**5-21**]: giving more diamox as CXR shows persisting pleural effusions and labs still reveal an elevated bicarb; now down to 1.5L of O2 requirement [**5-25**]: giving diamox for increased weight and crackles on exam  2.
Cardiac: HTN, afib, diastolic dysfunction CHF, r/o MI -for now, rate control with IV/PO lopressor; [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] IV lopressor dose with PO dose 30 minutes later -telemetery -r/o MI with ekg/enzymes -lasix as bp tolerates, with goal of OFF supplemental O2 -will hold on afib anticoagulation pending d/w family re: goals of care, fall risk -repeat echocardiogram this admission to recheck EF, r/o any new WMA's, r/o clot -low likelihood that afib mgmt will involve cardioversion or antiarrhythmics given pt's age and multiple comorbidities [**5-20**]: better rate control on TID lopressor; starting ACE [**5-21**]: pt declining increased dose of lopressor but will continue attempting to give this to her given afib rate in 90's - 100's [**5-25**]: pt more compliant with meds, rate responding adequately; per family discussion no anticoagulation for afib given risks  3.
Mental Status Changes: likely back to baseline as she is making good sense right now and is not lethargic; her metabolic picture and hypoxia may have contributed to her delirium earlier  -continue to monitor mental status; family discussion will help this -start multivitamin -orient pt q shift if possible -hold sedating meds [**5-20**]: at baseline [**5-21**]: noted to have Enterococcus UTI despite negative UA; UA repeated and now markedly positive; Enterococcus is R to levaquin but S to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and vancomycin; b/c pt is allergic to penicillin and nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in pt's with her creatinine clearance, pt was started on linezolid x 3 days (course to end [**5-23**]); foley catheter was kept in b/c of issues with poor urine output --> no evidence of urinary retention, and pt always responded well to diuretics; ?
poor forward flow from her CHF [**5-23**]: UTI also has MRSA growing in it; will extend linezolid coverage to 10 days to treat both enterococus and MRSA; MRSA precautions started [**5-25**]: pt has had daily recurrence of her R inguinal hernia, always reducible at the bedside but causing significant anorexia and abdominal pain when not reduced; per family discussion, given pt's very recent cardiopulmonary problems (new afib, Class [**Name (NI) 1105**]/IV heart failure, chronic lung disease) she would be at extremely high risk for cardiopulmonary demise perioperatively --> deferring surgery at least 1-2 months, will need almost daily reduction of hernia at the bedside and this is preferable to surgery at this time  4.
FEN: QD-[**Hospital1 **] lytes, consider clears vs. NPO given ?
aspiration risk, diurese to goal OFF supplemental O2 [**5-19**]: speech and swallow consult obtained --> no evidence of aspiration, food type recommendations left in chart (see d/c plan for more info) [**5-20**]: pt developed hypernatremia which resolved with IV free water repletion [**5-23**]: free water repleted, no further problems  6.
PPX: aspiration precautions, subq heparin, bowel regimen, pboots, MRSA precautions  7.
