Of note, patient's coumadin had been stopped prior to the surgery with plan to restart on post-operative day 10.
[**Name (NI) **] wife called 911 with concerns of seizure and patient was back to baseline at time of EMS arrival.
The patient had no post-ictal symptoms of language difficulties, bowel/bladder incontinence, tongue biting, changes in vision, diaphoresis, pain.
Of note, patient was recently supratherapeutic on his dilantin but found to be subtherapeutic yesterday on admission at 8.6 (corrected for albumin).
Patient was given 1.75L of NS with 40mEq KCL and Diltizem 15mg IV + 30mg PO and heart rate decreased to the 90s.
In the MICU, patient was continued on Diltiazem 30mg PO four times daily and home digoxin with good atrial fibrillation rate control.
He has previously been admitted to an outside hospital for pain control due to his refractory gout.
Patient has been on colchicine and probenecid, and was given Dilaudid 4mg PO + 1mg IV with some alleviation of pain.

On transfer to floor: T=99.1 BP=126/80 HR=96 RR=22 O2=99% on 2L NC PHYSICAL EXAM GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing, NAD, slow speech HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Unchanged 5mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Patient is status post median sternotomy.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo male with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (rhythm but not rate controlled), acute on chronic subdural hematoma, aortic valve replacement who was called out of the MICU on POD 8 s/p craniotomy and evacuation, for transient altered mental status (?seizure) and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
No focal neurological deficits are observed on CC7, except for patient's post-op slowing of speech and word finding difficulties.
Differential diagnosis included hypovolemia vs. cardiac ischemia vs. seizures vs. stroke.
Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had had seizures given the lack of post-ictal symptoms.
Patient continued to be monitored on telemetry without issues (remained rate controlled throughout remainder of admission) and was continued on Diltiazem and Digoxin.
Patient's coumadin continued to be held despite original Neurosurgery plans to resume on post-operative day 10 (Saturday, [**10-2**]).
Patient has a porcine valve, so does not need anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding into his subdural was felt to be higher and more serious than the less than 1-2% risk of emboli from unanticoagulated atrial fibrillation.
Patient was continued on Dilantin which, after adjustment for albumin, remained at a serum level of 10.0 (therapeutic).
Patient was given intravenous fluids while in the ED and MICU.
