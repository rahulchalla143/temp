However, it was discontinued after an increase in his creatinine.
A nonsteroidal which had been started for his pericarditis was also discontinued prior to discharge.
The patient was maintained in a soft collar while in bed and in a hard collar while ambulating.
Anesthesia was made aware of the patient if he needed intubation it would need to be fiberoptic.
Gout:  The patient was continued on his allopurinol.
Anemia:  The patient had intermittent anemia during the admission and was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**2114-3-28**].
His anemia and need for an outpatient colonoscopy will be followed up by his primary care physician.
