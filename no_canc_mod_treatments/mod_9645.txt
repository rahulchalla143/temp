HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old man who was initially sent from the nursing home where he resides to [**Hospital6 8972**] on [**2146-7-1**] for gangrene of his right second and third toes.
His antibiotics were changed from Cipro to Vancomycin and Rifampin.
Atenolol was discontinued due to bradycardia.
Pacemaker was not placed due to MRSA bacteremia and because the patient was not hemodynamically stable.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained for evaluation endocarditis and was notable for a large left ventricular thrombus, a decreased EF equal to 15-20% with globally decreased systolic function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, thickening of aortic valve, trace mitral, aortic, and tricuspid insufficiency.
He was begun on Heparin for the left ventricular thrombus.
On [**2146-7-7**] the patient was begun on Dopamine for bradycardia, both sinus and junctional, with relative hypotension.
3) Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin with retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications: Lipitor 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol 100 mg q d, NPH 22 units q a.m., 16 units q h.s., Humalog 2 units q a.m., 8 units at dinner, Nitro patch 0.4 mg from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Nitro 0.4 mg sublingual prn, Celexa 40 mg q d, Flomax 0.4 mg q d, q h.s., Coumadin 2.5 mg q d, Colace 100 mg q d, Tylenol prn, Milk of Magnesia prn.
Medications on admission to [**Hospital1 188**]: Dopamine drip 7 mcg/kg/minute, Wellbutrin 50 mg q d, Lipitor 20 mg q h.s., Colace 100 mg q d, Nitro patch 0.4 mg on in the a.m. and off at night, Flomax 0.4 mg q h.s., Allopurinol 100 mg q d, Celexa 40 mg q d, Rifampin 300 mg [**Hospital1 **], Vancomycin renal dosing, Insulin NPH 11 units subcu q a.m., 8 units subcu q p.m. and a regular insulin sliding scale, Heparin drip as per protocol.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the MICU, the patient's admission labs at [**Hospital1 69**] were as follows: White blood count was 22.4 with 96% neutrophils, hematocrit 33, platelet count 353,000, sodium 125, potassium 4, chloride 92, CO2 17, BUN 109, creatinine 4.4, glucose 93, calcium 6.9, magnesium 3.2, phosphorus 7.5, albumin 2.8, ALT 35, AST 47, LDH 291, alkaline phosphatase 117, total bilirubin 5.2, triglycerides 87, Vancomycin level 13.5, lipase 85, troponin 1.9.
ID:  The patient was initially begun on Vancomycin and Rifampin IV.
Vascular:  Vascular was consulted on [**2146-7-8**] and their recommendation was that the patient requires a right above the knee amputation since transmetatarsal amputation would not control the infection adequately.
Cardiac:  A PA catheter was placed on [**7-8**] for management of acute renal failure.
The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and given fluid to keep wedge greater than 18, however, this did not improve renal perfusion.
Furthermore, Dopamine drip was attempted to increase cardiac output and chronotropia, however, this caused his cardiac output to drop and SVR to increase and therefore was discontinued.
The PA catheter was pulled on [**2146-7-10**] and his blood pressure has since improved.
Currently Aspirin was held given the risk of bleeding with pericarditis as well as patient being pre-op for surgery.
His ectopy seemingly resolves with management of potassium and magnesium.
A uremic friction rub was auscultated on [**2146-7-9**] indicating uremic pericarditis, hemodialysis was initiated for treatment of this.
A Heparin drip was continued for the left ventricular clot.
His Rifampin and Lipitor were discontinued due to this.
Renal:  Hemodialysis was initiated on [**2146-7-9**] for uremic pericarditis.
The patient had a high phosphate level secondary to acute renal failure which was treated with calcium carbonate tid.
Heme:  The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells on [**2146-7-8**] with good response of hematocrit from 28.2 to 35.1.
The patient received a dose of Epogen on [**2146-7-9**].
The patient's high phosphate level is treated with calcium carbonate tid and Amphojel times two days.
Psychiatry:  It was recommended by psychiatry consult that Wellbutrin and Celexa be held at this point.
Labs on [**2146-7-12**] when the patient was transferred to the medicine floor, white blood cells 21.3, hematocrit 33.2, platelet count 138,000, PT 15, PTT 67.8, INR 1.6, sodium 135, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, CO2 24, BUN 35, creatinine 2.1 and glucose 138, calcium 7.5, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 3.2, total bilirubin 13.7.
Extremities, 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities, 2+ pitting edema in bilateral upper extremities and hands.
Vancomycin levels were checked q day to determine dosing.
The patient was treated with Nystatin swish and swallow to treat his thrush.
Vascular:  The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2146-7-15**] for a right guillotine BKA.
Due to the patient's critical condition and after consultation with anesthesia, it was seemed safer to proceed with the guillotine right BKA under MAC anesthesia and to proceed with AKA at a later date after some of the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues have resolved.
This is somewhat improved when the patient's potassium and magnesium are above 4 and 2 respectively.
The patient was continued on Heparin sliding scale for left ventricular thrombus treatment.
It was determined with discussions with the attending that the patient's arteries are significantly calcified and therefore pose difficulty in obtaining appropriate blood pressures.
An abdominal ultrasound obtained on [**2146-7-14**] for evaluation of the biliary and urinary systems showed no signs of biliary or urinary obstruction and was positive only for gallbladder sludge.
Renal:  The patient continues on hemodialysis approximately every other day.
The patient was receiving hemodialysis through a left femoral Quinton catheter until [**2146-7-16**] when the catheter was pulled.
The patient will require placement of Perma-cath on Monday, [**2146-7-18**] in preparation for hemodialysis on Tuesday, [**2146-7-19**].
Hematology:  The patient is on Heparin sliding scale for the left ventricular thrombus.
His hematocrit was stable subsequent to his transfusions in the MICU until [**2146-7-15**] when his hematocrit dropped to 28.7 and after surgery the patient's hematocrit was 27.8, therefore he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells with good response to hematocrit of 30.3.
This does not preclude him from getting further transfusions as the blood bank will merely screen for these antibodies in the future.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  When the patient was transferred out from the MICU, he was on tube feeds running at 35 cc per hour.
The patient began to take better po on [**2146-7-15**] being begun on a renal diet.
Calorie counts will be performed and need for tube feeding in the future via NG tube will be assessed.
Endocrine:  The patient is currently on a regular insulin sliding scale for his type 2 diabetes.
He will be restarted on his NPH regimen once adequate po intake is established.
Psychiatry:  The patient has a history of depression, we are holding his psychiatric medications as per psych consult's request.
