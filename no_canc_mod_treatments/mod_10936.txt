At that time, he underwent a percutaneous intervention and had balloon angioplasty.
Subsequent to this, he had a recurrence of his anginal symptoms in [**2152-9-6**], therefore prompting another cardiac catheterization which showed a re-narrowing of the similar left anterior descending lesion and consequently underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, brachytherapy, and cutting balloon.
After completing that, the patient was chest pain-free until approximately one week prior to this admission, when he began with the crescendo anginal symptoms, chest pain and shortness of breath that prompted him to be admitted on [**2153-1-19**], where he underwent cardiac catheterization showing a right dominant circulation system with a 70% left anterior descending lesion with 90% distal disease past the site of the stent.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2152-7-7**], percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2152-9-6**] with brachytherapy and cutting balloon.
He has also had an appendectomy in the distant past.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Aspirin 325 mg once daily, Toprol 100 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, Cozaar 50 mg once daily, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, and a multivitamin.
Consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] revealed that he necessitated coronary artery bypass graft, and the patient subsequently went to the operating room on [**2153-1-22**].
In the operating room, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] performed a coronary artery bypass graft x 4, with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal I, sequentially to the obtuse marginal III.
He was on amiodarone and milrinone, as well as epinephrine, propofol, nitroglycerin and Neo-Synephrine.
He was brought to the Cardiac Surgical Recovery Unit, where his drips were weaned to amiodarone .5, milrinone .6, and Neo-Synephrine .5 to maintain cardiovascular parameters of 83 and sinus, blood pressure of 99/40 after two units transfused, as well as shovel mask at 100% for the arterial blood gas of 7.34/46/113/26/-1.
His milrinone drip was weaned.
He was kept on oral amiodarone for ventricular ectopy and ventricular tachycardia that had occurred postoperatively.
Lasix and Lopressor were held for blood pressure issues.
He was started on a regular diet, and given a regular sliding scale insulin postoperatively.
He was given a 48 hour course of Diamox to start his diuresis.
His lasix, Lopressor and aspirin were subsequently started.
His BUN and creatinine were 19 and .7 on day number two, and he was continuing on oral amiodarone.
By postoperative day number three, the patient was up and mobilizing with Physical Therapy without any difficulty.
His wires were removed on postoperative day number three.
He was given a physical therapy and rehabilitation screening, which ultimately revealed that he was ambulator and independent enough to warrant discharge to home.
The right saphenous vein graft site was clean, dry and intact, well approximated.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 25 mg by mouth twice a day, K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth every morning for seven days, Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day, Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice a day, aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth twice a day to continue for one week and then change to 400 mg by mouth once daily for two weeks and then end, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, percocet 5/325 one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed.
He will have a wound check in seven days.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft x 4 for crescendo angina and re-stenosed stent 2.
