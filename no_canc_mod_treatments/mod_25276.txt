The patient underwent an SFA stent on the right on [**2176-3-10**].
He received a shock of 100 [**Doctor First Name **] at 835 for presumed VT (strip not available), and underwent epi x 1 and atropine x 1, and 2 amps of calcium.
At this time, he received 4 rounds of CPR, and received 1 amp of epi, 1 amp vasopressin, 1 amp atropine, and 3 amps of calcium, 2 g of magnesium, and started a dopamine gtt.
Also initated insulin and D50.
The patient also had an external trancutaneous pace placed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a question of further management with potential bypass surgery, transffered on heparin gtt, dopamine gtt.
OP with ETT and OGT.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:     Basal InferoseptalBasal AnteroseptalBasal Anterior     Basal InferiorBasal InferolateralBasal Anterolateral 	Mid InferoseptalMid AnteroseptalMid Anterior Mid InferiorMid InferolateralMid Anterolateral 	Septal ApexAnterior Apex Inferior ApexLateral Apex 	Apex          N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum, inferior wall, and apex.
The nasogastric tube and intra-aortic balloon pump are malpositioned as described above.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2176-3-13**] 5:45 PM IMPRESSION: Low position of intra-aortic balloon pump, proximal position of orogastric tube, and change in positioning of transvenous pacing lead.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with HTN, HLD, DM, no known CAD s/p SFA stent for RLE non-healing ulcer, who coded x 2 at [**Hospital3 **], found to have diffuse 3 vessels disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with possible surgical intervention.
# PUMP: The patient was felt to be in cardiogenic shock on arrival, initially on dopamine gtt, ultimately uptitrated to 3 pressors with dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin.
The patient's bedside echos both at OSH as well as in-house showed  focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum, inferior wall, and apex, as well as dyskinesis of the distal inferior wall.
The patient was supported with 3 pressors, and balloon pump was continued at 1:1.
Patient was continued on heparin gtt, ASA, Atorvastatin, and Plavix for a presumed myocardial infarction.
# RHYTHM: The patient was noted by OSH reports to have been in 3rd degree heart block, and during his codes was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia, with variations between [**Hospital1 **].
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Patient is not a candidate for Artic Sun Cooling protocol given the amount of time since his event and start of cooling.
He was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam, and  # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine is 3.1, up from a baseline of around 1.3 per OSH records.
# Goals of care: The patient's prognosis was very poor on arrival given his his focal wall motion abnormalities, his poor neurologic status, his rise in creatinine, and the rise in his lactate, and rise in his LFTs.
