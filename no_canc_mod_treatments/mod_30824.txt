Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F Mitral regurg, probable diastolic dysfunction intially admitted with delirium probably secondary to hyponatremia, poor PO intake, and severe pain [**12-21**] L1 compression fracture.
She was given NS which precipitated volume overload and pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation.
This was therefore thought to be as a result of combination SIADH as well as hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Her pain regimen was tailored during her stay.
She continued her rehabilitation at the [**Hospital1 100**] House.
She was started on Lisinopril and continued on her metoprolol and ASA.
