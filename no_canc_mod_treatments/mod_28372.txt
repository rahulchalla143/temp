To treat likely progressive pulmonary fibrosis started on pulse dose steriods with 1gm solumedrol daily.
Also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc, cefepime and azithromycin given possibility of superimposed infection in setting chronic immunosuppression.
As patient was too unstable for CT scan or brochoscopy, she was also initiated on empiric therapy for PCP PNA with IV bactrim.
Given limited data that acute decompensated pulmonary fibrosis may be improved with anticoagulation, patient was started on heparin gtt.
Given dismal prognosis, patient decided to shift goals of care first towards DNR/ DNI and then to comfort measures only.
She was initiated on morphine SR to decrease work of breathing and symptoms improved slightly.
After discussion with health care proxy, medical regimen was narrowed to morphine gtt.
