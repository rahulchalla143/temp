Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2454**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

A small color Doppler signal (#50) is seen c/w a small secundum type atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt flow.
Mild, focal, ascending colon bowel wall thickening and peri-colonic fat stranding consistent with colitis.
The faster frequencies seen without the usual posterior predominance are very suggestive of medication effect.
Her pain was relieved temporarily on Morphine & acetaminophen, but the patient declined these medications.
Given her history of upper extremity DVTs we maintained her on a heparin drip until her INR returned to the therapeutic range.
Bacteremia:  The patient was admitted with a L PICC line in place for Vancomycin therapy for MRSA bacteremia from [**Hospital **] per her report.
Her PICC line could not verified on CXR, so it was removed, tip cultured and replaced under IR guidance.
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended TEE to exclude endocarditis.
Upon exclusion of endocarditis, the patient was continued on Vancomycin until [**2156-12-6**] and the patient's PICC line was removed.
She was continued on heparin while her INR became therapeutic between [**3-14**].
Through communications with her outside psychiatrist, it was determined that the patient would be tapered off of Lithium given her polyuria/incontinence.
She had received one dose of prednisone taper from [**Hospital1 2177**] before admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
She was maintained on Advair & Atrovent as needed.
MICU Course: The patient was transfered to the MICU on [**2156-12-9**] after becoming hypoxic, acidotic, and hypercarbic in the setting of being more somnolent after refusing CPAP at night.
She was called out the floor the evening of [**12-11**], but returned to the ICU after becoming agitated and refusing to use CPAP at night.
The patient was placed on 2L NC with pulse oximetry monitoring.
She maintained O2 sats in the mid to upper 80s for most of the night, but desatted to the low 70s again and CPAP was placed on her face while she continued sleeping.
To maintain her oxygen saturation and prevent hypercarbia, the patient must wear BiPAP or CPAP mask while sleeping.
Her settings on discharge with a nasal BiPAP mask were inspiratory pressure 16, expiratory pressure 6 with 12 L O2 to keep O2 sats >88%.
Throughout her MICU stay, psychiatry continued to follow the patient in consultation to assist with adjusting her psychiatric medications and guiding the psychosocial aspects of her care.
Given her two incidents of unresponsiveness (one hypercarbic and the other respiratory alkalosis) they recommended decreasing her abilify from 20 mg to 15 mg on discharge.
They also recommended crushing her medications and doing mouth checks given the patient's history of stockpiling medications and a lingering question of whether taking extra medications may have contributed to one or more of her epidoes of unresponsiveness.
