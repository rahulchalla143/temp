He was treated with lasix, metolazone and nitro and transferred to the CCU.
His CHF was treated aggressively over weekend with above medications but his CHF persisted.
He was also maintained on Milrinone drip at -.25mcg/kg/min & Heparin drip at 1000units/hr PTT 63.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

He is not aware of a diagnosis of CAD and he stated he had never had a catheterization but he had taken nitro for chest pain in the past.
Pt was continued on ASA 325mg and Clopidogrel 75mg (loaded already at OSH) and Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
Pt continued on heparin gtt which had also been started at OSH as well as metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Labetalol was uptitrated to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge with labetalol used as beta-blocker since also has alpha-blocking characteristics and there was concern that pt would continue using cocaine in [**Hospital1 3782**] setting and have unnopposed alpha constriction on pure beta-blocking [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
#Substance Abuse: Patient had been actively using cocaine and this is certainly contributing to his cardiac disease.
CAD portion of disease was managed as above and ACE-I was held due to renal failure.
Pt was diuresed with lasix to remove additional volume.
Patient's baseline creatine 3.5, elevated to 4.2 at time of admission.
His [**Last Name (un) **] may be related to poor perfusion in setting of NSTEMI or may be related to ischemia [**2-1**] cocaine use.
An ACE-I was held as above due to renal failure and decision was made to postpone either cardiac surgery or cardiac cath due to thought that this would push pt over the edge to requiring dialysis and thought that in setting of very poor social stability that this would lead to a worse prognosis than medical management of his disease.
He had already received levofloxacin as an outpatient (though pt is unclear how many doses he received) and ceftriaxone at OSH (day 1= [**2164-2-24**]).
Beta-blocker changed to labetalol for reasons noted above and dose uptitrated to 150mg PO BID by time of discharge.
# HLD: patient has been on simvastatin 20 mg po daily in the past for hyperlipidemia but has been off of it for ~3 weeks.
He was started on high dose atorvastatin for the first few days and then had dose down titrated slightly before discharge.
# DMII: patient has history of diabetes mellitus type, previously on pioglitazone at home, but has not taken in >3 weeks.
Pt transitioned to very low dose of glipizide (2.5mg daily) when blood sugars ran high for a few days in the hospital.

We gave you lasix to get rid of the fluid and we started you on new medicines to help your heart beat more efficiently.
You will need to take these new medicines to help your heart pump better and failing to take them will cause you to become significantly worse.
It is also very important that you see a kidney doctor (nephrologist) to prevent your kidney function from worsening so you can avoid needing dialysis for as long as possible.
STOP taking Actos, Levaquin, Metoprolol and amlodipine 2.
Start taking furosemide 40mg(lasix) once daily to prevent the fluid from building up in your lungs 3.
Start Glipizide 2.5mg to control your blood sugar 4.
Start taking labetolol 150mg to decrease your heart rate and blood pressure 5.
Start taking a baby aspirin (81mg) daily, you will need to take this every day for the rest of your life 7.
