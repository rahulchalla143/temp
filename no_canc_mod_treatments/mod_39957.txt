We have increased the dose of your lisinopril to 30 mg twice/day (from 20 mg twice/day) because your blood pressure was elevated on admission and during your hospital stay.
You blood sugars have been better controlled on this regimen and you should continue this insulin at home as instructed.
You were started on oral antibiotics for this and the infection is improving.
Please complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed.
You are being discharged on narcotic pain medication.
Take this medication as prescribed.
Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation so it is generally recommended that you take an over the counter stool softener such as colace or milk of magnesia to avoid constipation.
Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking narcotics, as these medications cause sedation.
You can continue to take tylenol to help control your pain.
Do not exceed > 4 gm of tylenol in 24 hours.
It is being recommended that you have further cardiology evalation as an outpatient.
