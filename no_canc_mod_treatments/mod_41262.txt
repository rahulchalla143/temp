4. cholelithiasis no cholecystitis.
Bladder contains a Foley and is poorly visualized due to being empty.
To address her left chest pain, she was given tylenol and oxycodone with good result.
She was followed closely by cardiology who recommended restarting her home aspirin but no further intervention.
By HD 2, she was fully oriented, tolerating a regular diet, on minimal oxygen and with pain well controlled.
Urine electrolytes were obtained that indicated the patient was prerenal and dry and so she was given a bolus of IV fluids.
With the IV fluids she developed flash pulmonary edema and was transferred back to the TICU on [**2189-3-15**] with respiratory compromise.
Lasix was given and she was started [**Female First Name (un) **] nitro gtt.
She was placed on intermittent CPAP, which was able to be weaned with diuresis and the nitro gtt was subsequently turned off.
On [**2189-3-16**] her respiratory status was stable on minimal nasal cannula and her chest x-ray showed significant improvement in edema (See pertinent results for details).
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission for her right frontal IPH who recommended no need for antiseizure prophylaxis and outpatient follow up one month from discharge.
Given that the patient had prior evidence of chronic renal insufficiency with a documented creatinine of 1.6 one year a few months ago and was clinically "dry" on exam, it was recommended that she be given IV fluids at a slow rate in order to rehydrate and avoid pulmonary edema.
It was also recommened to hold her gemfibrozil and change her home PPI to an H2 blocker which was done.
Her foley catheter remained in place for urine output monitoring, which remained adequate.
Incentive spirometry and pulmonary toileting were continued, along with scheduled nebulizer treatments.
With this, her oxygen saturation remained within normal limits on minimal nasal cannula supplementation.
The patient was encouraged to mobilize out of bed as tolerated throughout her stay, and was started on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis 48 hours after her injury.
She is being  discharged to acute level rehab to continue her recovery.
