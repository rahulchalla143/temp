Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thrombectomy of right iliofemoral graft, femoral-femoral graft, patch angioplasty of right femoral artery and left femoral artery with saphenous vein.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 60M with history of right sided stage III laryngeal cancer diagnosed in [**2099**] and treated with chemotherapy (adjuvant taxol and cisplatin followed by taxol, cisplatin and etoposide for three total cycles) and radiation (62g to right neck and vocal cords).
For this, right common iliac artery to common femoral artery bypass and femoral-femoral cross-over graft were performed.

The nasogastric tube and the left internal jugular central venous catheter remain in good positions.
The patient has undergone gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy.
These areas have heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder has a Foley catheter within it and is incompletely distended.
Native right common iliac artery distally and the external iliac artery is occluded with an old stent in place.
The iliac-femoral graft is widely patent.
Just distal to its insertion within the right common femoral artery, there is a right to left femoral-femoral bypass graft which is widely patent.
This is just superior to an excluded partially thrombosed old femoral- femoral bypass graft which contains gas within it, likely from recent surgery.
Just distal to the insertion site of the femoral-femoral bypass graft on the left is a round fluid collection that on pre-contrast images is heterogeneous in density and post-contrast images shows a small amount of contrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries with progressive increased density dependently within the collection seen, making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm.
Patent right common iliac- femoral bypass graft and right to left femoral-femoral bypass graft with patent superficial femoral artery distal to the bypass grafts in the visualized portions.
Just distal to the left insertion of the fem-fem bypass graft with findings are highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm.
[**Female First Name (un) **] ultrasound of this area is recommended to further evaluate.
Gas and fluid about the bilateral femoral [**Female First Name (un) 1106**] operative sites and gas within the old thrombosed fem-fem bypass graft likely related to surgery.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted and started on anti-coagulation secondary to LE graft coagulopathy.
Patient was started on a heparin gtt with goal of 60-80.
Patients Coumadin was initially held.
Patient was given an epidural.
Patient tolerated procedure and in PACU area it was noticed that Hct levels had come down.
Patient's anticoags were held while he got his transfusion and then was re-started.
Patient was continued on broad spctrum antibiotics(Vanco/Clinda/Ceftaz/Flagyl).
Patient's groin dressings were continually monitored during this time while in the unit where it was noticed to be draining.
Patient was screened for HIT and started on Argatroban.
Patient transferred to VICU and Argatroban and Coumadin were re-started.
Through-out the patients entire hospital stay the goal was to acquire a therapeutic state between (2.0-3.0)  Patient was started on Lovenox sq on final hospital day and it was explained to patient that when he get's discharged from hospital he won't be able to check his lovenox levels.
It was suggested to patient that he stay in the hospital until his PT becomes therapeutic but the patient requested he leave and go home on Lovenox sub-q.

If there continues to be drainage from your incision, place dry gauze over it.
This measures the level of coumadin in the blood.
You are to take Lovenox untill the Coumadin (INR ) is between [**2-5**].
Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge.
When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
You may have staples and or sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks.
