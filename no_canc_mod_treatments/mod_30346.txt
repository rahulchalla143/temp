Troponin negative.
Hypotension, as well as cardiogenic shock, are listed as adverse reactions to mexilitine overdose.
She may have ingested other medications that we are unaware of.
Baseline bradycardia precludes use of Betablocker in her, despite history of CAD.
Appears to have happened repeatedly before around time of her dosing and also given her extremely large doses of clonazepam (9mg per day).

Transaminitis: The patient had transaminitis upon ICU admission, likely secondary to mexilitine as this has been described.

Her medications were adjusted given degree of elevated liver enzymes.
