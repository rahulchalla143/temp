He was subsequently anticoagulated with lovenox, aspirin, coumadin.
Past Medical History: 1. bilateral frontal hemmorrage- in setting of MVA, c/b L sided weakness 2. h/o enterobacter and staph aureus pneumonia   Social History: lives at home with girlfriend and kids.
no calf tenderness or swelling neuro- CNII-XII intact, LUE/LLE weakness 4+/5 (old), 2+ patellar reflexes b/l.
[**2115-10-10**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]: There has been no interval change in the appearance of the cervical spine from the prior examination.
While in the MICU, heaprin gtt intially started but then a head CT showed an increased size in the hematoma.
He was unchanged neurologically but risks outweighed benefits of anticoagulation therefore it was decided to persue a removable [**Hospital1 **] filter.
His pain was controlled with morphine prn.
On [**10-11**] he c/o worsening chest pain and SOB with sats notable for 92% on RA which improved with supplimental oxygen.
He was therefore started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia and rapidly improved.
His oxygen sats improved rapidly as he was able to take deeper breaths and as his pneumonia was treated.
His fever and leukocytosis also resolved.
With regard to anticoagulation, subdural hematoma on head CT [**10-14**] looked stable and the decision was made to reattempt anticoagulation on [**10-15**] with heparin nomogram at starting rate 15U/kg no IV bolus and coumadin 3mg.
Heparin was stopped.
He is now being transferred to [**Date Range **] for further management.
Impression: 57 yo M with bilateral PE's, evidence of RLL collapse vs dense consolidation, likely pneumonia, PTX, s/p traumatic [**Hospital1 **] with bilateral subdural hematoma with expansion on heparin now s/p [**Hospital1 **] filter placement .
Interestingly chest CT seems to indicate free-air w/in RLL and also in pleura.
RLL pneumonia that has been improving on levoflox + flagyl.
- plan 2 wk course of levoflagyl (from start [**10-11**]) - repeat CTA chest in 6 weeks to confirm resolution of RLL collapse .
# Bilateral pulmonary embolus: given expansion of subdural hematomas, are not pursuing anticoagulation currently.
The patient is s/p placement of removable [**Month/Day (4) **] filter on [**10-9**].
Etiology likely hypercoagulablility from immobilzation at home/recent trauma.
- reanticoagulate as per neurosurg's preference .
- Management as per neurosurg .
The [**Month/Year (2) **] filter remains in place and he will not be restarted on anticoagulation for 3 months.

Metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) for 6 days: Discontinue [**2115-10-26**].
Continue levofloxacin and flagyl and discontinue them on [**10-26**], [**2115**].
