Admission Date: [**2202-3-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2202-5-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-6-14**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   The patient is a 59 year old, diabetic male status post renal transplant in [**2196**] and right THR in [**2197**], who was admitted from an outside hospital on the 26th with approximately seven days of right hip pain and chills.
At that time the patient also had an increasing creatinine with right upper quadrant tenderness on exam.
Upon initial consultation, the renal service felt that the patient's worsening creatinine was consistent with ATN with question of FK toxicity.
The patient was intubated on [**3-24**] for airway protection.
As a result, the orthopaedic service was consulted and removed the right hip prosthesis and replaced it with a Girdlestone on hospital day eight.
The patient was in the SICU on a ventilator and was getting nutrition by tube feeds.
On hospital day 11 the patient had a postpyloric feeding tube placed and Zosyn was started for t-max of 100.7 and a white count of 17.9, trending down to 16.6.
However, he began to exhibit profound weakness and cogwheel rigidity.
On hospital day 16 the patient had a tracheostomy placed due to his dependent ventilation needs.
Patient was continued on his regimen of medications.
Tube feeds were held.
The patient's operative site where the Girdlestone was performed was deemed to be erythematous and full.
It was hypothesized that a possible tap would make sense, however, due to the patient being on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, it was decided to take a wait-and-see approach.
On hospital day 23 the patient had a PEG placed and continued to spike some low grade temperatures.
The patient's medications were titrated as well, however, his white count was 11.2 on hospital day 28 with no other signs or symptoms of infection.
Amphotericin B was held off to treat the candidemia.
