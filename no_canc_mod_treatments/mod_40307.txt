EMS got no control for Versed administration but were unable to intubate her.
She was easily bagged with an oral pharyngeal airway in place.

Post-surgical changes from recent right craniectomy and right temporal lobectomy.
[**2192-8-19**] MRI neck New edema in the posterior paravertebral soft tissues of the upper cervical spine compared to [**2192-8-15**], which is of uncertain etiology, but may sometimes be seen secondary to prolonged supine positioning.
[**2192-8-24**] Abdomen No evidence of ingested foreign body within the abdomen  [**8-27**] Gtube check  Large pneumoperitoneum with tip of PEG tube within lumen of the  stomach.
CT head [**2192-8-30**] Rim enhancing fluid collections seen within the right temporal fossa, right frontoparietal subcutaneous tissue and right frontal lobe, which is concerning for abscess formation.
In this setting, the contrast in the colon could have resulted from prior passage after a G-tube study, which was done two days earlier.
The right-sided extra-axial and scalp fluid collections demonstrate "simple" fluid with only thin and discontinuous rim enhancement more suggestive of post-surgical seromas.
[**2192-9-3**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] 1.
The fluid seems to be interconnecting, but follow-up exam is recommended to monitor for loculation and abscess formation.
Since the prior study, patient is now status post cranioplasty with a small extra-axial collection with a dense linear-appearing area withing in which may be related to duraplasty but close followup to exclude hemorrhage is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Admission synopsis: 30F ped struck, mass lesion from multi-focal ICH s/p R craniectomy, PEG for enteral access c/b leak s/p ex-lap, JT placement, L sc CVL c/b ptx requiring CT, now resolved convalescing well with improving mental status, tolerating tube feeds, and without CT.  Trauma SICU Course: The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] following polytrauma as a pedestrian struck with , primary survey notable for impending airway compromise and asymmetric fixed pupillary exam.
She was subsequently intubated and underwent CT scan following completion of primary and secondary survey revealing intracranial hemorrhage with signs of midline shift and herniation.
Pt was emergently brought to the operating theater for R craniectomy and subsequently admitted to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment and management of her traumatic brain injury.
Injuries: - Complex L temporal bone fracture - Multi-compartment ICH (R SDH, R frontal contusions, SAH, +midline shift, +herniation) - R ptx  Neuro: Mass effect from multifocal ICH s/p R craniectomy.
The patient received seizure prophylaxis without evidence of seizure activity during ICU course.
(-CXR-) (-CT-) Pt arrived to floor with (-) chest tube to low continuous wall suction.
CXR on post-operative day (-) demonstrated resolution of pneumothorax and chest tube was placed to wall suction.
Repeat CXR demonstrated no reaccumulation of pneumothorax and chest tube was removed with final CXR demonstrating fully re-expanded lung (-).
(-Home oxygen therapy-)  GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
(-TPN-)  PICC line established with proper position confirmed and was started on TPN for (-).
Pt was discharged with VNA services for PICC line monitoring and TPN administration as needed.
Antibiotics:  The patient received peri-operative intravenous antibiotics.
(-Abx-) (-Ostomy-) Pt received ostomy teaching post-operatively with understanding and agreement to care plan verbalized.
A VAC dressing was placed at bedside and changed (-).
The patient received wound vac teaching.
(-VNA-) VNA services were arranged for wound monitoring and dressing changes.
Insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Patient was anticoagulated postoperatively with (-) a heparin drip Coumadin was (-re-) started prior to discharge and titrated to (-) therapeutic levels with close outpatient follow-up arranged for continued monitoring.
(-) Pt was discharged on lovenox bridge and received lovenox teaching prior to discharge.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots during this admission and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
Disposition: (-DNR/DNI-) (-CMO-)  ACS/Trauma Surgery Floor Hospital course: The patient was initially transferred to the floor on [**2192-8-19**] and did well on tube feeds using a dobhoff.
She received a PEG on [**8-24**] and TF were resumed the next day.
She underwent a partial gastrectomy, abdominal washout, and placement of a J-tube.
Was kept intubated given concern for evolving sepsis.
Neurologic status continued to improve over subsequent days with patient interactive and following commands on intermittent basis.
Given concern for possible brain abscess MRI was repeated [**9-1**] and likelihood of abscess based on this was considered low.
CV: Fluid resuscitation continued postop with combination crystalloid/colloid fluids.
Beta blockage [**9-4**] for persistent sinus tach.
A chest tube was placed and put on suction [**8-31**].
Chest tube re-positioned [**9-1**] for persistent PTX.
Re-positioned [**9-4**] and placed to water seal at midnight [**9-4**].
Persistent PTX seen and placed back to suction [**9-5**].
GI/GU: Patient was NPO postop and resuscitation was carried out with crystalloid/colloid fluids.
Central line removed [**9-5**] and sent for culture.
Her chest tube was put to water seal without leak and was pulled on [**9-7**].
Her JP drain was pulled out on [**2192-9-10**] after minimal serosanguinous output.
Her scalp incision sutures were removed on [**9-12**].
She followed commands although she was intermittently confused and continued to pull on her lines and at her scalp.
She was continued on TF through her J-tube without further complications.
Thus, she remained NPO with only J-tube feeds.
ID recommended per-operative Meropenum for a bone flap swab result of phingomonas.
She received perioperative antibiotic therapy with Meropenem, gentamycin and ciprofloxacin.
Two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were removed on POD1 [**9-21**] as output tapered to less than 30cc over 8 hours, staples were placed for closure of the drain sites.
Once the drains were removed Ciprofloxacin and gentamycin were discontinued.
Meropenem will continue for a 2 week postoperative course for prophylaxis of the bone flap.
Careful titration of pain medications as well as PRN ativan and trazadone for sleeping helped to improve her symptoms of restlessness and insomnia and by POD4 the patient was less restless and her family noted that she had returned to her pre-cranioplasty sleep patterns.
Her tubefeeds were titrated up to goal and at the time of discharge she is tolerating her tube feeds at goal, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Overnight on POD 4 into POD 5 she was restless again and recieved trazadone and ativan.
The ativan was not well tolerated so Seroquel was given.
On [**9-25**] she received 2 doses of Geodon IM for her agitation and then had an episode of emesis likely related to the Geodon administration.
As such it was discontinued and Seroquel was again ordered standing for agitation.
She was sent with instructions for followup with both neurosurgery for postoperative evalaution and with plastic surgery for evalaution of her incision and removal of her sutures.
Acute right sided subdural hematoma and incipient herniation 4.
Acute bloodloss anemia   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have been removed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), Continue to take this antiseizure medication as prescribed.
Your broken bones and internal injuries are healing but you have a traumatic brain injury that will take lots of speech and occupational therapy to help with improvement.
* You will need to work hard in Physical Therapy and Occupational Therpy so that in time you can get back home and continue therapy.
?Please return to the office [**2192-10-2**] for CT head at 8:45 and then in Clinic at 9:30AM for removal of your staples, sutures for a wound check with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
