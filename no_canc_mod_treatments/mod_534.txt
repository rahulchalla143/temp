# SPUTUM Procedure Date of [**2170-10-21**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion, admitted with unwitnessed acute-onset hemoptysis and pleuritic CP.
--TB rule-out: Pt was placed in isolation pending TB rule-out based on reported history of hemoptysis.
Levofloxacin was begun with goal 10 day course, which was later discontinued given possible suppressive effects on AFB.
--Autoimmune lung disease: Given isolated R-sided findings, low suspicion existed for Wegener's or Goodpasture's, but ANCA and anti-GBM were submitted and, respectively, were negative or pending on discharge.
Pt was converted to PO pain medications and monitored for response.
Pt placed on CIWA scale with diazepam 10mg PRN, as well as administered thiamine, folate, and MVI.
# During day, pt repeatedly removed O2 NC; when asked why, pt stated that it "fell off" without him knowing, despite NC being securely in place.
Later, pt took off telemetry monitors, placed it in an empty plastic [**Location (un) 6002**] box, taped the box closed, and then presented it to the nurse.
Pt was monitored on telemetry and initially continued on metoprolol.
On the floor, pt had no subsequent incidents of PAF, and anticoagulation was deferred without evidence of thrombus or PE.
# Sedation leading to respiratory depression leading to MICU admission: Over the course of his hospitalization the patient has had an escalating pain medication requirement for right sided chest pain.

He received 30 mg valium per CIWA on [**10-23**] and 10 mg on [**10-24**], none on [**10-25**] (purposefully stopped after patient returned from bronchoscopy with an oxygen requirement).
He received 125 mcg of fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam for the bronchoscopy on [**10-24**].
After consultation with the pain service, he was given 200 mcg narcan IM followed by repeat doses of IV narcan (total 0.88 mg) with good result.
