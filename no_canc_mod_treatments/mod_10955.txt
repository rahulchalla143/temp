HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an right coronary artery stent in [**2134-3-15**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four (SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2, SVG to diagonal, and LIMA to LAD), who presented with 5 out of 10 substernal chest pain after a short walk associated with diaphoresis.
He called EMS and was given Nitroglycerin and Aspirin with no change in his chest pain.
Catheterization revealed 100% right coronary artery occlusion at the stent and underwent Angioject with stent times two proximal and distal to the original stent.
The patient was treated with Dopamine.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], the patient percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to his right coronary artery in [**2134-3-15**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four in [**2134-3-15**].
The patient had saphenous vein graft to OM1, saphenous vein graft to OM2, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, and LIMA to left anterior descending.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.
q.d., Diovan 160 mg p.o.
q.d., Hydrocortisone enema q.12 days, Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Prednisone forte ophthalmic 1% one drop O.U.
q.i.d., Imdur 60 mg p.o.
q.d., Milk of Magnesia p.r.n., Tylenol p.r.n., Asacol 800 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Klonopin p.r.n.
Electrocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1760**] revealed ST elevations improved in II, and III, and AVF, as well as reversal of T-wave inversions in I and AVL.
Catheterization revealed 100% right coronary artery stent occlusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2134-3-15**], for inferior myocardial infarction, with right coronary artery stent, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four in [**2134-3-15**], who presented with inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular extension status post right coronary artery stent.
He had total occlusion of his right coronary artery stent and underwent Angioject and stenting proximal and distal to the original stent.
From a coronary artery disease standpoint, the patient underwent intervention to treat 100% occlusion of his right coronary artery.
He was initially hypotensive requiring Dopamine likely secondary to decreased preload state.
He was given intravenous repletion, and the Dopamine was able to be weaned off.
The patient was restarted on his beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor.
He was discharged on Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
and Zestril 5 mg p.o.
He had received a ................, Heparin, Aspirin, and Plavix.
He was given 1 U packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit to 28.5 on the day of discharge.
He was maintained on Protonix for his Barrett's esophagus.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.
q.d., Zestril 5 mg p.o.
every 12 days, Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Prednisone forte 1% drops 1 to both eyes 4 times a day as directed, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
pain, Asacol 800 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o.
The patient was advised not to take Imdur or Diovan until seeing his primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular extension with right coronary artery total occlusion status post Angioject and stenting times two.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times four.
