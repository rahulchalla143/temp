Her recent history is notably for being hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 12089**] with fevers and culture negative sepsis presumed to be due to a line infection for which her HD catheter was removed and replaced.
A viral NOS/flu syndrome was suspected, pt was admitted on droplet precautions for flu r/o.
She was given 2mg of morphine and became more somnolent and nauseous but stated that her pain was better controlled.
Purulent material was noted to be weeping from her HD line and she was also tachypneic.

Acute cholecystitis cannot be ruled out.
Multiple new hypodense geographic regions in the liver, spleen, native kidneys and renal transplant that are concerning for hypoperfusion / infarcts.
Cholecystostomy tube in situ, with post-procedural low-density lesions in either side of cholecystostomy tube within the right lobe of the liver that could represent biloma, hematoma, but cannot exclude abscess.
Gas within the lower pole of the renal transplant is new since the previous CT, and is felt likely to relate to prior instrumentation, although gas-forming organism cannot be entirely excluded if infection is present.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, subsequently developed respiratory failure and was intubated.
The patient was started initially on meropenem and vancomycin which was narrowed to nafcillin once MSSA was cultured.
Other possible etiologies were examined including pneumonia, c.diff., cholycystitis, influenza, endocarditis, UTI, etc.
The patient was given IVF to increase MAP and became fluid overloaded and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring intubation.
The patient was given phenylephrine to keep her pressures above a MAP of 65. .
For some time she was off pressors though not able to be weaned from the vent.
Starting on [**7-6**], the patient had consistent hypotension and new degrees of fever, and had a repeat echo and CT torso as well as broadening of antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and meropenem.
The CT torso showed multiple infarcts in the liver, spleen, native kidneys and renal transplant concerning for hypoperfusion/infarcts.
Micafungin was added.
The patient continued not to improve on antibiotics and had dramatically increasing pressor requirements, requiring consistent use of two pressors.
Microbiology results which returned after her death showed VRE-positive blood cultures from [**7-8**] and urine culture from [**7-5**] (resulted on [**7-9**]), with blood cultures returning as positive in the setting of having been on vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin at the time, suggesting that the VRE (as is common) was not sensitive to meropenem, though specific sensitivity testing to meropenem was not performed.
The patient was started on heparin sliding scale, aspirin, statin, metoprolol for rate control (once pressures tolerated).
The patient's sedation was increased and lidocaine drip was started with resolution of arrhythmia.
Lidocaine was discontinued with stable rhythms.
# Hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient presented to the unit after receiving IVF for rescucitation.
Her work of breath increased and she was intubated for hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She had fluid removed with CVVH and HD and had CXR which showed improvement in her volume status.
The patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator secondary to agitation with lifting of sedation and poor NIF scores.
Her HD line was removed due to suspected infection and was replaced 48 hours later.
Her low dose prednisone was continued as were nephrocaps and cinacalcet.
