She was started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
She was seen by GI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15831**] during the admission, who recommended conservative management and consideration of elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient.
Of note, she was consented for laparascopic cholecystectomy this morning.
She was given her usual dose of metoprolol (12.5mg) this morning.
Per the family, she had been complaining of back pain   She had been admitted twice within the past year for choledocholithiasis ([**8-/2162**] with two 8-10mm stones in CBD, sphincterotomy/stent but no stone extractions; [**11/2162**] stone extraction and stent removed).

She was admitted to surgery, started on cipro/flagyl, and monitored with serial exams as her functional status and comorbidities did not make her a good candidate for surgery.
In the setting of her sepsis (see below), surgery continued to opt for medical management and her coverage was broadened to include vancomycin and zosyn (started [**5-25**]).
Vancomycin was discontinued when the bacteremia pathogen was identified (Strep milleri).
She was discharged with instructions to continue broad coverage for GI pathogens with zosyn for 2 weeks, followed by a course of penicillin G (renally dosed).
She was intubated and stabilized in the ICU, and was transferred to the floor with all blood cultures from [**5-27**] being negative at time of discharge.
It was decided that she would not be a good candidate for further imaging with trans-esophageal echocardiogram, so she will be treated for a 6-week course of antibiotics for presumed endocarditis based on TTE.
#) Respiratory failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] required intubation secondary to respiratoy failure in the setting of sepsis and NSTEMI.
Since being on the floor, she has remained >95% on 2L nasal cannula and continues to breath comfortably.
Cardiology evaluated her and recommended 3 days of heparin gtt ([**Date range (1) 83455**]).
Her creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection to 1.1 at time of discharge.
This was most likely musculoskeletal, so we treated with lidocaine patch and standing Tylenol.
Her current planned treatment with 6 weeks of targeted antibiotics would be appropriate for discitis/osteomyelitis as well.
We were also concerned that this pain was recurring in the setting of cholecystitis, but we were treating with antibiotics and already determined that she was a poor candidate for surgical intervention.
This new pain regimen was initiated on [**5-31**] so it will be important to monitor for effectiveness on discharge.

You required intubation in the ICU, but you recovered with antibiotics, you were extubated, and you were transferred to the floor.
Because of your extensive infection, you were too ill to have surgery to remove your gall bladder.
Because of the infection of your valves, you will need antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
After that, please take Penicillin as prescribed for 4 weeks.
