Admission Date:  [**2183-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-8-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents / Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, 3vd  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PCI with stenting of LAD   History of Present Illness: 60 yo M with h/o ESRD, IDDM, CAD, CHF (EF 15-20%), CVA ([**6-16**]), ANS dysfxn admitted to OSH with syncope [**Date range (1) 73815**].
1st episodes of syncope occurred a week prior after an extra HD session with 6L fluid removed, although pt denies preceding symptoms.
He had several more episodes of syncope and traumatic falls resulting in hitting his head on the driveway, and losing consciousness for a few minutes.
He was started on heparin.
Repeat MRI performed on [**7-17**], heparin stopped, and placed on ASA 650mg daily.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p PCI in '[**96**] at [**Hospital 1514**] Hosp EF 25% DM II x 17 yrs hx neuropathy, nephropathy ESRD on HD x2 yrs MWF, [**Location (un) 11252**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33564**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73816**]) hx pancreatic rupture 17 yrs ago, s/p pancreatic debridement, mesh placement with poor wound healing, resultant DM L fem-popliteal bypass graft s/p R CEA ([**Hospital 73817**] Hosp in [**Location (un) 31628**], NH) approx 10 yrs ago - hx small CVA at time of CEA with R Bell's palsy, resolved GERD Glaucoma .
30-40% proximal with 95% complex lesions at the take off of a large diagonal.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis, and distal septal/apical hypokinesis, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
[**8-2**] MRI/A: FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Foci of hyperintense signal within left centrum semiovale and in the anterior portion of the right centrum semiovale on diffusion images with corresponding T2 and FLAIR abnormalities.
MRA OF THE NECK: IMPRESSION: Right internal carotid artery demonstrates signal loss and narrowing of the flow signal suggestive of high-grade stenosis.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRA or CTA would help for further assessment of the stenosis if clinically indicated.
The lesion in the mid LAD was predilated with a 1.5mm and 2.0 mm balloons, stented with two 3.0 mm stents and post dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon with lesion reduction to 0%.
3. the RCA lesion was crossed easily with a ChoICE PT XS wire This procedure was postponed.
Successful stenting of the LAD (Drug eluting) 2.
We considered CABG evaluation and angioplasty.
After neurology evaluated patient's MRI/A and taking into consideration patient's comorbidities and witnessed recurrence of CVA symptoms with decreased blood pressure, patient was determined by CT Surgery to be high risk for open heart surgery and the decision was made to undergo PCI.
Pt was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a HCT of 29.5 before the procedure.
[**8-6**] cath revealed a mid LAD lesion of 80% and a 70% instent restenosis distal to this lesion.
The lesion in the mid LAD was stented with two 3.0 mm drug-eluting stents with lesion reduction to 0%.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was continued on aspirin, plavix, stain, and ACEI for the remainder of the hospitalization.
ASA was continued at outpatient dose of 650mg daily, but later decreased to 325mg later in his course.
EP said placement of an AICD not indicated at this point.
Lasix 40mg po bid was started with hopes that during HD a lower volume could be drawn off in the ultrafiltrate, as hypotension was associated with HD.
Gabapentin for neuropathy was d/c'd due to concern for hypotension.
lisinopril was decreased to 2.5mg and coreg was held initially per hypotension, but coreg was gradually increased to 6.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to control BP.
The patient was maintained on a cardiac, diabetic diet, PPI, and SC heparin.
Medications on Admission: CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 650 mg daily Coreg 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 5 mg daily Crestor 10mg daily Prozac 20mg daily Insulin NPH 16 U qAM, NPH 8 U qPM Pantoprazole 40 mg daily Phos Lo 667mg tid with meals Timolol eye drops one drop each eye once daily Epogen with dialysis 2x/wk gabapentin 300mg daily lasix 80mg po bid (makes approx [**2-11**] cup urine daily)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Community Nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Care,Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: syncope, CAD/ CHF Secondary: HTN, hyperlipidemia, ESRD on dialysis, CVA, diabetes, glaucoma   Discharge Condition: good; hemodynamically stable, afebrile, VSS, ambulating well   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of passing out.
For this reason, 2 drug eluting stents were placed in your artery.
You were started on a new medication, Plavix, which will help to thin your blood to prevent clots around these stents.
Your lisinopril was decreased to 2.5mg daily and your lasix was decreased to 40mg twice daily because of your low blood pressure.
Please take your previous medications as prescribed.
