Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of DM2 c/b nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%, CAD s/p CABG x2, CKD, recent sinus infection c/b endopthalmitis, admitted for subdural hematoma, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, in the setting of supratherapeutic gabapentin levels, s/p hypertonic saline treatment with good response.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  Patient's creatinine was 2.2 on discharge from Mass Eye & Ear and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a creatinine of 6.0.
Of note, patient had received CT with contrast at [**Hospital 13128**] on [**2169-6-11**].
Gabapentin, gemfibrozil and diuretics were held.
Other medications such as allopurinol, levofloxacin, and linezolid were renally dosed.
# HYPONATREMIA:  Patient's sodium was 125 on admission.
Patient was given hypertonic saline and her fluids were restricted.
Neurosurgery felt that surgical intervention was not indicated and did not recommend initiation of antiepileptics.
Plavix was held (last stent in [**2162**]) but ASA was restarted.
# GABAPENTIN TOXICITY: patient's gabapentin level was 41 on this admission, which was likely related to her acute on chronic kidney disease.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient initially presented with confusion, hallucinations and associated muscle twitching.
Likely multifactorial in the setting of gabapentin toxicity, ARF, SDH and hyponatremia.
Unclear whether it seeded from her sinus infection or from other source (?sternal wound infection)  Patient was continued on eye drops and antibiotics.
# PANCYTOPENIA:  Likely in setting of prolonged Linezolid course.
Patient was admitted on levofloxacin and linezolid for endopthalmitis (course was to be finished on [**7-4**]).
However, she was seen by ID who suggested that antibiotic regimen be switched to levofloxacin and daptomycin (in setting of marrow suppression).
She will finish her levofloxacin and daptomycin course on [**7-4**].
Antibiotics were switched to levofloxacin and daptomycin (as above) to complete course on [**7-4**].
Metoprolol was initially held given low BP but soon resumed after BP normalized.
Lasix was initially held due to [**Last Name (un) **], but soon resumed because she was volume overloaded.
After kidney function recovered, she was actively diuresed (first 60 mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **], then 120 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **]) with goal of negative 1-2 L a day.
She was kept on home lantus with insulin sliding scale.
Follow up volume status and adjust Lasix dose as needed 3.
Sleep study is recommended given pulmonary hypertension 4.
