The patient was admitted to [**Location (un) **] and found to have a HR up to 120; he received IV lopressor with a drop in his blood pressure.
He was placed on renally-dosed dopamine and BP meds were held.
He was placed on IV heparin for atrial fibrillation.
Dopamine was continued but as his blood pressures improved, he was started back on a beta blocker and aldactone.
At the time of transfer, the patient was still on dopamine at a rate of 7.5.

Patient had catheterization in [**3-12**] which demonstrated 2 vessel coronary disease (90% distal LCx stenosis, 60% distal RPDA stenosis).
Patient has a history of afib and was thought to have an underlying atrial rhythm, so EP was consulted and his AICD/pacer was interrogated which showed Atach/Afib with multiple mode switches.
Patient was continued on a heparin drip.
Given patient's restrictive left ventricular dysfunction it was felt that rhythm control would not provide much benefit as the atrial kick would not contribute significantly to filling.
Rate control was targeted with IV lopressor which was titrated up as his blood pressure tolerated, to achieve a HR 70-90bpm, and he was eventually switched to po metoprolol 25mg po TID.
He was weaned off the dobutamine drip.
Metoprolol was switched to Toprol XL prior to discharge.
Patient was sent home on Coumadin 2.5 mg po qday and the heparin drip was discontinued.
The patient had an EF of 10% at OSH and 20% on echo done here, and was grossly volume overloaded with total body anasarca.
Patient was determined to be in decompensated heart failure and was maintained on a milrinone drip, which was titrated up to 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and a lasix drip which was titrated up to 15mg/hr.
250mg IV Diuril was added daily to assist in diuresis, with good effect.
We slowly attempted to change him to po meds, starting first by taking him off the lasix drip and giving bolus doses of IV lasix after po metolazone (thiazide diuretic).
Eventually milrinone was d/c'd and Lasix was switched to po dosing with stable hemodynamics.
Patient was sent home on Lasix 100 mg PO BID and metolazone 5 mg PO BID, 30 minutes prior to lasix.
If patient becomes more symptomatic with increased shortness of breath, please titrate home oxygen therapy to comfort and administer roxanol prn.
Care was made to avoid placement of BP cuff and RUE and the edema appeared to decrease with overall diuresis.
Not on treatment with statin.
DM: On lantus with sliding scale insulin with fingersticks QID.
Oral diabetic meds were held while in the hospital.
Patient to continue on sliding scale with Lantus 20 units QHS.
Anemia: Patient on home iron.
During the course of the hospitalization the Cr remained stable at 2.1-2.5, in spite of aggressive diuresis.
A meeting was held with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in which the family expressed a desire for no escalation in care, with continuing to manage medically to d/c to [**Hospital3 **] with hospice care.
