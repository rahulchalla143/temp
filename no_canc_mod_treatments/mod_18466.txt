He was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, status post prostate surgery seven months prior to admission, and he has had a previous colectomy for diverticulitis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day, Zetia 10 mg by mouth once per day, Mavik 4 mg by mouth once per day, Toprol 25 mg by mouth once per day, Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day, and folic acid daily.
The patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
Postoperatively, he was atrially paced via his temporary epicardial wires, and he was on Neo-Synephrine and propofol intravenous drips.
On the night of surgery, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated.
He was weaned off of his Neo-Synephrine drip by the morning of the next day.
He was treated with intravenous metoprolol and ultimately with an amiodarone bolus and amiodarone intravenous infusion.
However, after he had been started on the amiodarone and the Lopressor his rate was much more controlled in the 80 to 100 range with a blood pressure of 110s to 130s while he was in atrial fibrillation.
It was then decided that because the patient was tolerating his atrial fibrillation from a hemodynamic standpoint that the best course of action would be to continue his amiodarone and metoprolol but to anticoagulate him for the atrial fibrillation.
His chest tubes were removed on postoperative day two.
He began to ambulate well with Physical Therapy and continued to progress in the usual fashion from a cardiac rehabilitation standpoint.
An intravenous heparin drip was initiated on postoperative day five due to continued episodes of atrial fibrillation, and Coumadin was also begun at that time.
The patient then stayed in the hospital for the next few days on the intravenous heparin drip waiting for his INR to increase with the Coumadin so that he could go home anticoagulated because of his atrial fibrillation.
It was felt appropriate to discharge him home and to discontinue his heparin drip as his INR was approaching his goal of 2 to 2.5.
