The PICC line tip is in the SVC.
Stabilized with fluids while in ICU.
- CT abdomen and pelvis - no evidence of infection - RUE US, no evidence of DVT to explain swelling--most likely from lymphedema from breast cancer s/p excisions and radiation treatment - Urosepsis also a possibility, as GBS 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL did grow out of urine.
- ID consulted - Started on empiric vanc & ceftriaxone pending culture data, gave fluid bolus, then transferred to the MICU for further workup and management of sepsis.
- Blood cultures x2 were positive for gram posiive cocci in pairs & chains, final speciation of Group B strep - Urine cultures grew pansensitive Proteus mirabilis >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML and GBS 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML - Antibiotics narrowed to ceftriaxone alone on [**2145-9-3**] - TTE shows severe aortic stenosis, high risk of endocarditis in setting of GBS bacteremia, so we opted not to do TEE.
Will treat empirically for endocarditis with 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.
- [**Month (only) 116**] consider workup for inflammatory myositis if proximal muscle weakness persists after resolution of infection - Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is unlikely given acute onset, but held atorvastatin during hospitalization; restarted on discharge - IVF, monitor for pulmonary edema / dyspnea given history of diastolic heart failure - Creatinine improved markedly with volume resuscitation and source control from peak of 1.5 to 1.1 upon transfer back to floor from ICU, on discharge was 1.3, which is near baseline.
Was started on a heparin drip overnight on night of admission for possible ACS, but was discontinued prior to transfer to the unit as demand myonecrosis was the most likely explanation for elevated cardiac enzymes, and suspicion for ACS was low.
- Cardiac echo showed LVEF 55% and severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2) with moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP 43mmHg) - CK significantly elevated & initially trended up 4062->5032, MB stable 21->22, troponin 0.2->0.45, all of which resolved with control of her infection and volume resuscitation  # AS w/ diastolic CHF: h/o CHF with preserved systolic function (LVEF > 55%), severe AS, mild AR.
Then placed on home lasix.
- Furosemide 20 mg, Lisinopril 40 mg, metoprolol held while septic, but gradually restarted.
- Monitored resp status closely given IVF hydration for rhabdomyolysis as above, pt appeared clinically euvolemic and was satting well on RA, but CXR showed worsening fluid status, so diuresed with 20mg IV lasix ONCE then transitioned back to home lasix.
- No urgent need for aortic valve surgery.
# RUE swelling:  is s/p mastectomy & LN excision.
Likely etiology:  congestive hepatopathy, fatty liver (as evidenced by CT scan) - Trend weekly as outpatient per OPAT - Consider hepatitis panel as outpatient for r/o.
# UTI: Proteus - Treat for week long course given diabetes, on ceftriaxone for GBS bacteremia as above.
# Stage IV CKD: 1.3-1.8 is approximate baseline.
Day before discharge, was hypertensive (BP 135-180), restarted all home meds previously held for hypotension.
- [**Month (only) 116**] consider adding calcium channel blocker as outpatient if hypertension persists.
# Subgaleal hematoma s/p fall - No change in mental status  HEALTHCARE MAINTENANCE # DM: A1C of 6.1 on [**4-1**] - Held home glipazide, restarted on discharge - HISS # Spinal stenosis: Had started pregabalin recently.

You suffered a fall and developed a condition called rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle) from being on the floor for a prolonged period of time, for which we treated you with IV fluids.
You were found to have an infection in your bloodstream, for which you will complete several weeks of IV antibiotics.
TRANSITION OF CARE - You will need to complete 4 weeks of IV antibiotics, you will have weekly blood tests and follow-up in the infectious disease clinic  MEDICATION CHANGES - START IV ceftriaxone 2g daily, take as directed by the infectious disease clinic  Followup Instructions: You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the infectious disease clinic with a plan for outpatient follow-up of your bloodstream infection.
