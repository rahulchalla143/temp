Neurosurgery was consulted for the spinal fx and recommended C-collar to be worn at all times, MRI of C-spine, logroll precautions and TLSO.
A traction pin was placed in the R femur until the surgery was performed.
An IVC filter was not placed intraoperatively, as the patient's veins were not able to be cannulated.
An IVC filter was placed by Interventional Radiology without complications.
Neurosurgery evaluated patient and determined a non-operative approach to her spinal injuries, as she is young and will likely regain more spinal mobility without an operation.
She is to wear TLSO at all times for L1 fracture and a hard C collar at all times as well.
