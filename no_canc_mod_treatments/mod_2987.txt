The night prior to admission, she may have blown her nose and then developed perfuse epistaxis with clots that would not stop despite nasal packing.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where she received a six pack of platelets and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for an initial platelet count of 13 and a hematocrit of 19.
Of note, she also received clindamycin for nasal packing prophylaxis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for lower extremity edema since [**2182-12-12**], as well as increasing fatigue for approximately one month.
Negative for falls, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, sensation of cold, sinus headaches, chest pressure, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dark stools, bloody stools, dysuria, easy bruising or bleeding aside from epistaxis.
She then received combination therapy and despite this her CD4 count has never been greater than 400 and since having been on triple drug regimens, she has never had complete viral suppression.
Her opportunistic infections include Cryptosporidium and candidal esophagitis, Salmonella and herpes labialis.
She is HCV arthropathy and has received interferon once a week.

Split S1 increased with inspiration, nondisplaced point of maximal impulse, midsystolic click midway through the systolic phase.
Differential:  88% neutrophils, 0% bands, 9% lymphocytes, INR 1.0.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given perfuse epistaxis in the setting of thrombocytopenia with drop in hematocrit to 19.
Epistaxis:  Patient had nasal packing in place and was evaluated by the ENT Service.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2183-3-17**] demonstrating hypolobulated megakaryocytes with an adequate number of megakaryocytes suggesting that steroids might be beneficial as the diagnosis of ITP was considered.
The Hematology Consulting Team recommended beginning prednisone at 1 mg/kg for one week to empirically treat the clinical diagnosis of ITP.
The antiplatelet antibody results are still pending and IVIG was considered, but it was felt that prednisone would be a first fine [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute renal failure with protein in the urine and decreased albumin the serum suggesting a nephrotic syndrome.
This was augmented with the use of Lasix 40 mg po q.d., as well as Aldactone 100 mg po q.d.
with prn doses of Lasix 40 intravenously with an average urine output subsequently of 500 cc.
Of note, there was no evidence of FSGS which would be present in the setting of HIV nephropathy, nor was there any evidence of hypertensive nephropathy and thus ACE inhibitors were not initiated.
Initially she had not been antiretroviral therapy, but four days prior to discharge, she was started on two protease inhibitors (atazanavir 400 mg q.d., as well as fosamprenavir).
Azithromycin was continued for outpatient regimen once per week.
Although, Bactrim was held initially given the side effect of thrombocytopenia, at the time of discharge, the patient was restarted on Bactrim Double Strength once a day on Tuesday's and Friday's which was a decrease from the previous dosing of three times per week.
It was felt that this could be secondary to drug fever in the setting of Neupogen administration.
It is thought that the hepatitis C is currently suppressed, however, given the initiation of steroids at reasonably high doses, the viral load should be closely monitored.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis:  The Lasix and Aldactone were continued as above.
She was initially maintained on a Dilaudid PCA with no basal rate and prn rate of .05.
This was converted to po form of 2 mg at the time of discharge, as well as continuing the standing medication OxyContin 40 mg q.a.m.
Depression:  She was continued on citalopram.
She had been on Unasyn for a five day course.
This was changed to levofloxacin for a total of ten days.
As a result, a right femoral line was placed under standard protocol on [**2183-3-14**].
This was discontinued on [**2183-3-17**] at the time that a PICC line was placed by Interventional Radiology.
This is a single lumen PICC and was left in place at the time of discharge for potential platelet transfusions.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  She was maintained on Renagel and Tums for hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia.
Prophylaxis:  A proton pump inhibitor, Colace, senna, ambulation and Pneumoboots were used.
Prescription for daily CBC check, as well as typed and screened for platelets at [**Hospital 3320**] Hospital.
