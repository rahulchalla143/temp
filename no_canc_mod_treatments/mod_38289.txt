He was maintained on an insulin drip in the immediate post-op period for his diabetes.
Lasix drip was initiated for diuresis.
He converted to sinus rhythm prior to discharge and was maintained on PO amio and anti-coagulated on coumadin.
INR became supra-therapeutic, and coumadin was held.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Vasopressors were finally weaned off and Beta blocker was initiated.
