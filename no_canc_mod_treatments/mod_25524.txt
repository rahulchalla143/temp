Correlation with laboratory evaluation is advised to exclude pancreatitis.
Umbilical and inguinal fat-containing hernias.
Brief Hospital Course: 48M with COPD and HTN, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS and septic shock.
Appeared to be pneumonia on presentation(aspiration vs. CAP vs. HAP given recent hospitalization) Unlikely to be ARDS given focal consolidation on initital CXR.
The patient was intubated prior to transfer and initially required fairly heavy ventilatory support- AC FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 12 to keep sats in a good range.
Post-extubation the pt was hypertensive and persistently hypoxic- this was thought to be [**1-25**] flash pulmonary edema and responded well to nitro gtt, IV enalapril and lasix.
Started on broad spectrum coverage with vanc/levoflxacin/zosyn.
BPs rapidly improved with bolus IVF, weaned rapidly off dopamine then levophed on HD2.
He completed a 7 day course of levo/zosyn and was transferred to the medical floor with a PICC in place to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for his GPC bacteremia.
Discharged home with plans for vancomycin administration q24h for 4 days more to complete the course, with PCP monitoring of [**Name Initial (PRE) **] vanc trough level.
Shock physiology had resolved, so patient was back on almost all of his antihypertensives (still holding atenolol on discharge) and without hypotension, and with improvement in his laboratory values that had previously been indicating septic shock.
He was started on steroids, initially solumedrol, he left the ICU on prednisone 40mg daily to complete a 14+ day taper.
He will need outpatient pulmonary follow up which was scheduled for him, with a better daily regimen, so he was discharged with advair and spiriva and VNA for inhaler teaching.
# Lower extremity edema: believed d/t post-sepsis fluid resuscitated state with fluid settling in legs; recommended leg elevation, ambulation, compression stockings, to help with mobilization of fluid.
