Admission Date:  [**2198-12-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-12-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath on [**12-20**] - stent to LAD s/p Intra-aortic balloon pump on [**12-20**] - no complications   History of Present Illness: 84 yo M c significant h/o CAD, atrial fibrillation, s/p pacemaker placement for Sick Sinus [**Hospital 54531**] transferred from OSH for anterolateral STEMI after elective total b/l knee replacements.
Pt recently had cardiac cath in [**2-11**] for anginal symptoms resulting in PCI with cypher stents placed in the Left Circumflex and LAD.
Bilateral total knee replacements performed at the OSH without complications and with minimal blood loss.
ASA and Plavix had been discontinued one week prior to the procedure.
A PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was successfully placed in LAD with restoration of TIMI 3 flow.
As a result, the patient was defibrillated once, given IV lopressor, IV Amiodarone, Dopamine pressor, an Intraaortic Balloon Pump, and intubated to protect airway.
The patient als developed persistent distal LAD spasm and treated with Nitroglycerin IC and Nipride.
Hemodynamics at time of Catherization were: RA 18, PCWP 27, PA 53/30, CO 3.16, CI 1.53.

There is a Swan Ganz catheter from a right femoral approach, along with an intra-aortic balloon pump.
The balloon pump tip is not visualized.
Pacemaker leads, and an NG tube are present.
There is a low attenuation lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney which is not fully evaluated without IV contrast, and measures 2.7 x 2.8 cm.
Note is made of a percutaneously placed line into the left femoral artery.
Aortic balloon pump from right femoral artery.
Vascular catheter in left common femoral artery.
The calculated cardiac index using an assumed O2 consumption was 1.53 Lt/min/m2  consistent with severe cardiogenic shock.
Wide complex tachycardia requiring 200 [**Doctor First Name 140**] of biphasic electrical cardioversion.
Profound cardiogenic shock requiring placement of a 8F/40cc IABP in the right femoral artery resulting in significant diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course by System:  A. Cardiovascular  Ischemia:  Patient had MI ten years ago and is s/p stent of Left Circumflex and LAD [**2-11**].
Patient had elective bilateral total knee replacement, and ASA and Plavix had been discontinued one week prior to surgery.
A PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was placed in LAD with restoration of TIMI 3 flow.
However, there was large componenent of distal LAD spasm in the setting of pressors and ?embolization.
It is felt that pt's STEMI was secondary to acute stent thrombosis off aspirin and plavix.
Pt had massive CK leak and was found in cardiogenic shock necessitating dopamine and IABP from cath lab.
During hospital course, pressors and balloon pump were gradually weaned.
After hypotension resolved, pt was started on Coreg and Captopril.
He will continue on aspirin, Plavix indefinitely until otherwise instructed by dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was hypotensive in cath lab requiring maximum doses of dopamine and also trialed on dobutamine.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for additional support.
Over hospital course, pt's pressors were weaned off and balloon pump was d/c'd on hospital day 4.
With improved hemodynamics, pt was able to be diuresed approximately 2-3 liters and eventually weaned off oxygen requirements.
Coreg was started at low doses and also started on captopril which tolerated well.
Both BB and captopril should be titrated as hemodynamics tolerate in the next several weeks.
Meanwhile, he be anti-coagulated w/ coumadin given large apical wall akinesis.
Lovenox will be used as bridging therapy w/ goal inr 2.0  Rhythm:  History of chronic afib.
Pt remained in afib for the majority of his hospital course and continued on anti-coaglation as above.
It was decided to place pt on amiodarone to suppress ventricular ectopy.
Amiodarone will be d/c'd at the discretion of his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
In addition, although pt already has pacemaker, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will decide on the utility of a defibrillator given his suppressed EF.
B.  Ortho Patient was followed by ortho throughout hospital course for bilateral total knee replacements.
Ortho recommended discharging patient on long term anticoagulation to prevent DVTs given knee replacement.
Pt did well on ventilator and 1 day after balloon pump d/c'd, was easily extubated.
E.  Neuro Patient's pain was initially managed with PO vicodin.
As a result, patient was given IV Morphine which resulted in a change in mental status.
The patient was then given oxycodone, standing tylenol, and Ultram for pain management.
F.  Endocrine Patient was put on an Insulin drip post-cath to optimize glucose levels post acute-MI in ICU setting.
G.  Prophx Patient was given senna/colace for constipation prophx, protonix for GI prophx, Heparin for DVT prophx.
