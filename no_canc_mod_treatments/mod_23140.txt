She had routine outpatient colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 112**] on [**2116-1-30**].
She had stopped coumadin prior to procedure, and resumed use the day following her procedure.
Since the procedure she has noted small amounts of red blood in her stools.
Given 5 mg IV vitamin K, ordered for FFP and typed and crossed for 2 units PRBCs.
On beta blocker and coumadin.
- s/p cataract surgery [**11/2116**], no complications.
- Alcohol: none - Illicits: none  Family History: Daughter with kidney stones.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic HBV without ESLD, presenting with BRBPR s/p colonoscopy one week ago.
Presenting with 2 days of painless rectal bleeding, in the setting of having a colonoscopy one week ago - high suspicion for post-polypectomy bleed in the setting of re-starting Coumadin as an outpatient, particularly since pt had been having smaller amounts of bleeding since the procedure.
Her INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
GI saw her and recommended continued supportive management at this time.
We obtained OSH records that confirmed polypectomy x3 in the cecum.
Patient had one additional episode of bloody BM on the general medicine floor in the setting of PTT >150 while on Heparin drip bridging to Coumadin, and this resolved when Heparin was discontinued.
Hct was stable and patient did not require any transfusions.
Patient's anticoagulation was initially held in the setting of acute bleed, but then restarted by the time of patient's discharge from the MICU.
She was started on Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] (increased from home dose of Metoprolol 25mg daily) and was paroxysmally in and out of a fib/flutter throughout her stay on the medicine wards.
Heart rate responded to IV Metoprolol and IV Diltiazem, but the patient was seen to have [**3-28**] second pauses on telemetry with IV nodal agents.
She was seen by her outpatient cardiologist and was scheduled to have a pacemaker placed which was done on [**2-15**].
Given the patient was only symptomatic from her a fib/flutter was during the initial episode on the floor, and remained asymptomatic with stable BPs during her subsequent episodes of a fib/flutter, it was decided to hold off on attempt to rate control prior to placement of pacemaker.
After the pacemaker was placed she continued to have afib with RVR without a good response to Metoprolol.
BP meds were held in the setting of acute bleed.
Fosamax was held while patient was in-house and started at discharge.
