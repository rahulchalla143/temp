He was continued on Ativan for anxiety and Dilaudid as needed for pain, both to decent effect.
He did exhibit some brief periods of delirium in the initial days of his hospitalization as well as depression.
Psychiatry assessed and believed his delirium to be multifactorial in nature and to avoid psychiatric medications for the short term.
His depression was thought to be an appropriate response given the circumstances and he was started on antidepressant therapy and followed closely by Social work during his stay who felt his coping was appropriate as well.
He was kept in the c-collar for a period after his surgery and per Ortho spine his c-collar was removed on [**7-27**].
CV: He was initially in neurogenic shock, briefly on pressor support in the early days but able to be weaned off by HD 5.
Midodrine for blood pressure support was started on HD 4 and continued intermittently throughout his stay but was eventually stopped.
He underwent tracheostomy on HD 3.
He was also noted to develop a right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for ventilator associated pneumonia, and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of vanc/cipro/zosyn on [**6-29**].
GI: He underwent PEG tube placement on HD 3, he was started on tube feeds (Replete with Fiber) which were advanced to goal without difficulty.
His tube feeds were held and a tube contrast study was performed to rule out malposition or contrast extravasation and it was negative.
Pneumoperitoneum was demonstrated on multiple subsequent CXRs but this was consistent with the normal amount expected after PEG tube placement and continued to decrease.
His tube feedings were resumed.
Over the course of his stay he was evaluated by Speech & Swallow and was given an oral diet.
His tube feedings are currently being cycled and he is on a regular diet and tolerating both without any difficulties.
GU: He had a foley catheter initally and as he progressed he was switched to being straight catheterized every 6 hours.
As noted above, he was started on vanc/cipro/zosyn for presumed PNA which was ultimately tailored after cultures from sputum/BAL showed MSSA.
Additionally he was started on micafungin on [**6-30**] due to blood cultures growing yeast.
Heme: He has been receiving subcutaneous heparin since admission and should have his plt count monitored at lead every [**9-17**] days.
