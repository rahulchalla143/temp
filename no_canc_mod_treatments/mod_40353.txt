He was then re-hospitalized with worsening mixed respiratory/metabolic acidosis requiring emergent HD, and his course was complicated by respiratory difficulty ultimately requiring debridement of suprastomal granulation tissue, and replacement of [**Location (un) **] trach button.
He now returns to the ED from [**Hospital3 **] with persistent nausea/vomiting since yesterday afternoon, with concern by rehab staff for aspiration event, now with increasing lethargy, increased bronchial sounds, and putative new infiltrate on CXR at rehab.

Nonspecific new foci of air within the hilum of the right pelvic kidney transplant which could be iatrogenic from foley catheterization, however, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Stable thickening of the tracheobronchial tree with midline tracheostomy.
Retained fluids in stomach Scattered erosions in body of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma.
Small mucosal defect in D1 at site of surgical anastomosis.
[**2184-9-29**] Post pyloric FT placement :  Successful repositioning of Dobbhoff tube into the post-pyloric position.
Known prior gastric perforation, with improved right rectus sheath collection, but persistent sinus with mild enlargement of a small gas and fluid-containing collection anteroineferior to the pylorus.
He had an NGT placed with rapid outflow on about 1 liter of bilious fluid.
He was seen by renal who did not recommend dialysis at the time.
He was continued on tacrolimus 2.5 with daily tacrolimus levels and started empirically on linezolid and cefepime for a history of VRE.
He was started on a heparin gtt and his coumadin was held.
His INR was supratherapeutic so it was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. Transplant surgery recommended EGD to rule out a perforation in the area of his previous perforated duodenal ulcer.
He was started on flagyl for broader spectrum coverage.
His linezolid was discontinued and he was started on vancomycin.
His heparin gtt was held in anticipation for bronchoscopy however he did not get bronched until HD3 which revealed significant mucopurulent secretions throughout the airway with mucous plugs and moderate supraglottic edema.
His heparin gtt was restarted.
Because his Cr continued to remain elevated on HD 7 he was started on a bicarb drip.
His trach was capped after which he experienced an episode of desaturation on room air which improved with uncapping and trach mask.
His tacrolimus dose was decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] per renal recs for a tacro level of 11 up from 5.
On HD 8 ([**2184-9-6**]) his heparin gtt was held for a bronchoscopy and EGD which were performed in the operating room.
He tolerated the procedures well and was returned to the floor in stable condition.
After the procedure he was restarted on coumadin with a heparin gtt bridge for treatment of a prior IJ thrombus and his diet was advanced to regular.
His trach mask was weaned from 60% to 40% FiO2 with capping attempted throughout which he only tolerated for brief periods before becoming tachypneic.
An NGT was placed to provide him with medications and nutrition.
Because his INR was therapeutic his heparin gtt was stopped.
Because BAL from [**9-6**] was negative for pathogenic flora his cefepime and flagyl were discontinued.
Minimal granulation tissue seen with a patent airway.
He was complaining of difficulty swallowing which was thought to be related to his supraglottic edema so he was restarted on tube feeds through his NGT.
On HD 13 he was started on Cefepime for a WBC that had increased to 13.2 and the positive gram stain from the day prior.
They recommended multiple cultures including c-diff, CMV and legionella all of which came back negative.
Because of his episode of desaturation and his known prior positional occlusion of his tracheal button, his warfarin was held and his button was exchanged with IP for a tracheostomy tube.
After the exchange he was maintained on pressure support with minimal settings.
The following day his warfarin was restarted with a heparin gtt, his tube feeds were restarted through a Dobbhoff which was exchanged for his NGT.
Over the next several days TF advanced to goal at an increased caloric density/reduced volume after experiencing some nausea and multiple attempts were made to wean him off of the vent, however each time he was transitioned to the trach mask he became tachypneic requiring that he be put back on pressure support.
Because he continued to have high tube feed residuals on HD 23 his dobhoff was advanced past the pylorus in the IR suite.
His tunneled HD line was removed by IR as well and he was given 10 IV lasix for a CXR that looked wet.
Over the next several days his Cr remained stable however his K rose as high as 5.9 on HD 25.
30 of IV lasix was given and his repeat K was down to 5.3.
His tube feeds were changed from Isosure to Nephro in order to reduce the amount of K in his diet.
Per renal recommendations he was started on 20 of IV lasix.
He had been tolerating trach mask for over 24 hours and was tolerating a PMV so he was transferred back from the ICU to the surgical floor.
His K increased to 5.5 and he was given an additional 20 of IV lasix after which his K was reduced to 5.
He was stable on the floor on a trach mask and on HD 27 he was noted to have a Hct of 21.5 which was thought to be secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
On HD 30 his dobhoff was placed past the pylorus under flouroscopic guidance and his tube feeds were restarted.
He was also started on epoetin 4000U 3x/week.
The following day his standing lasix were stopped as he was thought to be volume down with a BUN in the upper 60's.
On HD 32 his tube feeds were cycled over 18 hours rather than given continuously because he was complaining of vague abdominal pain.
His K was 5.6 so per renal recommendations he was given 1.5 amp of HCO3 in 500 of D5W along with 20 of IV lasix with subsequent improvement in his K to 5.2.
Over the next several days his tube feeds were switched from cycling to continuous and the back to an 18 hour cycle in an effort to help with his vague abdominal pain.
He was started on megase in an effort to help with his appetite as he continued to take in minimal PO.
He continued to have problems with hyperkalemia, requiring occasional kayexelate.
His diet order limited potassium to 1 gram but he was also eating food brought in by his family and this could not be restricted.
Still pending is renin and aldosterone levels.
His blood sugars were also elevated to the 300 range as he took both tube feedings and and a diabetic diet.
His Lantus was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and the sliding scale was tightened up.
(*********CURRENT THROUGH OF [**2184-10-3**]*********)  The patient was transferred to the medicine service for management of his hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia and a summary of his medical issues after his transfer are detailed below.
However, he had been started on tube feeds and also was persistently acidotic, which could raise his potassium.
It was largely thought that most his elevated potassium levels were related to both his dietary intake and also his heparin injections.
We talked to nutrition about his tube feeds and lowered there potassium content.
In addition, we limited his PO potassium intake and stopped his heparin injections as heparin can cause a hyperkalemia.
Going through his medications, there were not medications that elevated his potassium and we made sure that all IV medications were mixed in normal saline and not D5W as they often are.
In addition, he was on a regular diet and so it was changed to a diabetic consistent carbohydrate diet.
We also spoke with nutrition about adjusting his tube feeds.
We began treatment, but he continued to have elevated am FSG in the setting of adjusting his tube feeds.
We also started monitoring a 3am FSG in the middle of his tube feeds so that we could have better control while he is being fed and receiving the majority of his daily calorie intake.
After titrating his medication his sugars were better controlled and he was discharged on a sliding scale with Glargine 34 in the am and 60 in the pm.
He will need to have his fingersticks monitored closely at the LTACH and his insulin adjusted as he weans himself off tube feeds and increases his oral intake.
B-glucan was also sent that was the upper limit of normal and galactomannan was negative.
Repeat work up revealed a UTI and ceftriaxone was started.
The patient was broadened to vanc/ceftriaxone and flagyl temporarily, and then the ceftriaxone was changed to cefepime when his urine came back with pseudomonas.
When the final reads of the images came back and did not reveal an intrabdominal process or osteo of the sacrum, the vancomycin and flagyl was discontinued.
He will need a 14 day course of cefepime for his UTI to be completed on [**2184-11-2**].
# UTI: As above, he was initially started on ceftriaxone and once the cultures came back, he was changed to cefepime.
Last Day of cefepime will be [**2184-11-2**].
The patient is thought to have a neurogenic bladder and the plan initially was for long term foley placement.
# S/p Gastric perforation in [**Month (only) **] and repair:  He has a persistent phlegmon anterior to the site of his repaired ulcer.
we had wound care come see the wound and make recommendations.
We continued aggressive wound care and he had multipodius boots on bilaterally.
He was given fluids and blood (as described below) for intravascular volume and his creatinine resolved.
He was continued on his tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone.
His MMF and prednisone doses were stable, but his tacrolimus doses were repeatedly adjusted depending on his levels.
Given his anemia and concern for anemia of chronic inflammation and also low epo levels, he was started on EPO 4,000 3x/week and also transfused as needed.
He had persistent secretions and was given guaifenesin w/ codeine on a PRN basis as a mucolytic.
He was started on clonazepam 0.25mg PO BID for anxiety and he is also written for ativan on a PRN basis.
# Anemia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] had persistent anemia throughout his admission, requiring multiple blood transfusions.
His guaiac have been negative and he has known renal disease and was started on EPO 4,000 units 3x/week.
He was started on Vitamin D 50,000 units Q weekly and will need a repeat level in 8 weeks.
His vitamin D regiment should be adjusted as per that level, but will likely need 1,000 units per day.
His calcium normalized, but when corrected with his low albumin (3.0), it was still mildly elevated.
His INR will need to be monitored closely and coumadin doses adjusted so that he can have a stable INR with the goal between [**1-23**].
He was started on citalopram during this admission and his dose was steadily increased to a maximum dose of 40mg PO Daily.
In addition, standing clonazepam was started and he received ativan PRN and gets it 2-3 times per day.
I spoke with him at length about the importance of this medication and he agreed to take it.
It is important to ensure that he continues to take his sodium bicarbonate.
He had to have tube feeds started during this hospitalization and while he intermittently take in some food orally, nutrition has been calorie counting and the amount is minimal.
We tried decreasing his tube feeds in order to create a situation where he would be hungry and want to eat, but this resulted in poor calorie intake and his tube feeds were started again.
He is tolerating his tube feeds currently.
His wife also does not want a [**Name (NI) 9945**] and feels that once he starts working with PT, he will have a bigger appetite and will eat more by mouth and we will be able to wean him off his tube feeds and back on a regular diet.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: LABWORK: - Will need Daily tacro levels and need tacro goals of [**3-26**], fax tacro levels to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21335**] - Will need CBC 3x/ week and transfuse for Hct less than 21 - Daily BMP, Ca, Mg, P for now and trend potassium as tacro levels come down, potassium should come down as well - Trend White blood cell count (3x/week) as it has stablized, but if trending up would need to have further work up.
- Next INR check on [**2184-10-24**] and adjust coumadin as needed  VOLUME STATUS: - Monitor his fluid status closely.
If concerned for dehydration or BUN/Cr rising on labs, would give 1L NS - Make sure he is taking his Sodium Bicarbonate  ANTIBIOTICS: - Cefepime 1gm Q12H until [**2184-11-2**]  GENERAL CARE: - Straight Cath Q6H - Wound care daily - frequent turning Q2H - Will need aggressive PT and OT - Chest Physical therapy - Continued suctioning and trach care - Tube Feeds unless patient is able to be transitioned to PO or agrees to G-tube - need to follow up on his beta glucan - If FSG are persistently elevated would have endocrine come to see him  DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: - Would increase clonazepam to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] if patient is requiring a lot of ativan - Consider psych consult if patient is not participating in care - Social worker and case managers to follow closely - Needs lots of encouragement.
