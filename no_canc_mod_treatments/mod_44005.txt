Status post left hip replacement.
2) Failure of left hip prosthesis with superolateral distraction.
His ICU course was notable for transient hypotension immediately after intubation requiring neosynephrine for a few hours, negative cardiac enzymes x 3, successful extubation [**6-12**], a mild transaminitis likely d/t poor perfusion/hypotension, a failed swallow evaluation [**6-13**], and new-onset asymptomatic bradycardia since [**6-13**] AM.
His sputum culture came back with moderate MRSA and sparse [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] as a result, he was started on a 14 day course of IV Vancomycin via PICC and PO Levaquin.
So his course by problems:  #MRSA Pneumonia - initially intubated x 24hrs for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection.
Transferred to the floor and maintained on a 14 day course of Vancomycin and Levoquin.
The patient remained afebrile but had gradual elevation of his WBCC and an accompanying bandemia beginning on [**6-18**].
Despite a negative UA, the patient was treated with a 5d course of fluconazole as it was felt that this was a possible of his elevated WBCC.
#Cholecystitis- in [**4-28**] pt was admitted with ascending cholangitis (was not manifesting any abdominal pain symptoms) and underwent ERCP stenting of his CBD.
Initial plan was for repeat ERCP to remove additional stones but in discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] of surgery it was felt that the patient would benefit from open cholecystectomy and subsequent exploration of the biliary tree as an outpatient elecive procedure.
#FEN - despite initial failure, he passed swallow evaluation on [**6-14**], and tolerated regular soft diet/thin liquids during this admission.
The patient was taking oxycontin 240mg TID (!)
#L Hip Dislocation/R Hip DJD - patient has had a long, complicated course with h/o a L septic hip prosthesis that was removed and replaced at the [**Hospital1 756**] [**2-27**] after 6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
Orthopedics was consulted and feel that the patient would benefit from an outpatient removal of his L hip prosthesis and spacer with an eventual total R hip replacement.
After an infectious etiology was excluded, the patient was restarted on his outpatient anti-diarrheals (in discussion with his outpt GI doc, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] with dramatic improvement.
#Proph - the patient was placed on adequate DVT and GI prophylaxis with fall and MRSA precautions  #Dispo - PT was consulted, and given all his comorbidities and clinical condition, the patient was deemed most suitable for a skilled nursing facility.
Of note, he will need 3 operations sometime in the near future: a cholecystectomy and bilateral hip replacements.
