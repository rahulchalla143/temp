Complex, non-mobile atheromas in descending thoracic aorta   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 54 y/o F w/ HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**7-/2171**], HCV s/p radiofrequency [**5-/2171**] initially admitted for SOB & anasarca, complicated by MICU stay for resp.
distress and subsequently developing GNR bacteremia as well as acute on chronic renal failure.
# Anasarca and volume overload: Etiology was felt to be secondary to a combination of liver disease, nephrotic syndrome ([**1-4**] chronic kidney disease), and albumin 1.9 on admission.
Pt received aggressive albumin replacement and diuresis with moderate urine output.
Diuresis had to be discontinued due to worsening renal failure.
Pt was not restarted on diuresis at discharge but was instructed to weigh herself daily and report wts.
Therapeutic thoracentesis were performed, however with rapid reaccumulation of the fluid R > L. Developed respiratory distress requiring transfer to the MICU.
Pleurodesis was considered but discarded, the decision was made not to place a pleurex catheter as longterm, because would continue to drain given portal hypertension and have potential for infection.
A thoracentesis was done on the day of discharge without complications ~2L was removed.
Did not require intubation during this stay.
distress was thought to be related to hydrothorax secondary to cirrhosis, however there was the possibility of PE, hence was empirically treated with heparin infusion.
She underwent multiple thoracentesis as above for R>L pleural effusions.
Pt not felt to be good candidate for interferon treatment as unable to tolerate 17yrs ago.
Pt was continued on lacutlose, ursodiol and propanolol.
Initially treated with valsartan, however eventually discontinued with worsening creatinine level.
Started on calcitriol, calcium acetate.
Initially worsened in the setting of aggressive diuresis while in the MICU.
However, sudden worsening of creatinine after initiation of Nafcillin.
Finding appeared consistent with AIN with urine eos and improvement of Cr.
Also started on iron to aid in treatment of chronic kidney disease.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Pt with long standing diabetes, received glargine daily with sliding scale insulin.
# Hypothyroidism:  Pt was continued on synthyroid, however dose was doubled during admission due to elevated TSH of 11.
She was discharged on Levothyroxine 50mg daily.
# HTN: Poorly controlled hypertension prior to admission, BP continued to remain elevated during admission despite aggressive BP therapy.
She was discharged home on home regimen of propanolol 20mg TID as well as amilodipine daily.
Short term and long term memory loss, appears stable based off prior notes.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin then continued on augmentin for combined treatment of MSSA and enterococcus UTI.
However, pt developed fevers despite treatment and had to be restarted on Vancomycin.
Naficillin was added to the regimen, however developed symptoms consistent with AIN, thus had to be stopped.
Pt was discharged home with home O2 and PICC line in place.
