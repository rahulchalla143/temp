At the start of this segment of his hospital course, the patient has been in Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator undergoing therapy for respiratory infection for fungemia and bacteremia.
On [**2136-7-23**], the patient was taken to the operating room by the thoracic surgical team, where he underwent a video- assisted thoracoscopy and pleurodesis of his right chest.
He tolerated this procedure well and postoperatively was in the Intensive Care Unit with 3 chest tubes to 20 cm of water suction.
He received both parenteral and antral nutrition and remained on antibiotics, including Vancomycin and meropenum for pseudomonas and enterococcal positive cultures from the sputum and urine, respectively.
After receiving a full course of antibiotics on [**8-3**], his antibiotics were discontinued, continued ventilatory wean, and diuresis.
He was continued with the diuresis and vent wean.
Ativan, which seemed to work well, and he did have periods of time where he would remain on a trach collar for a significant amount of time.
Also during this time, the chest tubes were removed by the thoracic team.
He was given some fluids and pan cultured.
He was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including fungal coverage.
After changing his left subclavian line over a wire, the decision was made to transition him completely to tube feeds, discontinue his parenteral nutrition, and re-site his line to the right IJ.
He also underwent bronchoscopy, which was okay.
A chest x-ray showed an accumulation of right pleural effusion, and this was tapped via percutaneous pigtail catheter in the radiology lab.
He was treated with a full course of caspofungin, continued on meropenum, and he had empiric Vancomycin, but there was no gram positive cultures, and this was discontinued after several days.
The catheter tip also grew yeast, and this was felt to all be due to the parenteral nutrition he had been receiving.
He required further diuresis, and he is now currently at his dry weight, weaning off the ventilator, albeit slow, but he does make progress every day.
Ileostomy has been functioning normally.
At this point, the best course of action would be for him to continue with a ventilatory wean, perhaps at a facility which would better suit his chronic respiratory failure and who would be able to better situate him.
