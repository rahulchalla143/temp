He remained on bed-rest until INR came below 5.
Sternal erythema was noted and IV vancomycin and oral cipro were started.
He remained on antibiotics and wound was the packed.
The erythema continued to progress on antibiotics and the sternum became unstable.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-20**] for sternal exploration and debridement with a vacuum dressing placement.
On [**1-2**] he had a fourth debridement with pec and omental flap.
He was seen in consultation by the ID service for an OR culture that grew pseudomonas and for c.diff (PCR positive) diarrhea.
He was placed on oral Vancomycin and ceftazapine.
He was started on TPN due to poor oral intake.
He was started on wellbutrin to help with smoking cessation and any depression that may be inhibiting his poor oral intake.
Coumadin was started for atrial fibrillation and history of pulmonary embolism, but due to his extreme sensitivity toward coumadin, only low doses were used and INR was checked daily.
His permanaent pacemaker was interrogated secondary to what appeared to be oversensing, but the electrophysiology service felt that it was pacing appropriately to APCs.
He complained of a painful abdomen but was given maalox with resolution of his symptoms.
