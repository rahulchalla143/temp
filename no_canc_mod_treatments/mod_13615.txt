Hypertensive urgency:  It was unclear what medication regimen he was taking as an outpatient prior to admission.
It was felt that his hypertension on admission was most likely related to medication nonadherence, anxiety, and volume overload.
He was initially managed on a labetalol drip but subsequently weaned off once his oral/transdermal medications used during his recent [**Hospital1 112**] hospitalization were initiated.
His blood pressure remained difficult to control on an oral regimen as well and his oral labetalol was uptitrated.
He was followed closely by the [**Hospital **] clinic and his lantus dose and humalog sliding scale were adjusted.
He was initially treated with lorazepam and haloperidol as needed for anxiety.
He had one further episode of hyperkalemia during his stay prior to dialysis and was given calcium gluconate and kayexalate for peaked T waves on ECG.
He had a subtherapeutic INR on admission and was started on a heparin drip as a bridge to Couamdin therapy.
His INR at discharge was 2.6 and his heparin drip was stopped.
He will have his labs drawn at dialysis and faxed to his primary care provider.
ESRD on HD: He was continued on HD MWF schedule.
He was also continued on sevelemer, neutraphos.
Medication liver injury was considered a possibility and his statin was stopped due to this possibility in addition to some complaints of lower extremity muscle pain.
