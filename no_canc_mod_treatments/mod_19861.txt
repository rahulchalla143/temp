CT HEAD NECK [**3-26**]: FINDINGS: The patient is intubated with the tip of the ventilation tube above the carina.
The orogastric tube is coiled within the oropharynx and does not reach to the stomach.
Incidental note of coiled orogastric tube in the oro- and hypopharynx.
Right-sided PICC line in constant position.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old male with alcohol abuse who was admitted after a reported pulseless arrest for 30 minutes in the field before return of circulation.
He was originally transferred from outside hospital with an endotracheal tube to undergo the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
He completed this but the only cause for his arrest that could be found was intoxication and possible resultant hypoxia (cardiac work-up negative).
He was treated for aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin x 8 days when he developed a fever and cough with MSSA in the sputum.
Unfortunately, he continued to have altered mental status after completion of antibiotics and resolution of acute cardiopulmonary issues.
Based on history, report of 30 minutes of CPR, no strips from the event were sent with the patient and he never received any ACLS medications per the documentation.
On arrival he was started on the therapeutic hypothermia protocol for neurologic protection.
He was monitored on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours with no evidence of seizure after rewarming and decreasing his sedation.
He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and continued on his home simvastatin 40 mg daily for ongoing CAD and stroke risk modification.
He completed an 8 day course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
His mental status remained the biggest barrier to extubation, as he would become very agitated off sedation, so he was tried on precedex and prn haldol for agititation and his mental status became less agitated.
He was eventually extubated and performed well off the vent.
# Anoxic brain injury:  When he was finally weaned off sedation and mechanical ventilation, he had altered mental status.
This occured in the setting of receiving cefepime empirically for fevers (see below) and having a past history of penicillin allergy.
The cefepime was changed in favor of levofloxacin which MSSA was susceptible to.
It was susceptible to levofloxacin so he was changed to monocoverage to complete an 8 day course.
Also continued his albuterol HFA and fluticasone inhaler [**Hospital1 **] for reactive airway disease.
He was initially on propofol which would help treat withdrawal, then was managed with ativan for agitation due to concern about alcohol withdrawal.
After he had been in the hospital for 4 days the benzodiazepines were discontinued, and he was transitioned to prn haldol for agitation.
He did not require any medications for agitation for several days before discharge.
# Cervical spine trauma: CTA of his neck on admission had no evidence of fracture but he was maintained in a cervical collar until he was able to wake up to confirm whether or not he had any pain on examination.
This might help with his lethargy during the day time and his asthma symptoms - Please assist with physical therapy and occupational therapy  Medications on Admission: albuterol HFA furosemide 20 mg daily tramadol 50 mg prn loratidine 10 mg daily fluticasone 110mcg IH [**Hospital1 **] simvastatin 40 mg daily metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily aspirin prn?

There was concern that your heart had stopped or you had stopped breathing so a tube was inserted into your lungs to help breathe for you and your body was cooled to try to preserve your brain function.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Please START taking thiamine and folate supplements.
- Please take a multivitamin daily - Please take acetaminophen for pain - You may use Miralax as needed for constipation.
- Please START taking aspirin 81 mg daily for stroke prevention - STOP taking furosemide  It is very important that you keep all of the follow-up appointments listed below.
You should bring all of your medications to each appointment so your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] update their records and adjust doses as needed.
