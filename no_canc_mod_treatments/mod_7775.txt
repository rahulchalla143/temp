I was unable to test this as the patient was being intubated during my exam.
He was maintained in a C-Collar, started on Decadron to hopefully reduce swelling, he had a wound drain in place.
He also required an insulin drip due to his diabetes.
He was started on tube feeds for nutritional support.
The ICU team tried to wean the patient ventilator with variable success alternating between periods of CPAP and assist control.
The patient made clear attempts to self extubate this ET tube with his tongue requiring reintubation.
