A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis of septum, anterior and lateral walls, and hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
Clinical:  Mitral valve disorder/mitral valve replacement; TVR; possible replacement via right thorax.
It consists of a single piece of cardiac valve with attached chordae, measuring 2.3 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2177-4-7**] for surgical management of his valvular heart and coronary artery disease.
On [**4-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed a redo-sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.
He maintained stable hemodynamics as he gradually weaned from pressor support.
Low dose beta blockade was resumed.
HIT assay returned positive for HEPARIN PF4 antibodies.
Argatroban anticoagulation was subsequently started with slow transition to Warfarin.
Postop course was also complicated by significant fluid overload and heart failure which temporarily required intravenous Lasix drip.
He was slowly transitioned to PO/oral diuretics.
He also experienced sternal drainage with a leukocytosis.
White count peaked to 17K, and he was empirically treated with Vancomycin.
By discharge, his white count normalized and his sternal drainage improved.
He eventually became therapeutic on Warfarin with appropriate Argatroban overlap.
Warfarin should be dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
Given thrombus in setting of positive HIT assay, he will need Warfarin for at least six months.
Plan for follow up with coumadin dosing by [**Company 191**] anti coagulation clinic.
