ACTIVE # Acute sCHF and COPD Exacerbation - Patient a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring Bipap (usually on CPAP at home), thought to be [**1-15**] CHF and COPD exacerbations.
Exacerbating factors were potential medication non-compliance, worsening of pulmonary HTN (noted on TTE during this hospitalization), cigarette smoking.
