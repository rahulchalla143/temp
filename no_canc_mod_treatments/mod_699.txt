Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the left, decreased since the most recent prior examination and trace on the right, markedly decreased compared to [**2187-4-10**] with pigtail catheter noted in place on the right.
#Hypoxia/hypercarbia: She initially required BiPAP and was admitted to the MICU for monitoring of her respiratory status.
She was able to be weaned from BiPAP on ICU day 2 and remained on 2L NC at the time of discharge.
She was initially started on HCAP antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were stopped on HD 4 prior to discharge given that all cultures were negative and there was no consolidation on imaging.
There was no evidence of infection and antibiotics were quickly stopped as described above.
Most of her mental status changes were probably related to her sedationg medications and hypercarbia at admission, which improved with BiPAP and holding her antipsychotics.
ID was curbsided regarding vanco course given that she received a few days of HCAP antibotics and her PO vanco was changed to 125mg q6h for 7 days after stopping IV vanc/cefepime (D7 will be [**2187-4-30**]).
Flexiseal in place at discharge.
# Bilateral pleural effusions: Noted to have bilateral pleural effusions last hospitalization in setting of massive fluid resuscitation, right pleural pigtail catheter removed this admission in the MICU.
She is still volume overloaded on exam, but her bicarb remained elevated, and she was not given any further diuresis.
She continues to appear total body overloaded, likely in setting of volume resuscitation on prior admission for sepsis, but with contraction alkalosis currently, so further diuresis was held as above.
Consider further diuresis once hypercarbia improves and bicarb trends down.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily  # Hypertension: Patient was previously on lisinopril which was held since last admission in setting of sepsis and relative hypotension.
She remained normotensive  # GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this was stopped again when she became delirious last hospitalization.
# Code status this admission: FULL  # Transitional issues: -Foley was removed [**4-23**] and she has not voided as of discharge, may need Foley replaced if she is unable to void -Would restart diuresis when bicarb trends down -Continue PO vanco 125mg q6h through [**2187-4-30**] -Please follow Hct daily given melanotic stools, should resolve as her C. diff resolves -Midline removed [**2187-4-21**] -Pigtail catheter removed this admission -F/u pending BCx, catheter tip cx  Medications on Admission: Medications at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab: fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray 1-2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] PRN levothyroxine 50 mcg dialy acetaminophen 650 mg Q4H PRN pain polyvinyl alcohol 1.4% drops every 4H PRN dry eyes heparin line flush Humalog insulin sliding scale Miconazole nitrate 2% powder, 1 application TID PRN rash ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H PRN nausea Olanzapine 2.5 mg PO daily and qHS PRN anxiety/insomnia Vancomycin 500 mg Q6H planned through [**2187-5-1**]   Discharge Medications: 1. fluticasone 50 mcg/actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: 1-2 puffs Nasal twice a day as needed for allergies.
