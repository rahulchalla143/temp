MEDICATIONS:  Included propranolol, spironolactone, Lasix and Levoxyl.
Transplant surgery was consulted who assisted in the operative intervention.
Her heparin was stopped, her lines were changed, and she was followed from this standpoint.
Postoperatively, from the second washout she was continued on ventilatory management, and she was kept on Levophed for blood pressure control.
She continued to require significant fluid resuscitation, as she was losing over 3-4 liters of ascites fluid from her open abdomen.
VAC dressings were changed at the bedside multiple times, and there was slow granulation tissue.
She was started on TPN for nutritional support during this time.
After multiple attempts at weaning the ventilator were attempted, it was decided that the patient would proceed to a tracheostomy, as she was not weaning adequately.
Because of this, a tracheostomy was performed, and she did well from that standpoint.
However, LFTs continued to rise, and her VAC drain output continued to stay high at over 5 liters.
Pancultures were done, and she was found to have Pseudomonas in her lungs and; therefore, she was changed from Zosyn to meropenem.
She was attempted on multiple occasions to be given anticoagulation using argatroban and lepirudin.
She had multiple episodes of bleeding, both from her NG tube, as well as from her Foley which required significant blood product resuscitation.
After proceeding with the ultrasound and finding the thrombosis of her portal vein, a repeat family meeting was held, and it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures only.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post abdominal aneurysm     repair.
Status post Vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and VAC     placement.
Status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure.
