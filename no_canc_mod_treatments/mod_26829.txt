The left kidney measures 11.8 cm.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Upright swallows of thin liquids resulted in aspiration and thereafter in spontaneous cough.

Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis of 700 cc of yellow serosanguineous fluid.
Foley and rectal tube adequately placed.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 55 year old woman with autoimmune hepatitis on azathioprine complicated by cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, esophageal varices, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with multifocal PNA.
She was treated broadly with antibiotics per ID.
PICC line was placed for prolonged IV antibiotics.
She had increased respiratory distress on [**4-29**], failing bipap, and at that time, she and her family decided to reverse her DNR/DNI to full code and thus, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated.
She continued on mechanical ventilation until [**5-9**] when she was extubated successfully.
She was given 1 dose of Neupogen and no longer neutropenic.
Continued on her rifaximin, lactulose.
Mental status improved once NGT placed and increased lactulose dose after extubation.
Multifocal pneumonia: On transfer, the patient remained on oxygen supplementation and was slowly weaned off.
She remained afebrile without further need for antibiotic therapy.
Prednisone therapy was initiated and LFTs improved on 20mg Prednisone.
LFTs stabilized and Prednisone was increased to 40mg to further decrease patient's Liver Function Test.
1/2NS IV fluid was started and after the patients mental status improved and she began eating patient's hypernatremia resolved.
Pancytopenia:  Thought to be secondary to azathioprine, so Azathioprine was held since admission.
Pancytopenia has not resovled since Azathioprine was held.
Leukopenia resolved after neupogen in the ICU.
Asthma:  Patient was placed on as needed albuterol/ipratropium nebs and remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
