Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SURGERY:  The patient was admitted on the [**9-17**], and on that same day underwent abdominal exploration, at which time the ventral hernia was repaired, and there was significant lysis of adhesions, and the patient also required a partial small bowel resection for an incarcerated area of hernia which was somewhat strangulated and perforated.
Postoperatively, she continued to require intubation for her respiratory status.
As noted, she was maintained on sedation during intubation, but otherwise had no neurologic deficiencies postoperatively.
She was eventually extubated after this edema had resolved, at which time she was restarted on her BiPAP.
The patient had significant difficulties with tachycardia and although her blood pressure has remained control, this was attributed to be secondary to the body stress response, and the patient was on IV Lopressor.
5) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient did require TPN postoperatively, as she was NPO, and she was intubated for quite some time.
Her significantly positive fluid balance, as noted previous, was handled with aggressive lasix diuresis, for which she was initially on a lasix drip but eventually converted to PO lasix.
She was treated for this with IV vancomycin.
Follow-up cultures drawn after patient had been on her IV vancomycin had shown no growth prior to discharge.
The patient's pain control was through PO medication.
The patient's postoperative course antibiotics was to be determined by the final results of her surveillance cultures.
