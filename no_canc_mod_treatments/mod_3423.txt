Received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells, with appropriate Hct response, but Hct continued to drift downward.
Pt remained HD stable.
The hematocrit continued to fall, and the pt received further transfusions.
She was therefore taken on HD 3 to the operating room for exporatory laparotomy and revision of the previous Billroth 2, a feeding gastrojejunal tube was also placed.
Trophic tube feeds were begun and subsequently advanced.
On POD 3 she developed afib and was placed on beta-blockade; other VS and Hct were stable.
On POD 7 she developed L sided weakness concerning for R MCA stroke given her AFib and lack of anticoagulation post-op.
She was begun on heparin drip and transferred to the SICU for hourly neuro checks.
Heparin was stopped and she was placed on coumadin.
The atrial fibrillation persisted despite beta-blockade, and she was switched to diltiazem, and later IV lopressor.
She was followed conservatively, provided TPN and trophic TF, and eventually opened up.
She was transferred to the floor, receiving PT/OOB and slowly advanced on her TF.
She was placed on Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl and transferred to the SICU.
The central line was removed and re-sited.
She remained on coumadin and developed a therapeutic level.
The TF were advanced very cautiously and tolerated; TPN was weaned and then stopped.
The Foley catheter was removed and the CVL removed.
Home meds were resumed.
