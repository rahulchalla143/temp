There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%).
Right PICC remains in place in standard position.
The sternal wires are aligned with unchanged fracture of the first wire.
There was a  total obstruction of the left anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary arteries.
Historical studies: MIBI [**2134**]: Coronary artery bypass surgery [**2123**]: He had a the vein graft to the LAD, a sequential vein graft to 2 marginal branches, and a vein graft to the distal right coronary artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yom who presented to OSH with epigastric pain, shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right chest with ecchymosis, at OSH found to have elevated trop and BNP, fever, leukocytosis, CHF with EF of 25%, and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm), was treated with broad spectrum abx and diureses and transfered here for consideration of surgical intervention for AAA.
His hospital course included treatment for an acute COPD exacerbation, pneumonia treatment and treatment of acute pulmonary edema.
In this setting, intervention upon the AAA was deferred until after further recovery, and was discussed with the patient and his family.
# COPD exacerbation: admitted in repiratory distress with acute on chronic hypercarbia + hypoxia- the main pulmonary process per physical findings and radiology is likely exacerbation of his chronic respiratory disease (a combination of restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease given h/o asbestosis, sleep apnea, and asthma) perhaps with some contribution from heart failure and resulting pulmonary congestions given pleural effusions and congestion on xray.
Per fever and leukocytosis at OSH though he was also covered with Abx for pneumonia, got Ceftriaxone, azythro, Vanco then transitioned to levofloxacin.
In the MICU patient was put on BiPAP with improvement in ABG.
He was started on standing nebs; continued ipratroprium + started levalbuterol(given ectopy).
We started Prednisone day 1 = [**5-26**] (also got IV solumedrol 125mg on the night of admission to the CCU).
We continued  Levofloxacine for a total of 7 days.
ON DISCHARGE: Patient is leaving on a prednisone taper - 30mg for 3 days, 20mg for 3 days, and 10mg for 3 days.
Will need to continue with use of inhalers - this will need to be adjusted based on patient's respiratory status.
Patient will need his O2 sat monitored, with O2 therapy to maintain his O2 around 92%.
His CHADS2 score of 3 but does not appear to be candidate for anticagulation given his poor functional status and evidence of falls (bruise on chest), Family understood this.
- Continued ASA 325 mg PO daily - Continued lisinopril - restarted home carvedilol - continued home Simvastatin 80mg daily .
# CHF:  echo here: mild symmetric LVH, LV is top normal/borderline dilated,  mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%).
LOS fluid balance at tramsfer was -1600 -  holding home lasix, goal I/O even for now - restarted Acei once renal function improved - restarted home carvedilol - salt restrict to Na 2g/daily On Discharge: Continue to monitor I&Os - goal net- even daily.
# AAA:  infrarenal 7.5 cm newly found, no acute intervention per vasc [**Doctor First Name **].
Patient initially transferred here for evaluation of surgical intervention.
Currently vascular feels that patient needs to improve functional status prior to surgical intervention.
On Discharge: Once patient is out of rehab he will need to follow up regarding surgical intervention for his large AAA.
# HTN: Blood pressures currently holding well - Continued lisinopril as above - restarted home carvedilol on half home dose 6.25 On DISCHAREG:- Hold anti-hypertensives if SBP <100 .
# HLD: - Continued Simvastatin 80mg daily for now .
#AAA - patient will follow up with surgery as outpatient for elective endovascular repair of this aneurysm.
