History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old man who underwent a long hospitalization associated with bleeding duodenal ulcer 30 years ago, which resulted in a right thoracotomy, right subcostal incision, and a midline incision for distal gastrectomy with apparent Billroth II reconstruction.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is quite anxious about surgery, which will require reoperation through his right subcostal incision with repair of his cholecystoduodenal fistula, partial or total cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, and placement of a T-tube type biliary drain as access to the bile duct is not possible endoscopically.
The patient had a detailed discussion about goals, risks and possible outcomes of the surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his [**Hospital 45932**] clinic.
