The patient had a recent admissions for congestive heart failure the first being secondary to ICD firing and stent restenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and hemodialysis and the second being for flash pulmonary edema on [**8-21**] and cardiac catheterization was negative for new lesion at that time.

Pleuritic chest pain:  The patient is admitted with pleuritic chest pain.
Hypotension:  In the Emergency Department the patient became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressures of 83 and he was started on a Dopamine drip and a right IJ was placed and intravenous fluids were given.
His systolic blood pressure increased to the 90s to 100s and Dopamine was discontinued.
Initially he was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin for questionable sepsis.
The patient's hypertensive medications were held during hospital stay.
Prior to discharge his beta blocker and a low dose ace inhibitor were restarted.
In addition the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during hemodialysis for a drop in his hematocrit, however, his blood pressure remained stable.
This could be secondary to taking all of hypertensive medications at the same time versus SIRS versus sepsis.
End stage renal disease:  The patient received hemodialysis while at [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was maintained on Zosyn for five days.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit dropped from 34.3 to 29.6 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during dialysis.
Prophylaxis:  PPI and subcutaneous heparin were given.
Anticoagulation:  The patient was kept on Coumadin for a factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], goal INR 1.3 to 1.5.
