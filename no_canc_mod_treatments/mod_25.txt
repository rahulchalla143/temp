The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**].
Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.
She was intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully placed.
The patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose and admitted to CCU.
In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine for hypotension.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac output of 2.2.
Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5 and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.
The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible pneumonia.
By hospital day 5, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective intubation.
Vitamin E.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU, temperature 98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.
Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent with ARDS and required multiple pressors.
She was requiring increasing ventilatory support.
A discussion was held with the family who decided that the patient will be made DNI/DNR due to the fact that CPR was likely to be unhelpful if the patient arrested.
