Status post right orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, with new increased axillary adenopathy.
Findings in the proximal femurs suggesting prior slipped capital femoral epiphyses with bilateral hip degenerative change.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old man with a history significant for rhabdomyosarcoma testicular cancer as a child s/p resection, chemotherapy and radiation who presented with back pain, admitted to the ICU for septic shock.
Initially PE was considered and the patient was started on heparin drip briefly, however determined to be unlikely based on septic physiology.
The patient had worsening tachypnea and hypoxia on the floor, was transferred to the ICU the night of admission and was intubated within hours.
The patient was treated with ARDS net protocol, with increased PEEP and decreased tidal volumes.
The patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator despite being treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for bilateral pneumonia and volume removal with CVVH after aggressive volume resuscitation.
As the patient became more difficult to ventilate and CXRs showed progression of bilateral infiltrates despite volume removal and antibiotics, a contrast CT scan was done which showed large bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right than left, ground glass infiltrates and airbronchograms especially on the left.
A chest tube was placed for continuous drainage.
Multiple cultures were sent from sputum, blood, urine, pleural fluid, BALs however all following the administration of IV antibiotics and all found to be negative.
The patient was initially started on levofloxacin, vancomycin and zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.
After ID consultation, the patient was started on clindamycin for possible toxin mediated process given the rapidity of the progression.
He was started on an amiodarone drip.
Cardiology recommended continuing oral amiodarone.
He was tolerating lasix for volume removal and eventually weaned off of pressors for intermittent periods.
The patient was given atropine and vasopression.
He was given calcium and magnesium.
Volume was removed by CVVH.
Abdominal US unremarkable, aside from distended gall bladder, which IR declined to drain given no other signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
The patient was treated with levothyroxine 50 mcg IV daily.
Ophthalmology consulted and recommended diuresis and lacrilube ointment applied to the eyes.
