Admission Date:  [**2128-6-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-7-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old white female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 and saphenous vein graft to OM1 in [**2120**], re-do in [**2123**], congestive heart failure, with her last ejection fraction less than 20%, likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation (anticoagulated), status post DDD pacemaker in [**2123**], status post pacemaker replacement three weeks ago, hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, complete occlusion of abdominal aorta, chronic renal insufficiency, the patient is chronically on home dopamine therapy since [**2126-8-19**].
In the Emergency Room she was thought to be hypotensive so she was given one and a half liters of fluid and her diuretics were held.
She is on 8 mcg/kg/min of dopamine at home and she was given an additional 15 mcg/kg of dopamine to which her blood pressure responded and went up to the 120's over 70's.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120**] status post re-do in [**2123**].
Diabetes mellitus not insulin dependent.
Patient has had recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia on her pacemaker which was aborted with pacing overdrive.

Cefazolin and codeine give her an unknown reaction.
She was 98% on two liters O2 nasal cannula.
2-3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border with a mechanical click.
Cardiovascular:  Ischemia-wise, it was possible that the hypotension could have been due to an ischemic event although this was unlikely given the patient had no chest pain so she was continued on her aspirin, beta blocker, statin.
Her ACE inhibitor was held secondary to her increase in creatinine over her baseline.
The hypotension could have been explained by her hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea volume loss.
Given her history of congestive heart failure and ejection fraction less than 20, it was felt that more fluids were not necessary and her diuretics were restarted that evening in a goal to keep the patient uvolemic.
Her amiodarone was continued throughout her hospital stay.
She was started on a heparin drip until her INR became therapeutic on the 13th when her heparin was discontinued and she was continued on her home dose of Coumadin.
Her dopamine was weaned as tolerated.
She required no additional intravenous fluids.
Infectious Disease:  Given that the patient was admitted with hypotension, this could possibly be a septic picture given her recent Gram negative sepsis in [**2128-2-17**] with a prolonged course of home antibiotics.
It was felt that the diarrhea could have been an atypical manifestation of her recurrent sepsis or possibly that this could be Clostridium difficile given her recent antibiotic use.
Of note, the patient had not had any bowel movements since being admitted to the hospital so she was given suppository as she felt that she was now constipated.
Pulmonary:  The patient was admitted on two liters of oxygen nasal cannula.
and she was given sliding scale insulin p.r.n.
As the patient had been afebrile throughout the hospital course, had had no further episodes of diarrhea and was on her baseline home doses of dopamine with stable blood pressure, it was felt that the patient was stable to go home with close follow up.
She was to continue taking all of her home medications per her normal routine.
