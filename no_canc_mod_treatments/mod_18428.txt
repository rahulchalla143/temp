Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-12-15**] - flexible bronchoscopy  [**2139-12-16**] - Flexible bronchoscopy; bronchography to evaluate for a fistula; esophagogastroduodenoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 75989**] is an unfortunate 71-year-old institutionalized patient who several decades ago underwent the distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy with reconstruction low in the left chest.
Past Medical History: PMH: GERD, chronic aspiration, paraesophageal hernia, hypothyroidism, HTN, Depression, hepatitis, hearing loss, C-diff   PSH: Gastrectomy, partial esophagectomy w/gastric pull through and pyloroplasty, CCY  Social History: non contributory  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: See physical chart, patient expired while in the hospital  Pertinent Results: CT Chest [**2139-12-12**] - Heterogeneous left thorax fluid collection and air extending laterally to the pleural surface could be compatible with a bronchogastric fistula possibly extending to the pleural space.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU on [**2139-12-12**] for r/o MI, massive GI bleed, recurrent pneumonia, started on a protonix drip, empiric vanc/zosyn/gentamicin, started on dopamine, right central line placed, intubated for airway protection and started on IV fluids.
[**12-13**] - tube feeds started, transfused one unit of RBC  [**12-15**] - d/c vancomycin, continued mechanical ventilation, abx, tube feeds,  [**12-16**] - underwent the above procedure where the patient began having massive gastrointestinal bleeding from the site of the esophageal ulcer.
The patient became hypotensive on the operating table and required IV fluids and blood products for resuscitation.
Intravenous vasopressors were started to maintain the blood pressure.
At this point, the decision was made to transfer the patient to the intensive care unit to continue resuscitative measures.
Surgical options for control of the GI bleed were discussed, but the opinion was that there were no clear surgical options available at that point.
The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit on IV fluids, blood products, and the intravenous vasopressors.
