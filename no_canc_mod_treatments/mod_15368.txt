Brief Hospital Course: #)Cardiac a. Ischemia/Rhythm: Mr [**Known lastname 51459**] presented with an inferior STEMI; he was taken urgently to the cath lab where he was found to have a proximal RCA lesion which was treated with thrombectomy + 2 BMS.
He was transferred to the CCU in stable condition on integrillin drip, aspirin, plavix.
He was started on lipitor, ACE and BB; approximately 36 hrs post transfer he went into complete heart block with jx escape rhythm of 60 with associated hypotension that did not respond to multiple IVF bolus.
He was vomiting and visibly aspirated and was therefore intubated for airway protection.
EP was consulted and placed an emergent temporary pacing wire and he was begun on dopamine and dobutamine drips.
Temporary pacer wires placed but then discontinued due to MRSA bacteremia.
Upon discontinuation, patient reverted to sinus rhythm and did not revert back into heart block in the week that he was monitored on telemetry.
His electrical functioning was thus deemed to have recovered and he did not need an implanted pacer.
He was started on a low-dose beta blocker once in sinus.
As rhythm normalized, tolerated gentle titration of beta blocker.
He was started on vancomycin and his lines and pacing wires were removed; once these were removed his cultures became negative and he remained afebrile.
A PICC line was placed under fluoro on [**2173-1-11**] and he will finish a 14-day course starting from the date of his last positive blood culture.
