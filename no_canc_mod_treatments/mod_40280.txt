Mild gallbladder wall hyperenhancement with surrounding band of fat stranding, portocaval lymph nodes, and presence of peritoneal fluid might be explained by current episode of hepatitis.
[**2165-11-7**] EEG: IMPRESSION: These findings are consistent with initial non-convulsive status epilepticus, resolving with treatment (IV levetiracetam), and improvement in the background activity to moderate diffuse slowing consistent with a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
He was intubated for agitation and airway protection [**2165-10-31**] after becoming dyspneic, tachypneic, and having chest pain.
Ferritin was 57,602.
ICU course was complicated by hypernatremia to 150 which improved with free water boluses, agitation/delerium which improved with levetiracetam and haloperidol, sinus tachycardia to HR 150, and steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
He was started on vanc and ceftriaxone.
Hem/onc was consulted for further assistance and performed a bone marrow biopsy on [**2165-10-31**] which was repeated [**2165-11-1**] due to inadequate specimen.

He was treated with tylenol and benadryl and tolerated the remained of the infusion.
He was initially treated with hydral 5mg IV x 2 with good response.
Given duration of illness and likelihood that sepsis would have declared itself, we resumed his beta-blockade with metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with plans to resume [**Last Name (un) **] if BPs were stable on [**11-2**].
He was started on PPI in the setting of recent Hct drop and stools were guaiac-ed (results**).
It was felt that this was c/w acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis given his constellation of symptoms.
Neurology was consulted who felt that he may have been having subclinical seizures and he was started on antiepileptics.
Also during his ICU stay, the patient required an insulin drip to adequately control his blood sugars.

This was treated with etoposide (chemotherapy) and dexamethasone (steroids) and you will need to continue these as an outpatient.
This required intubation (ventilator/breathing machine support).
During this time, an EEG showed seizure activity, so you were started on a seizure medication, levetiracetam (Keppra).
As the steroids and chemotherapy continued, you began feeling better, you did not need the ventilator, fevers resolved, and the liver function tests normalized.
Your blood counts remain low, a result of the HLH and chemotherapy, and you are continuing to need frequent blood transfusions.
Etoposide chemotherapy weekly for at least the next 5 weeks, then additional therapy will be considered.
Dexamethasone tapered over then next six weeks.
Levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure disorder.
Metoprolol 2x a day.
Calcium and vitamin D supplements while you are on steroids (dexamethasone).
