Reason for MICU transfer: Hypoxia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74 y/o M with a h/o IPF, bullous emphysema normally on home oxygen for exercise and a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 10525**] for pneumonia, where he was discharged on levofloxacin, cefpodoxime and flagyl and at the time of discharge had an increased oxygen requirement to 1L at rest and 3L with activity who presents from his pulmonologists office with continued fever and hypoxia.
He was given vancomycin and zosyn (has a pcn allergy, although reportedly tolerated ok), and started on a heparin gtt.
During his ER course he continued to desaturate on 4LNC, and eventually required a NRB to keep his oxygen saturation in the 93-96% range, although he did not have any increased work of breathing or any signs of respiratory distress.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: Pulmonary fibrosis -- on home oxygen 2LNC when he excercises and sleeps bullous emphysema, h/o hemoptysis Lung nodules Osteoarthritis of Hip s/p right hip replacement [**2135**] Glucose Intolerance COPD diverticulosis OSA HTN colonic polyp h/o squamous cell carcinoma - SKIN-L clavicular area, SCC in situ hyprecholesterolemia nephrolithiasis BPH and prostatic nodule   Social History: Lives in a house in [**Location (un) 745**] with his wife.
Physical Exam: On Admission to MICU General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, oropharynx clear Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL, No Cervical adenopathy Cardiovascular: RRR, Nl S1,S2 no M/G/R Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: Crackles : in the right upper lobe area around his scapula and along his spine, no wheezes or rhonchi Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Not Distended Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: Absent, Left lower extremity edema: Absent, No Cyanosis, No Clubbing Skin:  Warm, No Rash: , No Jaundice Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Movement: Purposeful, Tone: Normal .
Furthermore, in       infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may vary.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74-year-old man with a history of IPF, bullous emphysema and recent admission for presumed CAP, discharged on a regimen of cefpodoxime, levofloxacin and metronidazole who now re-presents with worsening RUL pneumonia complicated by possible infected bulla and multiple small pulmonary emboli in the setting of significantly worsened hypoxemia.
For the HCAP and infected bullous/functional lung abscess he needed coverage for MRSA, pseudomonas and bacteroides and was placed on Vancomycin, Meropenem, and levofloxacin.
On the floor he was maintained on supplemental oxygen as needed to keep oxygen saturations above 92%.
Given his umimpressive history of a penicillin allergy, and his recent failure of cefpodoxime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, the patient was switched to Augmentin 875mg PO Q8H on [**8-12**] and monitored for allergic reaction.
He was discharged on Augmentin [**2125**] mg [**Hospital1 **] for 14 days.
He will discuss continuing the course of antibitoics with his pulmonologist and his PCP.
Of note, he was on DVT prophylaxis with SQ heparin during his recent hospitalization.
Heparin gtt was started, and coumadin was started on [**8-12**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] was discharged on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
Dosing of coumadin: [**8-12**]: 7.5 mg [**8-13**]: 5 mg [**8-14**]: 5 mg [**Location (un) 2274**] anti-coagulation nurses are aware that patient is starting coumadin and will contact patient regarding anti-coagulation follow-up.
#) Transaminitis: Patient with elevation of his AST and ALT during hospitalization.
#) Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Continue CPAP at night with supplemental oxygen with goal to keep oxygen sat > 92%, .
#) Hypertension: Patient was continued on home diltiazem XR 120mg daily with good blood pressure control .
#) Hypercholesterolemia: Initially held statin given elevation in LFTs.
Restarted statin at discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Beta-glucan and galactomannan pending at discharge - will be followed up by primary team # Outpatient work-up for elevated AST/ALT # Code: Full (confirmed with patient)   Medications on Admission: 1. pravastatin 40 mg DAILY 2. diltiazem HCl 120 mg ER DAILY 3. cefpodoxime 200 mg twice a day for 6 days.
4. levofloxacin 750 mg DAILY for 6 days.
5. metronidazole 500 mg Q8H for 6 days.
2. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
3. pravastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
4. amoxicillin-pot clavulanate 1,000-62.5 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr Sig: Two (2) Tablet Extended Release 12 hr PO twice a day for 14 days.
Disp:*56 Tablet Extended Release 12 hr(s)* Refills:*0* 5. warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO As directed: Take 5 mg on [**8-14**] and [**8-15**].

You were admitted to the MICU where you were started on antibiotics with improvement in your oxygen saturations.
You will need to continue antibiotics for another 14 days until you follow-up with your primary care doctor or pulmonary doctor.
We also started you on a blood thinner for the pulmonary embolism (blood clot in your lung).
We made the following changes to your medications 1.
START Augmentin [**2125**] mg (twice a day) for 14 days - you may continue this medication for longer.
START coumadin 5 mg daily for the next two days ([**8-14**] and [**8-15**]).
START lovenox 90 mg SC twice a day.
You will take this for the next 5 days OR until you have been therapeutic on coumadin for 48 hours (whichever is longer).
