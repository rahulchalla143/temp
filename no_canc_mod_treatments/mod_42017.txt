He was initially placed on BiPap and received Lasix 100mg IV in the ED for his respiratory distress; Bipap was quickly discontinued and the patient received Zosyn, IVF, and pain medication (morphine 2mg IV x 1) with significant improvement in his abdominal pain.
He had some hypotension to SBP 90s on the night of admission, however he never required pressor support.
Given that the patient is on Plavix (last dose 8/24 AM), it was decided to hold off on dilating the stricture and transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his cholangitis.
Patient reportedly tolerated the procedure well, but had some post-procedure wheezing that was treated with bronchodilators.
