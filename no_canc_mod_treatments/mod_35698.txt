EKG revealed increased prominence of previously appreciated ST elevations and a heparin drip was started per a cardiology consult.
Because of crescendo respiratory decline, the patient was evaluated by the ICU team who felt the patient required emergent intubation.
The patient was subsequently intubated for 5 days while steroids, nebulizers, and antibiotics were administered.

Brief Hospital Course: * Pulmonary: As discussed above, the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED in acute respiratory distress, requiring intubation to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.
Etiology of the COPD exacerbation was thought secondary to not taking prednisone after last hospital discharge; he reported the prescription was never called in and he quickly decompensated.
IV steroids and azithromycin were initiated concomittantly with nebulizer treatments.
The patient's respiratory status gradually improved and he was able to be extubated without complication after 5 days of ventilator dependence.
The patient was switched to po steroids and maintained on antibiotics and nebulizer treatments.
By day 6 of his hospitalization, the patient reported feeling at his baseline respiratory status on 3L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
A steroid taper was initiated and physical therapy evaluated the patient to be safe to return home with pulmonary rehab follow up.
The Cardiology service was consulted and they suggested starting a heparin drip until enzymes were cycled.
The patient continued to deny chest pain and when all cardiac markers were flat, the patient's heparin drip was discontinued.
Aspirin was continued and an ECHO was obtained to ensure the patient did not suffer a cardiac insult.
The results of that study are above, but essentially revealed no significant change from prior studies.
* Endo: While on steroid therapy, the patient was found to have persistently elevated blood sugar levels.
The patient was subsequently placed on a tight insulin sliding scale with good effect.
Starting the patient on a long acting insulin was discussed with him, but he adamantly refused to comply with injections at home.
Thus, the patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of metformin with the thought that as steroids are decreased, blood sugar levels will similarly become better controlled.
