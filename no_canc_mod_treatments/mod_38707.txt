Admission Date:  [**2184-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-2-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p cardiac catheterization and bare metal stent placement to LAD   History of Present Illness: 85 yo M with hyperlipidemia, HTN, who developed abdominal/L arm/chest pain earlier today and presented to an OSH with STEMI in V1-V2.
He was started on ASA, given Plavix 600mg, started on heparin and Integrillin.
During the cath, he had a bare metal stent placed in his LAD for a 95+% lesion.
Metoprolol was also titrated up and he was discharged on Toprol XL.
Since he had had an anterior STEMI and was thus at risk for a mural thrombus, he was maintained on a heparin drip.
Prior to discharge, he had a TTE which showed an LVEF of 35%, an LV aneurysm with possible mural thrombus, as well as focal akinesis of the anterior septum, distal anterior wall, and apex.
Due to the apical akinesis and question of mural thrombus, he is being discharged on warfarin with plans to followup with a new PCP here at [**Hospital1 18**] and the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **].
He will need warfarin for at least 6 months (to be further determined by his outpatient cardiologist and PCP).

It is very important that you take all of your medications as prescribed, especially the Plavix (clopidogrel) and aspirin, since these medicines will help to keep your new stent from clotting.
Do not stop taking the Plavix or aspirin without talking to your cardiologist.
Please discuss further dietary advice with your cardiologist.
For this, you have been started on a blood thinning medication called warfarin (also known as Coumadin).
You are being enrolled in the [**Hospital 95182**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 **]' here at [**Hospital1 18**] since you are being started on a new blood thinning medication (warfarin, also known as Coumadin).
