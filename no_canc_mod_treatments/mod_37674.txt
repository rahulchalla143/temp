Brief Hospital Course: 73 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, anxiety, and chronic siadenitis of the left submandibular gland due to a stone, who was noted to have right hemiplegia, language difficulties, and right-sided neglect after a left submandibular resection.
His examination was notable for a non-fluent aphasia, with impaired comprehension, repetition, and naming.
The patient was then transferred to the neurology service for further care including heparin drip given the occlusion and he was also closely followed by ENT for his submandibular resection.
He was successfully transferred to the floor service where he remained stable and the JP drain from the surgical site was removed on [**3-19**] per ENT who recommends follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] as outpatient and removal on sutures/staples on [**3-23**] as scheduled.
On [**3-19**], he was started on Coumadin with heparin drip continued for bridging.
he needs daily INR until INR stable and therapeutic between 2~3 with titration of Coumadin dose.
He was transitioned off heparin drip by discharge.
Also, patient needs intense occupational/physical plus speech therapy given that he is completely plegic on right side with slight right facial droop and expressive aphasia.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Post-operative stroke - likely embolic and hypoperfusion stroke in L MCA/ACA/PCA distribution   Discharge Condition: Stable - left submandibular hematoma with sutures to be removed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] on [**2123-3-23**]; Right hemiplegia (no movement in R arm even with noxious stimuli but triple flex in R leg with noxious stimuly plus slight R facial droop and expressive aphasia).
Given the occlusion right ICA occlusion and possible thrombus on left ICA, you were started on heparin drip with goal PTT 40~60 and Coumadin was started on [**3-19**] after ensuring that the hematoma was not increasing in size and hematocrit was stable.
You need heparin drip with goal PTT 40~60 until INR is therapeutic (2~3) with Coumadin.
