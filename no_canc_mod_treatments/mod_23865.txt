Special stain for H. pylori pending.
Her symptoms initially started with diarrhea and developed into abdominal pain and polymyalgias.
She was initially treated with Cipro/Flagyl, but this was stopped when C.diff, O+P, and all other infectious stool studies were negative and IBD became presumed diagnosis.
Patient was treated empirically with IV Solumedrol because she was in severe pain and had a nodular rash.
She then underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy and endoscopy.
Patient was changed from IV Solumedrol to PO prednisone for discharge and started on protonix and mesalamine 2g [**Hospital1 **].
She was treated with IV Dilaudid.
Given endoscopy showing ulcer and colonoscopy showing melena, the patient likely bled from her ulcer at some point.
