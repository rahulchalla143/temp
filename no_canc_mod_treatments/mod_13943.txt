Pt given [**Last Name (LF) 59739**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], NTG IV and started on Hep gtt.
However during the procedure Pt became hypotensive requiring Dopamine and an IABP placed without HD effect.
A left femoral catheter was placed and procedded to pass catheter to the right femoral artery with a goal of baloon tamponading the perforation.
During this process, the right femoral artery became totally occluded and salvaged with angioplasty and resultant good distal flow.
Physical Exam: VS: 96.5, 128/74, 76-99, 97% 6L NC  PE:  Lying comfortably in bed NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, dry MM, OP wnl supple, JVP not appreciable while supine, no bruits anteriorly CTAB RRR, S1/S2, no m/r/g abd soft, NT, ND, NABS ext without edema, 1+DP left and 2+ DP right, warm and well perfused groin site intact bilat with small hematoma on right no bruit.
Procedure complicated by RP bleed stabilized with baloon tamponade.
Pt maintained on [**Hospital1 **] and statin overnight, with ACEi and BB held until the morning once Pt showed HD stability.
Given her RP bleed, heparin was held as well.
Pt did not go immediately for CABG, given uncertainity as to her the benefit of bypass, amount of viable myocardium that would be salvagable, especially in light of her recent RP bleed.
Pt was maintained on BB and ACEi held as described above.
3) Vascular:  As per HPI, Pt with right femoral artery perforation controlled with baloon tamponade in the cath lab.
She was found to have a IVC clot during her second cardiac catheterization and an IVC filter was placed.
She was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation for 6 months.
