He was intubated and brought to the [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room at admission, where a left craniotomy for evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma was performed along with resection of the left temporal lobe for hemorrhagic contusion with a partial left anterior temporal lobectomy; and in addition, he had the left skull fracture repaired.
The patient tolerated the procedure and continued his hospital course under the care of the Trauma Service.
His intensive care unit stay was highlighted by his need for careful intracranial pressure monitoring with a ventriculostomy drain.
The patient did require sedation postoperatively with propofol; and to control his cerebral pressures, he also required mannitol initially postoperatively.
He was also placed on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He tolerated the procedure well.
Initially, he was placed on heparin after this procedure and eventually switched over to aspirin and Plavix for prophylaxisu after stent-assisted treatment of his persistent carotid-cavernous fistula.
He will need to continue on Plavix/ASA until further notice to prevent thrombosis of the Jostent Graftmaster stent-graft in his carotid artery.
He had a PEG tube placed while in the intensive care unit and this was successfully removed.
The PEG tube was removed on postoperative day number 46 from his original craniotomy.
He tolerated the removal of the PEG tube without difficulty and had a good appetite and had no difficulty maintaining an oral diet.
He did have a swallowing study evaluation prior to advancing his diet, and he did well with both solid foods and thin liquids.
His trach tube was successfully discontinued on postoperative day number 44, and the patient did not have any complications from the removal of the trach tube.
Occupational therapy was evaluating the patient and determined that he was still somewhat disoriented and required frequent reorientation, and he also demonstrated inappropriate behaviors such as quick, sudden movements and jumping out of bed in an inappropriate manner.
When not supervised, he was in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bed, and it was decided by the physical and occupational therapist that he would be best discharged to rehabilitation setting because the patient did not have insurance that would cover this.
