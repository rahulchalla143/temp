She was continued on Lasix for a goal of -500 cc in 24 hours.
She was also continued on her Digoxin and Zestril 10 mg q.d., which was increased to 12.5 mg q.d.
Lasix was at 40 mg intravenous b.i.d.
intake and Lasix on top of multiple, complex, other hemodynamic lesions including decreased ejection fraction, valvular disease and pulmonary embolus while she was in the cardiac care unit.
She had also received Percocet for pain and this might have exacerbated her hypovolemia.
She received isotonic fluid boluses for a systolic blood pressure of less than 85 or for symptoms.
Her Lasix was held on the night of [**2138-9-19**] and she was started on maintenance fluids.
Her Percocet was discontinued and her cardiac medications were changed to short-acting.
This showed no pneumothorax or infiltrate, but she was status post pleurodesis when the x-ray was taken and this could have complicated the picture.
Her blood pressure responded well to fluid boluses.
(B) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on aspirin and Lipitor.
She was continued on her heparin drip.
Her Coumadin was held for her thoracentesis on [**2138-9-13**] and her atenolol was continued.
Her heparin and Coumadin were both restarted after her thoracentesis.
On [**2138-9-17**], because her INR was 3, her Coumadin dose was decreased to 3 mg h.s.
Her Coumadin was held for one night and then continued again on [**2138-9-20**].
Her Digoxin was continued throughout her hospital stay.
The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask for a few hours after her tap and then a repeat chest x-ray was taken.
The analysis of her pleural fluid was consistent with an exudative bloody effusion with a broad differential including being secondary to her pulmonary embolus, congestive heart failure in the setting of heparin and diuresis or eosinophils secondary to air/blood; cancer was always a possibility as well as pneumonia.
Another repeat chest x-ray was done and, because of the reaccumulation of fluid, it was decided to place a chest tube on [**2138-9-16**].
On the morning of [**2138-9-17**], it was placed on water-seal with no air leak.
On [**2138-9-19**], her chest tube was removed by the cardiothoracic surgery service and she was given Percocet for pain treatment.
She had not responded well to past morphine and Ativan doses, responding with both lethargy and paranoia.
A chest x-ray after the chest tube was removed was essentially unchanged.
She also had a history of a seizure disorder and she had been continued on her Dilantin throughout this hospitalization.
The patient was continued on anticoagulation with heparin and Coumadin for both her atrial fibrillation and her new stroke.
She did not respond well to Ativan and morphine, which caused her to be sedated and paranoid.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on aspiration precautions and the speech and swallow team followed her while she was in the hospital.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**2138-9-14**], the patient complained of pain at her Foley catheter site and the urine looked dirty.
She was started prophylactically on three days of ciprofloxacin for a possible urinary tract infection.
