Last night, she used a pin to put a hole in her R leg in hopes of relieving pressure, noticed minimal clear drainage from the area.
Also has large ulcers in inguinal areas L>R (6cm ulcer with pus and drainage in L inguinal area, 1cm ulcer in R), she does dressing changes for these daily at home using Silvedene.
Pt says she was tested for HIV since stopping drugs and has been negative, HCV infection is "inactive" per her, she was never treated for this.
Review of systems: + Weight loss of 15 lbs in past month, decreased appetite; chronic headaches; + non-productive cough of few days No N/V, no diarrhea, no changes in urine or bowel, abdominal distension at baseline per pt  Past Medical History: Hepatitis C antibody positive, negative VL [**4-/2143**], neg VL [**4-5**] HIV negative as of [**4-5**] IVDU with unclear timeline of use [**Name (NI) **] Deficiency Anemia Septic R shoulder s/p drainage and debridement of rotator cuff Osteo of spine Thigh ulcers (left upper thigh ulcer for >7 years) MSSA bacteremia with endocarditis resulting in 8 week [**Hospital1 2025**] admission in [**4-4**] MSSA osteo [**2143**] resulting in 7 week [**Hospital1 18**] admission in [**2143**]  Non-caseating granulomas ([**6-3**]): liver biopsy, bone marrow, gastric antrum thought to be the etiology of her elevated alk phos (likely a result of injecting heroin with cocaine containing talc)  Social History: Lives with parents given need for assistance but has her own home.
Physical Exam: GA: AOx3, NAD HEENT:  PERRLA, moist oral mucosa, anicteric sclera Cards: RRR, S1/S2, holosystolic murmur [**4-2**] in LUSB Pulm: coarse breath sounds B/L, no wheezes or rales Abd: soft, distended, + hepatosplenomegaly, no appreciable fluid wave, non-tender, no rebound/guarding 6x6cm draining ulcer in L inguinal area; 1x1cm ulcer in R inguinal area Extremities: R>L edema and erythema, no distinct border, warm to touch b/l, erythematous, small draining tract on R dorsal shin, scaling b/l, 2+ distal pulses Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact.
Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolci function with inotropic support 2.
Though pt reports not having used heroin in the past 6 months, ulcers have not healed despite dressing changes at home.
Pt was started on IV nafcillin for MSSA, to complete a total 6-week course.
Of note, pt has history of MSSA infections in the past (abscesses, bacteremia, and R sided endocarditis) for which she completed nafcillin courses.
Started on 6-week course of IV nafcillin as above.
Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted and did not recommend acute surgical intervention given bacteremia and no decompensated heart function.
This respiratory failure was quickly reversed with diuresis and NIMV, and was thought to be [**3-1**] severe aortic valve insufficiency in the setting of patient anxiety.
Similar episodes occurred intermittently in the ICU with any mild increase in SVR, so patient was kept with sedative/opiate regimen to stave off anxiety.
Cardiac surgery was consulted, and it was agreed that surgical correction of valve was only viable therapeutic option.
She had been doing daily dressing changes at home though these ulcers were likely infected on admission (6x6cm in L anterior thigh area, 2x2cm in R).
Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted, plastic surgery did not recommend surgical debriding, pt had wet-to-dry dressing changes three times a day which required 1mg IV dilaudid for pain control beforehand.
Once pt completes antibiotic course for bacteremia and endocarditis, she will follow up with plastic surgery to consider flap placement to ensure healing.
Pt had bilateral venous stasis changes and 1+ edema below knees, in addition to leg elevation and betamethasone cream, she was diuresed with lasix and had decrease in edema and pain in legs.
Given aortic valve vegetation, will maintain high suspicion for valve dysfunction contributing to hypotension.
# Anxiety - continue home 1mg TID ativan .
- outpt work-up for ?malignancy - LFTs stable  # IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months - social work consult MICU Course The patient is a 46 yo F with hx of IVDU complicated by MSSA verebral osteo [**2143**], and prior history of endocarditis [**2145**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], h/o MRSA/pseudomonal hip wound infection, HCV, granulomatous disease of GI tract, chronic inguinal ulcers, and anxiety with MSSA endocarditis who was transferred to the MICU for hypercarpic respiratory failure and code blue after being briefly unresponsive.
Although pt with high tolerance and has been stable on dilaudid dosing and no recent increase.
Pt was extubated after being intubated for 2 days and sating well on 2L NC/RA.
MSSA Endocarditis: Pt previously on Nafcillin for MSSA endocarditis seen on TEE.
Pt had stat ECHO performed at bedside by cardiology  ID consulted and recommended changing to vancomycin and meropenem given concern for sepsis upon initial presentation to ICU, which was later switched back to Nafcillin given stable BP's and clinical status, as this provides better coverage of her MSSA bacteremia.Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures .
Sepsis was initially also a concern in this pt with MSSA endocarditis but given mixed venous of < 70, cardiogenic is more likely.
Required briefly phenylephrine but was later weaned off and tolerated well without.
ECG Changes: Pt with inverted t-waves in the setting of her severe acidosis and tachycardia.
Per cardiology, will not pursue anticoagulation for concern of ACS , according to ECHO report patient most likely experienced coronary artery embolization from her endocarditis .
- wound care with wet to dry dressings TID  .
However, given respiratory failure after receiving dilaudid and ativan, will be conservative in dosing, ordered Lorazepam 1 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN anxiety , HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.5-1 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain/agitation .
Transfused 2 units PRBCs,did not increase appropiately to first unit and DIC labs were sent which were unremarkable, Guiac stools...  Cardiac Surgery Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-21**] where the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with 23mm Porcine tissue valve.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
She remained on epinephrine and propofol drips.
Decadron was initiated for lack of cuff leak on POD 2.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.
ID continued to follow and the patient is to be maintained on Nafcillin for a 6 week course through [**2147-1-9**].
Fluconazole was initiated for yeast in the urine.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 5, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
Does not take any other medications at present.
