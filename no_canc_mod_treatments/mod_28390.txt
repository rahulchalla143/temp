PRENATAL SCREENS:  Blood group A+; direct antibody test negative; hepatitis B surface antigen negative; RPR nonreactive; rubella immune; gonococcus negative; Chlamydia negative; HIV negative; quadruple-AFP normal/low risk; cystic fibrosis negative.
Pregnancy was complicated by ventricular size discrepancy noted on fetal survey with subsequent echo showing the following: hypoplastic left heart syndrome with probable aortic and mitral valve atresia, mild tricuspid regurgitation, adequate pulmonary artery, good right ventricular systolic function, large PDA, small left atrium, moderate nonrestrictive atrial septal defect.
Elective cesarean section was undertaken, without prior labor, for fetal indications.
Two peripheral IVs have been started, and prostaglandin has been initiated at 0.01 mcg/kg per minute.
We will therefore defer antibiotic coverage for now but consider this if cardiorespiratory symptoms develop.
Enteral feeds will be deferred given the likelihood of cardiorespiratory compromise.
The infant will require postnatal abdominal ultrasound in followup of the antenatally diagnosed renal dilatation.
Prostaglandin 0.01 mcg/kg per minutes through peripheral     IV.
The infant has not received a hearing screen or hepatitis B immunization.
Vitamin K and ophthalmic erythromycin prophylaxis have been administrated.
