Admission Date:  [**2141-10-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-10-23**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency who is admitted for asymptomatic right carotid stenosis now here for stenting.
The patient was admitted for an elective stenting of his right carotid artery.
The patient underwent stenting of his right coronary artery without any complications.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2131**] four vessel disease.
NPH insulin b.i.d.
Right ICA stent:  The patient was admitted for elective stenting of his right ICA.
This was following a carotid duplex in [**Month (only) **], which showed significant occlusion in his right ICA with moderate to severe disease with 40 to 60% stenosis on the right.
The patient did undergo a right ICA stent without any intraoperative complications.
He was subsequently started on aspirin.
Initially Plavix was held given plans for mitral valve replacement in the near future, however, later in the hospitalization following discussion with CT surgery staff he was started on Plavix.
The patient was closely monitored after the surgery and remained neurologically intact.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease, the patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
He had a recent cardiac catheterization prior to admission at an outside hospital, however, this was a technically complicated procedure and his grafts were thought to not be well visualized during this catheterization.
He was already known to have total occlusion of his right coronary artery graft and this was not further explored.
His left internal mammary coronary artery left anterior descending coronary artery graft was widely patent.
His saphenous vein grafts were already known to be occluded and were not further explored.
The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the AV groove branch of the LCX and also in the proximal LCX.
The patient was maintained on a regimen of aspirin, Plavix, statin and beta blocker.
The patient was briefly on heparin prior to catheterization given his unstable angina.
Following the catheterization with successful angioplasty he was taken off his heparin.
He was maintained on ace inhibitor for after load reduction as per his outpatient regimen.
Valve, the patient with known mitral valve disease who was thought to need a mitral valve repair in the future.
The patient was maintained on an ace inhibitor for after load reduction.
The patient was to follow up with CT surgery following discharge to formulate plans for mitral valve repair.
Rhythm, the patient maintained on telemetry throughout the hospitalization.
His beta blocker was titrated down and these symptoms resolved.
He received intravenous fluids and Mucomyst with his catheterization and his creatinine stabilized and returned to his baseline prior to discharge.
FEN:  The patient maintained on cardiac diet.
His electrolytes were followed and his potassium and magnesium were maintained.
