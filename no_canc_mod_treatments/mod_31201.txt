On review of her med list it appears lasix 60mg PO was started [**2-15**] and lopressor 25mg PO BID was started on [**2137-2-14**].

- SVT in the setting of hypoxia with admission [**5-28**] - [**5-28**] PNA treated with Vanc, Cefepime   Social History: Transfered from [**Hospital3 **].
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if indicated.
The patient has been now intubated and ETT is seen to reach the central portion of the right main bronchus.
Previously described left internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position.
An apparently new NG tube reaches only to mid portion of esophagus.
#Shock: Patient arrived hypotensive despite extensive IVF resuscitation and required dopamine via PIV.
She was covered broadly for infection with Cefepime and Vanco, with the addition of Azithromycin and Flagyl later in the hospitalization.
Central venous access was obtained and an arterial line was placed for close blood pressure and ABG monitoring.
She was persistently tachycardic and started on metoprolol and diltiazem for control of her atrial fibrilliation/atrial flutter, without success.
The patient's blood pressure began to drop once again and she was placed on phenylephrine and eventually needed to be started on norepinephrine + vasopression with minimal effect.
On admission, her respiratory status was close to baseline, but her progressive lung disease combined with the fluids she was given to support her blood pressures would intermittently put her into pulmonary edema.
Her oxygen requirement slowly climbed and her chest x-rays appeared to worsen, requiring intubation due to increased work of breathing, outstripping non-invasive ventilation.
She had not had any exposure to heparin since her previous hospitalization.
DIC labs were normal and she was continued on heparin SQ.
RUQ U/S showed an incidental finding of ?acalculous cholecystitis and IR was consulted.
She was tried on increasing amounts of AV nodal blockers to control her tachycardia, without effect.
