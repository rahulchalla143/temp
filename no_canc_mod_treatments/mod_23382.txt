Status post right lower lobe resection with open window thoracoplasty changes and packing material in the right pleural space.
Brief Hospital Course: 70M with HIV (undetectable VL), inflammatory arthritis on chronic steroid therapy, SCC s/p RLL lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated by bronchopleural fistula treated with [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, as well as empyema and invasive aspergillosis on outpatient voriconazole admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock from pneumonia.
He required intubation on [**2147-8-8**].
Due to right sided air leak and dense disease on left lung it was difficult to ventilate the patient with a single endotracheal tube.
He was switched to a double lumen endotracheal tube on [**2147-8-9**] that was much better tolerated.
Due to the severity of his illness and his compromised immune status and risk for infection(HIV, chronic steroid use, malnutrition, and extended hospitalizations) he was treated broadly for HCAP with a 14 day course ending of [**2147-8-21**] as well as a 21 day course of therapeutic bactrim and steroids for PCP.
He elected to undergo tracheostomy and PEG placement to improve comfort.
After tracheostomy fever and increased sputum returned.
Cultures again were negative and patient was started on another 7 day course of HCAP treatment (cefepime, cipro, vancomycin with last dose on [**2147-9-2**]).
With initiation of antibiotics fevers resolved.
At time of discharge patient was tolerating trach mask for the majority of the day and required ventilator during the night.
Continue weaning patient on ventilator and encourage use of [**Date Range **] [**Date Range **] valve for communication.
On arrival to the ICU he had persistently low blood pressures, tachycardia, and low urine output despite agressive volume resuscitation in the setting of active lung infection.
After initial treatment of infection subsequent hypotension was thought to be multifactorial including medication induced vasodilation (versed, propofol), overdiuresis, relative adrenal insufficiency and diastolic heart failure.
Of note, noninvasive blood pressure readings were found to be consistently 10 points below arterial line blood pressure readings.
Tachycardia was believed to be multifactorial due to intravascular depletion, fever, infection, pain, hypoxia, pressors, and withdrawal of sedation.
With resolution of infection and management of oral secretions his rate fell to 90-110s.
He was ultimately started on metoprolol to improve cardiac output given his diastolic heart failure.
At time of discharge patient is maintaining HRs of 90s with noninvasive systolic blood pressure readings of 90s-100s with Metoprolol 37.5 mg po TID.
# Invasive aspergillosis: Patient was continued on outpatient regimen of voriconazole until [**2147-8-22**].
Recommend follow up with Thoracic Surgery for future wound care and management.
# HIV: Patient continued on home HAART regimen.
Recommend continuing home HAART regimen and following up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after discharge from rehab.
During admission he was continued on aspirin and statin.
His metoprolol was restarted at a lower dose and titrated up after pressors were weaned off.
# Glycemic Control:  FSBS QID with sliding scale insulin # Lines:  PICC placed [**2147-8-9**] # Prophylaxis: - Continue lovenox 40 mg sc daily for DVT prophylaxis.
- Continue ranitidine 150 mg daily for stress ulcer prophylaxis while on ventilator.

[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85241**] on discharge [ ] Ensure patient makes it to follow up appointment with Thoracic Surgery in clinic post discharge [ ] After completion of antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime) can discontinue PICC line.

Patient afebrile and off pressors for several days prior to discharge.
Tolerating tube feeds.
You were admitted to the ICU and ultimately required intubation for your lung infection.
Unfortunately you continued to have great deal of secretions that caused you to become short of breath and you were too weak to protect your lungs.
You had a tracheostomy placed to help protect your airway from secretions and to help aid suctioning.
You received nutrition during the majority of your admission via a feeding tube through your nose.
Because you continued to be too weak to safely swallow regular food you underwent placement of a percutaneous feeding tube.
You tolerated the procedure well and were fed through this external feeding tube.
