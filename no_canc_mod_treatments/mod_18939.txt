Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name8 (MD) 6507**], MD, Interpreting physician   Brief Hospital Course: 52yo man w/ AIDS, hepatitis C, CAD s/p MI, bicuspid AV w/ severe AR & MR, w/ h/o CHF (EF unkown) who presents w/ escalating chest pain.
CT surgery evaluated the patient and scheduled CABD and valve replacement/repair surgery for Friday [**1-14**].
he was transferred to the CCU where he became unresponsive and sufferred a cardiac arrest was resuscitated with chest compreessions for about 45 minutes with no response.
He was placed on ECMO at the bedside in the intensive care unit following which a decision was made to proceed with the operation given his young age though he had already had cardiac arrest for a substantial period.
He was emergently brought to surgery to undergo valve replacement and CABG.
# Hep C: The patient has never received therapy for his hepatitis C. Outside records of a liver biopsy in [**5-30**] demonstrated steatosis, lymphocytic infiltration of portal triads with piecemeal necrosis and lobular inflammation.
trichrome stain with expansion of portal triads with portal-to-portal and portal-to-central vein bridging and fibrosis surrounding single cells.
Diagnosis: chronic hepatitis, grade 3, stage 2 consistent with HCV infection.
Post cardiopulmonary bypass he had difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation and was placed on a venovenous ECMO.
On the night of surgery he sustained a cardiac arrest again and underwent open chest cardiac massage and was succesfully resuscitated.
Over the next twenty four hours he was successfully weaned off the ECMO and maintained saturations.
the next day he again sustained another cardiac arrest and this time could not be resuscitated by internal cardiac massage and was placed on arteriovenous ecmo as a last option.
