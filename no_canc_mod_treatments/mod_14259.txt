Evolving known right internal capsule and right pons hemorrhage with interval decrease in attenuation.
His blood pressure was maintained < 160 mmHG with nicardipine as needed.
His home aspirin was held.
His hypertension improved and he was weaned from nicardipine.
# ID/Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he recieved an 8 day course of vancomycin and cefepime starting [**9-12**].
Blood cultures ([**9-29**]) were noted to be positive for coagulase negative staph, and Vancomycin treatment was restarted.
The most recent cultures ([**10-6**]) continued to grow pseudamonas and Zosyn treatment was initiated.
He should continue on a 2 week course of antibiotics (zosyn, vancomycin) to end on [**10-24**].
# Cardiovascular/Hypertension: On admission, the patient was monitored on telemetry with no major events and nicardipine drip was used for SBP > 160.
He was started on lasix which significantly improved his hypertension and peripheral edema.
Standing lasix was discontinued prior to discharge.
# Abdomen/GI:  The patient initially had an OG tube which was noted to have dark output.
He was maintained on IV protonix and output cleared.
He was started on tube feeds on [**9-9**].
An agressive bowel regimen was initiated with good results.
In addition to the above, given the prolonged nature of his hospitalization, a PEG tube was placed on [**10-3**] for long term nutritional managment.
He has continued to have adequate stool output on his current bowel regimen, but his abdomen should be monitored and medications increased accordingly.
He required ventilatory assistance throughout his hospitalization.
Due to failure to wean completely from the vent, a tracheostomy was performed on [**10-3**].
He has required pressure support ventilation since that time, but has been weaning down on the amount of support required and is currently on PSV5/5-->[**9-3**] depending on the day.
He has the potential for only partial ventilation requirements as his pneumonia improves.
The patient was started on occular antibiotic treatments and will require continued ophthalmologic evaluation as an outpatient.
His antibiotic course is currently scheduled to end on [**10-21**].
# Gentiourinary:  The patient had a traumatic foley placement on admission.
He was evaluated by urology this hospitalization and was felt to have no barrier to future foley placement or removal.
His foley was exchanged once during this hospitalization for concern of yeast colonization; the patient underwent a short course of fluconazole treatment.
The foley should be removed when possible.
