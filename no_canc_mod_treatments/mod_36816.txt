HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease who has been on hemodialysis for the last 15 years who was initially admitted [**11-17**] for a splenic laceration several weeks post motor vehicle accident.
The patient was admitted to surgery and went to the Operating Room on [**11-18**] where he had open splenectomy.
He had a 500 cc blood loss, after which he was transferred 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.
In the PACU, he was extubated but required intubation due to obtundation and inability to protect his airway.
The patient was noticed to have 2500 cc of blood loss with the surgery and postoperative he was noted to have no flow to his right AV fistula graft.
The patient was admitted to the SICU where he received 33 units of packed red blood cells as well as fresh frozen plasma.
The patient had Quinton catheter placed for temporary hemodialysis access.
The patient remained intubated secondary to volume overload.
The patient in the SICU was also found to have sinus tachycardia with a negative CTA and electrocardiogram demonstrating T-wave inversions in 1, L, V2 through V6.
The patient was finally stabilized and was extubated on [**11-22**] and required intermittent Bi-PAP and was difficult to wean from respiratory support.
The patient was initially transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team for further management of his respiratory failure on [**2187-11-27**].
The patient was weaned to nasal cannula, but required nightly CPAP.
The patient had received 6 mg of morphine overnight and Narcan empirically after he was discovered to have an arterial blood gas that was 7.19/64/240.
With Bi-PAP, the patient improved and was weaned to nasal cannula again.
The patient received epi and Atropine 1 mg x3 and was emergently intubated.
Arterial blood gases prior to intubation 7.00/98/69.
The patient received 6 mg of adenosine also with no effect.
The patient was started on a Neo GGT and had improvement of his blood pressure and tachycardia.
The patient has end stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**2171**].
The patient has a history of bacterial endocarditis in [**2175**], status post mitral valve replacement and debridement of perivalvular abscess.
Metoprolol 25 mg intravenous q4h 2.

In short, this a 49-year-old male initially admitted for splenectomy with a complicated hospital course including postoperative bleed and multiple hypercarbic arrests who presented again to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2187-12-11**] after hypercarbic respiratory arrest and subsequent hemodynamic collapse.
Pulmonary - respiratory failure:  The patient's respiratory failure is presumed to be due to a combination of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis, narcosis and multiple aspiration events.
Additionally, the patient's volume status was tenuous and frequently felt to be contributing to his inability to wean from mechanical ventilation.
This is notable for bilateral pleural effusions as well as consolidation at both lung bases concerning for infection.
The patient was re-extubated on [**2187-12-16**] and initially did well, however he required re-intubation for PEA arrest on [**2187-12-17**].
The patient did well after reintubation, particularly after aggressive hemodialysis brought him down to his pre hospital weight.
However, given that the patient had already undergone two hypercarbic respiratory arrests after extubation while in the hospital and given his underlying tendency to aspirate as well as his diaphragmatic paralysis, it was agreed that the patient should undergo tracheostomy and more protracted coarse of weaning from the ventilator.
The patient underwent tracheostomy at the bedside on [**2187-12-27**].
The patient was tolerating trials of pressure support only, breathing well on his own, especially when close to euvolemic at the time of this dictation.
The patient was loaded with amiodarone and resumed sinus rhythm.
The patient had had his hypertension managed with hydralazine while he was NPO after being weaned off pressors.
However, at the time of this dictation, the patient had been restarted back on his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor.
Renal:  The patient underwent hemodialysis throughout the course of his hospital stay as well as ultrafiltration when necessary to remove extra fluid.
The patient had been empirically started on antibiotics prior to undergoing further work up.
However, the patient's antibiotics were stopped after patient had a TTE that was negative for endocarditis, a full body CT scan which showed no evidence of abscess and his pleural effusion showed no evidence of infectious etiology either.
Following the PEA arrest, though, which was on [**12-17**] and thought to be associated with an aspiration event, the patient was started on Ceftaz and Flagyl.
The patient completed a 14 day course of Ceftaz and Flagyl and had remission of his leukocytosis.
The patient underwent right upper extremity ultrasound and was noted to have a deep venous thrombosis in his subclavian and basilic vein given the concern for clotting of his hemodialysis catheter.
The patient was started on heparin until his surgical procedures were finished, at which time the plan was to transition him over to Lovenox.
The patient had been started on TPN while in the SICU on [**11-22**].
At this time, it was also thought that the patient would receive PEG tube in the next day or two, however the patient's PEG tube was delayed due to scheduling issues.
The patient was restarted on tube feeds which he tolerated at a slow rate initially before becoming nauseous and developing an elevated lipase for which the tube feeds were stopped.
The patient had two attempts at percutaneous PEG placement which were unsuccessful, one at the bedside with an endoscope and the other down in Interventional Radiology.
Given the patient's complicated abdominal anatomy, it was decided to consult surgery for open PEG placement which was pending at the time of this dictation.
Psych:  The patient was considerably anxious during his hospitalization which was controlled with Ativan.
The patient was started on Paxil to help improve his mood in the long term.
Endocrine:  The patient was maintained on Synthroid throughout the course of his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.
This responded to 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient did not require any further transfusions through the date of [**2187-12-31**].
Tube feeds as stated above needed to be stopped.
The patient's tube feeds were thus stopped.
