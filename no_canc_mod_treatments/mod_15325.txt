She has been on a tracheostomy since [**2146-9-28**] when she had a coronary artery bypass graft at an outside hospital and had failure to wean.
She was transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for ventilatory weaning and was given the diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia and had two stents placed in the distal trachea and left main stent.
Her ventilator settings at that time were assist control with a tidal volume of 600, a respiratory rate of 12, an FIO2 of 0.5, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6.
She was being bagged through her tracheostomy and was hemodynamically stable.
She had an urgent bronchoscopy, as the original thought was that perhaps her stents had been displaced causing blockage and hypoxia.
Subsequently, her clinical status improved, and she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for followup and stabilization.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146-9-28**] at [**Hospital6 1708**].
Failure to wean; status post coronary artery bypass graft with tracheostomy placement.
History of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia and sepsis; status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Atrial fibrillation; status post coronary artery bypass graft.
A recent diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia with placement of silicon stents.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post aortic femoral bypass.
Peptic ulcer disease; status post a total gastrectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission included)  1.
Prednisone 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Bumex 1 mg intravenously once per day.
Zestril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Lantus 12 units subcutaneously once per day.
Lansoprazole 30 mg by mouth once per day.
Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously ever week.
Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Linezolid 600 mg q.12h.
Bactrim 10 cc q.12h.
Flagyl 500 mg q.8h.
Morphine as needed.
Ativan as needed.
Tube feeds through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.
Status post bronchoscopy, there was improved air movement bilaterally.
Status post bronchoscopy, her arterial blood gas levels markedly improved.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  Originally, the patient was kept on her original antibiotics including linezolid and levofloxacin.
Levaquin was continued for double coverage of Serratia.
A 10-day course of these antibiotics is anticipated with the date of completion for both the clindamycin and ceftriaxone being on [**2-25**].
Given the fact that we had a source of Serratia and Klebsiella in the sputum with no evidence of positive blood cultures, linezolid was discontinued.
HYPOTENSION/SHOCK ISSUES:  Initially, the patient came to us with a low blood pressure with required a Levophed drip to be maintained.
She remained on the Levophed drip for approximately four days into her admission.
Different pressors including dobutamine and dopamine were used, but discontinued due to side effects of tachypnea, tachycardia, and vasodilation.
With treatment of her pneumonia with antibiotics as well as initiation of digoxin, she has been able to maintain her blood pressures adequately without the need for pressors.
At the time of discharge, she had been off any pressors or drips for greater than four days.
It was decided to start her on stress doses of steroids for seven days.
She received fludrocortisone by mouth and hydrocortisone intravenously, which was discontinued on the day prior to discharge.
Initially, she was written for a sliding-scale; however, it was thought that with stress-dose steroids this increased her glucose and was difficult to maintain just on a sliding-scale.
Therefore, an insulin drip was started which will be discontinued following the completion of her stress-dose steroids.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient came to us with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and received tube feeds per Nutrition consultation.
SEDATION ISSUES:  The patient remained on a Versed drip and Fentanyl drip during her time here, which were weaned approximately 20% per day toward her discharge.
She was given Haldol as needed to aid with the sedation weaning.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin three times per day, pneumatic boots, and a proton pump inhibitor.
