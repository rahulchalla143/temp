HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is an 83-year-old African American Male with a history of [**State 531**] Heart Association Class IV- heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2096**] with re-do in [**2108**].
Atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.2, status post AICD with biventricular pacer placed [**8-17**] who presented with hyperthermia and a temperature of 107 degrees.
The patient was intubated and brought to the [**Hospital1 1444**] emergency department.
The patient was given ice packs to the groin and axilla and a cooling blanket as well as three liters of normal saline with a resulting temperature of 102 and a heart rate of 87 and a blood pressure of 118/59.
The patient was noted to have some convulsive and twitching movements in his facial muscles that were not rhythmic and in his extremities and was therefore given 4 mg of Versed intravenous and 4 mg Ativan intravenous with no improvement.
Two grams of Ceftriaxone intravenous and 1 gram of Vancomycin were also given.
The patient was placed on assist control ventilation with a volume of 500 and rate of 10.

IMPRESSION:  83-year-old male with Class IV congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 20%, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD with biventricular pacer admitted with severe hyperthermia.
Initially the patient was given loading doses of Dilantin in order to treat his seizure like activity in the emergency department.
He was continued on Dilantin at prophylactic doses and in the MICU.
There was no further seizure like activity noted on exam and due to the lack of seizure activity and the likelihood that the seizure were due to his hypothermia the Dilantin was discontinued on [**2115-7-13**].
Therefore, the Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were discontinued on [**2115-7-8**].
The patient was continued on Levofloxacin and Metronidazole for possible aspiration pneumonia.
The acute renal failure was most likely due to a combination of factors including rhabdomyolysis with myoglobin induced tubular damage (CK 1671), hypotension with pre-renal failure and ATN.
A subsequent electrolyte panel and Arterial blood gases showed metabolic alkalosis so his fluids were changed to normal saline.
They recommended continuing his outpatient diuretics so that the patient was started on Lasix intravenous 80 mg twice a day and Zaroxolyn 5 mg twice a day.
The patient was thought to have had the Foley placed in the prostate.
The following day the patient's exam was consistent with congestive heart failure so he was given Lasix 160 intravenous with no urine output.
Urology was called to replace the Foley and the patient voided 600 cc's bloody urine and then continued to void 100 cc's per hour.
Considering his history of coronary artery disease he was transfused one unit packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit greater then 30.
On day four of admission the patient was noted to have an INR of 1.3 and a PTT of 42.8 with platelets of 97 so he was given one dose of Vitamin K and a DIC panel and LFTs were sent.
He was started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day.
Because of bloody OG suction, aspirin and Heparin were held.
The patient was 9 liters positive on [**2115-7-12**] with crackles on lung exam therefore, he was given 160 mg intravenous Lasix in addition to his usual home doses of diuretic.
Therefore, he was given 10 mg intravenous of Hydralazine to help decrease afterload.
The patient was intubated for airway protection by EMS.
He was over breathing the vent, oxygenating and ventilating well with minimal secretions.
RSBI on [**2115-7-12**] was 70 to 100 and he did well with a Supraventricular tachycardia over three hours.
That afternoon he began to have oxygen saturation of 80% and was given Lasix and Hydralazine and he improved.
On discharge to floor the patient required 4 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 94%  8.
Aspirin was held.
PPI and Heparin subcutaneously were given.
Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] was discharged to the floor on the same medications that he was on as in the MICU.
