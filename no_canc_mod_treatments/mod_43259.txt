HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**9-15**] and taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for an aortic valve replacement and a coronary artery bypass graft times two.
[**Month (only) **] mechanical valve and the bypasses were left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain adequate blood pressure.
Total bypass time was 125 minutes, cross clamp time was 89 minutes.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on the first postoperative afternoon.
The patient was started on Lasix for diuresis and the patient was started on Coumadin.
It was noted that the patient preoperatively had had a urinary tract infection and the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for this.
By postoperative day number three, the patient's INR had quickly risen to 3.5 and the patient still had her epicardial pacing wires in.
It was decided that since the patient had a mechanical valve replacement, the pacing wires could not be cut and it would be the best presentation to let the INR drift down and remove the patient's pacing wires when the INR fell below 1.8.
During this time, the patient was ambulating with Physical Therapy and by postoperative day number three, was able to keep a Level V, walking 500 feet and climbing one flight of stairs without difficulty.
By postoperative day number seven, the patient's INR reached 1.6 and the pacing wires were removed without difficulty.
On postoperative day number eight, the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 150s treated with intravenous and oral amiodarone, intravenous Lopressor and subsequently an intravenous Diltiazem infusion.
The patient was instructed about coughing an deep breathing and the use of an incentive spirometer and over the next couple of days, the chest x-ray appearance improved.
The patient was converted from intravenous Diltiazem to oral Diltiazem on postoperative day number nine and the patient subsequently converted into sinus rhythm on postoperative day number ten.
Again, the patient had briefly been placed on Levofloxacin for a presumed urinary tract infection which was discontinued, however, at that time, the patient's INR had risen to 3.8.
Once the Levofloxacin was discontinued, the patient's INR began drifting down and by postoperative day number fifteen, it was determined that the patient was on a stable enough dose of Coumadin that she could be safely discharged to home.
