Widespread ground-glass attenuation likely represents pulmonary edema as reported on serial chest radiographs, but superimposed asymmetrical foci of consolidation in the lower lobes and 2 small nodules raises the concern for coexisting pulmonary infection.
Over distention of endotracheal tube cuff.
No history of cholecystectomy could be elicited from CareWeb.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and alcohol use in past), ileostomy, GERD with delayed gastric emptying, who presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**10-28**] with nausea and dizziness.
She continued to have general malaise and fevers despite bactrim and asa.
She was given home doses of simvastatin and SSRIs, but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0.
She was thought to be in hyperacute fulminant liver failure either secondary to Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity - tylenol level peaked at 10.0 >24 hrs after last ingestion.
She became progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy requiring intubation and ventilatory support.
She became progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation for survival.
The patient initially had blood pressure support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her cerebral edema.
The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and there was no further requirement for this.
Hypertonic saline and mannitol were used for aggressive volme managment.
Her sedation and paralytics were weaned.
She was started on Keppra for seizureprophylaxis to finish a 10-day course.
In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient required full ventilatory support with hypoxic respiratory failure.
She initially did well, but, secondary to what was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on [**2187-11-13**] after failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
She was on Vancomycin fom [**2187-10-31**] for ppx with bold placement.
She then developed a drug rash leading to the discontinuation of Vanc and Zosyn on [**11-10**].
Cipro was started in lieu of Zosyn but was discontinued on [**11-13**] .
1 Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: s/p bolt removal with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy [**3-3**] liver failure.
However, she was re-evaluated on [**11-23**] prior to transfer and she was found to be safe to take teaspoon trials of nectar thick liquids and pureed food.
Will plan to continue tube feeds for nutrition at this time.
We recommend she continue on NS at 75 cc/hr for now.
- Continue IVF with NS at 75cc/hour .
S/p tx with zosyn.
# Drug Rash: Drug rash per derm thought to be most likely [**3-3**] Zosyn but Vanc or fluconazole also possible.
Will continue iron supplementation.
Please see attached note from wound care about recommended dressing.
Pt should be followed by wound care specialists as an outpatient.
We would recommend that pt continue IVF, NS at 75cc/hour until she is better able to take in PO volume.
Also, she is currently cleared to take nectar thick liquids and pureed foods in teaspoon trials.
Code- Full  Medications on Admission: Medications prior to hospitalization are unable to be confirmed by pt during this hospitalization.
Lansoprazole 30 mg Tablet,Rapid Dissolve, DR [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet,Rapid Dissolve, DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] DAILY (Daily).
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Ferrous Sulfate 300 mg (60 mg Iron)/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hyperacute fulminant hepatic failure Secondary diagnoses: Acute Renal failure Increased intracranial pressure s/p Bolt procedure Intraparenchymal bleed Aphasia Dysphagia OCD Anemia Drug rash   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with liver failure.
We are unsure of the exact cause of your liver failure at this time but we think it was a reaction to the tylenol and bactrim you had been taking.
While you were here you also had kidney failure.
You recieved dialysis for this but you no longer need this and your kidney function is returning to normal.
This required a bolt placement in your head to monitor your pressure.
You will need extensive physical and occupational therapy at rehab.
