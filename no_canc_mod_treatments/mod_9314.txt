HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2181-8-16**], which revealed an ejection fraction of approximately 55%, 50% discrete right coronary artery proximal stenosis, 95% mid RCA, 80% discrete stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, 70% of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, 70% diagonal 1 stenosis, 80% midcircumflex, and 70% distal circumflex.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for coronary artery revascularization.
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 on [**2181-8-20**].
The patient received a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1, and a sequential graft to the obtuse marginal #2, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal #1, and saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending coronary artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications, and was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition.
The patient was kept intubated overnight and was successfully extubated the following day on postoperative day one.
He was treated with Lopressor intravenous push.
Amiodarone drip was started and the patient was noted still to be tachycardic with little response to the amiodarone.
A diltiazem drip was also started, as the patient did have V wires in place.
Thus, 80 mg of intravenous Lasix was given with a good response of the patient, both with urine output and symptomatically with increasing oxygen saturation.
Thus, he was maintained on intravenous Lasix during the rest of his hospital course, and subsequently his oxygen saturation and breathing pattern improved dramatically.
His diltiazem drip was discontinued.
His amiodarone drip was changed to p.o.
He is currently maintained on intravenous Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.
