Status post cardiac arrest ten years ago.
Corgard 20 mg p.o.
Lasix 10 mg p.o.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2-7**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a coronary artery bypass graft times three, [**Doctor First Name 4796**] to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal; saphenous vein graft to PDA.
In the Operating Room, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed perioperatively due to the patient's low ejection fraction.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Milrinone and Levophed infusion.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day zero, continuing on Levophed and Milrinone with adequate cardiac output.
Chest tubes were removed without incident.
The patient was given two grams of magnesium and an Electrophysiology Service consultation was obtained.
Recommendations were made to start the patient on low dose beta blocker and plans were made for an Electrophysiology Service study due to the patient's low ejection fraction and ventricular ectopy.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 30%, dilated right and left atrium, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one to two plus mitral regurgitation and one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient tolerated his low dose beta blocker, however, the patient occasionally had episodes of bradycardia with rates in the 30s to 40s while asleep.
On postoperative day number six, the patient's pacing wires were removed without incident.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to be 25; he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
Electrophysiology Service was again re-consulted and it was felt that the patient was asymptomatic and that the episodes were only happening while the patient was asleep and there was no further intervention required.
The patient continued on a heparin infusion for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin was restarted.
By postoperative day number nine, the patient was cleared from Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty.
Discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] were had and it was decided to discharge the patient to home on subcutaneous injections of Lovenox with continued Coumadin therapy until the patient's INR was therapeutic.
TSH was noted to be elevated at 7.4 and it was felt that no therapy was needed but it would be recommended that the patient have his TSH rechecked again in one month.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 10 meq p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Percocet 5/325, one to two p.o.
Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously twice a day until INR greater than 2.0.
Coumadin 5 mg on [**3-19**] and [**2-19**].
The patient is to follow-up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 54594**] office and [**Hospital 197**] clinic by phone on [**2-20**], for a Coumadin dose and the patient should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4541**] in person in one to two weeks.
