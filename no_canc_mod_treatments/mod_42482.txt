Admission Date:  [**2146-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 46915**] Chief Complaint: seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy endoscopy rigid sigmoidoscopy and fecal disempaction flexible sigmoidoscopy lumbar puncture PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 63 year old male who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in behavioral neurology who was brought to the ED today from his day care center due to seizures.
His history was obtained from the ED notes and EMS notes since the patient is now intubated and sedated.
His neurologic history is significant for multiple strokes with residual global aphasia and right hemiparesis since [**2127**], SAH, s/p left MCA aneurysm clipping [**2143**], seizure d/o (off AED's since [**8-23**]), and recent V-P shunt placement [**1-22**] for hydrocephalus.
In the ambulance, he had another witnessed seizure, was given Valium 5mg x1, but "right sided shaking" continued so he was given another 5mg Valium without resolution of seizure activity.
He was given ativan 2mg x2, paralyzed and intubated (with Vec, Succ, etomidate, and fentanyl)for airway protection.
He was started on a propofol drip for sedation.
He was seen by the neurology ED resident after he had been medicated and there was no apparent seizure activity (though exam limited due to medication administration).
He had another episode of right arm shaking and received another 2mg Ativan in the ER.
He was loaded with dilantin 1g IV.
Just prior to transport to the ICU, he had another episode of right arm shaking which resolved after a bolus of propofol was given.
He arrived in the ICU intubated and sedated on propofol.
She says that he did not take any of his medications while they were away.
He was treated with phenobarbital until [**8-23**] when it was discontinued due to ongoing cognitive problems and no recent seizures.
Work up revealed hydrocephalus and a VP shunt was placed [**2146-1-25**].
Past Medical History: Strokes/SAH/Seizure d/o/Hydrocephalus (with elevated opening pressure of 28) as above s/p Left MCA aneurysm clipping [**2143**] s/p V-P shunt ([**1-22**]) CAD s/p MI CHF -EF25% HTN alchoholic hepatitis NSVT s/p ablation and pacer/ICD placement   Social History: Married, lives with his wife.
ABD: soft, NT, no HSM, +BS EXT: RUE contractures, otherwise WWP, no CCE  NEURO: MS: alert, follows commands (both midline and appendicular) though at times with some inconsistencies; answers yes-no questions consistently; aphasic with minimal speech output (answers 'bien' to most questions) CN: EOMI, PERRLA, hearing intact bilat, tongue midline, palate even Motor: increased tone in RUE>>RLE; RUE [**Last Name (un) 101365**] paretic; RLE with [**2-22**] power throughout.
Pertinent Results: [**2146-3-23**] wbc=10.6 hct=45.3 plt=510 [**2146-3-22**] pt=15.2 inr=1.5  ptt=29.7  SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN [**2146-3-22**]: There is interval placement of an NG tube with its tip terminating in the distal stomach.
A VP shunt is again noted coursing across the left side of the abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Status post NG tube placement with interval decompression of the stomach.
Some are hyperdense, and the presence of enhancement cannot be excluded on this study.
There is massive dilatation of the rectum with fecal impaction as described above.
Small hypoattenuating foci in the liver, which cannot be further characterized on this study but may represent cysts.
BACKGROUND: Background rhythm was dominated by low voltage faster record, frequently including beta frequencies.
There is evidence of post-surgical change with surgical clips in the region of the left middle cerebral artery.
There has been placement of a drainage catheter from a right frontal approach terminating within the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The supratentorial ventricular system appears slightly less dilated when compared to [**2145-3-18**] with interval placement of a drainage catheter terminating within the right lateral ventricle.
TECHNIQUE: 8-MDCT axial images of the head were obtained without and with IV contrast.
There are again noted post-surgical changes with surgical clips within the region of the left middle cerebral artery.
No abnormal enhancement after IV contrast is seen to suggest an abscess.
The ventricular drainage catheter is again seen with its tip near the septum pellucidum.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDY [**2146-3-21**]: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and saphenous veins were performed.
Again, note is made of NG tube and VP shunt tube.
