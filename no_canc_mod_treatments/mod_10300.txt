Admission Date:  [**2167-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-10-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-10-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Reason for transfer from an outside hospital was for further treatment of severe congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction in [**2161**] and status post right coronary artery stent), rheumatic heart disease (with 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm2 and a gradient of 11 mmHg), congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%), atrial fibrillation (status post biventricular pacemaker placement but not cardioverted due to left atrial clot seen on [**2167-7-19**] and [**2167-9-18**] transesophageal echocardiograms).
The patient also had a chronic right pleural effusion (status post therapeutic thoracentesis) in the recent past and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen).
The initially impression at the outside hospital was that she was in decompensated congestive heart failure and was given Lasix as well as antibiotics for a possible pneumonia.
Her Coumadin was held as her INR was supracervical at 4.7.
She was diuresed with Lasix and was becoming hypotensive.
She was started on dopamine and dobutamine and transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in [**2161**] and status post right coronary artery stent, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
Cerebrovascular accident in [**2167-7-19**] with subsequent left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications at the time of transfer included aspirin, Ambien, multivitamin, Lipitor, digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
q.d., captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d., spironolactone 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Carvedilol 3.125; Coumadin was held.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.4, heart rate was 104, blood pressure ranged from 96 to 108/62 to 70, respiratory rate was 35.
Anesthesia was called, and the patient was electively intubated and placed on ventilator.
Shortly thereafter she had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary artery filling pressures of 60/35, and a wedge pressure of 30.
Using these numbers, she was diuresed accordingly with intravenous Lasix.
She was tried on multiple combinations of pressors including dopamine, dobutamine, Milrinone, and Natrecor; none of which effectively increased her renal perfusion and urine output nor her cardiac output and index.
Cultures were sent including sputum, blood cultures, and urine cultures.
She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and continued on pressors.
By this time, her pressors were changed to Levophed and Vasopressin to maintain blood pressures.
Antibiotic and pressor support were withdrawn after morphine constant infusion was initiated, and there was every assurance that the patient was comfortable.
