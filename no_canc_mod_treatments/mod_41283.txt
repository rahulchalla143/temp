Ultrasound in [**2143-5-12**] showed 60-69% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a normal left, 11) History of ectopic pregnancy, 12) Status post hysterectomy, 13) Status post tonsillectomy, 14) Status post small bowel obstruction with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, 15) History of melena.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  1) aspirin 81 mg po qd, 2) Tricor 160 mg po qd, 3) atenolol 25 mg po qd, 4) Flexeril 10 mg po qd prn, 5) trazodone 50 mg po q hs prn, 6) Zoloft 200 mg po q hs, 7) Benadryl 50 mg po q hs prn, 8) Klonopin 0.5 mg po q am and 1 mg po q hs prn, 9) NPH Insulin 15 U q am and 15-20 U q hs, 10) Regular Insulin 15 U q am and 10 U at dinner.
The coronary artery anatomy showed 50% LAD proximal stenosis, mild luminal irregularities of the left circumflex, 70% RCA stenosis.
A stent was deployed into the Right coronary artery, and procedure was complicated by a proximal edge dissection, grade C, requiring emergent CABG.
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room on [**2143-6-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for a CABG x 2 with LIMA to LAD, and SVG to distal RCA.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a milrinone infusion.
The patient remained intubated overnight due to hypoxia and agitation.
On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation, and the milrinone was weaned off.
After extubation, the patient had a respiratory acidosis which responded to aggressive chest PT and good pain control.
The patient was started on diuretics with good response, and the patient was started on her antianxiety medications.
The patient's PA catheter was removed.
The patient was medicated for pain and received albuterol nebulizer treatments by respiratory therapy, and aggressive chest pulmonary toilet during the course of the day on postoperative day #3.
Over the evening on postoperative day #3, the patient was progressively confused, and on the morning of postoperative day #4, the patient was quite hypoxic, and the decision was made to transfer the patient back to the Intensive Care Unit for pulmonary toilet and monitoring of pulmonary status.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) lopressor 50 mg po bid, 2) lasix 20 mg po bid x 7 days, 3) potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid x 7 days, 4) colace 100 mg po bid, 5) Zantac 150 mg po bid, 6) enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po qd, 7) captopril 12.5 mg po tid, 8) Zoloft 200 mg po qd, 9) Klonopin 1 mg po bid, 10) Flovent MDI, 11) Serevent MDI, 12) Combivent MDI, 13) dilaudid 2-4 mg po q 6 h prn, 14) trazodone 50 mg po q hs prn, 15) NPH and regular Insulin per patient's previous regimen.
2) Status post stent to right coronary artery, complicated by dissection requiring emergent coronary artery bypass grafting.
3) Coronary artery bypass graft x 2.
