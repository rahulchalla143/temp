She was subsequently admitted to CCU at LGH with heparin gtt, lopressor, ASA, Plavix, kept NPO for cath.
They held liniopril and lasix.
The patient was given morphine and nitrates prn for pain, and an abd u/s and echo were performed.
CARDIAC HISTORY:  s/p MI in [**2109**], [**2108**], [**2107**] - CABG: - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  s/p cath with [**Name (NI) **], unclear which time - PACING/ICD: 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - CAD - DMII - Hyperlipidemia - PAD - HTN - essential thrombocytopenia - CHF: EF 35% on [**7-29**] - Stroke: right parietal in [**2109**], saw neurologist Ramsamy in the past - s/p Fem/[**Doctor Last Name **] on the left - chronic abdominal pain, first noted in [**2106-12-20**], has had negative workup including EGD x2, CT x3, last colonoscopy [**3-/2104**], Pos FH of [**Year (4 digits) 499**] CA.
Prominent-appearing pancreatic duct, of uncertain etiology.
Probable patency of the cystic duct, as suggested by the normal caliber of the gallbladder on the CT scan in relation to the collapsed size of the gallbladder status post percutaneous aspiration performed on the same day.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with PMH CAD s/p LAD and RCA stents, MI x 3, DMII, HTN, PAD presenting with CP x2 nights, seen at OSH and treated as NSTEMI and depressed EF (30-35% to 15-20%) with unchanged coronary disease and significant abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Therefore, further surgical evaluation for CABG was deferred to the outpatient setting upon follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology.
Her statin was held secondary to liver enzyme elevation and should be restarted at the discretion of her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also continue on anticoagulation for her hypokinetic ventricle.
She was discharged on a Lovenox bridge for continued warfarin therapy (which she should continue indefinitely for history of a parietal stroke), with INR checks by her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should also be considered for an ICD placement with her depressed EF on outpatient follow-up.
# Abdominal Pain: She was admitted with concerning abdominal pain.
Given her persistent sinus tachycardia, hypotension, pain, and imaging studies concerning for sepsis, she was started on Zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy was done, draining normal-appearing, non-purulent bile negative for microorganisms on culture.
Her pain was controlled with narcotics and eased down to her baseline abdominal pain, which she has had for a few years.
Her antibiotic was discontinued.
# Essential thrombocytopenia: Platelets briefly trended below 100, but rebounded back to her baseline.
# DMII: She was continued on sliding scale insulin while in house, as well as her home dose of Lantus.
# Follow-up: She should follow-up with cardiology for 1) ?ICD placement in future for low EF, 2) possible CABG, and 3) optimize medical management  # Healthcare maintenance:  We would highly recommend a colonoscopy to complete her abdominal pain work-up.
