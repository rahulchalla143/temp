Median sternotomy wires are seen.
The left kidney measures 11.6 cm.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial, and popliteal veins were performed.
Aortic valve calcifications are noted.
Median sternotomy wires and CABG clips are noted.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures, with RVEDP 29 mmHg.
Successful ptca and stenting of the LCx with a 3.0x28mm cypher stent post dilated to 3.25mm.
Successful ptca and stenting of the LM overlapping the Lcx stent with a 3.0x18mm cypher which was postdilated to 3.25mm.
Continue aspirin/plavix, statin 6.
Plan diuresis, weaning ventilatory support 7.
CXR to check ETT placement and r/o PTX as well as assess for  infiltrate given extubation episode with emesis.
She was continued on plavix and started on a heparin drip.
She had two cypher stents placed to the left main and the left circumflex.
She was transferred to the CCU for a brief period of time for aggressive diuresis and was transferred back to the general cardiology service.
She was continued on her outpatient cardiac regimen including aspirin and plavix.
It was thought that this was most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of a receiving a high osmotic fluid load during CTA.
She was discharged on lasix 20 mg daily.
She was continued on her home dose of lisinopril 30 mg daily.
She was switched from atenolol to carvedilol for her heart failure.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] for her heart failure and her primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat creatinine and potassium check.
With increased doses of beta blocker she had more profound episodes of bradycardia in the 30s.
She completed a ten day course of ceftriaxone with improvement in her pain as well as her respiratory status.
As noted above her atenolol was changed to carvedilol.
She was discharged on amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, carvedilol and lisinopril will good control of her blood pressure.
Her renal function quickly improved with gentle fluid hydration.
Respiratory Failure: As above the patient required emergent intubation for respiratory distress likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
She was afebrile but given that she had an indwelling foley catheter at that time there was concern that she had developed a UTI.
She was maintained on NPH and an insulin sliding scale during this admission.
She was continued on her home dose of synthroid 200 mcg daily.
She was continued on neurontin at decreased doses given her presentation with acute renal failure.
She was discharged on her outpatient regimen of neurontin 900 mg TID with standing tylenol.
