A left-sided PICC line has been placed which reaches well into the right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: In brief this is a 61yoF with h/o developmental delay and epilepsy who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-29**] after falling.
CXR at that time revealed ?opacities and patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient was made NPO and medications were made IV.
Neuro was consulted to help manage medications while NPO and suggested IV ativan.
She was started on metoprolol 2.5mg IV BID.
Metoprolol was uptitrated to 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
MICU course- In the MICU patient had poor IV access and received a PICC line for access and to receive treatment for her pneumonia.
While in the MICU she was maitaining good oxygenation on room air and her heart rate was controlled on metoprolol tartrate 37.5 mg four times daily and started on a baby aspirin.
[]ACTIVE ISSUES: #Tachycardia with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate (Afib with RVR): On [**2167-8-1**], pt had afib with RVR at 145bpm and converted spontaneously to sinus rythm with bigeminy.
Pt started on metorpolol 5mg IV considering continued episodes.
and was sent to MICU for further management.
While in MICU, patient was started on metoprolol 5mg IV every six hours and uptitrated to 37.5mg four times daily with good effect.
She maintained good blood pressures despite this tachycardia and had no chest pain.
For anticoagulation, Coumadin is not indicated based on her CHADS2 score, Aspirin is sufficient.
She was monitored on telemetry and had no documented events during her stay on the medicine floor after being discharge from the MICU.
The patient was emprically started on HCAP treatment (Vanc/Cef/Flagyl, day 1 = [**2167-8-2**]).
Pt was on and off of oxygen throughout her MICU stay.
While in the MICU she received IV vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for hospital aquired pneumonia coverage and aspiration pneumonia coverage.
# Elevated Creatinine Kinase: This was thought to be secondary to her open reduction and internal fixation.
She was given normal saline and creatinine kinase has downtrended since then to normal ranges.
# Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of the right femur: Orthopedic surgery followed pt post-operatively for wound checks.
# Seizures: Pt was initially unable to take depakote, lamotrigine, and tegretol orally so was on ativan 1mg IV.
Neurology recommended inserting [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric tube (NGT) to give home seizure medications.

You underwent surgery to repair this and the surgery was complicated by fevers and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
You were noted to have an irregular rhythm and were given medicine to slow your heart rate, which worked well.
