The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2151-12-23**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times five with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the RPL, sequential to the RPDA, saphenous vein to the OM and saphenous vein to the diag.
Postoperatively the patient was transported from the operating room to Cardiac Surgery Recovery Room on intravenous Neo-Synephrine drip in stable condition.
On postop day one the patient had been weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation, remained on intravenous Neo-Synephrine drip, was atrially paced via epicardial wires and his chest tubes were removed.
He was treated with intravenous Lopressor as well as intravenous Diltiazem and eventually given intravenous Amiodarone.
His beta-blockers were increased and his Amiodarone was continued.
He was begun on intravenous Heparin and transitioned to Coumadin for anti-coagulation for his persistent postoperative atrial fibrillation.
He has remained in the hospital this length of time due to difficulty controlling his ventricular rate and slow increasing of his Coumadin to get his INR to therapeutic.
The patient had his intravenous Heparin drip discontinued on postoperative day eight, his INR was therapeutic at that time, had bumped 2.8, he remained in atrial fibrillation however, at that time with rates up to the 130's.
His Lopressor was increased up to 50 mg b.i.d.
and he was maintained on Amiodarone.
On postop day ten the patient remained in sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate in the 60's on Lopressor and Amiodarone and remained on Coumadin with an INR of 2.8.
On postop day 11, [**2152-1-3**] the patient's INR was 2.2, remained on Coumadin, remained on Metoprolol as well as Amiodarone however, his Metoprolol had been held a couple of times over the past 24 hours due to hypotension.
After discussion with the patient's primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] it was determined best to discontinue the Metoprolol due to the patient's intermittent hypotension and discharge him home on Amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation.
