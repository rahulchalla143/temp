Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephem carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
# Urosepsis: Patient was empirically started on clindamycin and cefepime in the ED, and was hypotensive requiring fluid reuscitation and a brief span of Levophed.
In the MICU antibiotics were switched to meropenem and linezolid (questionable hx of vancomyin/zosyn reaction, thrombocytopenia, when the two antibiotics were used together).
Final sensitivity showed pt's Proteus was sensitive to Ceftriaxone as well, so his antibiotic was changed from Meropenem to Ceftriaxone.
Urology was consulted and recommended continuing the antibiotic for several days prior to changing the urostomy tube.
Pt was started on Vancomycin while the rest of the urine cultures were pending.
When the other urine cultures returned negative, pt was taken off the vancomycin since the staph aureus coag positive was likely due to skin contamination.
Pt was d/c'd home after he was afebrile for >24 hrs with continuation of Meropenem for additional eight days to complete a 14 day course at home.
In addition, pt was seen by the urology consult team, and his supra-pubic catheter was changed.
He was given ASA and was seen by the Atrius cardiologist.
Pt tolerated the medications well.
Gabapentin was stopped at pt's request because he felt it was not effective at all.
When INR was below 2, Coumadin was restarted.
At the time of discharge, pt's INR was only 1.3, so he was instructed to continue Lovenox treatment until his INR is between [**3-21**].
His Trazodone was stopped at his request.
