Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent of left external iliac artery.
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent of left common iliac artery.
Atherectomy of left external iliac artery.
Atherectomy of left superficial femoral artery.
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent of right common iliac artery.
History of Present Illness: 78 year old female with CAD s/p NSTEMI, s/p LCx stent 6.03, and RCA total occlusion, sefere PVD with bilateral carotid stenoses, presents for elective stent of significant LE PVD.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p stenting(3x18mm Cypher)of prox L circumflex [**7-5**] at [**Hospital1 18**] COPD/asthma on prednisone in past but never intubated HTN PVD-severe lft subclavian stenosis with diff UE BP's Hyperlipidemia Glaucoma OD Osteoarthritis Iron deficiency anemia   Social History: Lives at home with husband.
Retrograde access was obtained via the right CFA using a 6 French sheath.
Successful treatment of the totally occluded left SFA using adventitial dissection, an Outback catheter, angioplasty, and stenting with three overlapping self-expanding stents (from distal to proximal 6.0 x 100 mm Absolute, 6.0 x 100 mm Dynalink, and 6.0 x 80 mm Absolute) all postdilated with a 6.0 mm balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, a small proximal perforation, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Perforation of the distal SFA treated with balloon inflation and protamine.
Initial angiography was obtained by access of the right CFA to the contralateral left SFA using a 6 French sheath.
Successful atherectomy using a SilverHawk LS device on the left SFA, PFA, and EIA.
An 8.0 x 28 mm Dynalink self-expanding stent was delivered to the proximal EIA and postdilated with a 6.0 x 12 mm Viatrack balloon at 12 ATM.
The left proximal CIA lesion was dilated with an 8.0 x 38 mm Genesis stent at 12 ATM.
The right CIA was stented with an 8.0 x 29 mm Genesis stent at 12 ATM.
Successful atherectomy of the left SFA, PFA, and EIA.
Followup dedicated PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are recommended for initial further characterization.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with CAD and severe PVD, presents for elective stent of significant biaortoiliac disease.
1) Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease:  On admission the patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory for planned intervention of the 100% stenosed L SFA and 50% stenosed L PFA.
Final angiography demonstrated 30% residual PFA stenosis, no residual stenosis of the L SFA, a small proximal perforation of the L SFA, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow.
She underwent another planned catheterization 2 days after admission, for planned further intervention of her severe bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease.
Post-stenting of the R common iliac artery there was extravasation of contrast which persisted despite balloon pressure and protamine.
The patient was placed on nitroprusside drip for elevated blood pressure to 198/60 and sent to the CCU.
She was noted to have hypoactive bowel sounds and a rigid tender abdomen, and was therefore sent for a repeat stat CT of the abdomen/pelvis which showed interval increase in the amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, however the amount of increase over the 8 hours since the previous CT scan was not considered excessive, and the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout, therefore it was decided to manage conservatively with PRBC transfusion and clinical/laboratory observation.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and her hematocrit remained stable status post 4 units of PRBCs over 24 hours.
They consistently resolved with SL nitroglycerin.
She was continued on ASA, plavix, and a statin (atorvastatin 10 mg daily).
The electrophysiology team saw the patient, and felt that this CHB episode may have been consistent with a vagal episode, given the prolonged PR interval around the time of her block, as well as her known RP bleed.
However, given the significant duration of her pause, it was recommended that she have a pacemaker placed should she have another one.
After extensive discussions with the patient, she persistently refused pacemaker placement should the event recurr.
AV nodal blockers were avoided, and should continue to be avoided in the future given this history.
Her lisinopril and lasix were held for the 2 days prior to discharge, but restarted on discharge.
6) HTN:  The patient was on a nipride drip for 24 hours post catheterization, for blood pressure goal of 100-140.
Subsequently she was transitioned back to her home blood pressure medications:  Norvasc 10 mg daily, Lisinopril 10 mg daily, and clonidine 0.3 mg TID.
