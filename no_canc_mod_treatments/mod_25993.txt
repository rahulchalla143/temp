There is 14mm of dehiscence of the inferior left sternum lateral to the sternotomy with a non-hemorrhagic collection between the seperated fragments.
FINDINGS:  The initial CT tomogram confirms abnormal alignment of median sternotomy wires as identified on prior radiographs.
Two surgical clips are seen adjacent to this area (2.7).
Severe three-vessel coronary artery atherosclerosis is identified.
The aorta and aortic valve prosthesis is in expected position.
A left-sided SVC line terminates in the upper SVC.
An enteric catheter extends into the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 83900**] was transferred from cardiologist office to emergency room for evaluation of dyspnea that was progressively worsening at rehab that was thought to be related to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation at rehab.
He was on coumadin and received fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K for reversal.
He was treated with IV fluids and levophed for hemodynamic management.
He was taken to the cardiac cath lab [**5-13**] and underwent pericardiocentesis with placement of drain.
Of note prior to procedure he was electively intubated for the procedure in the intensive care unit.
He tolerated the procedure, he was started on diuretics for diuresis as he was significantly volume overloaded.
On [**5-14**] he was extubated without any complications and was continued to be diuresed and creatinine continued to improve.
On [**5-15**] he was note for diarrhea and stool was positive for Clostridium dificile, flagyl was started.
He was evaluated by speech and started a modified diet however his oral intake was not sufficient and dobhoff was placed for additional nutrition on [**5-16**].
Additionally due to worsening rashes on skin dermatology was consulted, the left lower extremity was felt to be hyperkeratosis and facial rash was vitiligo but felt to be chronic.
He continued with diuresis, pulmonary exercises and non invasive ventilation at night.
On the night of [**5-22**] he had difficulty breathing while completing respiratory treatment and then became bradycardic with PEA arrest.
ACLS protocol was initiated see code sheet.
He received chest compressions, defibrillation, medications, and intubation.
He was noted for significant secretions, was started on empiric antibiotics and BAL revealed pseudomonas.
He required vasopressors and inotropic support.
Infectious disease was consulted due to resistant pseudomonas and antibiotics were adjusted per their recommendation.
He continued treatment for pneumonia, clostridium dificile, and urinary tract infection.
There was a family meeting on [**5-28**] and the family wanted to continue treatment with plan for repeat EEG in 1 week.
reporting protocol was followed.
