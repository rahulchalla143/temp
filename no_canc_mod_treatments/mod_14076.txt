History of ovarian cancer, status post bilateral salpingo-    oophorectomy.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Status post repair of ventricular septal defect and    infundibular resection ([**2160**]).
Right ventricular outflow tract repair and    reconstruction with pericardial patch.
Pulmonary valve replacement (with 25 mm Thermofit    aortic valve).
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for elective surgical repair.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2188-4-1**] for preoperative preparation and evaluation.
They felt that this was likely secondary to either contact allergy or a drug allergy and recommended oral antihistamines but otherwise did not feel this was an infectious process.
She had repair and reconstruction of her right ventricular outflow tract with pericardial patch and also pulmonic valve replacement with a 25 mm Thermofit aortic valve.
She remained somewhat sedated but hemodynamically stable on postoperative day zero and therefore remained intubated until the morning of postoperative day #1 at which time she was extubated without difficulty.
Her electrolytes were managed appropriately and we decided to treat these with beta blockade and avoid the use of amiodarone.
She otherwise did quite well postoperatively as noted, was extubated on postoperative day #1 at which time she started a clear liquid diet which was advanced without difficulty.
We removed the Swan-Ganz catheter on postoperative day #1 and patient was up out of bed to a chair.
She began diuresis with Lasix on postoperative dat #1 with a goal of returning to her preoperative weight.
The chest tubes were removed on postoperative day #2 along with continued diuresis and continued beta blockade with Lopressor.
Pacer wires were removed on postoperative day #5.
This was felt to be secondary possibly to her level of beta blockade but as the patient was stable it was felt that this could be monitored safely in an outpatient setting.
She was discharged home on the following medications: Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
for two weeks, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
once daily, Darvocet 100 - 650 mg tablets take one tablet every four hours as needed for pain with a note to limit acetaminophen intake to less than 2 grams per day, Percocet 1 tablet as needed p.r.n.
Note to limit acetaminophen intake to 2 grams per day, ibuprofen 600 mg p.o.
q 6 hours, Toprol XL 50 mg p.o.
once daily, Captopril .25 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
for seven days, potassium chloride tablets 20 mEq p.o.
for seven days, Synthroid 50 mcg p.o.
