The patient was scheduled for her HD today, and her vital signs in the AM were normal, although she was felt to be lethargic at her nursing home.
In the ambulance on the way to HD, the patient's BG was 60, which improved to 110 after oral sugar.
She then had a desaturation recorded at 87% at 1600, which improved to 100%.
The patient received 2L NS, Cefepime, Flagyl, Daptomycin and Tylenol.
Of note, the patient has recently had the following discontinued or changed: Lantus 24U qhs increased to 26U; gabapentin increased from 300mg after HD to 400mg QID; ativan 0.5mg q8h PRN anxiety was d/c'd; buproprion was d/c'd, venlafaxine d/c'd.

CT Abd Pelvis woth contrast [**2181-8-28**] Small-to-moderate amount of simple ascites and anasarca may be from fluid overload.
Required intermittent pressure support.
Delirium cleared and will be empirically treated as outpt with 6 week course of cefazolin (day 1:[**2181-9-8**]) .
CXR [**2181-8-29**] concerning for pneumonia, so daptomycin was swithced to Linezolid, flagyl was DC'd.
Surveillance BCxs remained negative, but given worsening clinical picture, antibiotics were broadened to daptomycin and cefepime.
Dapto and cefepime started on [**9-3**], and per ID, to be continued for 7 days, followed by 6 weeks of cefazolin for presumptive MSSA endocarditis (TTE showed no vegetations; TEE not pursued as not within patient's goals of care).
Switched to cefazolin 2g Post HD (day 1:[**2181-9-8**]).
was occasionally on low-dose norepinephrine.
This was discontinued on [**9-5**] and patient was started on midodrine 10mg TID.
At rehab, [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure should be monitored ([**Month/Year (2) 5348**] pressures ~80's systolic) and midodrine weaned as tolerated.
# AMS: Likely multifactorial including sepsis, hypoglycemia, polypharmacy, and underlying psychiatric condition.
Hydroxyzine was held in an attempt to limit sedating medications, however, may be slowly restarted at rehab facility.
The patient is taking insulin with only a slight increase in her lantus from 24U to 26U prior to admission, otherwise is on a fairly moderate humalog sliding scale.
# CKD stage V on HD: Patient received make-up HD on hospital day two, then line removed.
HD line was replaced on [**8-31**] and pt.
#Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Euvolemic on admission with O2 requirement but it is minimal.
Plavix has been discontinued per [**Date Range 2287**] records and [**Hospital3 2558**] [**Month (only) 16**].
[**Name (NI) **] sugars difficult to control, and will need to be monitored and insulin adjusted as necessary.
Restarted venlafxine at discharge with the plan to continue at 37.5mg through [**2181-9-9**].
Also started on zyprexa 5mg TID and 10mg hs.
Family and patient stated that they would like for her to be treated with IV antibiotics for the 6 week duration suggested by ID.
Options of obtaining TEE to look for endocarditis and for consideration of pacemaker removal given her bacteremia were discussed.
Transitional Issue: #Started Midodrine on transfer out of MICU, [**Name (NI) **] pressures need to be monitored, midodrine weaned as appropriate.
[**Month (only) 116**] restart Wellbutrin on [**2181-9-14**] #Held scheduled lantus due to initial hypoglycemia, however restarted on day of discahrge [**1-25**] hyperglycemia.
#Will need follow-up scheduled with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-1**] days #Will need to treat for 6 weeks with cefazolin 2g post HD, and 3g post HD on long cycle (tues of T,TH,Sa schedule) #Will need weekly CBC w/ diff, ESR/CRP, to be drawn at HD   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were treated with antibiotics through your veins.
A second hemodialysis catheter was placed after your [**Hospital1 **] cultures were no longer growing bacteria.
Because you did not want to get a transesophageal echocardiogram or have your AICD pulled we want you to take cefazolin for the next 6 weeks.
We were concerned this may due to the infection in your [**Hospital1 **], and you were treated in the intensive care unit with medication to increase your pressure.
You will be continued on one of these medications, midodrine, as an outpatient.
Your hydroxyzine was stopped for this reason.
It initially was very low, so you were taken off of standing lantus.
Your sugars should be checked at least 4 times daily in your rehab facility, and insulin should be adjusted accordingly.
You will need to keep your hemodialysis line in place for now.
