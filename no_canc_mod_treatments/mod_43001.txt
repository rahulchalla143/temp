Given the lack of edema or hypoxia, the patient was continued on her home regimen fo torsemide 30mg PO QAM and 10mg PO QPM.
At the behest of her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], she underwent a right heart cath with plans for a trial of milrinone therapy.
RHC revealed markedly elevated left and right heart filling pressures that significantly improved with milrinone infusion.
If this milrinone trial fails, she would likely be transferred to [**Hospital1 3278**] for a heart transplant evaluation.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient subjectively felt much better after milrinone infusion.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Idiopathic vs post partum cardiomyopathy atleast since [**2092**], EF of [**10-24**]% - 64 year old female with post-partum dilated cardiomyopathy s/p  abdominal ICD implantation for NSVT and inducible VT in EP study  in [**2092**].
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Incidental finding noted on chest CT scan of a 6 mm nodule, mild restriction on PFTs - status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, two C-sections - remote asthma and multiple allergies - anxiety - ovarian cysts - Lyme disease seeing specialists in [**State 531**].

There are surgical clips in the upper abdomen, potentially from prior cholecystectomy.
Following milrinone bolus and infusion of 0.5mcg/kg/min, PCWP decreased to mean of 30mmHg.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-2-25**] 7:30 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein device, in addition to the left pacemaker.

She was started on milrinone drip and had improvement in symptoms and functional capacity in-house.
Her EF was found to be 5%, BNP elevated to 4000 from baseline of 1000, and left and right sided pressures were markedly elevated (40s and 70s systolic respectively) on right cath performed on admission.
She improved significantly on milrinone 0.5/hr infusion: CI rose from 1 to 1.9, CO improved and trans-pulmonary gradient decreased, which dramatically improved her pulmonary hypertension.
She was transiently hypotensive on milrinone [**2-11**] milrinone's vasodilatory effects, which subsequently resolved with MAPs consistently >55 afterward.
Given her profoundly reduced LV function, she was also started on Coumadin.
Beta blocker was initiated per patient's cardiologist.
PICC was placed for home milrinone infusion.
Patient will ultimately require heart transplant at [**Hospital1 3278**] after optimization of hemodynamics with milrinone.
# ARRYTHMIA: Patient went into multifocal ATach on HD#4 likely [**2-11**] discontinuation of her beta blocker after initiation of milrinone.
This resolved and she returned to NSR after metoprolol 5mg IV.
Per patient request and with her cardiologist's permission, she was restarted on low-dose metoprolol without recurrence of MAT.
# Left wrist Superficial Thrombophlebitis: Patient developed superficial thrombophelbitis of left wrist since peripheral line removal in the ICU.
She was started on a 7-day course of keflex to complete at home but noted some improvement after 2 days on antibitics in the hospital.
They also feel that she would benefit from talk therapy and possibly antidepressant therapy as an outpatient.
Her mood and affect improved on HD#2, although she did remain significantly anxious requiring frequent reassurance and low-dose klonopin throughout.
ASTHMA: Patient has a remote history of asthma and is on prn ipratropium at home.
