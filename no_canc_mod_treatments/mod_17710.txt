Patient took ASA 325mg at home, and then presented to [**Hospital3 **] after pain returned.
Patient was admitted at [**Hospital3 **] as ROMI, started on heparin, Aspirin, plavix and beta blocker.
Official Cath report from [**Hospital1 18**] pending at the time of this note, but patient had successful stenting of her vein graft with BMS x3.
Patient was intermittently on phenylephrine during the procedure.
A left femoral sheath was placed for possible insertion of IABP.
Immediately following the procedure patient noted to be bleeding from this site, manual pressure was applied and patient was started on dopamine.
Pressures were labile on/off pressors, and she was transferred to the CCU on dopamine (7.5 ucg/kg/min) and neosynephrine (1.50 ucg/kg/min).
Past Medical History: - CABG - 16 years ago at [**Hospital1 756**], SVG to PDA, SVG to RCA, SVG to Ramus, SVG to LAD.
- Hypothyroidism - Hypertension - Dyslipidemia - Previous TIA - s/p Appendectomy - s/p Mastectomy  Social History: 25 pack year history of tobacco.
Stent in bypass graft most likely going to the RCA or PDA is again noted in unchanged location on both PA and lateral views.
On arrival, patient was intubated and on pressor support with dopamine and neosynephrine.
Impression on arrival was for a vagal episode in the setting of groin pressure for bleeding from the femoral sheath site, leading to atropine and then V. Fib arrest.
Patient's dopamine was increased with good response.
Ultimately, pressors were titrated to off over the next 24-48 hours.
Patient was transfered to floor for management and was discharged w/o events.
Lipitor was held given the patient had been intolerant of statin therapy in the past (severe myalgias).
Beta-blocker/ACE were held in setting of cardiogenic shock requiring pressor support.
After patient had been transferred to the floor she was restarted on her acebutalol at 200mg daily, and later lisinopril 5mg daily.
She continued to have SOB however, requiring diuresis with lasix 20mg IV over 3 days with good UOP.
Patient was discharged with PO lasix dose for 5 days and will likely not require lasix in the future.
CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated a small hematoma at the site of her left-femoral sheath, a small hematoma in the rectus abdominus muscle, and a small hematoma at the site of her central line placement (R-IJ).
Patient had a stable hematocrit therafter and did not require a transfusion.
Her platelet count dropped and in the setting of her bleeding heparin products were held.
Here HIT antibody was negative and platelets stabilized and heparin was restarted prior to discharge with stable hematocrit, platelets and no evidence of bleeding.
#Hypothyroidism: patient was continued on at home dose of levothyroxine 75ucg daily.
