Remaining chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
The patient made progress with physical therapy and was ambulating with minimal assistance before discharge.
The patient was discharged to rehab on POD 18 with plans to follow up with cardiology for an internal pacer, and with thoracics for a barium swallow study, and infectious disease for further anti-microbial management.
