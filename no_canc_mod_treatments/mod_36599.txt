She reports taking Levemir and Humalog for sugar control.
She has also noted flushing of her skin and dizziness over the last several days.
Her subsequent temperature also increased to 96.6 without any intervention.
It was then decided to start her on an insulin drip to better control her sugars despite no anion gap being present.
She was therefore given vancomycin and Levaquin to cover infections from a skin and urinary source.
Of note, the patient developed a pink rash all over her body which was most notable on her palms, shins, chest, and back before she received the vancomycin and it was thought that the rash was due to hyperemia from re-perfusion after initially being mottled.
She was also bolused with 3 Liters of NS with a 4th Liter hanging upon transfer and her lactate decreased from 2.8 to 2.2.

She was treated in the ED with IV insulin, with modest control, but then transferred to the ICU on an insulin gtt.
She also received a dose of vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED.
Her blood sugar control improved with sliding scale and increased levimir dosing.
Type II diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled, with complications - The patient's blood sugars were elevated as high as 672 and requried insulin drip and ICU admission.
The [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and she was started on an aggressive sliding scale and increased long acting insulin (lantus instead of levemir).
She will require ongoing teaching.
She was treated with 3 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily.
Likely prerenal etiology given profound volume depletion related to uncontrolled hyperglycemia plus lab interference given ketones.
She received IVF and improved back to her baseline.
Pancytopenia - She initially had WBC of 8, HCT 34, PLT 117 and after IVF and correction of her glucose went down to 3.1, 31 and 59 respectively.
