No interval change in size of the larger hepatic abscess, status post interval removal or dislodgement of a previously placed pigtail drain catheter.
Pigtail catheter remains in appropriate position in a subhepatic collection, which is contiguous with, but possibly minimally communicating with, the larger collection.
There was drainage occuring around the pigtail catheter requiring multiple dressing changes daily.
Per report, cannulation of the biliary duct initially was not possible using a free-hand technique.
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was successful and deep using a free-hand technique.
A 5Fr 4 cm pancreatic duct stent was placed to facilitate cannulation of the bile duct.
An additional cannulation attempt of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A 10cm by 7FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully in the main duct due to the stenotic papilla following the sphincterotomy.
Also, a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed using standard endoscopic nasojejunal feeding tube placement rechnique.
The [**Last Name (un) **]-jejunal tube was secured at 120 cm at the nose.
Immediately following the ERCP, the patient also underwent exchange and upsizing to 10 Fr of the existing pigtail in the subhepatic fluid collection.
Initially, the patient was kept NPO overnight per protocol following the sphincterotomy, and on the following day, as the day progressed, the patient was having increased abdominal and back pain, and urine output decreased significantly.
A foley was placed for monitoring, and he received fluid boluses.
He was kept NPO, and was started on TPN folloewing central line placement.
The abscess pigtail drain was draining 150 - 300 cc daily of purulent appearing, thick light tan fluid.
With resuscitaion and NPO status, the patient's symptoms started to improve.
As symptoms subsided, he was very slowly advanced on his diet, and the tube feeds were started via the post pyloric feeding tube, which had to be replaced while in the SICU due to clogging.
The pigtail catheter was still in appropriate position in the subhepatic fluid collection.
The pigtail drain dressing was noted to have drainage that seems to increase when patient upright or ambulating.
On [**9-7**] he was sent to CT for another drain upsize to a 12 Fr drain.
