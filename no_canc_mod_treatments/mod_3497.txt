HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease who is five years status post living-related donor kidney transplantation.
He was treated initially with intravenous antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and then defervesced and had symtomatological improvement within two days.
Living-related kidney transplantation on [**2124-1-12**].
Ventral hernia repair in [**2124**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications included sirolimus, Neoral, prednisone, Bactrim, Prilosec, Lopressor, Librax, Accupril, Lipitor, Coumadin, Catapres, Bumex, and colchicine.
His abdomen was very obese and difficult to examine but appeared to be soft and nondistended.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to undergo intravenous hydration and further workup.
There were several areas of patchy ischemia in the small bowel; two of which were resected and left unanastomosed with a plan to bring him back for a second-look laparotomy.
He continued to require pressor support and bicarbonate therapy for correction of his acidosis.
His urine output had petered down to almost nothing, and he was started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
The following day we brought him back for a second-look laparotomy.
He underwent a right colectomy and resection of a large segment of small bowel.
The plan was to bring him back for a third-look laparatomy in the morning.
He required continuous pressor support and more and more bicarbonate therapy with little response.
