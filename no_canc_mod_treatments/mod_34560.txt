The patient underwent right thoracotomy with thoracic tracheo- and broncho-plasty with right upper lobe wedge resection on [**2180-10-4**].
At rehab the patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and a prednisone taper.
She received systemic anticoagulation with marked improvement in her symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement back to her baseline home oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula.
At the time of discharge the patient was therapeutic on warfarin with 24 hours of overlap with therapeutic heparin.
The patient will follow-up with her PCP for further discussion of: - Ongoing INR monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustment.
The patient did have a small amount of hematuria with a single episode of clot passage in the urine and a nosebleed while on dual therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin.
Of note the patient had some lower extremity edema and a positive fluid balance while in the hospital and her home lasix had been held during her hospitalization.
The patient was restarted on her home lasix and will follow-up with her PCP for ongoing monitoring.
She was continued on an oral prednisone taper consistent with her admission medications.
She was transitioned to 5mg daily of prednisone for 7 days to complete the taper at the time of discharge.
She did not require insulin while on a sliding scale in the hospital on 10mg of prednisone and was therefore not discharged on an insulin regimen.
She will also continue on nebulizer treatments with albuterol and ipratropium as well as steroid inhalers and tiotropium.

This was due to blood clots that formed in your legs and travelled to your lungs.
You must take a blood thinning medication called coumadin to prevent recurrence or enlargement of the blood clots for at least the next 6 months and potentially longer.
Please have your blood drawn at your primary care doctor's office every 3 days until further notice from your doctor to monitor the coumadin level.
Discuss the blood results with your doctor and change the dosing of your coumadin based on their recommendations.
Follow-up as previously scheduled with your thoracic surgeon with repeat CT scan in [**Month (only) 1096**].
Take all medications as prescribed.
Please discuss: - Ongoing monitoring of your coumadin level and dosage changes in your coumadin.
- A work-up for the cause of your clot formation.
