M well known to the MICU [**Location (un) **] team with h/o afib on coumadin, dementia, DM, CHF, recent right hemiarthroplasty of the hip who presented to and OSH after being found unresponsive and hypotensive in the setting of oxycodone at NH.
Before admission, pt was being treated for C. diff, with positive assay noted at NH 2 weeks PTA (had a course of PO flagyl but still had diarrhea so was changed to PO vanc).
Pt was stabilized with IVF digoxin for a fib and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the MICU PO vanc was continued and PO flagyl was added for C. Diff.
BP stabilized to basline of SBP 90-100 with fluid resuscitation - no pressors were required.
He was restarted on his home colchicine and probenacid with little relief of symptoms.
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended a steroid taper, but the floor team decided to hold off on this in the setting of infection.
UA was positive after transfer and cipro was started empirically.
He received 500cc NS with good effect (SBP to 100s).
Given possibility of urosepsis with resistant organism, Cipro was broadened to Zosyn.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2183-3-10**] FINDINGS: Please note, the detection of free air on a supine abdominal radiograph is limited.
The patient is status post right femoral hip prosthesis.
Recommend clinical correlation as to the presence of a prior line insertion.
He was treated for severe c.diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanco.
Surgery was consulted initially and later reconsulted, but no surgical indication was met.
He had difficulty tolerating tube feeds initially, but this later improved with time.
However, later during his course, he became hypotensive and pressors were initiated.
OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE The patient was oliguric during most of admission, and this was at first thought likely a combination of poor retention of intravascular volume given marked hypoalbuminemia with albumin of 1.6g/dL.
He was given IVF boluses as well as albumin challenge but only became severely anasarcic.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION The patient had positive U/A and was treated with Cipro initially, and then expanded to Zosyn when he again became hypotensive.
U/A grew E.coli and yeast, and he completed a 7 day course with ceftriaxone based on sensitivities, and fluconazole.
He was placed on a prednisone taper, and restarted on colchicine and probenecid.
