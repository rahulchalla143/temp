She received an extra dose of Klonopin on the evening of HD #2.
Oxygenation requirement improved to 3 L/min NC without diuresis, and CXR [**6-17**] showed improvement in pulmonary edema.

There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss with probable infiltrate as well on the right.
A Foley catheter is in place, which limits evaluation of the urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: # Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction - Given acute on chronic renal failure and rapid improvement in symptoms, cardiac catheterization was deferred and the patient was treated with optimal medical therapy.
Heparin gtt was continued for 48 hours after admission.
Atorvastatin was started given that the documented allergy to lovastatin was likely a history according to the patient's son (baseline [**Name (NI) 53324**] were WNL).
Continued aspirin, Plavix, carvedilol, Imdur, lisinopril, and atorvastatin on discharge.
Omeprazole was changed to ranitidine given initiation of Plavix therapy and concern about inhibition of the anti-platelet effects of Plavix in the setting of concomitant PPI use.
Diuresed initially with Lasix gtt followed by Lasix IV boluses.
Metoprolol was changed to carvedilol, started lisinopril, uptitrated hydralazine to 50 mg q8h.
Lisinopril started, as above.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia - Started empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Vancomycin was dosed according to trough level given acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and ultimately discontinued after 72 hours.
Angiography and further definitive therapy was deferred in the setting of acute illness and impaired renal function, but it was strongly recommended that the patient follow up with her vascular surgeon and wound clinic as an outpatient.
Started iron sulfate and erythropoeitin at the recommendation of the consulting nephrology team.
# Hypertension - Well-controlled on carvedilol, amlodipine, Imdur, and hydralazine.
Continued atorvastatin 80 mg, as above.
# Generalized anxiety disorder - Reduced Klonopin to 0.5 mg qhs.
