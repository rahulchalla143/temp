The patient is also complaining of mild chest pressure on the day of admission, lasting approximately 5 minutes to 10 minutes, intermittent, relieved on its own, without associated increase in her baseline dyspnea, without radiation, without diaphoresis, and without nausea or vomiting.
The patient was restarted on Lasix and ACE inhibitor approximately one week prior to admission.
She states she has been using her [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure machine six to seven hours per night.
On home oxygen (2 liters per minute).
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Neurontin 300 mg three times per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Flovent 2 puffs twice per day.
Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Multiple attempts at diuresis were tried.
Initially, the patient was tried on intravenous Lasix at varying doses with the assistance of afterload reduction, and angiotensin receptor blocker, and heart rate control, and a beta blocker.
The patient showed minimal diuresis to the intravenous Lasix regimen of 60 mg twice per day.
This was then changed to a Bumex regimen of one twice per day, also with minimal diuresis.
The angiotensin receptor blocker was discontinued as her creatinine continued to increase.
The patient was also tried on a dopamine drip along with intravenous Lasix.
The dopamine was used in an attempt to increase renal perfusion; however, this was deemed unsuccessful after two days.
During her last hospitalization, the patient was tried on a Natrecor drip which also proved to be ineffective and resulted in hypotension.
The patient was eventually seen by Nephrology who recommended increasing diuresis despite creatinine elevations.
The patient was started on Lasix 80 mg intravenously three times per day which provided good diuresis of approximately 2 liters; however, this resulted in hypotension and mental status changes.
The patient was briefly sent to the Coronary Care Unit where she was treated with [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure as well as a dopamine drip.
The patient returned to the floor and had intermittent periods of somnolence in which [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure was used with good improvement in her mental status.
The patient maintained some level of diuresis with intravenous Lasix at low doses; diuresing approximately 500 cc to 1500 cc over a three to four day period.
She was placed on a low-sodium diet and limited to 1.5 liters of fluid per day.
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE/OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's body habitus caused multiple problems in her pulmonary function; including bicarbonate retention, likely from her body habitus causing some restrictive disease.
They recommended possible tracheostomy in the future; however, in the short term recommended the use of bronchodilators as the patient had shown some response in the past during pulmonary function tests.
The patient was started on bronchodilators as well as a brief course of steroids in the form of prednisone 40 mg per day for a 5-day course.
The patient should be using her own [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure machine for comfort reasons.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was rate controlled on a beta blocker (metoprolol).
This heart rate will help maintain and maximize cardiac output.
The patient was initially on Coumadin therapy; however, she was transitioned to a heparin drip with a concern that she would eventually need either a dialysis catheter or other invasive procedure.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed in which the heparin drip was held prior to that.
An Endocrinology Service consultation was ordered, and they recommended methimazole treatment and the dose was increased to achieve the desired affect.
It was felt the patient's endocrine abnormalities may have been contributing to her overall poor functional status, and to maximize this would improve not only diuresis but the patient's symptoms as well.
The patient's creatinine slowly increased during diuresis and caused some limitation in our ability to diurese.
The goal of diuresis was approximately one kilogram per day, which the patient began to achieve with Lasix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.
Due to her allergy to penicillin, the patient was started on vancomycin and she was to finish a 14-day course for a line-related bacteremia.
The patient's vancomycin was dosed by levels to achieve random levels of greater than 15.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter placed for the administration of vancomycin.
The patient was started on Epogen and iron gluconate to help boost her bone marrow production of red cells.
Due to her religious beliefs, the patient's heparin drip was run at a slightly lower than therapeutic level by partial thromboplastin time for concern of bleeding and catastrophic consequences of such an event.
