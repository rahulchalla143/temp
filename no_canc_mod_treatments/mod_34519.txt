A diagnositic paracentesis was done that revealed a WBC of [**Numeric Identifier 26452**] with 90% neutrophils.
He was started on ceftriaxone and albumin.
He continued to have abdominal pain and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis was done 2 days after initiation of treatment.
Treatment with ceftriaxone was continued for a total course of 2 weeks and he was then started on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.
His respiratory status improved with diuresis and CXR showed persistent left pleural effusion that was unchanged.
He has numerous reasons for baseline multifactorial hypoxia with A-A gradient.
However, sputum subsequently grew out rare oropharingeal flora and [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] these antibiotics were discontinued.
He was started on CVVH on [**7-15**], with net negative fluid balance of approximately negative 13L by [**7-21**].
His respiratory status improved, ventilation settings were weaned, and he was successfully extubated on [**7-21**].
He subsequently developed a low grade fever and leukocytosis by [**7-22**] and was pancultured, with cultures pending; an IR paracentesis was also scheduled.
CXR from [**7-22**] showed stable LLL atelectasis with layering of a moderate L pleural effusion and improved right multifocal airspace opacities and pulmonary edema (now mild).
After transfer to the floor, he was continued on dialysis.
# Renal failure: Prior to admission the patient was diagnosed with post-infectious GN, Cr.
Once his Cr stabilized at low 2s he was started on diuretics to treat his fluid overload.
He was treated for HRS with minimal improvement.
He was started on CVVH on [**7-15**] to treat his fluid overload as above.
During his hospitalization he was evaluated by the transplant nephrology team who concluded that his renal failure was likely due to his post-infectious GN with a component of ATN and so he initially did not qualify at the moment for liver-kidney transplant.
However, Mr. [**Known lastname 40167**] continued to require Hemodialysis at the end of his hospitalization and ultimately was HLA typed and screened for renal transplant.
#Anemia: Patient was persistently anemic despite multiple blood transfusions.
Initially it was thought to be due to SBP(see above) but it persisted even after SBP was treated.
A right heart cath was subsequently done to further characterize his pulmonary HTN.
# S/p Liver Transplant: Patient is s/p liver transplant at age 4 because of biliary atresia.
He underwent complete transplant workup while in the hospital and is currently listed on the transplant list.
# Fever: Patient had a fever while on Vanc and Zosyn as well as eosinophilia.
There was concern for drug fever and antibiotics were discontinued.
He was given Vancomycin HD protocol for possible HD line infection.

Tolerating PO and continuous tube feeds, electrolytes within normal limits on HD.
We gave you fluids and medications for nausea.
Due to your abdominal pain, you required an operation to determine what was causing the pain.
During the operation a small portion of your bowel was removed due to concern that there was a hole in the bowel wall causing stool to leak into your abdomen.
Because of this, you were started on ciprofloxacin which you should continue.
Additionally, during your admission, you had problems with your breathing and were sent to the intensive care unit and required a machine to breathe for you.
You were also given a medication called ivermectin in case you have a parasitic infection.
You should continue this medication for the next 4 days ([**8-3**], [**8-4**], [**8-5**] and [**8-6**]).
In the meantime, you were started on tube feeds to support your nutrition which you should continue until you are told otherwise.
You should NEVER take ibuprofen or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for pain.
