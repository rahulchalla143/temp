HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, with severe insulin resistance and also a reported history of insulin antibodies questioning diagnosis type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, asthma, and marked obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, who presented to the Emergency Department and was treated initially for hyperglycemic with blood sugars reported to be greater than 800.
However, given the questionable diagnosis of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes and severe hyperglycemia, she was treated with aggressive fluid rehydration.
She was given multiple liters of normal saline and initially started on insulin drip to better regulate her blood sugars.
She was continued on the drip to the morning and to the next night, adjusting her intravenous fluids appropriately then hyperglycemia.
By the morning of [**2128-9-24**] the insulin drip was discontinued and the patient was restarted on her home insulin regimen with continued close monitoring of her blood sugar.
Hypotension:  Over the course of the first 24 hours of her hospital stay, the patient became profoundly hypotensive on the floor on [**2128-9-24**] and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure and hemodynamic management.
She was given three liters of intravenous fluids on the floor with minimal blood pressure response.
That is why she was transferred to the Unit for closer hemodynamic monitoring, where she was given additional liters of intravenous fluid with normalization of her blood pressure.
She reports baseline sugars in the 200 to 400s at home and subsequently presented to the [**Hospital **] Clinic following extremely high treatment with NPH at 80 and 70 q. a.m. and q p.m.
However, during her hospital stay she had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, and her insulin requirement was titrated down accordingly.
In consult with the Endocrine fellow and the input of [**Last Name (un) **] attendings, she was discharged on an insulin regimen of 50 of NPH in the morning and 54 NPH at night with an adjusted sliding scale.
She will be followed up closely in the [**Hospital **] Clinic over the next week to titrate her insulin requirements accordingly.
