Imaging: CXR: [**2133-10-27**]: INDICATION: 64-year-old male status post NG tube placement.
FINDINGS: There is interval placement of the NG tube with the tip lying within the stomach.
Possibilites included secondary to recent weaning off vent, continued respiratory muscle weakness, increased abdominal girth (compressing diaphragm), and standing sedating medications.
We held all sedating medications, diuresed the patient and maintained him on standing nebulizers.
His vent was changed from AC to PS and then taken off.
He was not empirically started on antibitics because of lack of fever or increased WBC count.
Pt was on trach mask during the day and bipap at night.
Diuresis was achieved with 10mg zaroxolyn followed by 140mg IV lasix.
On day of discharge, pt was started on Diamox, given his rising bicarb from 31 to 36.
Pt was diuresed with lasix and zaroxyln.
He may benefit from pMIBI and potential cardiac cath as an outpatient.
Pt should have his creatinine and lytes followed daily.
Pt was started on iron supplementation.
Coumadin was held in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Coumadin should be restarted tomorrow.
