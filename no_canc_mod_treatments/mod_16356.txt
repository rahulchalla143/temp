Admission Date:  [**2188-9-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-9-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-11-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right coronary artery stent secondary to myocardial infarction.
He was given aspirin, morphine and fluids in the field and then the Emergency Department gave him atropine, started a Dopamine and heparin drip.
The patient was given a half a dose of Retavase for lytic therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and catheterization.
He had an angiojet and his right coronary artery was stented at that point at which point he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further observation and management.
Chest x-ray showed EP tube in right main, opacity in retrocardiac, possible atelectasis versus pneumonia and on arrival his electrocardiogram was pending.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was status post stent mid right coronary artery.
He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and did well.
His beta blockers were initially held secondary to bradycardia and negative inotropic effects.
At that point later on he was switched over two days later to beta blockers.
On discharge date his beta blockers were switched over from Metoprolol 75 b.i.d.
to Toprol XL 150 q.d.
He had an elevated AST, slightly elevated ALT at which point Lipitor was not started, but the day of discharge Lipitor was started given that his AST rise was most likely secondary to his myocardial infarction insult.
He may need future percutaneous intervention on left anterior descending coronary artery and D1.
His CKs were followed post intervention and the goal was to keep the CVP around 18 to 20.
He did well after transfer to the Emergency Department and was extubated the next day and weaned off of his O2 and transferred to the floor.
For his pump status he was later on started on Captopril and on the day of discharge his Captopril t.i.d.
was switched to Lisinopril q.d.
Initially he was continued on the Lidocaine drip until the morning after admission to the Coronary Care Unit at which point he was discontinued off the Lidocaine.
He had an atropine at bedside for possible bradycardia and secondary hypotension secondary to bradycardia, which was not used and his beta blockers as we noted earlier was held on the first day and later on started as he tolerated it.
The day after admission he was started on Levaquin for presumed right lower lobe consolidation secondary to community acquired pneumonia.
Tolerating his medications and his diet well.
