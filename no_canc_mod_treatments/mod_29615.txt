It was felt that since the procedure was semiurgent, that no further intervention would be required at this time.

She received two units of packed cells.
She was continued on perioperative Kefzol and converted to Vancomycin on [**2147-12-12**].
Heparin was continued and Coumadin was initiated for goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
