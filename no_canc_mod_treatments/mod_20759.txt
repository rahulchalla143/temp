History of Present Illness: 45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with 4 days of loose stools, fatigue, lightheadedness with stools turning to bloody 2 days prior to admission ([**2100-7-26**]).
Of note, he was taking Ibuprofen for tendinitis, though only took 10 tablets over a period of a week.
On [**7-27**] he had an EGD which showed normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum and then underwent a Pouchoscopy/enetorscopy which showed large amount of fresh bright blood with blold clots, including J pouch and throughout the entire small bowel examined (~ 70cm).
He denies recent changes in BM frequency or character until presentation.
He has been off all medications for ~ 2 years, as "nothing has worked" for his loose stools.
Of note, ~ 1 month ago, had severe constipation and required an endocsopic treatment to relieve this.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis - [**7-/2094**] - Ileoanal pouch w/ ileostomy - [**10/2094**] - Laparotomy, resection of small bowel including ileostomy, reanastomosis and dilatation of the anorectal stricture - Aortic valve stenosis, mild per outside hospital records, no documentation at [**Hospital1 18**].
30 ppy prior to that.
- No bleeding diseases - Brother with coronary artery disease died in 60s - Uncle died of myocardial infarction at 45 - No h/o sudden cardiac deaths or arryhthmia  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97F BP: 135/57 P:90s R: 22 O2: 95%RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera pale, dMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, flat JVP Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: RR, normal S1 + S2, [**3-27**] syst.
S/p total colectomy with a ileo-pounch creation.
[**2100-7-27**] CXR: Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach, with the most proximal side port just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
I suggest you obtain repeat conventional chest radiographs when feasible to see if this is a persistent finding.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who presented to outside hospital with loose bloody stools, was found to have hemorrhage in the small bowel with a normal EGD, status post 7 units pRBCs and with out improvement in HCTs.
After recieving 7 units without adequate Hct response at the outside hospital the patient was transfused 2 additional units of pRBCs and 2 units of FFP on arrival to the MICU.
2 additional pRBCs were administered with target Hct above 30.
On HD3 after another episode of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] GI bleed, a repeat CT-A demonstrated again no active bleed - 2 more units of pRBC were transfused after a Hct drop below 30.
An upper and lower endoscopy on HD 2 revealed mild duodenitis, old blood, some mild ulcerations of small bowel and mild proctitis.
A push through enteroscopy was performed on HD 3.
Pt's Hct remained stable, and on HD4, pt was discharged home with close GI follow-up for small-bowel follow-through and capsule endoscopy.
A transthoracic echo on HD 3--requested to investigate the patient's dyspnea on exertion and possible endocarditis with emboli to bowel--reported severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet; no vegetations seen.
Recommendations for future management, given the patient's symptoms at baseline and the physical nature of his work, included the addition of a betablocker or verapamil when stable from a bleeding perspective.
Wellbutrin was held secondary to patient's unstable Hct on hematocrit.
Pt can be re-started on Wellbutrin as outpatient upon follow-up with PCP.
Medications on Admission: - ibuprofen prn - advair prn sob/wheezing, does not take regularly - wellbutrin, stopped 2 mo ago, he feels he did not need it (anxiety)   Discharge Medications: 1.
Protonix 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
You received multiple blood transfusions and your blood levels stabilized but you had significant amounts of blood in your stool.
In addition, you were found to have a heart murmur and outflow obstruction from your ventricle.
[**Name2 (NI) **] will need to be on a medication for your heart, once your bleeding problem has resolved.
You were started on Protonix 40mg twice daily by mouth.
You do not need bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis.
