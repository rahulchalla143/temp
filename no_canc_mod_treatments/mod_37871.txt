Admission Date:  [**2152-9-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-10-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-10-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 55 year-old male with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post AVR, MVR and also a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, atrial fibrillation, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis who presents with fever and change in mental status.
The morning of admission the patient had a temperature of 104.0 F and was weaker and incontinent of stool at home.
On the way to the hospital the patient was incontinent of urine and became combative and incoherent.
The patient was given 1 gram of vancomycin and two grams of ceftriaxone and Gentamicin 80 milligrams.
Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR and MVR in [**2146**].
Coronary artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146**].
Hepatitis C, status post Ribavirin and treatment, which has unfortunately advanced to cirrhosis.
Nadolol 20 milligrams p.o.
Dilantin 300 milligrams p.o.
Celexa 40 milligrams p.o.
Urinalysis was nitrite positive with a trace of protein, glucose and ketone negative.
Patient's CSF first tube had 3 white blood cells, 1 red blood cell with a differential of 7 polys, 33 lymphs, 45 monos, protein was 22 and glucose was 80.
Patient's first ABG on four liters nasal cannula was 7.33 with a Pco2 of 49 and Po2 of 150.
In short this is a 55 year-old male with rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR, MVR, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and HCV cirrhosis who presented with fever, mental status changes prior to admission.
Four out of four bottles of which grew coag positive Staphylococcus aureus was later identified as being methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Because no source was located on this patient for his bacteremia, the patient was treated with oxacillin for presumed endovascular infection.
Patient will complete a six week course of antibiotics for his staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
Thus it was felt that there was no need at this time for esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy to evaluate the occult blood.
Thus it seems likely that the cause of his occult blood was nasal trauma secondary to nasogastric tube insertion.
Patient received multiple fluid boluses over the course of his admission and developed notable ascites.
His belly was much more distended than on arrival after fluid boluses for previous episodes of hypotension and hydration secondary to fever.
Because of this, patient was started on Lasix and aldactone.
CT Scan showed no evidence of acute appendicitis but did raise the possibility of diverticulitis thus patient was started levo and Flagyl to treat a presumed diverticulitis.
Patient did have a therapeutic paracentesis during his stay which showed a white blood cell count of 175 and a red blood cell count of 25,000.
Following his therapeutic paracentesis, the patient developed a sizable hematoma on his right flank as well as a two point drop in hematocrit.
The patient was thus transfused two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrits add up appropriately.
He was somewhat lower at the beginning of his admission thus Heparin flushes were held and a HIT antibody was sent.
Patient was on Coumadin on admission, anticoagulated for his mechanical valves.
During his admission, his Coumadin was held and he was anticoagulated with Heparin.
He was continued on aspirin throughout the course of his admission.
Patient responded well to diuresis and had no further signs of failure or shortness of breath once his heart rate was controlled.
He had no initial response to Lopressor thus he was started on a diltiazem drip and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 19024**] more intense monitoring.
He was seen by Cardiology who recommended not employing antiarrhythmics at this time but rather increasing his dose of nadolol and stopping the diltiazem.
This was done, however, patient became hypotensive several hours after being given his beta blocker and required fluid boluses and transient dopamine for which he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit overnight.
Patient was rapidly weaned off of dopamine although his rate remained difficult to control without beta blockers.
He remained on diltiazem and diltiazem drip until he underwent DC cardioversion, prior to discharge after which he remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course of his stay.
His creatinine fluctuated over the course of his hospital stay depending on his fluid status.
At the time of discharge, his creatinine again, was 1.8, this was following a brisk diuresis to relieve his ascites and it was felt that the patient's creatinine would turn back towards the baseline, post diuresis.
PULMONARY - patient had adequate O2 saturations during his admission but did have a history of using Advair and several times during admission he was noted to have bilateral wheezing.
Patient was started on Atrovent nebulizer which seemed to relieve his wheezing as the diuresis.
He was initially somnolent with mental status changes and incontinent of urine and stool as he defervesced and was started on antibiotics.
He was treated with lactulose and his mental status returned to baseline.
Patient was maintained on Dilantin throughout the course of his hospitalization.
