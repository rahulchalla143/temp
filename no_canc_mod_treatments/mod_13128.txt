Admission Date:  [**2152-8-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-9-12**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old woman with a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital on [**2152-8-2**] with complaints of lightheadedness and intermittent chest pain.
She was given beta blocker and Digoxin, which were held and she had an episode of wide complex tachycardia.
She was treated with two shocks and then with Adenosine and then a calcium channel blocker.
She was intubated and sent to the Intensive Care Unit.
She was started on Esmolol drip with a heart rate dropping to the 120s, but the patient dropped to a systolic of the 50s.
The patient was started on a dopamine drip with a systolic blood pressure increasing to the 90s and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of this presumed heart failure.
Cultures from the outside hospital were negative, but the patient had been on multiple antibiotics broad spectrum there.
The patient arrived to the [**Hospital1 69**] Coronary Care Unit on a ventilator.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction 15 years ago.
Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer placement VVI [**Company 1543**] pacer with a rate of 60.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: 1.
Paxil 10 mg once a day.
Lasix 40 mg once a day.
Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d.
Diovan 160 mg once a day.
Digoxin .25 mg once a day.
Atenolol 50 mg once a day.
Reglan 10 mg q.i.d.
Zosyn 4.5 mg intravenous q 8.
Lovenox 1 mg per kilogram per day.
Plavix 75 mg per day.
Lipitor 20 mg per day.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation, left bundle branch block with occasional paced beats.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed that the tip of the endotracheal tube was 3 cm into the right main stem bronchus.
All external lines and hardware with the exception of the VVI pacer were removed from the patient and the patient was started empirically on Vancomycin, Flagyl, Imipenem and Miconazole powder.
She was kept well hydrated with fluids and pressor support as needed.
Aspirin was continued and the patient was started on a heparin drip and enzymes were cycled.
The electrocardiogram with the baseline left bundle branch block and now pacer placement made it difficult to say whether or not the patient was in acute coronary syndrome.
Heparin drip was continued for anticoagulation and rate controlling medications were added onto the treatment regimen.
The creatinine normalized down to a level of 0.6 on the day of discharge after aggressive hydration and treatment of the underlying causes of heart failure and sepsis.
On the first day of admission the pressors that the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on were weaned off, but Dopamine was restarted at a renal dose to improve renal perfusion.
The patient became tachycardic to the 130s and therefore the treatment regimen was switched to Levophed.
The patient received intravenous fluid boluses for low urine output.
The patient's ventilator was weaned down to 50% with a PEEP of 8.
Tube feeds were started for nutrition and the patient's hematocrit dropped from 31 to 26.
The following day diuresis with Lasix and Natrecor were pursued with a goal of removing 2 liters of fluid.
Beta blocker was added on and increased with ace inhibitors to reduce SVR.
Once the patient was extubated heart rate was aggressively controlled with beta blockers and Digoxin was added.
The patient was weaned off of diuretics as the congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock resolved and all of her intravenous medications were changed to po.
Zoloft was added back to her regimen of medications at this time to treat the depression that she had been managing chronically.
Heparin was weaned off as Coumadin was started and the therapeutic INR of greater then 2 was achieved.
The patient was receiving nutrition through thick feedings and her atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia were controlled on po medications.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was recommended that the patient continue physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy in a skilled nursing facility.
She was instructed to take all of her medications as described most importantly her Metoprolol 50 mg three times a day to control her heart rate and prevent flash pulmonary edema.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Septic shock leading to cardiogenic shock, biventricular heart failure, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, urinary tract infection, hypotension, cerebrovascular accident, anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia, sick sinus syndrome.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
Digoxin 250 micrograms q day.
Lisinopril 20 mg q day.
Lasix 40 mg po q day.
Metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d.
Famotidine 20 mg once a day.
Paroxetine 20 mg half tablet once a day.
Ativan .5 mg every four to six hours as needed for anxiety.
Multivitamin once a day.
Levofloxacin 250 mg tablet once a day for three days for treatment of urinary tract infection.
Pertinent treatments during hospitalization include mechanical ventilation, diet with thick smoothed pureed foods and recommended home health services for home oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula.
Occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy after extended intubation.
It is also important to note that during the hospitalization this patient did not receive a cardiac catheterization.
She was recommended to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cardiology at [**Hospital1 69**] two weeks after discharge to discuss congestive heart failure management and to pursue cardiac catheterization if a benefit could be presumed from that intervention once the patient is rehabilitated after this long standing hospitalization.
