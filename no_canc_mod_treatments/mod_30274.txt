Admission Date:  [**2132-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-8-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: infected PEG tube  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2132-7-30**] - laparotomy and open debridement of L abdominal abscess and necrotizing fasciitis with new gastrostomy tube placement  History of Present Illness: 89 yo female with pmhx sig for a-fib, aortic stenosis, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **] for SDH, s/p evacuation.
Her hospital course was complicated by seizures, hypoxic respiratory failure, and VAP requiring intubation and subsequent trach and PEG placement on [**2132-7-11**].
She was temporarily changed from Vancomycin to Linezolid when her PICC was removed, but then restarted on Vancomycin recently although culture data remained negative.
When the g-tube was placed to gravity, 200 cc of thick green pus came out of the tube this morning, and pus was easily expressed around the site.

Pertinent Results: [**7-15**]- blood cultures positive for MSSA [**7-19**]- blood cultures negative [**7-16**]- cath tip negative [**7-17**]- pleural fluid negative [**7-28**]- PEG swab: 2+ PMNs, 2+ GNRs, mod growth GNRs (sparse pseudomonas - pan-sensitive; sparse strep viridans) [**7-31**] - abscess swab with 1+ PMN, 1+ GPR, 1 GNR [**7-31**] - abscess drainage with 2+ PMN, 4+ GNR, 3+ GPR, 3+ yeast, 1+ GPC in pairs and clusters [**2132-8-6**] sputum: 4+ GNRs, 1+ budding yeasts .
Fe studies: vit B12 1430, folate 9.8, Fe 32, TIBC 95, ferritin 1727, TRF 73 .
[**7-29**] G tube check: multiple small amounts of extravasation into skin, but not intraabdominally.
[**2132-7-30**] - to OR with laparotomy and open debridement.
new gastrostomy tube placement .
[**2132-7-31**] L subclavian central line placed without complication .
no acute IC bleed  Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo female with recent SDH s/p evacuation with complicated course including intubation, VAP; and eventual trach and PEG placement.
# A-fib - H/o of A fib during prior admission, on [**8-3**] in afib with RVR up to 130's-140s.
Patient was started on a heparin drip.
She continued to be in afib with better rate control until [**8-5**] - increasing HR into 130s unresponsive to IV amiodarone and diltiazem with decreasing MAPs.
Pt tried on esmolol drip for rate control on [**8-6**] which failed secondary to poor rate control and decrease in SBPs to 80s.
There was poor rate control on diltiazem drip (110s-150s) and we were unable to increase diltiazim drip rate per decreasing SBPs.
Dilt drip was restarted on [**8-9**] and was attempted to be weaned several times, but was unable to be weaned given pt's tenuous HR control.
Phenylephrine drip was used to maintain blood pressure and increased to maintain MAPs 50-60s.
The patient's daughter did not want elective cardioversion and given the patient's overall poor prognosis she was made comfort measures only and the drips were turned off.
She was losing a significant amount of fluid from her wound and so I/O recordings were not accurate assessment of her fluid status.
Pt was aggressivley hydrated with good response to  UOP and CVP at target (19-20); however, aggressive hydration was held per increased pulmonary edema on CXR with increasing FiO2 requirement.
As above, it was eventually decided by her daughter that she would be weaned off of pressors and fluid would be stopped as she was made CMO.
[**2132-8-6**] CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema with large bilateral effusions, likely a result of aggressive fluids.
# [**Name (NI) **] pt with increasing leukocytosis over several days with no clear source, with 4+ GNRs, klebsiella pna and pseudomonas on [**8-6**] sputum despite vancomycin and aztreonam treatment, and low grade fever.
Started meropenem and tobramycin on [**8-11**] for double coverage of pseudomonas, d/c'd aztreonam as sensitivities were not performed for aztreonam.
PEG tube was draining frank pus on day of admission.
PEG tube removed by GI on [**7-28**] with foley in place to maintain tissue tract.
CT abdomen/ pelvis [**7-29**] showed presence of 9cmx3cm abscess from g-tube to pelvis.
General surgery was consulted on [**7-30**] to evaluate for management of abscess.
Pt was taken to OR by general surgery on [**7-30**] for laparotomy s/p abscess drainage and debridement for necrotizing fasciitis.
Pt lost large volumes of fluid through the wound --> eventually a woundvac was placed, and surgery did not feel the wound was infected several days post-op, but that her poor nutritional status compromed wound healing.
Levo/ flagyl for gut flora coverage was started on admission --> changed to aztreonam on [**7-30**] when wound culture grew pseudomonas --> flagyl restarted and fluconazole added on [**7-31**] for anaerobic and yeast coverage s/p surgical debridement; patient was on vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole when she expired.
# R hand discoloration: The patient developed RUE swelling and purplish discoloration.
She was kept on a heparin drip titrated to PTT 60-80 and her hand was kept elevated.
improved after vasopressin had been d/c'd.
present again, patient was on vasopressin again until pressors were weaned when she became CMO .
# hyperglycemia - pt had increased glucose on FSS on [**8-1**] --> insulin added to TPN, increased FS again, so insulin gtt was started .
Fe studies here are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
#) MSSA bacteremia - pt with recurrent fevers and bandemia while at rehab despite antibiotics in setting of history of pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, for which she was on vancomycin.
Vancomycin was started on [**7-15**] with plan to continue for 3-4wks per ID fellow ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9404**]); it was subsequently continued as part of broad-spectrum coverage.
# Acid/base - primary nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with primary respiratory alkalosis; an increase in bicarb was seen on [**8-8**] - probable contraction alkalosis given volume depletion, subseqyently resolved.
this was discontinued when she was made CMO and she was started on a morphine drip.
