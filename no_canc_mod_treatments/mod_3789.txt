gout, kidney disease, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% s/p ICD placement presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks.
He denied recent foot/leg trauma, fevers, chills, sweats, rash, other joint pains, recent travel, tick or insect exposure, sick contacts.
Of note, he was recently admitted to an OSH for "dehydration" after steroid dose reduction.
He was noted to have increased pain and swelling of his ankles and MCP joints bilaterally and was given cefazolin 1gm IV ONCE for suspected septic arthritis.
He was given 1 5/325 tab of percocet for his pain.
He was given 1L of NS wide open.
For the low blood pressure he was broadened to vancomycin 1gm IV ONCE.
He was given dexamethasone 4mg IV ONCE for presumed adrenal crisis.
Ortho was consulted who recommended rheumatology consultation.
Podiatry was consulted who offered to tap the joint, which a small amount of serosanguinous fluid was sent to the lab.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Compared to his last testing two and a half weeks ago there is a marked decline in both his forced vital capacity (about 400 mL) and a drop in his FEV1 by about 400 mL as well  2) Idiopathic DCM, chronic LBBB, sp ICD implantation for primary   3) Hypothyroidism  4) Bilateral TKR  5) T12 compression fracture in [**2188-3-3**]  6) Right peroneal nerve injury [**2189**],now improving  7) CKD .

gout, kidney disease, chronic pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% and ICD placement for primary prevention and chronic pneumonitis presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks with hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **], leukocytosis, worsening intestitial infiltrates.
Ultimately, because pt presented with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and recent steroid dose reduction, and because sx resolved rapidly after IV dexamethasone, it was concluded that adrenal crisis was most likely etiology of hypotension.
On Day #2 he was transferred from MICU to floors where he received prednisone PO and remained afebrile with stable VS. Cortisol stim test and random cortisol both were elevated but this is because pt was being treated with steroids during test.
There was also concern for septic arthritis given fever, white count etc so pt was initially started on broad spectrum abx but synovial fluid cx were negative.
Prednisone treatment ([**Last Name 788**] problem #1) helped treat gout and symptoms rapidly resolved.

Adrenal insufficiency from stopping steroids 2.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital yesterday with low blood pressure and swollen feet.
We determined that these problems had been caused by two different issues: being tapered too quickly off your steroids, and having a flare-up of your gout.
There is a small chance that you have a joint infection; cultures of your joint fluid have been negative so far but you should follow up with your PCP about these results and/or if your symptoms worsen.
You should go to all the appointments scheduled below to follow up on these problems and decide whether you should be started on medication for your gout.
We also wrote you a prescription for Colchicine 0.6 milligrams three times/day, which you should take as needed if you have another gout flare.
