<br> PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2111-12-30**] PERSANTINE MIBI INTERPRETATION: This 50 year old type 2 IDDM woman with a history of [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure was referred to the lab for evaluation.
The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
She had two episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BiPAP therapy and aggressive diuresis.
The etiology was likely A-flutter/A-fib with RVR versus hypoglyemia precipitating catecholamine surge causing htn vs anxiety provoking htn.
She also had a repeat echo as above.
She had an ACE level sent (for possible sarcoid), however this was undetectable (pt on ACE inhibitor therapy).
After aggressive diuresis with IV lasix, her volume status improved and she was switched to PO lasix.
Ultimately, she was discharged on B-blocker (Toprol XL 250), ACE-inhibitor (Lisinopril 60), Lasix (80mg [**Hospital1 **]), Hydralazine (50mg tid), and Imdur (60mg).
Her Toprol XL dose was ultimately uptitrated.
She was maintained on coumadin with decrease of INR prior to discharge due to a decrease in her dose (secondary to hematuria).
On discharge her coumadin dose was increased and she will have this monitored as an outpatient.
After second transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was placed on treatment dose Lovenox and Coumadin (given subtherapeutic INR).
However she had hematuria and Lovenox was subsequently stopped.
Prior to discharge, blood pressure control was somewhat improved and she was discharged on regimen as above.
Given the number of agents that she is on for blood pressure, it may be worth evaluating her for secondary causes of hypertension, including renal artery stenosis.
Given IV fluids w/ some improvement.
Elevated bicarb/hypochloremia in setting of diuresis and vomiting.
# DM-II, controlled- Initially held oral hypoglycemics in setting of renal insufficiency and recent CT. Sulfonylurea (Glucotrol XL) subsequently restarted, however pt had hypoglycemic episode as described above and this was stopped.
On discharge, Metformin was restarted.
# Depression/Anxiety - cont paroxetine initially, then psychiatry consulted and decided to cross taper paroxetine to fluoxetine given longer half-life which will be beneficial from a medical adherence standpoint.
She was given Valium for anxiety, but was discharged on Ativan per psychiatry's recommendation.
# Tobacco Use/Restrictive lung disease Was given a nicotine patch (which she was discharged on).
Maintained on Advair and nebs as needed.
After discharge, H. Flu was seen in [**Hospital1 **] cx.
# Outstanding Issues: -consider fat pad biopsy for amyloid -consider w/u for secondary causes of htn -monitor INR -monitor HR/BP/weight -monitor response to Fluoxetine -repeat UA to ensure no microscopic hematuria -consider BiPAP for OSA -H. Flu in [**Name (NI) **], consider therapy vs. repeating.
