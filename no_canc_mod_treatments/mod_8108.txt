The patient was maintained on Aspirin, Lipitor and Plavix.
Once he became hemodynamically stable on [**8-13**] he was started on Metoprolol and Captopril which were titrated upwards as blood pressure tolerated.

The patient's initial hematocrit drop of 10 points may have reflected blood loss from two catheterizations and dilution after 4-6 liters of fluid resuscitation, however, he received two units of packed red blood cells on the morning of [**8-13**] and his hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **], remaining fairly stable.
The patient complained of increasing right groin pain and was found to have a right groin bruit on exam.
The patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure with thrombin injection on [**8-15**].
