EGD [**2138-11-21**] Erosions and ulcerations in the middle third and lower thirds of the esophagus compatible with Grade 4 (severe) erosive esophagitis.
2 sets blood cultures [**2138-11-21**] no growth Blood cultures from [**2138-11-22**] pending, NGTD  transfusion reaction workup: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 91069**] experienced a six-degree F temperature rise while asymptomatic within the first fifteen minutes of a leukoreduced, compatible red cell transfusion.
The patient received two units of red cells early the following morning without incident.
Brief Hospital Course: 27yoM with history of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction/CIP (congenital) s/p small bowel transplant x2, both complicated by rejection now with gastric pouch remaining who is on chronic TPN, s/p vfib arrest in [**8-/2138**] s/p ICD placement and recent fungemia presenting to ICU for management of esophageal clot.
He tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without incident.
In ICU pt was monitored overnight post-procedure for anemia requiring blood transfusions.
Received dilaudid overnight.
Pt returned to the floor the morning after day of admission, s/p 2 EGDs, cautery/epi for area of esophageal clot and 2u RBC transfusions.
Most likely cause is severe and prolonged reflux of gastric secretions.
S/p epineprine injection and 2 unit of pRBCs.
pt recieved a 3rd unit PRBCs on return to the floor for HCT drop with nadir at 22.2.
PPI gtt was continued, 1 day later switched to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
HCTs were monitored, pt bumped appropriately and did not require further transfusion.
Pt's volume status was carefully monitored and IVF administered accordingly.
Gtube fluid showed high amylase, of [**Numeric Identifier 40285**] and Tbili of 4.3.
It appears the patient was previously on octreotide but had stopped it likely [**3-12**] expense.
No new medications that would cause elevation in LFTs.
MRCP was considered to better definie anatomy but pts AICD was a contraindication to imaginge.
Regarding cholestasis, transaminases uptrended then continued to downtrend slowly, but alk phos still int hte 400s on discharge.
Pt complained of severe itching and was started on cholestyrmine.
Pt was started on 7 day course of ceftriaxone given high concern for cirrhosis in setting of severe esophagitis/UGIB now with persistent fever.
On discharge famotidine was added to TPN prescription.
Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and takes TPN and fluids at home on regular basis.
Tachycardia resolved with aggressive fluid hydration, TPN and pain control.
Resolved quickly back to baseline with aggressive hydration.
We limited his dilaudid use, unfortunately pt does not absorb PO narcotics and morphine makes him vomit so we were not able to find a pain control regimen to send him home with.
Dilaudid was weaned day before discharge.
# h/o v. fib arrest: Per patient report occured in the setting of dehydration, hypokalemia, and administration of contrast for CT scan.
# Thrombocytopenia: Possibly in the setting of marrow supression [**3-12**] to malnutrition.
