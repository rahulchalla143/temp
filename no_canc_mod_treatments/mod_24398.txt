In discussion with patient's PCP and family, decision was made to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management pre-operatively.
Patient was initially scheduled for aortic valve replacement on [**2132-10-22**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but it was postponed in the setting of COPD exacerbation and recurrent herpes genitalis.

# Aortic Stenosis, Critical: Originally scheduled for AVR on [**2132-10-22**] but postponed secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Pt also received ceftriaxone and azithromycin in setting of COPD exacerbation.
He was restarted on his home dose of lisinopril 20mg daily for afterload reduction and continued on his home furosemide dose.
The patient completed a 7 day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
He was given Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs PRN, continued on his home spiriva, advair was added and he was transitioned from IV solumedrol (started at OSH) to a PO prednisone taper.
He was discharged on albuterol and ipratropium inhalers (patient reported unable to afford spiriva), advair, mucinex and continued on a prednisone taper.
We recommended establishing care with a pulmonologist and obtaining a set of pulmonary function tests as an outpatient.
His beta blocker was held secondary to low heart rates after starting amiodarone for an episode of atrial fibrillation.
IV Lopressor was given without much effect, followed by IV diltiazem which slowed his rate and he had spontaneous conversion to sinus.
He was started on amiodarone and was discharged on amiodarone 200mg daily.
His beta blocker was held secondary to HR 50-60s, but can be restarted if amiodarone is stopped as an outpatient by his cardiologist.
He was maintained on a heparin drip during his entire admission and was re-started on coumadin at discharge.
His INR was subtherapeutic at discharge, but given that he remained in sinus, we did not discharge him on a lovenox bridge.
Initially had signs of fluid overload and was given IV furosemide IV 40mg once and then continued on his home dose of furosemide 40mg PO daily was resumed.
# Diabetes mellitus: Hyperglycemia in setting of steroid administration for COPD exacerbation.
He had been started on insulin drip at OSH.
Insulin drip was initially continued on the floor and then transitioned to Lantus and Humalog sliding scale once the prednisone taper was initiated.
His glucose control improved as the prednisone was tapered and he was discharged on his home NPH and insulin aspart sliding scale.
# Hypertension: Initially his pressures were tenuous and his home BP meds were held, but lisiniopril was restarted and titrated (after valvuloplasty) to home dose 20mg/day with a goal of <120 SBP.
Metoprolol was held as above and can be restarted as outpatient if amiodarone is stopped.
