There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum, distal distal anterior wall, and apex.
These eventually improved and she was weaned off pressors without further complication.
In the past, she has had infection with multiple resistent organisms, including MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella (sensitive only to carbapenems), and pseudomonas (sensitive to Zosyn and carbapenems, resistent to cipro and tobra).
Her sputum culture grew MRSA and Pseudomonas and she was treated with broad spectrum ABx and eventually narrowed to Vancomycin and Cefepime based on culture sensitivities as above (of note, the very resistant Ecoli was only sparse growth and pt was clinically improving, so not specifically treated).
She improved with ABx and diuresis and was eventually able to be extubated.
Of note, she was still 3L positive through LOS even after having been diuresed, so if clinically relevant could consider diuresis but pt thought to be approaching euvolemia.
Altered mental status: Pt was sedated during intubation but noted to have prolonged course of awakening.
IV Fentanyl was used for pain.
Hypothyroidism: She was initially started on 50 mcg daily IV thyroxine; the pt's TFT's were then drawn while intubated and noted to be grossly abnormal, with TSH 9.9 --> 33 and fT4 low at 0.52 (0.93 - 1.7).
Endocrine consult obtained and the question of thyroxine home non-compliance (called pharmacy, takes 75mcg levothyroxine daily) was raised; given the GJ tube the issue of non-absorption also raised.
She received a 100 mcg IV thyroxine load and increased to 75 mcg IV thyroxine daily.
Endo recommended restarted her PO thyroxine at 75 mcg daily (hold tube feeds 2 hrs before and 2 hrs after), rechecking TFT's in [**6-10**] wks after discharge and follow up as outpt -- her endocrinologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7711**] at [**Hospital1 18**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and made aware of the situation.
NSTEMI: The pt had lateral deep inverted TW inversions and produced cardiac enzymes with Troponin peak to 0.43 (<0.1) but never made MB fraction, all consistent with NSTEMI.
TTE showed new WMA of distal anterior septum, distal wall, apex, mild decrease of EF 45-50%.
Cardiology consult felt this consistent with demand ischemic process, pt was treated with 48 hrs of Heparin gtt, daily ASA 325, Plavix 75, and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily (not 80 mg given that this was demand ischemia).
She was started on beta blocker, but noted through admission to get bradycardic with sleep so this was eventually stopped.
Last fever was [**6-15**] at 100.7, at which point she has re-cultured with blood, urine negative to date.
Of note, there has been a question of pt's noncompliance with NPO at home leading to GJ malfunction and possibly aspiration.
A collection bag was placed over the fistula to prevent bilious fluid from irritating her skin, and the redness/maceration improved over time, and eventually was able to be removed.
Review of previous surgery notes indicates that this fistula was a very long standing issue, that she had refused surgery for it, she had had IR guided attempts to fix it; and the most recent recommendations were for wound care and nutrition.
Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.4 on admission from baseline 0.7; this returned to [**Location 213**] by day 2 of admission with IVF's and renal fxn no further issue this admission, Cr by discharge 1.0. .
Chronic pain: On fentanyl, dilaudid, gabapentin at home; she was continued on gabapentin and was sedated for her intubation.
After extubation, she was given IV Fentanyl prn for pain.
She was continued on Lexapro and Lamictal while admitted (Lexapro at half dose when QTc was prolonged but normalized by discharged so back to home dose 20 mg daily).
