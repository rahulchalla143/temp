Initiated IV systemic steroids day 29 ([**2114-5-8**]) due to severe CLD and inability to wean HiFi ventilation and oxygenation.
She then weaned to CPAP [**2114-5-11**]; remained on CPAP until [**2114-7-14**] (day of life 96) when she transitioned to high flow nasal cannula.
She has remained on nasal cannula since that time.
