Brief Hospital Course: 86 M with history of tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheostomy and stent placement on ventillator overnight at baseline with recent admission for post-obstructive left-sided pneumonia followed by removal of stent who presented for planned rigid bronchoscopy.
Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent removal [**2-/2122**]: Since his prior admission for post-obstructive pneumonia during which his Y-stent was removed (see operative report note above), he has been chronically ventillated in rehab.
Y stent placed under rigid bronchoscopy by IP during admission.
Patient initially did well on trach mask, but then developed copious secretions concerning for a VAP.
He was covered with ceftazadine and vancomycin and sputum grew pseudomoas.
He progressively worsened (see shock below) and ultimately Y-stent was removed in OR by IP on [**2122-4-27**] without intraoperative complication.
He was started empirically on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Cefepime was changed to Ceftazadime based on previous sensitivities for pseudomonas.
**His 14-day course of ceftazidine will complete on [**5-11**].
