The orthopedic surgeons surgically corrected your fracture, and you have been recovering nicely from that procedure.
The orthopedic surgeons request that your staples be removed in 2 weeks, and have recommendations for physical therapy while you are at your rehabilitation facility.
You were also noted to have shortness of breath in the emergency room, so you were initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit and had to be temporarily placed on positive-pressure ventilation.
You also had fluid taken out of your lungs using a medication called Lasix.
There have been several changes to your medications during this hospitalization.
The primary changes to your medications are as follows: - START Calcium and Vitamin D supplements.
- START Tylenol 1000mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
DO NOT take more than 4g (4000mg) of this medication in a 24-hour period, because you can seriously harm your liver.
- START Tramadol as needed for pain.
- START Lovenox injections to prevent blood clot formation.
- We increased your lantus dose to 23 units in the morning and increased your insulin sliding scale to get better glucose control.
- We also started colace, senna, and bisacodyl to prevent constipation as well as albuterol as needed for shortness of breath.
