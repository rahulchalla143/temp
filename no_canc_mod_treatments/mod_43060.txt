Admission Date:  [**2168-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-10-13**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Colchicine / Omeprazole / Doxazosin / Cipro I.V.
/ Lipitor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: arterial line [**2168-10-9**]   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]y F with history notable for bilateral SDH s/p evac here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2166**] as well as chronic, recurrent non-migrainous headaches, hypertension, and remote h/o migraine HA.
At that time, her headache had started one day after she started a new medication (amlodipine at a low dose).
It had been going on for several days at that time, with only partial relief from Fioricet and Motrin, and a one-day spell of relief during a brief stay at [**Hospital1 **] where she got Reglan.
We recommended f/u with her outpatient Neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been following her since [**2166**]), and stopping the medication that may have triggered the HA (amlodipine) and follow up with her PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 2678**] to try a different anti-hypertensive [**Doctor Last Name 360**] because her BP was 170/x at that time (despite the amlodipine).
She followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this past Monday ([**10-3**]), and he recommended trying verapamil extended-release 120mg daily for the BP and headaches in lieu of the amlodipine.
Here, her BP has ranged from 190s-250s systolic over 70s to 110s diastolic, and did not respond well to labetalol or hydralazine.
Her daughter is concerned about the situation and there is some disagreement between her and the patient about the desired amount of diagnosis and treatment -- patient requests DNR/DNI and does not want, e.g., CTA or potential coil/clipping if she were found to have an aneurysm.
She also takes off the BP cuff and refuses BP cuff measurments because she says it hurts her arm.
She says she will allow a-line placement and IV managment of her BP.
Past Medical History: 1. remote h/o migraine HAs 2. bilateral SDH/hygromas [**4-/2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution; no Neurologic sequelae except intermittent vertex HAs since that time, including this week.
3. h/o DM2, but this was apparently related to hydrocortisone use for her low back pain; her daughter explained that the patient stopped requiring any diabetes medications since discontinuing the hydrocortisone (and also lost 10-20lbs recently).
Chronic anemia, on FeSO4 (not taking) and EPO injections (taking).
Hyperlipidemia, no longer taking statin (adverse reaction to atorvastatin) 9. h/o Gout 10. h/o melanoma 11. h/o "spastic colon" on mesalamine 12. remote surgical history of gastrectomy, T&A, hysterectomy, "bladder lift" 13. hypothyroidism 14.
Low back pain, chronic - takes tramadol ("my favorite"), formerly experienced better relief with hydrocortisone.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs: T 98.6F HR 86, reg BP 196/119 --> 180-190 / 74 on my exam RR 24 --> teens on my exam SaO2 100%  General: Lying in ED stretcher in trauma bay, daughter sitting next to her.
Soft, non-tender, and non-distended.
Heel-knee-shin testing with no dysmetria.
-Gait: deferred, given the labile BP and pt preference ______________________________________________________________ Discharge Examination: No change from initial examination except for variable orientation: oriented to name and place but not month, year, or hospital name.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 1968**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with PMHx of bilateral SDH/hygromas in [**2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution, DM, HTN, HL and hypothyroidism who presented with HA x2 weeks and hypertensive urgency, thought to be causing the headaches.
# Neurologic: patient was initially on a nicardipine gtt, but this was able to be stopped on [**10-10**].
We initially continued her on verapamil SR 120mg that was started prior to her admission as well as her home valsartan.
We increased her toprol XL dose and restarted her on lasix 20mg to help control her BP.
She refused BP checks with a cuff because they were "too painful".
She was started on clonidine as well for blood pressure management and was transferred from the ICU to the floor.
She developed orthostasis the next day, but this resolved quickly with intravenous fluids and the holding of her blood pressure medications.
We decided on a final regimen of metoprolol succinate (50mg XL), clonidine (0.1 [**Hospital1 **]), and valsartan (home dose, 320 mg daily) for her blood pressure management.
Her HR remained stable in the 70's after we increased her Toprol XL dose from 25->50mg QD.
# Nephrology/Urologic: pt has known chronic kidney disease, which began with Prilosec treatment and per daughter plateaued and improved after withdrawal of this medication.
We monitred her potassium and BUN/Cr, which remained increased after starting furosemide, likely also with a contribution of volume depletion.
We stopped her furosemide and will not restart this medication at this time.
[ ] She will be going to rehab for a short course for physical therapy to improve her gait stability.
