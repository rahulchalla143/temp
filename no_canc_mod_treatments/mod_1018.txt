PERTINENT PREVIOUS STUDIES:  In [**2104**] stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery, [**2104**] rota of the obtuse marginal and [**9-/2106**] percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LPDA and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal one.
Status post unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal obtuse marginal one and [**10-24**] cipher to circumflex.
The patient also suffered from nausea during the first evening on the floor, which resolved with the application of Zofran and Ativan.
The Renal Service was consulted and they felt that the patient would require emergent hemodialysis to combat the acute renal failure.
The patient was transferred to the CCU where she underwent hemodialysis on two of the three days that she stayed in the unit.
During her time in the unit the patient had one bout of chest pain 4 out of 10, which lasted approximately 20 minutes, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Renal continued to follow the patient and felt that dialysis was not needed at this point, however, they would continue to monitor her urine output as well as creatinine.
On [**2-23**] three days before discharge her CK and troponin had a significant increase after trending down for the rest of her hospital stay.
Prior to the CCU admission the patient was given Lasix and was responsive, however, the day that she was transferred to the CCU her urine output dropped off despite the application of 120 mg of Lasix.
Hypoxia:  The patient was on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
After the significant diuresis by dialysis as well as the good urine output over the last few days of her hospital stay the patient continues to sat well on room air with no other respiratory issues.
High blood pressure:  The patient was put on her normal blood pressure medications and her blood pressure was controlled adequately throughout her hospital stay.
