GRAM STAIN (Pending): TISSUE CULTURE-TISSUE (Pending): ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Pending):  CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2196-2-9**]  Secretions are demonstrated within the trachea.
The dynamic expiration series demonstrate significant decrease of the diameter of the right main bronchus, from 7.7 to less than 3 mm with right middle lobe and right lower lobe origins almost collapsed on end-inspiration as a collapsed segmental bronchi in both lower lobes and right middle lobe with subsequent significant widespread areas of air trapping, most likely attributed to this dynamic airway collapse.
The presence of the endotracheal stent prevents the evaluation of malacia.
The tracheal and left mainstem stents are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent flexible bronchoscopy to evaluate stent placement and airway.
On HD#2 she was taken to the operating room and underwent flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, foreign body (stent) removal and bronchoalveolar lavage.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit intubated for airway management.
She was started on intravenous antibiotics for her aspiration pneumonia.
On POD #1 a central line was placed for access and intravenous antibiotics.
On [**2196-2-18**] she was taken back to the operating room for flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with silicone stent placement.
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated on [**2-19**] without difficulty.
A clear liquid diet was started and advanced as tolerated.
She was started on Lovenox and Coumadin.
She was placed on Keflex for possible mastitis.
