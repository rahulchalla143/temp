The patient was received a PEG tube on [**9-28**] without any complications for enabling for her to take in increased nutrition necessary for her to possibly help heal her severe stage four sacral decubiti.
The patient is currently being loaded up on her tube feeds at the time of discharge for a goal rate of 120 cc per hour to be cycled over 12 hours during the day.
Meanwhile she was continued on her Dilantin without complications.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, given her EF had improved 60% on most recent echocardiogram, the primary team felt despite her myocardial infarction with her improved EF there was no need for an ace inhibitor at this point.
Rather she was continued on aspirin and a low dose beta blocker.
She will follow up with her primary care physician for this matter and will probably likely need a possible stress test if she is to undergo any surgeries in the future.
She was able to be weaned off the oxygen at the discretion of her primary care physician as the patient has been on O2 for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was continued on meropenem in the setting of a recent Klebsiella urosepsis, in addition for her stage four sacral decubiti.
If her wound continues to improve over the next several days and weeks and the patient is able to stay free from fecal contamination, primary care physician may elect to do a vertebral biopsy of her sacrum to further delineate the bacterial pathogens if any associated with her osteomyelitis and in so doing possibly tailor her antibiotic therapy.
For now we will continue with the Meropenem with no plans for immediate surgery at this point.
