3) Coronary artery calcification.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M s/p urethral disruption and a rectourethral fistula after radical prostatectomy for BPH.
A type A thoracoabdominal dissection was found incidentally on work-up and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac surgery service for monitoring and evaluation.
Serial chest CT's showed no progression of the dissection, and cardiac surgery felt that the dissection was chronic in nature.
Pt had stool draining from both his perineal wound and foley catheter at this time.
He was started on levo/flagyl for empiric coverage.
Urology recommended a diverting colostomy to allow the perineum to heal and later repair.
Transplant surgery was consulted for the diverting colostomy and pt underwent the procedure on [**2176-4-3**].
Pt tolerated the procedure well and was extubated to the CRSU in stable condition.
His post-operative course was uncomplicated, and his colostomy began putting out stool by POD3.
Ostomy care was taught at bedside and patient was instructed to keep the foley catheter in at all times indefinitely, per urology.
Pt remained in house until cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiac surgery for discharge home on [**2176-4-10**].
He was instructed to return to the hospital the following week for repair of his aortic dissection.
His discharge medications included abx levo/flagyl (for a total of 2 weeks) as well as anti-hypertensive medications (goal SBP<120).
