He improved clinically with diuresis, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40%, anterior septal akinesis, apical akinesis, anterior hypokinesis, and akinesis.
Clinically, although he improved with diuresis during that admission, he was treated with Levaquin.
Since that discharge, he has been started on Lasix and Lopressor with cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20612**] on [**4-15**] and [**5-3**]; however, he continued to have increasing lower leg edema.
In the Emergency Department, he was treated with Levaquin, Prednisone, and intravenous Bactrim.
He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was diuresed with intravenous Lasix, and urine output to that was over a liter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end-stage renal disease status post a living-related donor kidney transplant in [**2131-1-9**], diabetes mellitus with significant neuropathy with orthostatic hypotension, nephropathy requiring renal transplant, retinopathy with a history of retinal hemorrhages.
He has obstructive sleep apnea and has been on BIPAP since [**Month (only) 1096**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Cyclosporin 200 b.i.d., Prednisone 5 mg q.d., Procardia XL 120 q.d., Pravachol 40 q.d., Neurontin 300 b.i.d., Lasix 40 q.d., Lopressor 50 b.i.d., ProAmatine 10 t.i.d., Niferex 150 q.d., NPH 32 U in the morning, 9 U in the evening, regular Insulin sliding scale.
ALLERGIES:  DICLOXACILLIN AND COMPAZINE.
He was then transferred to the floor, given one more dose of intravenous Lasix with subsequent diuresis.
The patient continued with Lopressor 25 t.i.d., and I&Os were monitored, and a follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion.
Cardiology:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction, and it was noted that he had an [**Month (only) 547**] MIBI which showed severe perfusion defect in the apex, moderate perfusion defect in the inferior wall, moderate perfusion defect in the septum, all partially reversible, with an ejection fraction of 47%, and septal hypokinesis.
In addition, the patient was started on an Aspirin a day after discussion with his ophthalmologist about a slight increased risk of retinal hemorrhages.
In addition, he was continued on his Lopressor 25 b.i.d., and he was continued on his Procardia 120 XL q.d.
for blood pressure control, as well as his Pravachol 40 q.d.
After discussion with the patient and his attending, as well as Cardiology, it was decided that the patient could come back for an elective catheterization within the next two weeks after discharge.
He will likely need admission prior to catheterization for intravenous hydration, given his renal function.
Renal function:  The patient, on the hospital floor, developed worsening creatinine to a peak creatinine of 4.0 on the 29th; however, his urine output continued to be adequate, and he continued to have actually high urine output even after Lasix was discontinued.
In addition, on arrival to the hospital floor, the patient's bicarb was extremely low, and this was followed, and the patient was started on Bicitra to maintain his bicarb level as well.
He was treated however with Levaquin which was renally dosed at 250 q.d., and the patient was continued for a full 14-day course of Levaquin; however, he had no elevation in white count and had no fevers on the Medical floor at all.
Since Cyclosporin can cause hemolytic anemia, haptoglobin was checked which was 136, not decreased, and thus this was deemed very unlikely.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Cyclosporin 200 p.o.
b.i.d., Prednisone 5 q.d., Procardia XL 120 q.d., Pravachol 40 q.d., Neurontin 300 b.i.d., Lasix 40 q.d.
congestive heart failure symptoms, Lopressor 50 b.i.d., ProAmatine 10 t.i.d., Niferex 150 q.d., NPH 32 and 9 as previously, regular Insulin sliding scale, Levaquin 250 p.o.
End-stage renal failure with transplant and acute renal failure on chronic renal failure.
