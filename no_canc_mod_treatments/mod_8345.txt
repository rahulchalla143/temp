Thoracic aortic aneurysm:  he was transferred from OSH on [**2116-12-21**] for treatment of T10-level aortic aneurysm discovered on CT scan.
He underwent endovascular aneurysm repair w/ stent placement on [**2116-12-22**], during which he lost 2500cc blood and received 10units PRBCs.
He was treated w/ heparin gtt after his surgery for anticoagulation; meanwhile, he was started on coumadin therapy for a goal INR of [**1-21**].
When goal INR was achieved, heparin gtt was d/c and he was continued on coumadin.
His aortic stent was observed to be in the proper position by serial CXRs during his admission, w/ no signs or symptoms of bleeding.
He does not require further anticoagulation for his vascular grafts after d/c, but must continue coumadin for treatment of DVT as below.
A new right subclavian central line was placed, and treatment was begun w/ vancomyin on [**2116-12-30**].
The pt defervesced after 24 hours of vancomycin therapy, and was monitored w/ daily surveillance cultures.
Surveillance cultures on [**12-14**], and [**1-5**] grew MRSA despite continuing vancomycin treatment, raising concern for possible bacterial seeding of cardiac valves or vascular graft.
The pt was continued on vancomycin therapy, and gentamicin was added for synergy and to assist with clearance of bacteremia.
Treatment was continued w/ vancomycin and rifampin until d/c.
He will need to continue vancomycin and rifampin after d/c to complete a 6 week course of antibiotics.
The AICD was reprogrammed to fire above 140 bpm, and treatment was begun w/ amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
He will need to closely for return of diarrhea or fever, which could represent return of C diff colitis in the setting of ongoing antibiotic therapy.
CAD:  the pt has known CAD, s/p CABG in [**2107**].
Cardiology consultants thought there was a low likelihood of acute ischemia, and troponin trended down consistently after NSVT was controlled w/ amiodarone.
He was treated w/ his outpt regimen of lopressor, ASA, simvastatin, and losartan during his admission, w/ no signs or symptoms of active ischemia.
Following surgery w/ aggressive fluid resuscitation, he had evidence of increased pulm congestion and LE edema on exam, together w/ O2 requirement of 4L/minute.
However, after a brief period of holding diuretic meds, renal function returned to baseline and lasix was reinstituted, achieving consistent diuresis w/ resolution of pulm crackles and improvement in LE edema by the time of d/c.
He will need to continue diuretic therapy after d/c to treat persistent fluid overload and peripheral edema.
During his admission, treatment was continued w/ his usual outpt regimen, and he was covered for hyperglycemia w/ RISS.
At d/c, he will need to continue NPH and regular insulin for glucose control.
However, losartan and lasix were held to allow renal fxn to return to baseline, and then lasix was reinstituted and achieved consistent diuresis in the setting of stable creatinine at baseline.
At d/c, creatinine remains stable at baseline despite ongoing diuretic therapy and reinstitution of losartan.
LUE US showed non-occlussive DVT of L IJ and L subclavian veins, where infected central line was located.
This thrombus had developed in the setting of heparin therapy after surgery, and was suspected to be the source of bacterial showering and positive surveillance cultures during this admission.
At the time of discovery of the DVT, the pt was already being treated w/ coumadin and had therapeutic INR.
Treatment was continued w/ coumadin for a goal INR of [**1-21**], and LUE edema showed some improvement by d/c.
He will require continued coumadin therapy for at least 6 months to prevent further thrombosis, and will need close f/u as an outpt to monitor coumadin dosing.
Pneumonia:  given the pt's persistent O2 requirement and exam indicating LLL consolidation despite treatment for CHF, CXR was obtained and demonstrated LLL infiltrate concerning for PNA.
Levaquin was started as empiric therapy.
The pt received 8 days of levaquin therapy before sputum cx was finalized, at which time it was thought that MRSA in sputum would be adequately covered by vanco and rifampin.
Thus, levaquin was d/c and the pt was continued on vanco/rifampin as above.
