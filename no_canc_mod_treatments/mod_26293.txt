She is scheduled for an elective tracheostomy.
An exam under anesthesia was conducted using a speculum.
Next, the patient was placed in the supine position with her arms at her side.
Then 2 Prolene sutures were placed laterally as safety sutures as well.
The endotracheal tube was withdrawn under direct vision and a #8 Portex nonfenestrated tracheostomy tube was placed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the intensive care unit in stable condition.
She was taken to the ICU intubated and sedated on Levophed drip.
An arterial and PICC line were placed.
Linezolid, Zosyn, Flagyl, and Capsofungin were started for empiric coverage.
A VAC dressing was placed at the open abdominal wound.
A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed extravasation of oral contrast, adjacent to the surgical sutures, presumably at the site of prior small bowel injury, concerning for persistent bowel perforation and leak; diffuse complex ascites and stranding, with multiple scattered foci of free air, consistent with peritonitis.
At HD 3 a drain was inserted into the labial wound.
Cardiology was consulted and temporary pacing wires were placed.
At HD 22 she underwent open tracheostomy.
Fluconazole was started in place of caspogungin.
At this point she was on Zosyn and Linezolid for (+)VRE and E. Coli UTI.
At HD 35 the pacing wires were discontinued.
At HD 46 a guide wire was placed for feeding tube via the fistula site, but could not be positioned due to remaining contrast from prior studies.
Tube feedings were then initiated.
A pacer was not placed due to continued candidemia based on (+) blood and IV tip cultures on [**5-30**].
Debate reigned regarding placement of permanent vs temporary pacer vs SVC reconstruction.
She was discharged home in good condition, tolerating a clear liquid diet and supplemented with tube feeds and cycled TPN.
Citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Please flush tube with 30ml water twice daily.
