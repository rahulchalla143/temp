Admission Date:  [**2133-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-11**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: CODE STROKE (@[**Hospital1 18**] ED, called for right facial droop, right hemiparesis and receptive aphasia)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV-tPA   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old right handed woman with a history including dementia with delusions, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented about one hour after the acute onset of right facial droop, right hemiparesis and receptive aphasia for whom a code stroke was called.
She also devloped slurred speech and was making non-sensical statements.
Although the examination fluctuated, initial NIH stroke scale score was 12 for inability to answer month and age (2), failure to follow commands (2), right facial droop (1), decreased movement of both lower extremities - likely a function of comprehension difficulties (2, 2), severe aphasia characterized by relatively fluent non-sensical speech and poor comprehension (2), and dysarthria (1).
-She had 2 brothers and 1 sister all of whom died of childhood diseases including scarlet fever and diphtheria.
Carotid duplex doppler U/S bilateral [**2133-2-9**]: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Right vertebral antegrade artery flow.
She was started on aspirin 81mg.
Her LDL was 106, and it was decided at this level, the risks of statin Tx probably outweight the benefits.
Her current deficit, c/w the location of her stroke, is a predominantly receptive Wernike's-type aphasia (preserved repetition) with frequent made-up words and paraphasic word/syllable substitutions.
CV: Home BP meds were held on admission for permissive hypertension post-stroke.
3d later, after her SBPs ranged up into the 180s (yet as low as 110s), her labetalol was restarted at home-dose (150mg [**Hospital1 **]) and her HCTZ was re-started initially at half-dose (12.5mg daily).
Her amlodipine was not as yet restarted, to avoid causing hypotension / hypoperfusion of the brain.
Please monitor her BPs and re-start this medication if needed for hypertension (>140/90).
Pt had h/o several prior UTI with 3x pan-sensitive E coli and very recently a partially-resistent Proteus sp., and was initially started on IV cefepime by ICU team.
Of note, oxybutinin was not continued (anti-cholinergic medication in a patient with dementia who is being actively treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor).
Please re-assess the symptomatic risks/benefits of this medication in this patient.
Prednisone 5mg daily was continued (per the ICU team, pt's [**Hospital1 1501**] said it was "for COPD" -- the indication was not substantiated; please verify and re-assess the need for this medication.
GI: PPI and bowel regimen (senna/colace) were continued.
Other: other home meds were continued, except as above.
