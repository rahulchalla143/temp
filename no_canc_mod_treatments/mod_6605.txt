He was treated with a furosemide drip, morphine, and then added nitro drip with improvement in symptoms.
Fluid overload related to congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia with myocaridial stunning and acute on chronic renal insufficiency from IV contrast during cath.
Furosemide drip was augmented with metolazone with improved diuresis and improvment in respiratory status.
At discharge, his diuretic regimen was the same as admission, 160mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **].
Patient underwent cardiac cath with kissing balloon dilation in LAD and LCx.
The option of repeat cath was discussed however the patient and family declined further interventions.
His symptoms were managed medically with changing metoprolol to carvediol and Imdur 30mg daily.
We continued his home aspirin, plavix, metoprolol,  and nitroglycerin SL.
Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg.
# CKD: Has CKD stage III with baseline Cr 1.6-1.8.
He received post-cath hydration.
We renally dosed his medications and avoided nephrotoxins.
He was on a lasix drip for diuresis.
Antihypertensive and rate control medical management as above.
# DM: Has a long-standing history of insulin dependent DM2.
Perhaps driven down by renal failure, though also overdue for repeat colonoscopy after polyp seen in [**2119**].
We stopped his colchicine, given his renal function.
However, after discussion with palliative care, SW, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he decided to switch his code status to full.
