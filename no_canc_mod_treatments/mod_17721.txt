Admission Date:  [**2131-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-4-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sotalol / Lidocaine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, Bilateral arm pain and palpitations   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Peripheral arterial Catheterization Left brachial artery exploration and thrombus removal Left Lung thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 year old female who presented to an outside hospital on [**2131-11-10**] with complaints of feeling her heart racing and pain running down both arms for about 1-2 hours prior to admission.
She denied any chest pain, fevers, chills, back pain, abdominal pain, or diaphoresis.
Her son had called 911 and en route to the hospital, she was given sublingual nitroglycerine x1 with good effect.
She was given 325mg of ASA and dosed with Cardizem drip.
She was started on a heparin drip and admitted.
Her heart rate was well controlled on the Cardizem drip and she was loaded with digoxin.
Urinalysis showed brown granular casts with + blood, 10-25 WBCs and 2+ bacteria for which she was given one dose of Levoquin 500mg on day of transfer.
She was started on dopamine and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her condition on [**2131-11-12**].
Afib with rapid ventricular response in [**2128**] - on digoxin, coumadin, lopressor 2.
GERD s/p esophegeal dilitation in [**2130**] 4.
[**11-21**] Peripheral Arterial Cath: 1.
Arterial access was difficult to obtain on bilateral femoral arteries, even after multiple attempts under ultrasound and doppler guidance.
Ultrasound characteristics may be suggestive of a benign angiomyolipoma, however, a neoplasm cannot be excluded given internal vascularity.
Otherwise, non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT examination can be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: OVERALL SUMMARY OF COURSE OF ILLNESS 78 year old woman with history of CAD, afib, smoking, alcoholism, GERD w/esophageal strictures, osteoporosis s/p hip fracture ([**2119**]), poor nutritional intake, presents as transfer from CCU after prolonged hospitalization at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital and [**Hospital1 **] for chest pain that included cardiac catherization (complicated by brachial artery thrombosis), heart failure, remeron-induced delirium, iatrogenic renal failure, and finding of an incidental mass of kidney.
Her son called an ambulance and the patient received nitroglycerin in transit with some relief of her symptoms.
She was started on aspirin, diltiazem drip, and heparin drip.
Her HR improved with diltiazem drip and she was loaded with digoxin.
UA demonstrated 10-25 WBCs with 2+ bacteria and she was started on levofloxacin.
She also became hypotensive and was started on dopamine.
During the course of her stay, she pulled out her nasogastric tube and IVs, possibly representing alcohol withdrawal.
Per the patient's son's request, she was trasnferred via med flight to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-12**] for further management.
She was transitioned from dopamine to dobutamine with the addition of a lasix gtt.
Regarding her atrial fibrillation, she was started initially on diltiazem gtt and was transitioned to oral metoprolol.
She underwent emergent thrombectomy and as a complication developed brachial thrombus as well.
She underwent a thrombectomy for the brachial thrombus.
While the abdominal pain resolved, the patient was felt to have a depressed appetite and was started on a trial of the antibiotic Remeron.
The single dose of remeron pushed the patient into a "demented state" and the patient has gradually improved back to baseline after withdrawal of the remeron.
Over the past week, the patient and family underwent consultation with palliative care physicians because of her overall failure to thrive and the patient was awaiting placement to a rehabiliation facility when she develoepd an elevated white count (13).
A chest x-ray showed a question of a consolidation and she was started on treatment for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
OTHER ISSUES DURING ADMISSION -Apical Thrombus Her echo on admission demonstrated a possible apical thrombus and she was maintained on anticoagulation for this (in addition to her atrial fibrillation) - E.coli UTI and possible pyelo - she was started levofloxacin on [**2131-11-12**] for an E.coli UTI and then transitioned to cipro.
She received a short course of TPN ([**Date range (1) 65265**]) for poor PO intake but after she pulled her NGT.
- thoracentesis on [**2131-12-4**] - Patient has been noted to have persistent bilateral pleural effusions and she underwent a thoracentesis on [**2131-12-4**] without complication.
- altered mental status - On the day of transfer to medicine ([**2131-12-11**]), patient developed hypoxia requiring 2L nasal canula and leukocytosis to 15, raising concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
She was started on vanco/zosyn for treatment of presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
She was on Dopamine drip on arrival with systolic pressures in the mid 90s and heart rate in the 70s.
A swan-ganz catheter was placed and showed a wedge of 32 and a PA systolic in the low 50s.
She was switched to Dobutamine and initial index was 2.04 and a SVR of 1300.
She was previously on anticoagulation via heparin drip for her atrial fibbrilation and that was continued.
Patient remained afebrile, and cardiac cath was performed on [**11-21**] demonstrating peripheral arterial disease without significant coronary disesase, she developed a brachial artery thrombus post procedure and required surgical exploration and successful removal of thrombus from the brachial artery.
She developed pleural effusions which were large (especially on the left) during her stay and responded slowly to diuresis, she had a left thoracentesis and subsequently was sating 100% on room air, though this rapidly reaccumulated secondary to her low albumen and poor nutritional status.
She underwent a second thoracentesis with again good improvement in her respiratory status.
Her chronic atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with metoprolol throughout her course.
She had one episode of afib with RVR 2d prior to discharge which was quickly rate controlled with the administration of 10mg of IV diltiazem.
She was started on PO diltiazem with improved rate control and maintained this for the next 48hrs.
It was thought that this episode may have been secondary to either albuterol nebulizer treatments or the recently started ritalin dosing.
Given her lack of response in terms of appetite (although she was more alert and awake), it would be advisable to stop this medication should she experience another episode of rapid ventricular respose to her atrial fibrillation.
GU/Renal:  Patient initially with UTI (E-coli which was pan-sensitive), treated with Levofloxacin, treatment complete, follow up urine cultures neagtive.
Creatinine increased to 2.3 upon admission, likely ATN, cardiogenic shock possibly post cath and contrast nephropathy in the setting of heart failure, with improvement of heart failure her renal function improved.
She was given TPN for approximately one week, however, began to exhibit signs of volume overload, therefore this was discontinued.
Patient also had a trial of methylphenidate with minimal improvement in oral intake (but increased wakefulness and interaction with family and staff).
Given her [**Hospital 5610**] hospital stay, her CXR appearing and her clinical status, she will be treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn for a 7 day course.

Secondary Diangosis: ETOH abuse   Discharge Condition: Stable, working with physical therapy and breathing room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood pressure and decreased functioning of your heart.
You underwent a peripheral arterial catherization and other multiple diagnostic procedures and were initially found to have a decreased pumping function of your heart which eventually improved.
You should take your medications as prescribed and avoid alcohol use as this likely played a role in your malnutrition as well as your initial depressed cardiac function.
