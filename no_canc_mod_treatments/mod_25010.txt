Admission Date:  [**2107-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-6-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-8-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**] Chief Complaint: Tracheostomy Tube Displacement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous Tracheostomy by IP [**2107-6-22**]  History of Present Illness: 67F w h/o schizoaffective d/o, DM, HTN, chronic respiratory failure, tracheal stenosis now sp trach/peg presents from [**Hospital1 1501**] after accidentally pulling out her trach this AM.
IP consulted in ED and bedside replacement of trach was attempted however there was tooo much bleeding.
She went to OR for replacement of tube in her tract, but too much granulation tissue was present to introduce the tube.
Attempts were made to dilate the stoma and to place tracheostomy tube with guidance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy but unable to place.
She was intubated in the OR with ETT for airway protection with plans to return to OR in AM for rigid bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy.
Of note Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of IP has been recommending tracheal resection and reconstruction in the past but patient has refused.
Post-intubation tracheal stenosis, requiring chronic tracheostomy.
Subglottic stenosis causing nearly 90% occlusion of the airway status post rigid bronchoscopy, tracheal dilatation and redo percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2106-10-12**].
Trach and PEG placement initially in [**2105-5-5**].
Rigid bronchoscopy, tracheal dilatation and redo percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2106-10-12**].
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
woman w/ a history of post-intubation tracheal stenosis, s/p multiple IP procedures, who presented with dislodged tracheostomy tube now POD1 s/p percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement.
# Dislodged tracheostomy tube: She has dislodged her tube several time in the past.
IP has previously recommended tracheal resection and reconstruction with thoracic surgery for definitive management but patient has refused.
Attempts were made to dilate the stoma and place the tracheostomy tube under the guidance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy but it was unable to be placed.
The next day, she was brought to the OR and interventional pulmonology was able to place the percutaneous tracheostomy tube under rigid bronchoscopy.
She remained on the ventilator on POD0 of the procedure given that she did not tolerate CPAP well.
However, the next morning, she was calm and cooperative and was able to be taken off the ventilator and transitioned to 10L high-flow O2 for her trach.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow, and their recommendations were regular diet but the CUFF ON THE TRACH TUBE NEEDS TO BE DOWN WHILE EATING.
Also, she cannot tolerate the valve for speaking at this time, so she will need reevaluation at a later time at the nursing home.
# Diabetes: At home, she is on lantus 58 units HS and standing prandial insulin (12-12-8U regular insulin w/ meals and ISS).
Following speech and swallow evaluation, she was transitioned back to her home insulin regimen.
She was not started on any antibiotics or other treatment for this.
# CAD/Hypertension: She was continued on home lisinopril, labetalol, amlodipine, aspirin and atorvastatin until she was post-op, at which time these medications were held since she did not have an NG/OG tube in place in anticipation of a quick wean off the ventilator.
She was resumed on these medications once she was evaluated by speech and swallow and permitted to receive orals.
This also occurred for her other meds below.
# Depression/Anxiety: She was continued on home citalopram.
She had clonazepam and lorazepam held while sedated prior to procedure.
She was given lorazepam in the post-op setting.
# Schizoaffective: She was continued on home risperidone and benztropine.
# GERD: She was continued on home omeprazole and ranitidine.
