Legionella Pneumonia:  He was admitted with hypoxia and required non-rebreather initially.
He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin to cover for CAP.
He was treated with standing acetaminophen and cooling blankets.
He was treated for infection as above and his fevers were presumably due to legionella.
His fevers were presumed to be secondary to Legionella, however, he was also started on doxycycline for 10 days for possible concomitant anaplasma infection.
He was initially treated with a diltizem drip and then weaned to oral nodal blockade.
He was also anticoagulated with a heparin drip.
However, given the unknown duration of his atrial tachycardia, he was started on anti-coagulation that he will continue for a month.
He was treated with levaquin as above for pneumonia.
However, after the heparin was discontinued his hematuria resolved.
