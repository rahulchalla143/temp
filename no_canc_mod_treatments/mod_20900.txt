Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease, ESRD on dialysis for past 18 months, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Heart Block - s/p PPM placement, Neuropathy, Retinopathy, Anemia  Social History: Lives with wife.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for surgical revascularization as multivessel PCI was not an option.
Antiplatelet therapy was therefore discontinued and Warfarin was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP.
He was subsequently started on IV Heparin.
Once his prothrombin time improved, it was decided to proceed with surgical revascularization.
He otherwise remained pain free on medical therapy and continued on his routine dialysis schedule.
