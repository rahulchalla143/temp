Urine [**2129-1-18**]: PENDING [**2129-1-8**] 07:30AM   PLT COUNT-387  Brief Hospital Course: Dyspnea: The patient presented with acute dyspnea with associated wheezing, initially requiring a NRB to maintain sats.
He was treated with standing nebs, steroids, and ceftriaxone+levofloxacin with improvement in his wheezes and O2 requirement.
Nursing concern was raised for aspiration on multiple occasions, however after multiple evaluations by S+S, he was consistently found to only aspirate thin liquids.
He also received approximately 48 hours of IV heparin prior to determining that no intervention was planned.
He later had melena, and his Plavix was stopped with agreement from Cardiology.
Hematuria: The patient developed hematuria in the setting of Foley placement and heparin gtt.
He retained greater than 1 liter of fluid with his last catheterization and required foley re-insertion.
His foley has been left in place now for 7 days; a voiding trial can be attempted in [**1-30**] days with reinsertion of foley for failure to void.
The first time this happened he required IV Lopressor 5mg x3 and diltiazem 15mg and 20mg IV.
He was anticoagulated as below and did not need further anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
Rate control appears to have been achieved with metoprolol 62.5 TID, which was converted to Toprol XL 150 mg daily.
Peripheral arterial disease:  On exam, several days after arriving to the floor, he was noted to have no DP pulses and delayed capillary refill on the left foot.
Vascular surgery consult was called, who asked for heparin bridge to Coumadin and took him to the OR for angiogram.
It was felt that he would need surgical intervention but would need to be scheduled as outpatient.
We recommend holding his coumadin for 2 days, and then restarting at 1mg daily with frequent INR checks.
He was made NPO except meds, started on protonix drip, and Gastric lavage was performed.
Anticoagulation was continued through this event because of risk to heart and limb in this patient.
Acute on Chronic renal failure: Creatine was 2.8 on arrival, up from a baseline of 2.0.
Hypertension: The patient was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
He was treated with colchicine, which improved his discomfort.
On day of discharge, he had mild erythema on the lateral dorsum of his left foot and tenderness at the 2nd MCP, though this was markedly improved since starting colchicine.
He will continue on colchicine daily for the next three days.
