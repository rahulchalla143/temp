HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with old ischemic infarction and some residual right hemiparesis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation (on warfarin with an INR of 2.5) who presented with increasing right-sided weakness on [**2192-3-12**].
He subsequently worsened with profound right facial droop and lethargy.
He was given vitamin K and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
There was a right facial droop with intact palatal elevation and midline tongue protrusion.
He was successfully weaned off intravenous blood pressure medications and converted to oral antihypertensive agents.
He was started on amiodarone.
The remainder of his Intensive Care Unit stay was stable and unremarkable, and he was transferred to the regular [**Hospital1 **] service for further management.
He was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.
Given the risk of ischemic infarction from his atrial fibrillation, we have restarted his warfarin at 3 mg p.o.
Therefore, he will benefit from Occupational Therapy as well as Physical Therapy for his hemiparesis.
His amiodarone schedule will be continued at 400 mg p.o.
Left basoganglia bleed with internal capsule involvement.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
