Admission Date:  [**2126-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-5-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: lower GI bleeding, fever and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CENTRAL VENOUS LINE PLACEMENT   History of Present Illness: 58 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2943**] [**Name (STitle) 696**], admitted on [**10-1**] with lower GI bleeding, fever and hypotension.
MICU course was complicated by intubation from [**10-2**] to [**10-16**], bouts of hypotension and oliguria in the setting of profuse bleeding requiring a total of 7U PRBC and 16U FFP.
Source of bleeding was identified as 1) Rectal varices and 2) Vaginal bleeding, felt to be in setting of flexiseal and very elevated INR.
Patient is being transferred to our service for further treatment of liver decompensation and transplant evaluation.
Past Medical History: 1)Cryptogenic cirrhosis 2)Cholelithiasis 3)Chronic lympedema of the right lower extremity 4)Right knee replacement [**2121**] 5)Recurrent cellulitis of the right lower extremity.
IMMUNOLOGY Carcinoembyronic Antigen (CEA) 2.0 ng/mL Alpha-Fetoprotein 2.1 ng/mL .
SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2126-10-18**] Findings:  Clotted blood was seen in the colon extending from the rectum to transverse colon.
Varices were injected with a 1:1 mixture of dermabond and ethiodol.
Varices were injected with a 1:1 mixture of dermabond and ethiodol.
Normal waveforms in the hepatic veins -[**2126-11-1**] Fluoro: Successful repositioning of the [**Last Name (un) 28075**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**] tube beyond the pylorus in the ascending duodenum and additional placement of a NG tube in the gastric antrum.
Feeding tube is now localized in the stomach.
The etiology of cirrhosis was not entirely clear, as her past workup included a mildly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, and an isolated positive HBcAb, in the absence of surface antigen positivity.
She was empirically started on prednisone and broad-spectrum antibiotics, to cover possible autoimmune hepatitis as well as low-grade undetected infection.
Prednisone was subsequently stopped several days later, as the patient had not demonstrated any improvement in her LFT's, and she experienced small amounts of blood in her stool.
The donor was found to have a soft tissue infection, however, and the surgery was cancelled.
Her ABx coverage was expanded to vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin.
She became oliguric, and she received high amounts of crystalloid and colloid.
HYPERVOLEMIA: The patient was massively volume overloaded upon transfer to the floor, given her aggressive IV fluid repletion.
She was started on furosemide and spironolactone, and the spironolactone was subsequently increased to 200 mg daily.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient developed a leukocytosis up to 16 in the setting of prednisone therapy.
She had been on broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to this leukocytosis.
Her temperature and blood pressure slowly trended down, and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin.
# ODYNOPHAGIA/NECK PAIN: The patient complained of a sore throat in the setting of having had an NG tube in place.
She was written for magic mouthwash, but did not require it once the NG tube was removed.
The medication was discontinued after she was found to be hypermagnesemic, given magnesium component to maalox.
She was treated with injection of 1:1 mixture of dermabond and ethiodol on sigmoidoscopy.
She was kept on daily PPI and vitamin K. She remained on propanolol for several days, but this was discontinued on [**11-6**] for systolic BP in the 90's and also to not mask a potential tachycardic response.
======================================================= On transfer to MICU GREEN, pt was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanoc, cefepime, flagyl).
Micafungin was added for empiric antifungal coverage in the setting of continued decline (hypothermia, bradycardia) with braod anti-bacterial agents.
Ganciclovir was also added for a borderline positive CMV viral load.
Ove the course of her first week in the MICU, the patient made progress, her BP improved to the point where she was having 300cc/hr of fluid removed by CVVH.
She tolerated her first HD session, but soon thereafter had worsening hypotension with an increasing pressor requirement.
She did not convert to sinus rhythm s/p amiodarone IV bolus x2.
Hepatology and Transplant were in agreement that [**Month (only) 3225**] status was not inappropriate.
Pt was started on a morphine drip, pressors were discontinued and she passed several hours later.
