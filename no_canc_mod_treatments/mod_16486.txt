He was given Atropine and found to be in complete heart block.
At that point he was revived but intubated secondary to congestive heart failure.
Thereafter he was maintained on Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was the maintained on Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip and heparin and transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for a coronary artery bypass graft.
Prior to the coronary artery bypass graft the patient also developed a fever which was thought to be due to a urinary tract infection as well as a pneumonia and urine growing greater than 100,000 Escherichia coli.
He was initially started on Unasyn and Vancomycin and kept on Unasyn 3 gm q.
He was thus transferred to Medicine for treatment of pneumonia urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure and acute renal failure prior to coronary artery bypass graft.
Question of coronary artery disease; 3.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO MEDICINE SERVICE:  Ambien 5 q.h.s., Levaquin 500 q.d., Heparin drip, Nitroglycerin drip, Insulin sliding scale, Lasix 40 b.i.d., Metoprolol 25 q.i.d., Pravastatin 40 q.d.
and Aspirin 160 two p.o.
At home it was reported the patient was on Amaryl 2 mg q.d., Carvedilol and Lipitor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to Medicine Service were 99.6 temperature maximum, temperature currently was 98.2, blood pressure 104 to 120/60 to 70, and last at 110/60, heartrate ranging 65 to 76, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 96% on 4 liters.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68 year old male with a history of diabetes and question of coronary artery disease presented to [**Hospital6 256**] status post acute myocardial infarction with three vessel disease on a diagnostic catheterization at an outside hospital, also congestive heart failure with likely pneumonia and urinary tract infection, acute and chronic renal failure, awaiting coronary artery bypass graft after resolution of his medical issues.
The hypoxia subsequently resolved and at the time of transfer for his coronary artery bypass graft the patient had an oxygen saturation of 93 to 94% on room air.
For the question of pneumonia on top of this, causing possible hypoxia, the patient was continued on Levaquin for a seven day course with complete clinical resolution.
Overall cardiovascular issues, diuresis was continued.
His congestive heart failure did improve clinically throughout his hospital stay prior to his coronary artery bypass graft.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was kept on Metoprolol and Nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip and statins, and awaiting coronary artery bypass graft for bypass of the coronary artery lesion.
For his acute and chronic renal insufficiency, renal consultation was obtained.
After approximately five or six hours the obstruction did resolve on its own, not requiring any intervention.
According to Gastroenterology the patient should have an outpatient gastroenterology follow up or likely upper endoscopy and should continue on a proton pump inhibitor for likely gastroesophageal reflux and prevention of any possible strictures.
On transfer, to Cardiothoracic Surgery for the coronary artery bypass graft, it was the opinion of the medical team that this patient will require follow ups after his discharged from the hospital.
