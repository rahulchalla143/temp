Patient was given NS fluid bolus x 2, 4 baby aspirin, morphine, lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and started on integrillin and heparin drips, then transferred to cath lab for emergent cardiac cath.
Had Cypher stent placed to RCA, across AM origin into PL, then had balloon dilation of AM, with residual 70-80% stenosis of AM.
Therefore patient was given amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 for loading and sent to CCU.
Past Medical History: Borderline hypertension Borderline hypercholesterolemia S/p basilar skull fracture s/p MVA   Social History: Works as a counseler at a hospital.
Physical Exam: Vitals - afebrile, HR 89, BP 115/86, RR 20, O2 99% 2L NC General -  awake, alert, lying flat in bed, appropriate, NAD HEENT -  PERRL, MMM, EOMI Neck - JVP flat, no noted hepato-jugular reflex, although difficult to evaluate because patient lying flat, no carotid bruit's b/l CVS - irregularly irregular, nl S1,S2, no M/R/G Lungs - CTA anteriorly and laterally.
The mid RCA lesion was predilated with a 2.0 X 20 mm sprinter  balloon, stented with a 2.5 X 28mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a 3.0 X 13mm high sail balloon  with lesion reduction from 100% to 0%, also jailing and stenosing the ostium of the AM.
4 rescue angioplasty of the  jailed AM/PDA.
Successful stenting of the mid/distal RCA lesion 4.
The patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, and time from onset of symptoms to intervention was estimated at approximately 2 hour (onset of symptoms at 4:30pm, in cath lab by 6:30pm).
Following cardiac cath, patient was started on plavix 75mg qd, aspirin 325mg qd, lipitor 80mg qd, metoprolol which was titrated up and changed to toprol xl on discharge.
Nitroglycerin was avoided in setting of likely RV involvement.
In terms of other ischemic management, patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, demonstrating a CK peak of [**2191**].
He was started on amiodarone (given 150mg bolus in cath lab, followed by 1mg/hr drip) and patient spontaneously converted to NSR a couple hours later.
It was believe that his atrial fibrillation was secondary to peri-MI, peri-cath circumstances and may have been contributed to by his PA catheter in place during the catheterization.
Therefore, upon converting to NSR, his amiodarone was discontinued.
Patient remained on telemetry without event throughout remainder of hospital course.
His post-cath course was also complicated by nausea/vomiting and hypotension, which was treated with PRN anti-emetics and fluid boluses with subsequent good control.
Patient was discharged on above medications with instructions to follow up with his cardiologist and primary care physician.
