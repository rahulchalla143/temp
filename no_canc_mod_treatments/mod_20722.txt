She took Tylenol which made headache better, but it later returned.
She took a temperature at home which was 100.5.
MRI showed FLAIR hyperintensity and contrast enhancement in the R thalamus, midbrain, corpus callosum splenium, temporal lobe, and cerebellum as well as leptomeningeal enhancement.
Given borderline positive PPD and known exposure to Tb in her native country of [**Country 4574**], empiric anti-Tb therapy was started with RIPE.
She also received a course of high dose steroids for possible inflammatory etiology of her symptoms.
Pt was also started on moxifloxacin for Tb and Mycoplasma coverage.
During her rehab course, she developed pneumonia and moxifloxacin was changed to levofloxacin.
Levofloxacin was changed back to moxifloxacin, but this was course completed 3 weeks ago.
She continued to have dizziness on standing and unsteadiness as well as fluctuating diplopia.

MR spectroscopy is planned for further management as discussed in the neurology case conference.
Brain biopsy: active encephalitis   Brief Hospital Course:   Ms. [**Known lastname 54845**] is a 50 year old woman with a known brain lesion, previously believed to be TB encephalitis and was treated as such with initial improvement during previous admission, but who presented with headache and worsening of blurry vision.
Initially, her Tb medications (RIPE therapy) were continued and a repeat MRI was performed which showed interval progression in and recurrence of the previously seen enhancing lesions in the right thalamus, right mesial temporal lobe, and right cerebellum with further smaller enhancing areas in the right mid brain as well as increased mass effect and 4-mm midline shift to the left.
Given her worsening at this point, ID was consulted and anti-Tb medications were stopped.
While the biopsy results were pending, she was started on dexamethasone 4 mg q6h, but this was changed to q8h after she began to have hallucinations; she was only noted to have minimal clinical improvement on steroids.
In fact, a repeat head CT performed after increased lethargy was noted, showed enlarging ventricles and the possibility of a drain for hydrocephalus was discussed, though not placed as her mental status improed without intervention.
As per ID, she was started on empiric Ampicillin (for Listeria), Rifampin and Moxifloxacin.
Her steroids have also begun to be tapered; she will be decreased to Dexamethasone 1 mg daily on [**2120-10-1**] and the steroids will then be stopped 1 week later.
A repeat MRI will then be performed 2 weeks after the steroids have been discontinued to evaluate for changes in lesions size and monitor effectiveness of antibiotics.
Of note, two LPs were performed this admission, in addition to the LPs she had during her prior admission, and the most recent CSF results show improvement while on the antibiotics, including lower WBC and protein counts (please see results section for full comparison of CSF results).
They believe the pain and weakness are of a neurogenic etiology, with no evidence of frozen shoulder/cuff related symptoms and recommended conservative treatment with pain control and physical therapy.
She was started on Neurontin 100 mg tid for the pain; this dose can be titrated up if needed for improved pain control.

You have known history of a lesion in your brain and was being treated for Tuberculosis encephalitis.
After the biopsy, you were started on steroids to help with the swelling in the brain.
For the encephalitis, while we don't know the causative organism, you were started on empiric antibiotic treatment with Ampicillin, Rifampin and Moxifloxacin.
You have improved clinically while on the antibiotics and the number of inflammatory cells in your CSF also decreased since they were started.
A repeat MRI will be done 2 weeks after the steroids are off to see if the size of the lesion in your brain has changed.
