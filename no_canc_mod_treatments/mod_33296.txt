On [**2153-6-20**] the patient was on bipap for most of day with slight improvement in his respiratory symptoms, although he did have wheezing.
Steroids, azithromycin, and nebs were administered and an a-line was placed.
On [**2153-6-21**], he was on vent mask during the day and did well.
He required bipap overnight with increased PSV over the course of the night due to increased CO2.
On [**2153-6-22**], his pCO2 improved during the day and his bipap at night was set at 16/8.
He was satting well on 2L NC and had been transitioned to PO steroids before being transferred to the floor.
He progressively became less somnolent and responded well to bipap at night.
He was treated with steroids, azithromycin, and neb treatments PRN during his admission.
He was on an insulin sliding scale while on high dose steroids during the admission.
He was discharged on a long prednisone taper starting at 60mg daily and decreasing by 10mg weekly.
Previously undiagnosed, but the patient did very well using bipap nightly in the hospital.
Pulmonary set the patient up with home bipap using 16/8 settings temporarily before a sleep study could be performed as an outpatient.
He required several additional PRN doses of lorazepam for anxiety during his admission.
He also has pulmonary follow-up in early [**Month (only) **] prior to his steroid taper ending.
