FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins were performed.
FINDINGS: There is continued resorption and redistribution of previously-seen blood products with some remaining diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and similar amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles dependently.
A ventriculostomy catheter via right frontal approach is unchanged with tip in the anterior right lateral ventricle.
Interval resorption and redistribution of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, with stable amount of intraventricular hemorrhage and no new hemorrhage.
Stable configuration of the ventricles with unchanged position of right ventriculostomy catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 year-old man with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p coiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG presenting from rehab with tachypnea and found to have with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Neurosurgery concluded that anticoagulation with heparin gtt was appropriate.
He was started on a heparin drip and was started on coumadin and lovenox on [**11-27**].
He will need anti-coagulation for at least 6 months.
Cerebral hemorrhage: Patient was admitted on [**10-28**] following an unwitnessed syncoal episode with resultatnt SAH and IVH now s/p ACOM coiling, VP shunt placement, tracheostomy and PEG placement.
On both fludrocotisone and losartan as an outpatient and were held during admission.
