The patient was started on lovenox (patient refused q6 PTT checks making heparin inappropriate).
She was continued on maximal medical management.
She was managed medically with a beta blocker which can be titrated up as her blood pressure allows - on discharge she is on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], with BP ranging from 90-120 systolic.
She is on ASA 325 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily.
Provided the patient continues to refuse intervention, nitroglycerin can be attempted for chest pain relief.
She was not responding well to fluid bolues and a MICU consult was called.
They recommended transfer to the ICU, but the patient was refusing central line placement and other ICU level care so she was kept on the general medicine floor.
Her hypotension was thought secondary to infection (WBC 20/Lactate 2.7) and she was started on linezolid/axtreonam (multiple resistence organisms in the past with pen/ceph/tobra allergies).
She was maintained on NS overnight and her blood pressure stabalized.
The patient refused a PICC making antibiotic choice difficult.
Later, her antibiotic coverage was changed to Levofloxacin.
These other episodes were thought to be due to hight ostomy output and responded well to 1 liter normal saline fluid boluses.
Left upper extremity PICC placed on [**11-21**] for hydration and electrolyte repletion.
She completed her course of levaquin in house.
COPD: The patient was continued on flovent and nebulizer treatments.
She was started on steroids in the setting of her ICU admission for hypotension, and these were continued via a slow taper as it was thought they may have improved her COPD.
Initially, her bismuth and loperimide were held for the possibility of infectious colitis.
A PICC was placed for hydration and electrolyte repletion.
