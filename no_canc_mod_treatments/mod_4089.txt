He required multiple blood transfusions during initial post-operative period.
He required Nitro for hypertension but was weaned off by post-op day two and started on beta-blockers.
He had episodes of atrial fibrillation on post-op day two which was treated with beta blockers.
Despite this he continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation and Amiodarone was started.
Coumadin with a Heparin bridge was initiated on this day and he was transferred to the SDU for further care.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
CT showed a large right hemothorax and Heparin was immediately stopped.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was then transferred back to the CSRU where a chest tube was inserted but without evacuation of hematoma.
Therefore he was brought to the operating room where he underwent an exploration and evacuation of hemothorax through his Right thoracotomy incision.

Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] remained intubated over two days and was weaned from sedation and extubated on [**7-28**].
Chest tubes were ultimately pulled on [**7-30**].
General surgery was reconsulted for prior GB US and patient now having increased LFT's and Amylase/Lipase.
Coumadin was eventually restarted with a Heparin bridge for his mechanical valve.
Therefore GI were consulted and recommended IV PPI's (d/t his PMH) with checking H. Pylori serologies and following lab-work.
Over next several days he remained stable and NPO without N/V.
On [**8-8**] a PICC line was placed for TPN while patient continued to remain NPO.
Over the following week he remained stable while receiving TPN and medical management and his LFT's and Amylase and Lipase were closely watched.
Patient continued to receive medical management while being treated for above complications with help from multiple services.
During this time he continued to receive Coumadin with a Heparin bridge for his mechanical valve.
Eventually Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] food well, TPN was discontinued with resolution of his pancreatitis.
