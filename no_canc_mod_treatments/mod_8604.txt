[**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color images of the left upper extremity in the region of the patient's AV graft were obtained.
Immediately medial to the graft in the mid portion of the bicep there is 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm homogenous somewhat echogenic rounded mass.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained without administration of IV contrast.
Blood cultures from the 16th showed no growth Blood cultured from the 17th showed coag positive staph (prior to removal of AV graft) Tissue from the AV graft grew out MRSA Blood cultures from 18th, 20th, and 21st showed no growth  RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-11-28**] 11:50 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please assses for liver hematoma, abscess, or any other acut  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 47 year old woman with ESRD on HD s/p kideny [**Hospital **], here with MRSA bacteremia but now s/p liver biopsy and PD catheter placement and with intense abdominal pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please assses for liver hematoma, abscess, or any other acute abdominal process (patient is immunosuppresed) CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: End-stage renal disease, peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, MRSA bacteremia, liver biopsy.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired following administration of oral contrast only.
No IV contrast was used secondary to patient's elevated creatinine.
Note is made of a peritioneal dialysis catheter entering the right lower abdominal wall with the tip coiled in the left pelvis.
Fevers: -patient was treated for MRSA bactermia with vancomycin, initially ?of source, the us of the fistula showed a small echogenic focus, most likely a hematoma and not an abscess, but the most likely the source was still the AV graft (the patients left arm became swollen and the skin around the graft became increasingly erythematous although the cultures from the fluid in the area has no growth), patient then had the graft removed and a PD catheter placed.
In addition patient was initially started in ceftriazone for ?pna but maintained on azithro to tx her pna - started Ceftriaxone (initially), azithro for pneumonia (dc'ed on the 21st) - repeat CT -resolution of air-space disease, also evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions (per attnd these had attempted to be tapped previously but were to small for tap)  2.
Hyperglcemia: Patient has very severe diabetes and is very sensitive to insulin, therfore [**Last Name (un) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to help manage her diabetic regimen  4) CRF: patient was maintained on HD (MWF) on immunosuppressive agents  6) HTN: patients blood pressure was controlled with CCB and ACE, hydral prn (not using beta blocker as may mask signs of hypoglycemia)  7) Diastolic HF: dialysis dependent  9) Abnl LFTs- patient liver was biopsied when the AV graft was removed- pending results  10) Epilepsy: we continued to monitor tegretol levels  11) Anemia: hct 38 on admission to 23.6 on [**11-24**] (patient also had some blood loss with removal of AV graft).
