Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] required intubation secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure during her first evening in the ICU.
She was treated for CAP with ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin for 7 days, and was then briefly extubated on HD 6 after tolerating appropriate weaning.
Despite this, she required reintubation after several hours for continued hypoxia.
At this point, she was restarted on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed VAP and was continued on bronchodilators and steroids for COPD management.
She was again weaned from the ventilator on HD 15 after finshing 14 full days of antibiotics.
Prior to the second extubation, in an attempt to avoid flash pulmonary edema, Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] was actively diuresed and her blood pressure was aggressively controlled with a nitrogylycerin drip.
Given these circumstances, her family was consulted about the possiblity of tracheostomy for vent weaning.
THey agreed to this and the patient received a tracheostomy (and PEG) on [**2196-9-21**].
PEG was working well and patient was receiving tube feed at goal (Promote with fiber) at 55 cc/hr.
Attempted speech and swallow eval prior to discharge, however, pt did not tolerate PMV during admission.
Multiple regimens were implemented in various combinations including increased beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydralazine and occasional nitroprusside or nitroglycerin gtts.
Though she is maintained with an ACE inhibitor at home, it was not initially used in her management as she had increased creatinine.
On discharge, she was maintained on metoprolol 125 mg [**Hospital1 **] as well as lisinopril 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pt also noted to have sterile pyuria during hospitalization with bloody urine; foley was replaced and pt was treated 3 day course of ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI.
Hyperglycemia/DM: Was intermittently controlled in the ICU with insulin gtt and insulin sliding scale.
Patient was discharged on insulin sliding scale.
Followed closely by the renal transplant team for titration of tacrolimus, cellcept, prednisone, espeically in the setting of receiving intermittent doses of stress-dose steroids for the COPD component of her respiratory disease.
Discharged on Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 5 mg daily and tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Anemia: Essentially at baseline during this admission, though pt was started on ProCrit 3000 units 3 times per week for maintenance of baseline hematocrit.
