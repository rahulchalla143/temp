Given the degree of severity of the left main disease in the setting of the substernal chest pressure and unstable angina the patient was therefore scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft.
Off pump coronary artery bypass graft was done secondary to the fact that the patient has a history of nephrotic syndrome and was at risk for coagulopathy, stroke, etc.
Last treatment was two years ago.
ALLERGIES:  Lipitor and Atenolol for which she gets a rash.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was brought to the Operating Theater on [**2142-1-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] where she underwent an elective two vessel coronary artery bypass graft off pump.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was on nitroglycerin drip, propofol and phenylephrine.
She was therefore brought to the Operating Room for an immediate redo coronary artery bypass graft.
She underwent a two vessel coronary artery bypass graft at this time including a saphenous vein graft that was utilized to the left anterior descending as well as to the diagonal in a sequential manner.
She had received four 8 units of packed cells in her resuscitation and eight units of fresh frozen platelets as well as 3 packs of platelets.
In the Intensive Care Unit she was placed on Vancomycin and Gentamycin for the fact that her chest had to be opened at the bedside.
Her Swan-Ganz catheter was left in place for hemodynamic monitoring.
She was started on Lasix, aspirin and antihyperlipidemic therapy.
The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to CVL.
At this point she was being maintained on a morphine PCA with Toradol and Percocet for breakthrough pain.
Given her chronic opioid dependence she did have significant issues of tolerance and therefore was ultimately referred to the Acute Pain Service who had recommended to use Oxycodone 20 mg po q 3 to 4 hours prn as well as morphine sulfate intermediate release 15 mg po b.i.d.
Potassium 4.1, BUN and creatinine were 24 and .8 and the remainder of her electrolytes were within normal limits.
On postoperative day five was also marked by the onset of persistent substernal chest discomfort, pressure and tightness.
The acute Pain Service ultimately titrated her medication regimen for pain control to the aforementioned regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg po q.a.m., Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg po q day, Plavix 75 mg po q day, Oxycodone 10 to 20 mg po q 3 to 4 prn, MSIR 15 mg po b.i.d., Imdur 30 mg po q day, Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d., Amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d., Ibuprofen 600 mg po q 4 to 6 prn as well as Oxazepam 15 to 30 mg po q.h.s.
Her staples were intact.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Unstable angina status post off pump coronary artery bypass graft followed by redo coronary artery bypass graft on the night of surgery for V tach/V fibrillation arrest.
