Admission Date:  [**2117-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-4-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Lactose  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Abnormal rhythm on outpatient cardiac event monitoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 64 year-old Female with a PMH significant for persistent atrial fibrillation (treated with Disopyramide and Metoprolol currently; previously on other anti-arrhythmics who underwent PVI in [**8-/2117**]), atypical atrial flutter (s/p cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in [**9-/2116**]), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ascending aortic aneurysm, primary biliary cirrhosis s/p liver transplantation in [**2095**] (on chronic immune-suppression) who presents with abnormal rhythm strip while being monitored from home via an event monitor.
On monitoring, her ventricular rate appeared to be in the 120-130s with runs of a wide-complex tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia vs. atrial fibrillation with aberrancy).
Of note, the patient had a recent CCU from [**2117-11-18**] to [**2117-11-19**] after she presented to an outside hospital with concerns for gastroenteritis and hypotension to the 80-90s systolic range; which was empirically treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn and stress dose IV steroids who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
On arrival, her GI losses were treated with IV fluids and in the ED she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 110s which was treated with Diltiazem, Amiodarone and Metoprolol.
She did spontaneously revert to normal sinus rhythm following these medications.
She required CCU admission and Phenylephrine gtt for maintenance of her tenuous blood pressure.
She improved quickly, with resolution of her GI symptoms and improvement of her blood pressure off pressor support.
Disopyramide 300 mg PO Q12 hours and Metoprolol succinate 50 mg XL PO daily were continued for rate and rhythm control.
She was discharged on a 5-day course of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for her presumed acute diarrheal illness.
She continued taking Cipro and Flagyl as prescribed and has continued to have 4-5 episodes of diarrhea per day, which is unchanged from discharge.
She has also been continuing her prednisone taper.
At [**Hospital **] hospital, she was in Afib with ventricular rate in 140s and received 2.5mg IV metoprolol.
By report, she also received amiodarone 150mg and the patient reported feeling better after this.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
They deny bleeding at the time of prior procedures or surgeries.
Past Medical History: * Hypertension * Persistent atrial fibrillation (initially treated with Disopyramide, followed by Amiodarone, Atenolol and Dofetilide; all unsuccessful in restoring or maintaining sinus rhythm; she underwent pulmonary vein isolation in [**8-/2117**] - currently maintained on Disopyramide 300 mg PO Q12H and Metoprolol succinate 50 mg XL PO daily), * Atypical atrial flutter (which developed after PVI status-post  successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in [**9-/2116**]) * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (last MRI in [**2115**] showed hypertrophy confined to the distal third and true apex portions of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction greater than 70%) * Ascending aortic aneurysm (measuring 4.2 x 4.3- cm in [**3-/2116**]) .
Liver transplantation, [**2095**] (secondary primary biliary cirrhosis vs. atresia with autoimmune hepatitis in [**2096**]) 2.

She is s/p PVI and has been tried on multiple antiarrhythics in the past, none of which have consistently maintained NSR.
She was contninued on her home disopyramide and metoprolol wasincreased to 25mg q8h.
Her INR was subtherapeutic and she was bridged with Lovenox until her INR was greater then 2.0.
However, we would expect that this would have improved with pulse of steroids she received last admission.
Cellecpt can also cause diarrhea, although she has been on this medication for a few years and dose has not increased recently.
# CORONARIES - no prior history coronary artery disease; no cardiac catheterization procedures; last stress testing performed [**2113**] - she exercised for 8-minutes with a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and had no EKG findings of concern with normal myocardial perfusion imaging - presenting without chest pain, EKG without evidence of active ischemia  # PUMP - last 2D-Echo performed on [**2117-11-18**] showing isolated apical left ventricular hypertrophy as well ([**Last Name (un) 51827**] variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%) with moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was continued on her home doses of lisinopril and metoprolol.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was continued on home doses of metoprolol, lisinopril and spironolactone as mentioned above.
#S/p Liver transplant - Not reporting any RUQ pain at this time.
She is currently taking Cellcept and tacrolimus for immunosuppression, which were continued during this admission.
