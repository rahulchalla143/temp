A large amount of air is noted within the stomach with associated prominent air-filled bowel loops A single lead pacemaker projects over the right hemithorax.
IMPRESSION: 1) New bilateral lower lung opacities likely represent multifocal consolidation, including aspiration pneumonitis.
2) Gas-distended stomach and bowel loops may benefit from nasogastric tube decompression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with continuous ventricular pacing at rate 60 was previously present.
[**2188-11-19**]: VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  Reason: difficulty swallowing  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: difficulty swallowing INDICATION: CVA with difficulty swallowing.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: This exam was performed in conjunction with the speech pathologist.
Under continuous fluoroscopic guidance, various consistencies of barium were administered orally.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Assess position of NGT AP CHEST, 5:29 P.M.  HISTORY: Bowel obstruction.
Transvenous pacer lead unchanged in position along the floor of the right ventricle.
No endotracheal tube is seen, although the chin obscures the upper airway.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are extensive multifocal, ill-defined opacities present at the lung bases.
A nasogastric tube can be seen coursing through the esophagus and side port is visualized just below the gastroesophageal junction.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A rectal tube appears to be kinked at the its apex within the rectum.
Findings again suggest functional pseudo-obstruction and are similar to the CT evaluation of [**2188-7-30**] with overall decreased colonic distension.
NG tube with side port just below gastroesophageal junction.
Positioning of the IVC filter, pacemaker leads, and nasogastric tumor are stable.
Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl to complete a 14-day course for aspiration pneumonia on [**2188-12-1**].
Patient had NG tube placed.
Rectal tube placed on [**2188-11-25**] and put on suction.
GI subsequently consulted and felt conservative management was best approach.
The rectal tube and NG tube were subsequently removed.
Bowel meds should be continued on a regular basis at NH.
Nutrition: Once above two issues resolved, the patient was re-evaluated by speech and swallow who cleared him for a thickened, pureed diet.
He required IV fluids (D5W) and water thru the NG tube.
Atrial Fibrillation: Rate remained well controlled on a beta blocker.
INR was elevated, so coumadin was initially held.
Lasix was held at discharge as patient was already hypovolemic.
Initially, the patient did go into acute heart failure due to aggressive volume resuscitation in ICU.
Hyoertension: Dose of metoprolol was reduced as below and lisinopril was stopped due to normal BP just on low dose metoprolol.
Lisinopril can be restarted if BP rises at NH.
He did not aspirate on a recent video swallow, but did have signs of aspiration today at the bedside with changes in vocal quality.
I discussed the risks of aspiration with the pt and his HCP and both agree they would like to continue with POs as opposed top placing a PEG tube.
I feel it will be safest if the pt takes nectar liquids and pureed solids during meals, but he can take thin liquids between meals to assist with hypernatremia.
He is at higher risk for aspiration of the thin liquids when taking solid food [**2-22**] residue from the solids.
Suggest pt continue on a diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed consistency solids.
Strict 1:1 supervision.
Between meals, pt can take thin liquids as tolerated, one sip at a time. "
