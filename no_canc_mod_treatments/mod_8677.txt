CTA OF THE CHEST  CLINICAL HISTORY: 75-year-old woman, status post descending aortic stent graft replacement with retroperitoneal hematoma and slowly dropping hematocrit.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were initially obtained through the chest and abdomen without contrast, followed by contrast-enhanced images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
The previously noted stent graft extending from the aortic arch into the proximal abdominal aorta is stable in appearance.
Midline surgical staples are again noted.
No significant change in appearance of the thoracic stent graft and previously noted endoleak.
