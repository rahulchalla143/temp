The patient was informed of these high-risk behaviors and accepted the liver.
The HBcAb of the donor was positive, and the patient has received HBIg per protocol with subsequent HBsAb titers > 500, and negative HBsAg.
Due to the level of her renal dysfunction, she required CVVHD during the transplant.
She remained in the ICU and while off renal replacement therapy, her BUN and creatinine continued to rise, however her urine output was approximately 1.5 liters daily.
The patient was noted to start having tonic-clonic seizures, Neuro was consulted, she was started on Keppra and received an additional hemodialysis treatment.
TSH was sent, result was 7.4 and levothyroxine was started.
A 10 Fr biliary stent was placed.
Famotidine was switched to [**Hospital1 **] protonix.
Levothyroxine was started.
She then underwent US guided drainage of subhepatic/paracentesis fluid drainage (2 liters of biliuous fluid)with placement of an 8 Fr drain.
Zosyn was started for infected bile collection.
Another 2 liters of bilious fluid drained out with patient becoming tachycardic.
Albumin 5%/500ml was administered with resolution of tachycardia.
She was prehydrated with IV bicarb fluid overnight prior to study.
On [**5-1**], repeat angiogram was done with successful stent placement.
Aspirin and Plavix were started for the stent.
Two units of PRBC were transfused with Hct increase to 27.
However, superinfection cannot be excluded.
On [**5-5**], CT guided placement of an 8 French drain was placed into the the right perihepatic collection.
No further fluid could be aspirated despite the drain being in satisfactory position, which raises the possibility of a loculated collection.
Drain continued to have thin, yellow colored drainage averaging 50 -150 ml daily.
On [**5-6**], Zosyn was discontinued and Cipro started for peritonitis prophylaxis.
Hepatitis B immune globulin was administered IM on [**5-6**] per protocol (postop day 21)as liver donor was HB core positive.
