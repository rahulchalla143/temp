The patient is status post left anterior descending interventions, i.e., repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the past, who was referred for a cardiac catheterization due to recurrent exertional chest pain.
He underwent an exercise treadmill test on [**2124-7-12**], which revealed that, after five minutes of exercise on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, he complained of shortness of breath, calf claudication, and had significant electrocardiogram changes.
He underwent a successful left anterior descending DCA as well as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting at that time.
Angiography at that time revealed re-stenosis of the previously-placed left anterior descending stent.
He underwent successful DCA as well as getting percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and brachytherapy of the left anterior descending stent at that time.
He was found to have a 90% restenosis of the left anterior descending stent, along with a 40% lesion distal to the stent margin.
He underwent repeat DCA, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending ostium.
He was referred for repeat catheterization and possible coronary artery bypass graft due to this problem, and was ultimately referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].
Coronary artery disease risk factor profile included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for depression, coronary artery disease status post multiple left anterior descending interventions outlined above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg once daily, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily at bedtime, Toprol XL 50 mg daily at bedtime, Glucophage 500 mg three times a day, folate 1 mg twice a day, Accupril 80 mg daily at bedtime, Celexa 20 mg once daily.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted and given pre-hydration and Mucomyst protocol.
He ultimately underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2125-11-8**] showing severe in-stent restenosis in the ostial left anterior descending stent, as well as moderate left circumflex and posterior descending artery disease, with low normal left ventricular ejection fraction, estimated to be 40 to 50%.
On [**2125-11-9**], the patient was brought to the operating room, where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3, including left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, as well as saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
He left the operating room with a right radial arterial line and a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter.
He had a mediastinal and left pleural tube as well.
His cardiopulmonary bypass time was 53 minutes, with an aortic cross-clamp time of 32 minutes.
He was started on lasix, Lopressor and aspirin.
His pacing wires were thereafter discontinued.
His dressings were taken down from his wounds.
He was continued on lasix 20 mg by mouth twice a day as well as Lopressor titrated to a dose of 25 mg by mouth twice a day.
He was working with Physical Therapy aggressively.
His preoperative medications were added back without any difficulty.
No drainage was noted.
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily 2.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth daily at bedtime, to be on hold, not to be started until after his lasix diuresis is completed 3.
Glucophage 500 mg by mouth three times a day 4.
Folate 1 mg by mouth twice a day 5.
Accupril 80 mg by mouth daily at bedtime, to be on hold until seen and evaluated by his primary care [**Provider Number 35338**].
Celexa 20 mg by mouth once daily 7.
Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice a day for five days, then stop and change to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily at bedtime 8.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily 9.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day 10.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed 11.
Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth three times a day as needed with food 12.
K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth twice a day for five days, stop after his lasix diuresis is completed  DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] in approximately three to four weeks, and see his primary care physician in one to two weeks so that his medications can be serially reviewed and his Accupril and hydrochlorothiazide be readdressed.
The patient is encouraged to take a diabetic, heart-healthy diet, to follow his finger sticks for glycemic control in the immediate postoperative time.
