Pt was recently hospitalized for an episode of unresponsiveness, work up essentially negative at that time, thought to be possibly due to sedating medications and discharged with increased dose of torsemide for her CHF.
However, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] note from [**2-20**], pt has not responded to 40 mg of torsemide, so increased to 40 AM/20 PM torsemide and did receive 1 dose of metolazone on [**2-16**].
Lisinopril was started and then stopped due to increase in creatinine.
[**Hospital1 **] called hospitalist here as they feel that the patient requires higher level of care and IV diuresis and the initial plan had been for admission to floor and discharged to advanced care.
While in [**Name (NI) **], pt refused treatment and became more hypoxic.
Her initial vitals in ED showed her satting 96 on 4L NC but eventually came down to 88% on 4L and pt refused to take IV diuretics till coming upstairs.
Pt also refusing foley but did finally receive IV torsemide in ED.
Pt states that her shortness of breath is stable, endorses orthopnea and interval improvement in her swelling, denies chest pain, PND, cough, fever/chills or abdominal pain.
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.

The cephalic and basilic veins are also compressible and fully patent, and PICC line is seen within the basilic vein.
[**2181-3-3**] CXR SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST REASON FOR EXAM: CHF, improved oxygen requirement after aggressive diuresis.
Pacer leads are in unchanged position, one in the right atrium, the second is probably in the right ventricle, though is in an unusual location more medial than expected.
Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91333**] is a 60 year old female w/ history of severe systolic heart failure s/p CABG ([**2172**]), STEMI (vein graft occlusion, LAD/[**Year (4 digits) 11641**] stenting [**2174**]) stents to LAD and [**Year (4 digits) 11641**] ([**2174**]), AICD placement, presents after hypoxic minimally-responsive episode at rehab, found to be grossly volume overloaded due to underdiuresis, improved after aggressive diuresis with lasix drip augmented with hemodialysis.
Noted recent admission for the same concern, during which time a work-up for arrhythmia, seizures, medication effect was without clear findings.
IV heparin started empirically when initial doppler US of extremities were difficult to definitely read as negative; patient subsequently had doppler US of all 4 extremities, reviewed carefully with radiology & read as negative--heparin discontinued.
Pt successfully weaned from oxygen after 15-20 kg volume removed by HD.
Pt had been discharged on increased dose of torsemide & continued on digoxin and carvedilol.
Transitioned to lasix drip, which successfully promoted diuresis of ~10 kg.
Transitioned to torsemide at 200 mg QD with metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone 25 mg daily.
She was discharged on the following medications for heart failure: torsemide at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone 25 mg daily, carvediolol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **], aspirin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, digoxin 0.0625 mg daily.
While she is on aggressive diuresis, please check chemistry panel daily starting on [**2181-3-23**] and dose her potassium chloride daily to maintain a potassium greater than 3.5.
Only 1 kidney visualized on renal ultrasound, no hx nephrectomy so likely congenital.
Ultimately patient required temporary HD as recommended by renal consult when her lasix diuresis waned & she developed somnolence/confusion/decreased appetite (considered possible symptomatic uremia vs med effect, see above).
RIJ temporary HD line placed by HD.
She was briefly treated with acetazolamide for low bicarbonate but this improved with improved creatinine clearance and she no longer needed the acetazolamide.
She was continued on calcium acetate tablets 667 TID.
# INTERMITTENT SOMNOLENCE & CONFUSION: TOXIC MEDICATION EFFECT Waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**] AOX2 (name, hospital, not date) and increased somnolence from [**Date range (1) 86279**].
Thus, her venlafaxine was decreased to 112.5 mg daily and buproprion to 100 mg daily.
Will need ongoing dressing changes/wound care per nursing recommendations (see page 1).
She was discharged on aspirin 325 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
Gabapentin was not restarted at discharge.
Initially continued home medications (buproprion, Venlafaxine XR) plus PRN qHS ativan, which helped her mood by helping her sleep.
We note that the patient previously had a therapist at home in [**Hospital1 189**] but has not seen anyone since first hospital admission in [**Month (only) 1096**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - needs follow-up appointment w/breast center, also for mammography and/or R breast ultrasound - needs psych/therapist after she gets to rehab - needs follow-up labs on [**2181-3-23**] and daily to check her potassium given multiple diuretics.
- needs close follow-up for diuresis, rehab shouldn't let her gain more than 3 lbs without calling cardiologist - may need to adjust doses of venlafaxine and buproprion once renal function improves, but recommend keeping gabapentin off given 2 admissions for "unresponsiveness" - still has PICC for blood draws given ongoing diuresis with 3 agents.
She should have this removed when her outpatient doctors think she [**Name5 (PTitle) **] not need frequent blood draws anymore or if it becomes painful or infected - she was not started on an ACE-inhibitor because her creatinine was still elevated on discharge to 2, this should be added in the future with nephrology input - Please check chemistry panel daily starting on [**2181-3-23**] and dose her potassium chloride daily to maintain a potassium greater than 3.5.
