He was intubated and required multiple blood transfusions and pressor support.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics given persistent hypotension.
He was evaluated by transplant surgery and eventually was extubated without difficulty.
He remained on the transplant list and plan was made for transplant but donor liver was ultimately not available.
He became increasingly tachypneic and required several large volume paracenteses to control respiratory symptoms - no evidence of SBP on any of his ascitic fluid.
He again developed hypotension requiring blood pressure support with Levophed and had to be removed from transplant list as was felt to be too clinically unstable to undergo transplant.
His antibiotics were broadened to cover HAP and fungal infections - vancomycin, cefepime and micafungin.
His MAP's remained low even with maximum dose Levophed and he required the addition of vasopressin and then dopamine and was only able to maintain MAP's in the 40-50's despite being on maximum doses of the 3 pressors.
In the next 12 hours, in spite of maximal pressor support and fluids, patient continued to have a severe metabolic acidosis thought to be from profound septic shock likely from a pulmonary source.
Pressor support was discontinued and the patient passed away approximately 25 minutes.
