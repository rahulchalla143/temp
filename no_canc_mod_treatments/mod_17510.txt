On [**2167-7-22**], the day of transfer to [**Hospital6 256**], the patient was still persistently spiking fevers, had an elevated white blood cell count with a bandemia, and became hypotensive despite IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, clindamycin and Levaquin.
His blood pressure dropped to 70 systolic, and he was given IV fluids and started on peripheral dopamine.
On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was no longer on the dopamine drip and was normotensive with blood pressure's in the 100's to 110's/60's to 70's.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.8 with 94 percent polys, 0 bands, 3 percent lymphs, hematocrit 35.3, platelets 201, INR 1.3, PTT 30.7, ESR 100, reticulocyte count 1.7, sodium 137, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, BUN 12, creatinine 0.7, ALT 64, AST 27, LDH 81, CK 153, alkaline phosphatase 127, amylase 12, total bilirubin 1.7, direct bilirubin 1.0, lipase 12, troponin-T less than 0.01, albumin 3.3, uric acid 3.0, haptoglobin 328, TSH 0.36, Lyme serology 160:[**2167**], negative.
GROIN ERYTHEMA AND SUBCUTANEOUS NODULES:  The patient's    groin erythema was clinically consistent with a    cellulitis.
Given the patient's possible allergy to    Ancef, he was continued on IV vancomycin and clindamycin.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and    did not require any further pressors.
The surgical service was consulted for biopsy of the left upper thigh lymph nodes, as the patient continued to spike fevers and had a persistently elevated white blood cell count despite vancomycin and clindamycin.
Given his extremely low risk for MRSA, and the fact that his cultures did not reveal any organisms, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to PO clindamycin.
MYALGIAS, ARTHRALGIAS AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN:  The patient    complained of bilateral shooting neuropathic-like pain,    migrating arthralgias, swelling in the fingers and toes,    and pleuritic chest pain.
Given the patient's exposure to    multiple insects and animals, there was initially concern    over tick-borne illnesses, including Lyme disease and    tularemia.
