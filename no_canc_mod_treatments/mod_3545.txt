The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**5-23**] and was given sublingual nitrogen x3 with a decrease in base to 5 from 10.
She received Lopressor, aspirin and 2 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.
The patient's pain was reproducible by palpation below the pacemaker placement site and with deep inspiration.
Status post pacer placement [**4-30**] for biventricular failure 2.
Allopurinol 100 once a day 2.
Colace 200 twice a day 3.

Swan placed and pressors were started.
It was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in the catheter lab and an emergent thoracotomy with pericardial drainage was performed by CT surgery.
On [**5-28**], the patient was progressing in the SICU, but developed rapid atrial fibrillation, so she was transferred to the CCU, started on amiodarone and the patient spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
On [**5-30**], the patient was extubated and creatinine gradually to trend up to 3.7 and that is high from 2.2 on admission.
On [**6-3**], the patient was unable to get sufficient fluid off despite Natrecor, Lasix and metolazone, so they tried to reduce afterload with Hydril and Isordil.
On [**6-6**], her creatinine peaked at 4.2 and they had to back off the Lasix due to renal failure.
On [**6-8**], hemodialysis was started but the patient's blood pressure could not tolerate such a procedure and significant fluid was not removed.
On [**6-14**], renal decided to retry hemodialysis which was successful.
On [**6-15**], a right subclavian tunneled catheter was placed by IR.
On [**6-16**], the patient was called out to the floor for placement and all central lines were pulled except for the hemodialysis tunneled catheter.
The patient needed one unit of packed red blood cells.
On [**6-21**], IR reevaluated the site, injected with thrombin and the site continued to ooze despite this.
They stopped Protonix and started to check labs for concern of a chronic DIC picture.
The patient was started on oxygen and beta blocker.
The patient could not tolerate aspirin at the time due to oozing around the catheter site.
On [**6-25**], pressure was held on the catheter site for 30 minutes and cryoglobulin, platelets and a unit of red cells were transfused.
Again later, another unit of cryoglobulin, packed red blood cells and bag of platelets were transfused.
On [**6-27**], the patient received hemodialysis and is ready for discharge to [**Hospital6 19682**].
