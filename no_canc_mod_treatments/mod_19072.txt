EKG demonstrated persistent ST elevations in the precordial leads with some decrease in magnitude of the elevation from prior EKG's, and with q-waves as well.
Patient received morphine PRN with resolution of his pain.
Repeat Echo the following morning demonstrated an apical LV aneurysm and patient was started on coumadin for prevention of thromboembolic disease.
He was then transferred to the floor where he received smoking cessation counseling, and physical therapy evaluation.

Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of a myocardial infarction (or heart attack).
A stent was placed in this blood [**Last Name (un) 12599**] to restore blood flow to your heart muscle.
The next day an echocardiogram of your heart was performed that showed your heart has a moderately decreased ability to pump blood and what is called an LV aneurysm.
Because of these findings you will need to take coumadin (a blood thinner) for 3 to 6 months and see an electrophysiologist in one month's time for evaluation of a possible cardiac defibrillator.
This medication should likely only be needed for the next 2-3 days while your coumadin dose takes effect.
This is a measure of how effective your coumadin dose is.
Your primary doctor will adjust your dose of coumadin on the basis of this lab result.
