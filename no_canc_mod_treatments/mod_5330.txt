MEDICATIONS:  The patient takes no medications at home.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: In the trauma bay upon evaluation, the patient was found to be somnolent with a degree of combativeness for which he was immediately intubated.
Cervical spine was nontender.
Cervical block, collar, and chest were clear.
For these injuries, the patient was started immediately on Solu-Medrol infusion per spinal injury protocol.
The patient was kept on strict C-spine logroll precautions and required pressor support to keep his systolics greater than 100.
Over the next few days, the patient's steroid drip was weaned off, and plans were made for neurosurgical open reduction and internal fixation stabilization of his cervical and thoracic spine.
On [**2180-1-2**], the patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to the Operating Room by the Neurosurgical Service where a C7 vertebrectomy was performed, a C6-T1 anterior arthrodesis infusion was performed along with ............... interbody titanium surgical .............. cage was placed which was packed with vertebral autograft.
The patient also received anterior screw with plate fixation.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.
The patient was transferred back to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated and was hemodynamically stable.
The patient underwent several bronchoscopic exams for removal of secretions and plugs.
A nasoenteric feeding tube was placed, and tube feeds were started with success.
On [**2180-1-7**], the patient was taken to the Interventional Radiology Suite where a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy feeding tube was placed.
The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.
Because of the multiple episodes of line sepsis and problems with central access for this patient, a PICC line was placed; however, the patient also had spiking fevers following this, and this PICC line was removed.
Following several attempts at weaning and failures requiring increased pressure support, on [**2180-1-11**], the patient underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy and bronchoscopy to verify placement.
He tolerated this procedure well without complication.
Following this, the patient's tube feeds were advanced by his percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube which he tolerated well.
The patient underwent speech and swallow study which revealed that his swallowing mechanism was intact.
Following this, all intravenous and intra-arterial catheters were discontinued in this patient, and all antibiotics were stopped.
He continued on tube feeds with a slow ventilator wean.
The patient also grew one blood culture of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis; however, this presumably was the only source of infection, so a course of Vancomycin was started and completed.
He began to slowly wean from the standpoint of his requirement for pressure support.
He was screened for placement and vent rehabilitation.
feeds were discontinued, and his tube feeds were resumed by his PEJ tube.
His vent support was at pressure support of 10, PEEP of 7.5, FIO2 50%.
He was in a cervical collar without spinal tenderness.
His PEJ tube site was clean, dry, and intact.
He is maintained on a peripheral IV only.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft 50 mg per PEJ tube q.d., Lovenox 40 mg subcue b.i.d., regular Insulin sliding scale, Zantac 150 mg per PEJ tube b.i.d., Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc p.o.
q.i.d., NPH Insulin 27 U subcue b.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg per PEJ tube q.4-6 hours p.r.n., Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs 4-6 puffs q.4 hours p.r.n., Lacrilube drops O.U.
p.r.n., Imodium per PEG tube p.r.n., the patient is receiving tube feeds Impact with fiber at 80 cc/hr at goal through his PEJ tube.
It should be noted that the anatomy of the patient's feeding tube is a percutaneous gastroduodenal jejunostomy tube.
