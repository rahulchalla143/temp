He was started on on tirofiban, heparin and aspirin, and plavix initally.
However, as this occurred in the context of chest compressions and shock, and the patients had negative MBs, tirofiban and heparin were discontinued.
He had serial EKGs while hypothermic which revealed resolution of initial t-wave inversions and normalization of his EKG.
After extubation, the patient developed a pneumonia, for which he was treated with bactrim.
After resolution of his pneumonia he had an ICD placed by EP.
He was started on a beta blocker and lisinopril.
He is being sent out on 2.5mg of lisinopril daily and should be titrated as tolerated.
# respiratory status: Patient was initially intubated during resuscitation for his Vfib arrest.
He was treated with bactrim for this, and remained afebrile once treatment began.
Bactrim may also cause hyperkalemia, and patient completed course of bactirm for pneumonia.
