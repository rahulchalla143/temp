HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, cirrhosis with ascites, and esophageal varices (esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2193-1-7**] showed grade 2 varices in the lower/middle esophagus which were nonbleeding with congestion/friability in the stomach consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy), intravenous drug abuse, and bipolar disorder who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3426**] for management of bleeding esophageal varices.
The patient was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells with a rise in his hematocrit to 28; which subsequently fell to 26.
The patient had increasing lethargy after Versed and had increased confusion.
The patient was treated with lactulose enemas and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for possible transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt evaluation.
Initially, the patient received an A-line, was started on dopamine, then Levophed, and Sandostatin.
A triple lumen catheter was placed.
The patient was given 3 units of packed red blood cells, a normal saline bolus of 500 cc, and started on a bicarbonate drip for severe acidemia with a blood gas showing a pH of 7.1, a PCO2 of 28, and PO2 of 383.
The patient's systolic blood pressure stabilized around 85 on Levophed/dopamine drip.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included lactulose 15 cc p.o.
b.i.d., Aldactone 300 mg p.o.
q.d., trazodone, lithium, Ambien, nadolol 20 mg p.o.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer included D-5 normal saline of 60 cc per hour, lactulose 45 cc q.4h., vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneous q.d.
times three days, Sandostatin at 100 mcg per hour.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature was 97, weight was 75 kg, blood pressure was 106/50 on 10 mcg of dopamine per minute with 5.3 mcg of Levophed, heart rate was 70 to 90, respiratory rate was 10 to 14 (with ventilator settings of AC/700/12X12/100/5, oxygen saturation was 91%.
He was intubated and sedated.
He was started on ceftriaxone initially.
Initial management was aimed at treating possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as supportive care for the other problems described.
On hospital day two, the patient's pressors were discontinued, and he was ultimately transfused 6 units of packed red blood cells.
He also received vitamin K and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.
He then became alcoholic secondary to the bicarbonate as well as ventilator settings; and ventilator adjustments were made as well as bicarbonate drip discontinued.
His INR improved to 1.7 from 2.7, but an additional 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were given.
His creatinine improved to 1.8 with intravenous fluids.
He received platelets for his thrombocytopenia.
The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and continued on previously prescribed ceftriaxone.
On hospital day four, nadolol was started for the patient's portal hypertension.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued as the gram-negative rods were found to be sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Vancomycin was started.
Tube feeds were started.
On hospital day seven, a paracentesis was done with 6.8 liters of fluid removed.
A 500-cc bolus was given without effect.
Foley irrigation was done, and approximately 50 cc of gross blood and clots were removed.
He received 12.5 g of albumin as well as normal saline, and a three way Foley catheter was inserted with continuous irrigation.
This procedure was without complaints, and the patient appeared stable that evening following the procedure.
Given the evidence of what appeared to be massive rebleeding of his esophageal varices, the patient was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Upon transfer back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient developed massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage; and despite pressors, fluid resuscitation, blood resuscitation, and octreotide, the patient was not able to be resuscitated.
