Preoperatively, Balancing blood pressure with volume overload was challenging, as diuresis limited by hypotension.
Prior to surgery he was placed on a lasix drip to attempt to remove some volume with modest success.
He had evidence of a resistant pseudomonal VAP sensitive to imipenim and cefepime from culture results from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 18**].
Treated with imipenem and then cefepime for total of 14d pseudomonal coverage.
Also treated MRSA given sensitivities of sputum culture from OSH (Was on bactrim [**2039-7-9**], vanc [**2044-7-14**]).
On [**2129-8-12**] he was taken tot he operating room where he underwent AVR with 21mm biocor valve.
His vasoactive drips were weaned to off by POD #4.
Post operatively the patient was seen by the GI service as he had intermittant guiac positive stool but no melana or [**Month/Year (2) **] bleeding, he was transfused w/PRBC's and PPI was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
