Today, you are ready to go home with your children and VNA (visiting nurses) will come to help with your care as you recover at home.
ADD a new blood pressure medication, Metoprolol Succinante 25mg daily, and stop an old one, Amlopidine, because Metoprolol better protects your heart after a heart attack.
