MRSA SCREENS: [**3-9**], [**3-13**], [**3-20**], [**3-27**] negative   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year-old man with a history including CAD, s/p CABG complicated by post-op a. fib for which coumadin was started, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and GI bleed secondary to a duodenal ulcer who initially presented to [**Hospital1 6685**] and [**Hospital3 **] Centers with headache and neck pain and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after he was found to have predominantely intraventricular hemorrhage (possibly caudate origin) and multiple ischemic strokes in the setting of anticoagulation reversal and medical cardioversion.
He was also noted to be in a.fib on [**3-6**] and was started on an amiodarone drip and converted back into sinus the morning of [**3-7**].
On [**3-9**]  aspirin 81 mg daily and a statin were initiated.
While the study showed insignificant stenosis on the left, the internal jugular line placement precluded visualization of the right internal carotid artery.
After a repeat CT on [**3-21**] was stable, Coumadin was started with an aspirin bridge.
Once the goal INR of 1.8-2.5 was achieved, the aspirin was discontinued.
The dose of coumadin at discharge was 5 mg by mouth daily; the INR was 2.3. .
Given the perceived potential for seizure, keppra 500 mg po bid was started.
RESPIRATORY/ID: The patient initially , remained intubated with difficulty weaning from the ventilator because of hypoxia.
He was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia, initially on vancomycin and zosyn, which was changed to levaquin once sensitivities returned as MSSA.
He was found to have RLL collapse, possibly secondary to mucous plugging although no clear source was found on bronchoscopy and the patient required re-intubation [**3-15**].
Due to his failed extubation, he underwent tracheotomy [**3-16**].
The patient completed a seven day course of levaquin for MSSA in the sputum.
He has continued to have low grade temperatures despite standing tylenol as well as a mild leukocytosis.
Vancomycin was added to levaquin on [**3-17**], as well as cefepime and flagyl on [**3-18**].
On [**3-21**], after multiple sets of cultures returned negative, the vancomycin, cefepime, levoquin and flagyl were discontinued, and he was just continued on vancomycin for the positive blood cultures.
A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was also done to determine the length of vancomycin treatment.
Based on the negative study, the team recommended vancomycin treatment be continued until [**2180-4-20**].
CVS: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on an amiodarone drip and is now on oral amiodarone.
He has been in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospitalization and was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and a statin as well as a beta blocker and ace-inhibitor.
An echocardiogram here was a limited study but notable for normal ejection fraction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and no evidence of ASD or PFO (was notable on TEE but not TTE prior to transfer).
On [**3-21**] he was noted to be mildly fluid overloaded, and was started on standing Lasix.
A PPI was initiated for GI prophylaxis.
Nutrition was provided via receiving tube feeds.
He underwent PEG placement [**3-16**].
To address the condition, a one liter fluid restriction was initiated.
As the sodium normalized, free water with tube feeds was gradually increased to address intravascular volume depletion.
The patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation at the recommendation of the physical and occupational therapy teams.

To overcome swallowing difficulties, a PEG tube was placed to administer nutrition.
When it was considered safe, anticoagulation was re-started to treat the atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 1.8 to 2.5. .
Accordingly, sodium should be monitoried and the fluid restriction adjusted accordingly.
* Please take all medications as prescribed.
