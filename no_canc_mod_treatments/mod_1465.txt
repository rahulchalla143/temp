[**2109-4-1**]: Portable CXR HISTORY: Central line placement.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
Left kidney measures 8.7 cm.
The bladder is collapsed about a Foley catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Pt presented with dyspnea and hypoxia; she was on Bipap and transitioned to NRB.
She was begun on CVVH on [**2109-4-2**] and diuresis was begun.
She continued on CVVH with levophed as needed for pressure support until [**2109-4-8**].
She was transferred to the regular floor and continued to receive hemodialysis until discharge.
She was discharged on her home regimen of metolazone, torsemide and spironalactone.
Permanent transiton to hemodialsis had been discussed with her in detail but she much preferred the option of an oral antidiuretic regimen which she committed to be compliant with.
# Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive to the 80s systolic in the OSH ED and she was started on levophed.
She continued requiring levophed for pressure support here in the ED and MICU and a central venous line was placed here in her right subclavian vein.
Her hematocrit did show a slight drop but blood loss and hypovolemia were not felt to be contributing to her hypotension.
Her hematocrit was monitored closely and she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells (one on [**2109-4-3**] and one on [**2109-4-4**]) with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit from 22.9 to 29.8.
She continued taking her home pantoprazole, and sub-cutaneous heparin was avoided in the setting of her GI bleed.
Creatinine began trending down as patient started on CVVH.
She was begun on CVVH on [**2109-4-2**] and diuresis was begun.
She continued on CVVH with levophed as needed for pressure support until [**2109-4-8**].
She was transferred to the regular floor and continued to receive hemodialysis until discharge.
She was discharged on her home regimen of metolazone, torsemide and spironalactone.
Permanent transiton to hemodialsis had been discussed with her in detail but she much preferred the option of an oral antidiuretic regimen which she committed to be compliant with.
Abdominal exam was benign and the patient was given zofran as needed.
Her home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension and she was not anticoagulated given her history of significant GI bleeding.
She did develop diarrhea with antibiotic treatment of her UTI that resolved when the antibiotics were stopped.
She continued taking her Asacol though had some difficulties tolerating the medication without vomiting due to the size of the pill.
