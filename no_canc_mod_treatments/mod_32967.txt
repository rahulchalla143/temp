A small brachial artery required cutdown initially for access and was repaired using interrupted Prolene sutures without difficulty.
[**2112-5-22**] CXR, portable: There is no significant change in the right PICC line, pacemaker, sternal wires and mediastinal clips, small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, and mild interstitial edema similar in appearance compared to the prior study.
[**2112-5-23**] KUB: Stents are seen in the upper abdomen, likely in the celiac and SMA.
Her INR was elevated and she was given FFP with plans for EGD/Colonoscopy to further evaluate her symptoms.
Her INR was still therapeutic and this procedure was deferred.
On [**2112-5-12**], patient became hypoxic and tachypneic likely secondary to volume overload; she was given lasix and transferred to the MICU.
Then she was taken to the OR by the [**Date Range 1106**] team and had a brachial artery exposure and repair with celiac artery stent x1 and superior mesenteric stent x2 placed.
She was later transferred to the VICU on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 and given gentle hydration.
On HD9/POD5, [**2112-5-17**], patient was advanced to regular diet which she initially tolerated with improved abdominal distension.
She had an episode of SOB; Lasix and spironolactone was restarted.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix and improved.
The EGD and colonoscopy were planned given her continued symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, however these were deferred given her tenuous respiratory status and inability to lie flat.

Atrial Fibrilation: Coumadin was initially held for planned EGD/Colonoscopy.
She was discharged on Coumadin 4mg PO qday with a Lovenox bridge until INR is therapeutic.
She should have INR checked in 2 days and Coumadin dose adjusted if elevated.
Lovenox should be stopped when INR is > 2.0.
