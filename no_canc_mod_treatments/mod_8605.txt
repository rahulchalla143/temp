While in the OSH ED, he developed [**11-22**] left-sided chest pain different from intial chest pain that resolved with NTG and morphine.
Prior to catheterization, however, the patient had VF arrest on [**11-10**] with ROSC after defibrillation x2, CPR, calcium, and amiodarone.
At that point, the patient was started on heparin gtt, integrillin gtt, and taken to cardiac catheterization.
CT surgery was consulted for possible CABG, which the family deferred pending transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and repeat cardiac catheterization.
Family History: HTN in mother, died of MI at 49; , polycythemia in father (may have been related to benzine exposure in shoe industry), died of  stroke at 72; sister with CAD.
The OM branch (was treated with POBA in [**4-21**]) was also diffusely and severely diseased throughout.
Heparin was commenced prophylactically.
The patient also was receiving NTG gtt and the IABP was set on 1:1 with augmented BP of 140 mmHg and mean of 65 mmHg.
The proximal LCX stent was predilated with a 2.5x12 mm Quantum Maverick RX at 12 ATM x2 followed by deployment of a 2.5x15 mm Promus RX DES at 12 ATm, postdilated with a 2.75x8 mm Quantum Maverick balloon at 22 ATM.
