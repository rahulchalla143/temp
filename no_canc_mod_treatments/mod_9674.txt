Second surgical intervention required a prolonged hospitalization, complicated by a gangrenous gallbladder.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was reluctant to undergo another surgical procedure but was ultimately referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for surgical repair of the aneurysm.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post thoracic aneurysm repair in [**2115**] and [**2121**].
Status post cholecystectomy in [**2121**], secondary to gangrenous gallbladder postoperatively.
Status post shoulder surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Actonel 5 mg q. a.m.  Menest 0.625 mg p.o.
q. a.m.  Protonic 40 mg p.o.
q. a.m.  Desipramine 50 mg p.o.
Propanolol 40 mg q. a.m., q. noontime, q h.s.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
Pen VK 500 mg q h.s.
Calcium with Vitamin D, 600 mg three times a day.
Percocet two tablets every three hours prn.
Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2132-6-5**] where she underwent a thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with a gel-weave graft by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Neo-Synephrine, Dopamine and Propofol drip.
She also had a spinal catheter in place at that time.
Over the first few days postoperatively, the patient was ultimately weaned off her neo-synephrine drip.
She was prophylactically placed on Vancomycin for antibiotic coverage.
She was placed on Dopamine drip.
She remained on full ventilator support.
She had been started on Vancomycin as previously stated and was placed on Zosyn at the time the gram negative rods were discovered.
On postoperative day number four, the patient had some rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with intravenous Amiodarone.
The patient remained sedated on the ventilator and was noted to be severely agitated everytime any sedation was weaned.
She had been weaned off of neo-synephrine at that time.
On postoperative day number six, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
The following day, the patient received a left pleural chest tube for pleural effusion.
She was begun on tube feeds.
The patient had been started on inotropic support due to her decreased hemodynamic status as well as her decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.
She was maintained on inotropes and pressors over the next few days.
Over the next few days, the patient tolerated slow pressor support wean.
The following day, she was being maintained on tube feeds at a goal rate.
She was on some Haldol for agitation.
She was placed also on intravenous Fluconazole prophylactically because she was developing a thrush in her mouth and also continued with significant endotracheal tube secretions.
The following day, a repeat echocardiogram showed significant improvement in the left ventricular function, compared with her previous echocardiogram.
It was the recommendation of the speech and swallowing service to maintain npo status and begin tube feeds.
The [**6-22**], Ciprofloxacin was added to the patient's antibiotic regimen, due to pseudomonas now obtained from her sputum, in order to double cover, as she was continued with increased secretions.
Therefore, her heparin was discontinued.
Anticoagulation was discontinued at that time.
On [**6-25**], due to continued need for ventilatory support, as well as nutritional supplementation, the patient went to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] where she underwent a tracheostomy as well as gastrostomy tube placement.
Please see operative report for details of surgical procedure.
She had been placed on Meropenem as well as Tobramycin.
She was continued on her antibiotic coverage for her resistant pseudomonas and was continued to improve from a ventilatory standpoint.
Her ventilator was weaned off during the day for a number of days and she was placed on ventilator support overnight to rest her and ultimately, she was weaned to a tracheostomy mask on postoperative day number 31, [**7-5**].
The patient also was noted to have a dehiscence of her small abdominal wound for the gastric tube placement.
There was no sign of infection or drainage at that time and the wound was just managed with sterile dressing changes.
A PICC line was placed for further intravenous access.
Due to a presumed chemical pancreatitis, her tube feeds were discontinued and she was placed on TPN via her PICC line.
Tube feeds were resumed on the [**7-8**], due to a decreasing amylase and absence of abdominal symptoms.
On [**7-9**], postoperative day number 35, the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor where she was begun with cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy evaluation.
Over the next few days, the patient's amylase, while it remained elevated at 174, pretty consistently for three days, she had no abdominal complaints of pain, no nausea, was tolerating her tube feeds at goal rate.
She had remained off the ventilator now for approximately one week, tolerating her tracheostomy collar with cool mist humidified oxygen, requiring tracheostomy suctioning approximately twice a day due to secretions.
The patient has remained stable and is ready to be discharged from the hospital to rehabilitation facility, to undergo increased physical therapy to increase her mobility and exercise tolerance as well as increased oral intake and ultimate weaning from her tube feed over the next few weeks.

A sliding scale should be as follows:  Blood glucose of 120 to 150 equal to three units subcutaneously; 150 to 200 equal to six units subcutaneously and 200 to 300 should equal nine units subcutaneously.
The patient's diet order should be full strength Promote with 560 mls per hour via her feeding tube; however, she is tolerating full regular diet by mouth as well and she should be followed for caloric intake observations and her tube feeds should be decreased according to her p.o.
The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1290**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**], cardiac surgeon for follow-up postoperative check-up on discharge from rehabilitation facility.
She should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] surgeon at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] for follow-up of down sizing and removal of tracheostomy as well as ultimate removal of the gastrostomy tube.
