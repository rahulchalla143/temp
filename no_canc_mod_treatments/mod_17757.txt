Multiple metal staples are seen in the right frontal scalp, at the site of the former bolt insertion.
In the Emergency Department, he was made NPO and intubated, intensive fluid rescusitation was initiated, a foley catheter was placed, initially started on Levophed and Neomycin in ED changed to Neo and Vassopressin for pressure support, lines placed, and started on empiric IV Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Patient takes coumadin at home for history of atrial fibrillation, arriving with INR 2.9.

He had experienced respiratory alkalosis on [**2180-12-12**], which compensated with metabolic acidosis CRRT fluid changed to BB32.
The patient underwent a swallow evaluation, and was started on a renal diet on [**12-18**]/201, which he tolerated.
It is expected that hemodialysis will be a temporary intervention, and that recovery to baseline can be expected.
The PTBD was capped on [**2180-12-20**], which was well tolerated without abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or fever.
Changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl.
Then changed to Unasyn alone to treat the S. bovis, clostridium, and the bacteroides in the bile culture.
Endocrine: Given his acute renal failure, home Metformin was stopped, and the patient was placed on an insulin regimen.
At the time of discharge, the patient was receiving Lantus 20units QHS plus sliding scale insulin with good glycemic control.
Other units were given prior to invasive procedures, such as tunneled HD catheter placement.
He received 1 unit PRBCs on [**2180-12-18**] for a HCT 23.0/HGB 7.4 during CVVH.
