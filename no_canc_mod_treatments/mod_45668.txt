She was therefore started back on a daily dose of Lasix at 10 mg p.o.
PULMONARY:  Over the last few hospital days, after persistent questioning of the patient by various staff members regarding any residual shortness of breath, the patient finally admitted to some shortness of breath which did not completely resolve after removal of the pigtail catheter from the pericardial space.
It was therefore determined to perform a thoracentesis for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
Proper consent was obtained from the patient's daughter (as a translator for the patient), and a right-sided thoracentesis was performed with removal of approximately 700 cc to 800 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
Therefore, a Pulmonary consultation was obtained, who suggested that given the patient's equivocal answers she might benefit from thoracentesis of her left-sided pleural effusion as well.
Therefore, consent was once again obtained (via the patient's daughter as translator), and a left-sided thoracentesis was performed with removal of approximately 500 cc of serosanguineous fluid without any complication.
She was therefore discharged to rehabilitation on [**1-12**] and was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 274**] in clinic as needed.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Additional medications at the time of discharge included Lasix 10 mg p.o.
