Electronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2170-11-6**] 17:35   Brief Hospital Course: Following catheterization Mr. [**Known lastname 87027**] was referred for a coronary artery bypass grafting.
He weaned from bypass on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol infusions.
He was diuresed towards his preoperative weight and beta blockade begun.
He failed voiding trial on two occasions and, therefore, an indwelling catheter was left.
Tamsulosin was begun and arrangements were made for urologic follow up.
Another voiding trial in the day or so after discharge would be appropriate as he has been on tamsulosin for several days and is more mobile.
While beta blocker doses were decreased, they were not stopped as he was slightly tachycardic and his systolic blood pressure is mostly is in the 110-120s.
Arrangements were made for follow up and medications are as noted.
Plavix was given due to poor bypass targets.
