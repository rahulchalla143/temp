Worsening growth restriction and decreasd amniotic fluid volume for twin #2 eventually led to c-section delivery.
The baby was admitted with the diagnoses of symmetric intrauterine growth restriction,, prematurity, 2 vessel umbilical cord and amniotic band syndrome of the left foot.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY: The patient was stable in room air at birth and never required oxygen supplementation.
The congestion has persisted to the time of discharge, although it has not appeared to affect work of breathing or feeding ability, and may have improved somewhat after treatment for reflux was initiated (see below).
The infant was treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity from day of life 3 to day of life 19.
Periodic desaturations and spells were noted subsequently, mostly related to feeds.
The infant was prepared for discharge on [**12-5**], when in the context of having received 2 month immunizations and having a low-grade fever, infant had several desaturation and bradycardic spells while at rest.
ECHOs performed over first 2 weeks of life secondary to murmur revealed a PDA that subsequently closed without treatment and a secundum ASD.
Hematology and cardiology were consulted, and as the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] was remaining stable, no treatment was initiated.
Of note, ECHO on [**11-28**] did also show a small PDA with high-velocity L to R flow; the PDA had been closed on several earlier ECHOs.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The infant was initially maintained on IVF and IV nutrition, with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 4.
With adequate weight gain, calories were decreased, and by the time of discharge, the infant is taking Enfamil 28 calories/oz formula on an ad lib PO basis, taking approximately 150 cc/kg/day.
During the hospitalization, clinical concerns for reflux became evident, and infant was begun on zantac 2 mg/kg q8 hrs with improvement.
Given that the thrombus was likely line associated, an evaluation for pro-thrombotic disorders was not undertaken.
Infant did not receive any transfusions, and is being discharged on iron supplementation.
The patient had a maximum bilirubin of 7.2 and 0.3 and she received phototherapy from day of life 2 to 10.
Due to the elevated blood pressures noted over the last several weeks of hospitalization, renal evaluation was undertaken including urinalysis, BUN/Cr measurement, and repeat renal ultrasound.
By the time of discharge, blood pressures were stable at approximately 90/40-50; infant never required treatment for hypertension.
The infant did undergo eye examinations, with immature retinas in zone III seen on [**10-16**], and mature retinas without ROP seen on [**10-30**].
Ferrous sulfate 25 mg/mL 0.5 mL po qd.
Zantac 2 mg per kilo per dose given q 8 hours.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  Hepatitis B vaccine [**11-6**].
On [**12-4**] Pediarix and hemophilus influenza B, Prevnar on [**12-5**] and Synagis on [**12-4**].
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED: 1.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from     [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the     following 3 criteria: 1) Born at less at 32 weeks, 2)     born at between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following:     Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,     neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age     siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the     fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
Intrauterine growth restriction, symmetric.
