The patient was found subsequently to rule in for an acute myocardial infarction with troponin I levels peaking at greater than 50.
The patient subsequently underwent CABG times five on [**2121-9-26**], LIMA to the LAD, and saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal, diagonal, PLE, and PDA.
The patient tolerated the operation well.
Postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated initially by respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, initially thought to be secondary to upper-airway edema.
The patient's chest tubes and pacing wires were removed earlier in the patient's postoperative course.
However, he continued to have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
The [**Last Name (un) 616**] Diabetes Service was consulted for the patient's diabetes management and he required Insulin drip intermittently throughout his hospital course.
The patient then underwent bronchoscopy, which showed very few thick secretions in the proximal airways, but, otherwise, completely clean airways; BAL was sent for cytology and microbiology.
The patient, at that time, was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Imipenem and Levaquin.
As the patient's LFTs worsened, he became somewhat coagulopathic and manifested an upper GI bled with bloody NG-tube drainage, requiring transfusion of several units of packed red cells.
The patient's coagulopathy was corrected with vitamin K and FFP initially.
The patient also had periods of hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine drip.
However, the patient never required hemodialysis during the hospital course.
Multiple sets of cultures were sent including cultures from previous bronchoscopy, blood cultures, and urine cultures.
After all these cultures came back negative, the patient's broad- spectrum antibiotic coverage was stopped.
General Surgery was consulted and a cholecystostomy tube was placed by Interventional Radiology.
On [**2121-10-2**], cultures from bile obtained from the cholecystostomy tube were negative.
During the remainder of the patient's protracted hospital course, he essentially received supportive care, again, never requiring hemodialysis, requiring mechanical ventilation.
The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG placement on [**2121-10-13**].
Tube feeds were continued twenty-four hours after PEG placement.
The patient essentially underwent a very slow CPAP wean over the next two weeks.
The patient was started on Vancomycin to treat the MRSA pneumonia for a 14-day course.
The patient was screened for rehabilitation and was accepted on [**2121-10-30**].

Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease status post CABG times five, complicated by multi-organ system dysfunction with acute renal failure, ARDS and acute hepatic failure.
The patient is also status post tracheostomy and PEG and bronchoscopy times three.
