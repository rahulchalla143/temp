Admission Date:  [**2170-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-21**] Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-22**], impella supported with drug eluting stents placed to left main and LAD PICC placement [**2170-6-23**] Right Femoral Dialysis Catheter placement [**2170-6-25**]     History of Present Illness: 82-year-old woman post NSTEMI (infero-lateral ST dep and TWI TnT 6.41 presenting as CHF post L THR on [**2170-2-12**] and at angiography there was evidence of two vessel coronary artery disease including a 90% proximal stenosis and a 30% mid-vessel stenosis and occluded RCA.
Following her operation, she had a period of rehabilitation and was back to her baseline by [**2170-5-8**] at which point she was able to walk 50ft with a cane.
She initially was on 40mg od of furosemide which was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and latterly metolazone was added.
Due to her symptoms, she presented for a repeat echocardiogram on [**6-19**] which showed significant worsening of cardiac function, an EF of 15%, significant AS, and moderate to severe MR. She was admitted for repeat coronary angiography.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Current teacher of science and art to pre-school children.
Recently limited by SOB using 1 cane post hip surgery, and limited to 3ft.
Cranial nerves II-XII intact no fundoscopy performed but fields normal.
[**Year (4 digits) **] [**2170-6-23**]: LVEF 20%, moderate 2+ MR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2170-6-25**]: RV systolic function appear slightly worse, LEVF 25%, 3+ MR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2170-6-27**]: RV function appears slightly improved and estimated pulmonary artery pressure is lower.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F s/p NSTEMI [**2-/2170**] with stent to LAD who presented with worsening CHF, echo demonstrated significant worsening in LV function (LVEF 15%, most recent EF=20-25% [**6-27**]) and MR, s/p cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-21**] which revealed in-stent restenosis of proximal LAD and worsened atherosclerotic disease of left main stem.
She developed left limb ischemia likely secondary to contrast nephropathy in addition to hypotension and her condition progressivly deteriorated and she died on [**2170-6-30**] after being made for comfort measures only on [**6-29**].
Echo on day of admission revealed diminished LVEF for 15% and moderate 3+ MR.  Cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] revealed 90% instent restenosis of the LAD stent as well as left main disease, and the patient underwent impella-supported PCI on [**2170-6-22**] with stenting of left main.
She was electively intubated for the procedure following an episode of hypoxia the night of [**2170-6-21**] in which she temporarily required a non-rebreather and CPAP to maintain O2 sats.
The patient had a PICC line placed and was briefly started on dopamine, however she did not torelate this and it was discontinued.
She started to recieve blood pressure support with Norepinephrine which she initially tolerated well and at highr levels was associated with increasingly [**Month/Day/Year **] appearance of her left [**Last Name (un) 5355**] and she was eventually weaned off only to be restarted on the morning of [**6-29**].
Patient remained on oxygen via nasal cannula 3-4L, and maintained her O2 sats on this.
She started heparin gtt ([**6-28**]) for both for her cardiac hypokinesis and any potential arterial embolism of her left leg after her INR decreased to subtherapeutic levels.
On [**6-29**] after discussion with her family, she was made for comfort measures only and an echo on [**6-29**] revealed a significantly decreased LVEF of only 10-15%, in addition to worse RV systolic function.
There was a question of whether her LAD stent had thrombosed, given significant worsening of LV function (EF 30-35% in [**2170-2-19**] to EF of 15% on admission [**6-19**]).
The patient underwent a cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] to evaluate her coronary arteries, which revealed 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD, worsened atheresclerotic disease of the left main (ostial 70% left main lesion), and complete occlusion of the RCA with the distal RCA perfused via collaterals.
The patient did not wish for surgical intervention, and then underwent an impella-supported PCI with stenting of the left main stem on [**2170-6-22**].
She was electively intubated for the procedure after a brief episode of hypoxia the night prior to the cath.
After the interventional catherization her asprin, plavix was continued.
She recieved simvastatin which was discontinued [**6-28**] given increasing LFTs.
Metoprolol held given her hypotension.
She was placed on heaprin drip after her INR became subtherapeutic on [**6-28**].
Resipratory status greatly improved with removal of fluid by dialysis but she remained anuric and was initially due to have a permanent dialysis catheter placed but was too unstable to go for the procedure so CVVH was continued with her femoral dialysis line.
She developed progressive cardiovascular instability and she required furtehr inotropic support.
She was made for comfort measures only on [**6-29**] and died on [**6-30**].
# Hypotension - BP was hypotensive on admission, likely multifactorial and secondary to diuresis, anti-hypertensives and poor CO.  SBP range generally 70s-90s with several SBP readings as low as 60s following administration of IV metoprolol which was held on most of the admission.
Norepinephrine was used intermittengly for blood pressure support and she was able initially to be weaned off this post-catheterisation however due to persistent severe hypotension on [**6-29**] this was restarted.
She was made for comfort measures only on [**6-29**] and died [**6-30**].
# Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on her home simvastatin until [**2170-6-28**], when it was stopped in setting of rising LFTs and elevated CK.
She was reviewed daily by vascular who felt no acute intervention was needed but recommended a heparin infusion which was commenced on [**6-28**].
Leg appearance initially improved with weaning norepinephine and using bear-hugger to warm extremities however worsened with decreasing SBPs.
She also had considerable [**Month/Year (2) **] limb pain requiring increasing levels of IV hydromorphoen with associated sedation.
CK levels were trended in case of compartment syndrome following re-perfusion injury but generally decreased.
By [**6-29**], both legs appeared [**Month/Year (2) **], worse on the left with on pulses present on doppler and greatly decreased capillary refill worsening with falling BP.
She was made for comfort measures only on [**6-29**] and died on [**6-30**].
We discontinued her statin and restarted tylenol only after increasing lower extremity pain.
Patient started on amiodarone infusion on [**6-28**].
We held Metoprolol given her hypotension.
Possibly caused by prolonged usage of facial oxygen mask and NC which can dry the mucous membranes.
However, given decline in hemodynamic stability, we monitored closely for signs of infection/sepsis.
Patient's code status changed to comfort measures only earlier today, and she has been on morphine gtt titrated to patient's comfort.
Patient expired with husband at beside, daughter and son in waiting room.
