Admission Date:  [**2143-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-12-11**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 87 year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure and a known EF of 20%.
She had been taking increasing doses of Ibuprofen as frequently as 400 mg every four hours.
She was given 5 mg of subcutaneous vitamin K and gentle hydration and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2-/2143**], status post catheterization with three vessel disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent to the right coronary artery.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post an AICD placement currently on Amiodarone.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on oxygen at home.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had her INR reversed with vitamin K and bolus with intravenous fluids as needed.
She eventually went for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy that was without evidence for a clear bleeding source, although the gastrointestinal service felt that an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was the most likely etiology of her blood loss.
She was treated with proton pump inhibitor and transfused as needed to keep over 30 without recurrence of bleeding.
The patient continued to have atrial fibrillation and was reloaded on her Coumadin prior to discharge.
The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction during her Intensive Care Unit stay and was presumed to be secondary to the strain of aggressive fluid and her known congestive heart failure.
She was treated medically with a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor was started.
Aspirin was held throughout, because the process was not thought to be a plaque rupture and there was more concern for her bleeding then for a plaque rupture.
