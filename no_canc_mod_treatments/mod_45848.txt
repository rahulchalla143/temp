He was tried on many different brands of tube feeds.
At various times, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was able to tolerate these tube feeds.
However, he often suffered from high residuals and the tube feeds were often held.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was on and off of TPN at various points during his hospital stay.
He was restarted on TPN permanently on [**5-21**].
Tube feeds were not administered after this time.
During the time when he was tolerating tube feeds by NG, placement of a PEG was considered.
However, PEG placement was not possible secondary to Mr. [**Known lastname 7522**] ascites.
They both felt that a PEG placement would be not advisable when ascites was present as it would prevent healing of the tract.
Given Mr. [**Known lastname 7522**] sporadic tolerance of tube feeds, as well as the inability for rehabilitation facility to accept him with an NG in place, it was decided that the best way to feed Mr. [**Known lastname **] would be via TPN.
This responded fairly well to Spironolactone and Lasix.
However, the spironolactone was not able to be administered once Mr. [**Known lastname 7522**] NG tube was removed.
Therefore, he remained on Lasix alone.
