[**2202-4-14**] Redo Sternotomy, Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm CE Pericardial Valve), and Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(vein graft to left anterior descending).
[**2202-4-7**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2916**] is a 86 year old woman with severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.6cm, peak gradient 66mmHg) and coronary artery disease s/p CABG and recent DES to RCA, LCx w/ 80% stenosis-unable to intervene who presented with right-sided chest pressure, which is her typical anginal equivalent.
Past Medical History: # Coronary Artery Disease s/p 2V CABG [**2198**](SVG to LAD, SVG to Ramus), History of STEMI [**12/2198**], s/p PCI of Left Main [**12/2198**], s/p PCI/DES to RCA and LCX in [**2-/2202**] # Aortic Stenosis/Insufficiency # Atrial Fibrillation, with history of tachy-brady, s/p PPM Placement # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Mild Mitral Regurgitation # Breast Ca s/p Bilateral Mastectomies approx [**2159**], and [**2172**], XRT # Rectal Cancer s/p LAR in [**2192**] # Radiation induced L axillary sarcoma, s/p XRT and resection [**2199**] # OA # Osteoporosis # History of colon polyps- adenomas, last screened [**2200**] # s/p Right THR # s/p spinal fusion # History HIT # Acute cholecystitis s/p Lap Chol [**11/2199**]   Social History: Widowed, lives indepently in [**Location (un) **].
Pacer site- dressing c/d/e, no hematoma Abd: soft, moderately distended, with reproducible epigastric pain EXT: R arm 1+ pitting edema, LE with 2+ pitting edema above knees.
[**2202-4-13**] Carotid Ultrasound: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Post Bypass - A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5 mmHg, peak 11 mmHg).
She continued on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
She experienced increasing dyspnea and oxygen requirements which prompted transfer to the CCU for initiation of Lasix drip and CPAP.
Cardiac surgery was therefore consulted for redo aortic valve replacment surgery.
Of note, preop HIT assays were negative for PF4 Heparin antibodies.
On [**4-14**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed redo sternotomy, aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
She required significant pressor support and multiple blood products.
She also required re-exploration on postoperative day zero.
Due to a prolonged critical condition and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, tube feedings were initiated.
She was unresponsive to Natrecor and Lasix drip.
Due to eventual mechanical problems with CVVH, hemodialysis was temporarily required.
She gradually transitioned back to Lasix drip with adequate response, and dialysis was no longer required.
From a cardiac standpoint, she maintained stable hemodynamics and eventually weaned from inotropic support.
Despite some improvement in renal function, she continued to remain ventilator dependent.
A right sided chest tube was placed on [**4-25**] for worsening right pleural effusion.
The Thoracic service was therefore consulted and performed open tracheostomy and placement of PEG tube on [**4-28**] without complication.
Following placement of tracheostomy, she went on to develop worsening lethargy, altered mental status, and a rising BUN.
She was transfused with PRBCs to maintain hematocrit near 30% and all narcotics were discontinued.
Rectal tube was placed for persistent dark liquid stools.
A morphine drip was initiated and the ventilator was withdrawn after discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
