He was treated with supplemental oxygen, Lasix, aspirin, nitroglycerin, Morphine, heparin.
Sodium 141; potassium of 3.3; chloride 104; bicarbonate 21; BUN 23; creatinine 1.2; glucose 183.
Cardiac output:  Initial was 3.33; post intervention was 3.35.
Post intervention was 1.73.
Coronary angiography:  Right dominant, LMCA normal; Left anterior descending 100% total occlusion; proximal origin T1; also occluded apical left anterior descending, fills via faint right to left collaterals intermedius.
Right coronary artery:  Large ectatic vessel, 40% proximal stenosis with common 90% large PL branch.
Interventional details:  The patient had a 42 cc intra-aortic balloon pump placed prophylactically in the left femoral artery.
Final angiography demonstrated 0% residual stent type but pruned appearance distal to the left anterior descending, beyond D-2, consistent with extensive previous infarction.
Temporary pacer was placed with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the left anterior descending using Hepikote stent and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stent to the right PL branch, using a Zeta stent.
The patient was then placed on Plavix and Integrilin for 18 hours and transferred to the CCU for continued management.
Occlusive pressure was applied for about 20 minutes and Integrilin and heparin were held.
Interventional fellow was notified and the patient was given .6 of Atropine and Dopamine.
Vascular surgery and radiology were consulted.
The patient was stabilized off pressors and inotropes and was continued to monitor serial hematocrits q. four hours.
The patient was restarted on Integrilin once the patient was stabilized.
The patient was continued on his aspirin, Plavix, Atorvastatin, titration of Metoprolol and Captopril was done and then subsequently changed over to once a day dosing prior to discharge.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on the fourth day of admission to the CCU without any complications.
The patient was started on Coumadin once the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on the fourth night of admission.
The patient was taught how to self administer Lovenox injections and was given appointments to see his primary care physician doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53425**], for follow-up and INR monitoring.
Vascular surgery followed up until discharge, noting that it was stable and no surgical intervention was needed at this time.
Pulmonary:  The patient was given nebulizers prn, supplemental oxygen as needed.
Prophylaxis:  Intravenous heparin and Protonix, then bridged with Coumadin and changed over to Lovenox.
Status post percutaneous coronary intervention.
Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
