On [**2198-3-26**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for progressive exertional angina.
The cardiac catheterization on [**2198-3-26**], showed one vessel disease and the patient underwent successful stenting of his left anterior descending coronary artery/diagonal two bifurcation using the crush technique.
The patient does have a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed felt secondary to hemorrhoids based on past colonoscopy and subsequently developed a hematocrit drop, reportedly from 34.0 to 26.0 while on Aspirin and Plavix.
His primary care physician discontinued his Aspirin and Plavix given the concern for the lower gastrointestinal bleeding on [**2198-4-11**].
He was treated with Lidocaine, Heparin drip, Aspirin, Aggrastat, Dopamine and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for more urgent cardiac care.
The patient underwent successful Rheolytic treatment and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
The patient had an intraaortic balloon pump placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and was transferred to the Cardiac ICU for further monitoring.
Status post bilateral knee surgery.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Terazosin 2 mg q.h.s.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
In general, the patient was intubated, somewhat somnolent but responsive to his sons, following commands on occasions.
He had a left internal jugular central line which was clean, dry and intact.
Right groin catheter and sheath site were clean, dry and intact with minimal oozing and no palpable hematoma.
LABORATORY DATA:  On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, his intraaortic balloon pump was at 1:1.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2198-4-16**], showed thrombotic occlusion at the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent, treated with Rheolytic treatment, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 20 percent residual disease at the left anterior descending coronary artery stent, 40 percent at the diagonal origin.
Chem7 showed sodium of 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 28, creatinine 1.6, glucose 157.
Albumin 3.3, total bilirubin 0.3, alkaline phosphatase 109.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 88 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from outside hospital status post acute anterolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction complicated by several episodes of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest and was found on emergent cardiac catheterization here to have restenosis of his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent which was successfully opened with Rheolytic and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapy requiring intraaortic balloon pump postprocedure.
He was continued on Aggrastat 24 hour postprocedure.
He will require Plavix therapy for nine months post left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis.
He will need to continue Aspirin indefinitely.
Post cardiac catheterization, the patient was continued on Heparin therapy.
Post cardiac catheterization, the patient require intraaortic balloon pump to maintain cardiac output.
In addition, he was requiring Dopamine for blood pressure support.
The patient's Dopamine was weaned down over the next several days.
His intraaortic balloon pump was discontinued on [**2198-4-18**].
He had mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall, apex, distal and inferior wall hypokinesis as well.
The team discussed with the patient's family the risks and benefits of anticoagulation given his history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
The team explained that Aspirin and Plavix were clearly indicated, however, Coumadin was somewhat controversial.
Even with it being controversial, the team did feel that he would possibly benefit from Coumadin over the long term and felt that a trial of Coumadin in the controlled setting of the hospital would be beneficial for the patient.
The patient was noted to have guaiac positive stool after initiating Coumadin and gastroenterology was consulted for further workup.
At this point, the patient's Coumadin was discontinued, however, he was continued on Aspirin and Plavix.
In addition in the setting of recent myocardial infarction, the patient was initiated on higher dose of Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
He should have his liver function tests reevaluated four weeks after initiating this medication on [**2198-4-16**].
The patient continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital stay which seemed to be best controlled with intravenous Amiodarone.
An attempt was made to transition the patient from intravenous Amiodarone after significant loading to p.o.
The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation was treated with Metoprolol intravenously at 2.5 mg increments.
In addition, his sinus pauses were up to five seconds when the atrial fibrillation was treated with intravenous Metoprolol.
Therefore, the patient was restarted on intravenous Amiodarone therapy.
Amiodarone after several days of intravenous Amiodarone therapy.
In addition, the patient had received significant volume resuscitation with his hypotension post cardiac catheterization and intraaortic balloon pump placement.
The patient was initially started on Nesiritide drip as well as ace inhibitor for afterload reduction in the hopes of diuresis.
The Nesiritide was continued from [**2198-4-20**], to [**2198-4-23**], when the Nesiritide was discontinued secondary to hypotension.
However, after several days, his blood pressure stabilized and we were able to further diurese the patient with intravenous Lasix.
Due to difficulty with his fluid status, the patient did have a Swan- Ganz catheter placed after initiating Coumadin [**2198-4-25**], to have better assessment of the patient's hemodynamics.
Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued on [**2198-4-28**], after significant progress had been made in his volume status.
On admission to Coronary Care Unit, he did have a nasogastric tube and was noted to have gastric occult positive nasogastric output.
The patient was continued on Heparin post cardiac catheterization and decision was made after speaking with the family about the benefits to initiate Coumadin therapy in a controlled setting.
Upper endoscopy was performed which documented three gastric erosions which were not actually bleeding but were felt to be the source of the gastrointestinal bleed.
They recommended follow-up colonoscopy in several months.
The patient was empirically treated with Protonix p.o.
In addition, he was tested for H. pylori antigen and his H. pylori antibody was positive suggestive of active or past infection.
A decision was made to hold on treating his H. pylori immediately given his multiple medical problems and concern that the patient may be at risk for aspiration with multiple p.o.
However, the patient should initiate H. pylori therapy prior to discharge.
Three out of four bottles came back positive for E. coli which was resistant only to Ampicillin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin immediately with the first fever spike and given the concern for infection.
In addition, his antibiotics were broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn the following day given concern that this could be multiple sources such as associated pneumonia, line infection, urinary tract infection.
However, after the blood cultures grew out E. coli, the patient's antibiotics were narrowed to Ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously once daily.
The patient had received several days of Vancomycin which should have covered for this.
On [**2198-4-27**], the patient's Vancomycin was discontinued.
Given the need for pacemaker placement, infectious disease service was consulted regarding the duration of the antibiotic therapy.
Infectious disease recommended that the patient continue on Ciprofloxacin for a full fourteen day course.
His last day of antibiotics should be [**2198-5-6**].
The source of infection was possibly secondary to bacterial translocation across the bowel wall in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially given multiple negative urine cultures.
Arrhythmia, sinus pause - The patient was noted to have significant sinus pause with beta blocker treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation.
The patient was noted to have junctional rhythm in the 30s after 2.5 of intravenous Metoprolol as well as five second pause.
Most likely, the patient will require a pacemaker for this.
He should have a pacemaker placed prior to discharge home, however, this will not be done until the patient has been adequately treated with intravenous antibiotics for his E. coli bacteremia.
The swallowing assessment noted that the patient cleared his throat on several occasions after coughing following sips of thin liquids from the cup as well as through the straw.
In the meantime, the patient was continued on nectar thick liquids with cups of only pureed solids.
