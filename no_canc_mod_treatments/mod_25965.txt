On return to ICU she was mildly hypertensive (SBP 160) and was started on a labetolol gtt and hydralazine.
She was transfused 2u prbc prior to embolization with increasing hematocrit after the procedure.
A hepatobiliary surgery and rheumatology consult were obtained.
She responded well to diuresis with lasix but required 2 more units PRBC to keep her hct above 28.
The labetolol drip was DC'd in exchange for prn hydralazine.
[**7-22**]: Aggressive diuresis was continued.
Being >48 hours out from embolization, subcutaneous heparin was started.
Diuresis continued with good effect (-1650mL/24hr).
At beginning of diuresis 2 days prior, she was positive 8L.
Our target diuresis was 1.0-1.5L/day.
Consistent with this theory, her fevers reduced as LFTs and bilirubin returned to [**Location 213**].
Rheum recommended no steroids at this time.
Her bilirubin continued to remain elevated while her LFTs trended downwards and there was concern for gallbladder pathology.
