After initial stabilization, workup consisted of imaging of the head, cervical spine and chest.
A left tube thoracostomy had been accomplished.
There was a right to left shift of approximately 1 cm at the level of septum pellucidum and the suprasellar cisterns were nearly completely effaced.
The patient subsequently began having excessive hemorrhage out of his left tube thoracostomy.
Because of the future nature of the injury, no additional resuscitation efforts were entertained.
