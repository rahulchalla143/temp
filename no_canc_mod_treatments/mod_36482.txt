The patient was started on vanco/clinda/ceftaz at this time (had previously been maintained on vancomycin and unasyn, prior course during ICU stay had included vanco/ceftaz).
Vancomycin was dosed more aggressively with goal troughs of 15, and the patient defervesced within 48 hours and remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his ICU admission.
CT surgery was consulted and felt the lesion was not amenable to either perc drainage or surgical intevention.
U/S revealed popliteal DVT, which apparently occurred despite patient having been maintained on heparin sc prophylactically.
Patient started on Heparin drip for therapeutic PTT.
Coumadin started [**6-24**] with goal INR [**12-27**] (need to adjust warfarin accordingly).
INR was therapeutic at 2.0 on day of discharge ([**2182-7-3**]), and patient should be continued on Lovenox 80 sc bid for 4 more doses.
INR should be checked every 3-4 days and adjust Coumadin dose accordingly.

The pt was treated with MVI, thiamine, folate for possible alcohol related mental status changes.

Potential treatment has been deferred until the pt is more stable.
