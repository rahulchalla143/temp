Patient underwent CT guided drainage of the abscess and a JP drain was placed.
Her antibiotics were broadened to meropenem given mutli-drug resistant E. coli.
ID was consulted to help with management of antibiotic choice and course of meropenem while in the hospital with transition to ertapenem 1gm Q24H to end on [**2174-6-3**].
JP drain site was clean, dry and intact.
IR recommended the drain be flushed with 5-10cc saline Q8H and remain in place until the daily net drainage is less than 15cc per day (subtracting the flushes), at which time she will need a repeat CT.
# Hyperglycemia - Patient has a history of poorly controlled DM with prior non-compliance with her oral regimen.
She was recently started on insulin and presented with one week of elevated blood sugars likely in the setting of her splenic abscess.
She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult who recommended her sliding scale insulin regimen be increased and her evening glargine decreased.
She was started on metformin once her anion gap completly normalized.
She will be discharged on metformin and a new insulin scale.
We treated her with meropenem as above which was changed to Ertepenem for ease of admninistration (once daily dosing) to treat her bacteremia and abscess.
# HTN: Well controlled on home medications.
We held atenolol due to her hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
# HLD: Statin held given elevated LFTs.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued her home dose of levothyroxine .
# PVD: Continued on home ASA .
# Enlarged endometrial stripe: Found on imaging as incidental finding.
At this time we recommend outpatient evaluation with a vaginal ultrasound.
# Pancreatic cyst: Found on imaging as incidental finding.
If CT shows complete resolution of the abscess, the drain may be removed with no further follow up.
Continue IV antibiotics until [**6-3**] with ertapenem 1gm Q24H.

Radiology drained the abscess and placed a JP drain which will continue to drain fluids.
You were started on an antibiotic called Miropenem while at the hospital.
We will send you to your rehab center on a similar antibiotic called ertapenem and will need this antibiotic until [**6-3**].
Your PCP can remove the JP drain at that time.
We also recommend stopping your atorvastatin since this can contribute to abnormal liver function tests.
We consulted the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service and they recommended a new insulin plan which you will go home on.
We will review your new insulin regiment in detail before you leave.
[**Last Name (un) **] also recommended starting Metformin, an oral medication you should take twice a day that can help with the management of diabetes.
The CT also showed a pancreatic cyst and you will require a MRCP for further evaluation.
Medicaion Changes START Metformin START Ertapenem STOP Atorvastatin  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.
