He was initially admitted to the ICU for early goal-directed therapy for the sepsis, and was later transitioned to the hospital medicine service once the sepsis had been stabilized, and continuosly improved until discharge back to his long term nursing home.
Acute Issues  # Sepsis: Upon admission, the most likely source was the urinary tract given his chronic 3-way urinary catheter at rehab and his UA with >182 WBCs.
His BP's improved to the 100-120s after about 1L total of fluids, and he received empiric vanc/Zosyn for presumed urosepsis as well as MRSA covereage given the concern for aspiration PNA.
He will complete a course of augmentin at his facility for pneumonia.
We held his seroquel and trazodone initially, but continued Celexa.
He was resumed on home trazodone and seroquel at discharge.
# Aortic stenosis: Valve area 0.8cm2 in [**2134**].
