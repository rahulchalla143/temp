ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone in Chelsae without immediate family but currently at Leespoint Nursing Center after pacemaker placement for rehabilitation.
Her blood pressure was 91/56, heartrate 81, respiratory rate 23 sating 100% on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
Baseline BUN and creatinine were 20 and .7 but here was 32 and 2.0, sodium was 128, potassium 4.5, chloride 87 and bicarbonate 23.
She was resuscitated with 2 units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids.
Her creatinine improved with hydration with intravenous fluids back to her baseline.
Her respiratory status improved with diuresis and a steroid taper for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare as she was quite wheezy during admission.
She had had a number of aspiration events in the past and so a video swallow was obtained which revealed a mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by reduced bolus control with formation that resulted in aspiration of thin liquids.
She was upgraded to a thin liquid, ground solid diet with her pills whole or crushed in purees and aspiration precautions including tucking chin to chest for all bites and sips, alternating between solids and liquids and clearing the throat and swallowing during the middle and end of the meal.
From the standpoint of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she improved with nebulizers around the clock and steroid taper.
From the standpoint of her question of gastrointestinal bleed, she received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy.
Given that she was on anticoagulation only for atrial fibrillation, they recommended holding anticoagulation until they saw and after the results of the biopsy determine if she needs a repeat endoscopy.
It was also consistent with her history of esophagectomy as her stomach lay in her thoracic cavity.
The recommendation per Radiology was that further evaluation with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging scan on a nonemergent basis is recommended if clinically warranted.
