She was awake and oriented (could nod yes or no) and had new mild left sided weakness ([**5-4**]) with her prior residual productive aphasia and R face, arm, and leg weakness.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care after receiving FFPs and Vitamin K. Her INR was 2.7 prior to 2 units of FFPs and 1.9 after, so she was given an additional 2 units of FFPs.
While in the ED, she experienced a brief 2 minute convulsive seizure and was subsequently started on Levetiracetam 500 q12h.
Her neurologic exam had been challenging as she was originally very hyperactive and agitated off sedation and subsequently has been more lethargic (possibly due to quetiapine 50 [**Hospital1 **] which was administered to reduce agitation); she does not attend to the examiner or follow commands reliably and may have had a component of delirium.
She was treated with IV Furosemide boluses and vasodilated with amlodipine and PRN hydralazine.
However, given her hemorrhage, we were unable to thrombolyse or anticoagulate her, so she was medically optimized with aspirin, beta blockade, statin therapy, and oxygenation.
[] Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia/Diabetes - She was hyperglycemic to the 300s-400s on the first night of admission and was treated with insulin which brought her glucose down to the 40s transiently; she was started on D5NS to maintain her glucose levels in the 100-200 range.
She has intermittently been hyperglycemia and has intermittently required insulin infusions.
[] Goals of Care - Multiple discussions have taken place with [**Doctor First Name **] (the patient's son), [**Name (NI) 1439**] (the patient's daughter), and the patient's grandchildren regarding her hemorrhage, her multi-organ system dysfunction, and the possibility of tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement in the context of the patient's wishes for goals of care (which unfortunately are not known).
