Admission Date:  [**2153-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-4-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Wegeners granulomatosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided biopsy Chest tube placement and removal Kidney biopsy   History of Present Illness: 34 y/o M with PMHx of DM I who was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 89453**] for work-up of anemia of unclear etiology.
During his admission he was noted to have eosinophilia, coagulopathy, infiltrates and an anterior mediastinal mass.
He received two units of PRBCs and Hct at discharge was 24.6.
Haptoglobin was high.
Bone marrow biopsy showed bone marrow suppression and iron deficiency.
He was discharged with iron supplementation.
His mediastinal mass felt to most likely be a thymoma, and would tie together all of his other findings including anemia, atypical pneumonia and recurrent sinus infections with eosinophilia and coagulopathy.
He had an MRI of the chest which showed Round heterogeneous lesion in the anterior mediastinum measuring 5.4 x 3.9 x 4.7 cm without appreciable loss of signal intensity on out-of-phase imaging with mild enhancement.
Thoracic surgery decided no biopsy should be performed as risk of seeding the surrounding tissue if this is malignant.
He was to follow up with them next week for further management.
Has always used condoms in previous sexual relationships.

[**2153-4-13**] mediastinal mass cytology: IMPRESSION: Technically successful aspiration of a predominantly cystic anterior mediastinal mass.
FNA, Anterior mediastinal mass: NON-DIAGNOSTIC Specimen consists of scattered macrophages.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 89454**] is a 34 year-old male with Type I DM and recent complicated history and hospitalizations for a mediastinal mass now thought to be a thymic cyst, vasculitis with DAH on BAL thought to be Wegeners granulomatosis (also with renal involvement confirmed on biopsy) whose course has been complicated by pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and removal s/p high dose methylprednisolone and first dose of rituxan.
He was found to have a high titer positive for C-ANCA after extensive workup of iron deficiency anemia on prior hospitalization.
He was treated with IV solumedrol 1gm X 3days then transitioned to prednisone 40 mg po bid.
As he did have a mediastinal mass, the concern was that this may be lymphoma and steroids would partially treat, obscuring a diagnosis.
He will require prolonged steroid treatment so omeprazole, vit d, calcium and bactrim were added for ppx.
He was given his first rituxan infusion on [**4-19**] without complication and will receive 3 more infusions over the next month.
Despite uptitration of his insulin he remained hyperglycemic and was transferred to the ICU for one day for insulin gtt titration.
[**Last Name (un) **] had been consulted and educated the patient how to down titrate his lantus dose when his steroid dose changes.
#  Anterior mediastinal mass:  Visualized on previous imaging.
Appears to be thymic cyst based on fluid aspirated.
He was treated with high-dose steroids without change in clinical status which makes it even more unlikely this is lymphoma.
He received one unit of PRBCs during this hospitalization and was maintained on iron and vit c supplementation.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and chest tube placed.
- Patient will need continued titration of insulin dosing as his steroid dose changes.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of Wegeners Granulomatosis.
You were started on high dose steroids and ultimately placed on 40 mg of prednisone twice daily.
The rheumatologists decided to treat you adjunctively with rituxan as this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has fewer sided effects then the mainline treatment for your condition.
You will need 3 more doses of rituxan which the rheumatologists will arrange.
You suffered a complication of this procedure which was a pneumothorax (collapse of part of the lung).
A chest tube was placed and then removed.
It is important that you avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications in the future (alleve, ibuprofen, ect).
You can use tylenol as need for pain control.
Otherwise discuss other pain medications with your primary doctor before using.
