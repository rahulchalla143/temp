Diaphragmatic hernia:   The patient underwent a Laparoscopic repair of hernia of Morgagni with mesh.
She tolerated the procedure well.
Chest xray showed significant hemidiaphragm on R side which was consistent with surgical repair but diminished her ventilatory capacity; the patient was given aggressive suctioning and pulmonary toilet.
The patient was given IV lopressor and a cardiology consult was called.
She was placed on telemetry and started on PO diltiazem.
She was started on IV diltiazem with improved rate control.
Her rate remained well controlled, and she was eventually transitioned to PO diltiazem at 90 q6h and the drip weaned off.
On [**9-4**] she was started on plavix for anticoagulation and sent home on this medicine.
It was felt that given her alcoholism the risk of bleeding was too high for her to be transitioned to coumadin.

Her foley catheter was removed and she urinated without difficulty.
They recommended outpatient follow-up with neurology and a C-spine MRI.
