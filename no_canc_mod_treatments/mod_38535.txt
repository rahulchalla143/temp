During that hospitalization she was diuresed with IV lasix, then transitioned to torsemide 10mg daily.
The patient was discharged on oral diuretics in an attempt to regain renal function prior to restarting evaluation for AVR.
In the AM, the patient was given 40mg of IV lasix and placed on CPAP, however did not tolerate well.
The patient was started on a heparin drip, given ASA, BBlocker, statin.
She was then placed on BiPAP by EMS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
The patient had persistent 8/10 chest pain during her stay in the ED, requiring multiple doses of morphine 2mg and 1mg of dilaudid.
The patient was placed on a non-rebreather and an ABG was sent which showed respiratory acidosis.
Her respiratory status was unstable and the patient was started on CPAP non invasive ventilation and narcan drip.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
She was continued on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP and gently diuresed on a lasix drip.
Ultimate treatment would be valvuloplasty vs. AVR, however the patient is not a candidate for AVR.
Her respiratory status improved slightly but continued to have oxygen requirement and was unable to lie flat therefore she would have required intubation for this procedure.
She had worsening renal function likely secondary to poor forward flow and required high doses of diuretics to maintain adequate urine output.
She expressed a desire to discontinue all aggressive measures in favor of comfort care.
She was transitioned to hospice care, continued on morphine as needed for comfort and expired in the hospital several days later with her family by her side.
