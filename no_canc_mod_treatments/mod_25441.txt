She reportedly proceeded to collapse and was brought to [**Hospital6 5016**], where she became intubated for airway protection after witnessed emesis.
She received fentanyl and versed for sedation; no anti-epileptics were given.
Neuro: Mental status: intubated and sedated on arrival; does not follow commands.
New right frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the third ventricle.
Stable size of the ventricular system with right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter stably terminating in the third ventricle.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The patient is now status post coiling of an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm.
Status post removal of an external ventricular drain, without evidence of hemorrhage in the tube tract.
She remained intubated for airway protection.
An external ventricular drain was placed for hydrocephalus and shortly thereafter her exam improved tremendously to the point that she became arrousable and was following all comands and moving all four extremities.
This was succesfully coiled without complication but will require further coiling with a stent in the near future.
Post procedure she was transferred to the SICU for close neurological monitoring including q1 neurochecks and strict blood pressure control to less than 140 systolic.
On [**8-6**] [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] was clamped and she was started on SQH for DVT prophylaxsis.
She was treated with lopressor 5mg IV x2 with good resolution.
The drain was left at 20cm above the tragus and she had no further episodes of increased ICP.
She was febrile on this day and blood, urine, sputum and CSF cultures were sent.
She did receive intra-arterial verapmil to the left ICA for treatment of her vasospasm.
Her SBP goal was increased to 140-160 and this did improve her mental status somewhat and she was following commands with all extremities and oriented to year.
She was again taken to angio and received verapamil and nicardipine for vasospasm.
Over the next 24 hours the patient was very unstable requiring 3 pressors (max dose), esmolol and milrinone.
[**Date range (1) 87363**] The patient remained paralyzed with pressors and medical management.
paralytics were discontinued and pressors were weaned.

[**8-23**] the heparin gtt was discontinued and the antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-24**] although she was still febrile.
on [**8-29**] patient was started on a heparin drip for stroke and a right upper extremity DVT.
Coumadin was started on [**8-30**].
Dermatology was consulted who recommended Hydrocortisone cream which was started on [**8-30**].
Coumadin was started for a goal INR of [**12-27**].5.
[**8-31**] Coumadin was increased, Heparin gtt continued, PTT within range, INR not within goal.
Heparin gtt continued.
