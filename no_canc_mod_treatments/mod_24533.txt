AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
A therapeutic tap withdrew 4L of fluid.
Hepatitis panel was positive for hep A antibodies and negative for hep B and hep C. Hep C PCR is still pending.
Heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] had an aortic valve replacement in [**2181**], and was diagnosed with heart failure six years ago in [**Hospital1 46**].
