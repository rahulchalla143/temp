B/L TIB/FIB AP/LAT [**2174-8-24**] Nonaggressive periosteal new bone formation along the tibiae bilaterally.
Tiny lucency in distal right tibia of uncertain etiology, but considered unlikely to represent a focus of osteomyelitis.
He was intubated for airway protection and brought to OSH.
RIJ placed and started on dopamine gtt for hypotension and sedated with versed.
EKG showed a.fibb with RVR, Peak troponin 0.56.
He did spike a temp to 101 and was started on vancomycin and imipenem after blood and urine cultures obtained.
CCU course: Pt was weaned off dopamine and antibiotics were changed to vanco and zosyn for suspected pneumonia.
Pt remained intubated and unable to wean from vent.
He was aggressively diuresed, first with bolus lasix, escalating to lasix gtt @ 20mg/hr and metalazone, and diamox.
On [**9-5**] pt underwent trach and PEG.
By [**9-10**] it was believed that we have overdiuresed the pt, Cr increaseing, BP dropping and fluid resesitant was began.
Does better on vent settings as follows: Vt600/rate24/peep10/fi0240%.
Pt thought to be dry thus lasix was held.
He was continued on atrovent nebs prn.
[**9-8**] sputum showed MSSA, therefore vanco was d/c'ed.
Had added flagyl for concern of aspiration pna.
As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.
Antibiotics switched to Ceftazidime 1gm Q12H on [**2174-9-11**].
Pt completed 14 day course of antibiotics and they were d/c'd.
On [**9-21**], in the setting of worsening respiratory status with metabolic acidosis, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, it was decided that antibiotics were not helping and all were d/c'ed.
Discussed pt's situation with his brother and his fiancee (in person) and with his other borhter (on the phone) and it was decided on [**9-21**], [**2174**] to make Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures only.
He was pronounced dead at 20:[**2086-9-15**] from respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and CHF>  # FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) Despite finishing course of abx cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl for [**8-18**] positive cultures, pt continued to spike fevers.
On [**8-25**] Initial cytology from BAL showing HSV inclusions and HSV1 culture positive.
Completed coarse of Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8h but continued to spike fevers up to 102.
Now on Ceftaz, flagyl and nafcillin (first dose [**2174-9-13**]).
Thus, in a final attempt to bring his fevers down a triple lumen foley catheter was placed for bladder lavage with cooling liquids, ice cold gastric was tried, and he was aggressively cooled by the Arctic Sun protocol.
Despite this, his temperature rose to 106.9 so after a 6 hour trial these measures were d/c'ed.
On day of death, max temp was 107.1 F.  # HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
Pt currently not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO can be resumed.
Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed.
BB Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart when tolerating PO.
Cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.
Patient was started on pressors for inotropy with good effect on his CO and uop.
By [**9-20**], in the setting of marked fever and metabolic acidosis pt was tachycardic and hypotensive despite maximum dose of norepinephrine (0.45 mcg/kg/min).
Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube and an ileus on CT that resolved after TF were held.
Surgery commented that they felt the oozing secretions around the PEG tube site was only leaking tube feeds.
Cr improved with diuresis and then began to creep back up with max 3.4 on [**2174-9-13**].
Giving fluid boluses and monitoring UOP, which was noted to be exquisitely sensitive to blood pressure.
However, met alk continues dispite lack of further diuresis.
Moderate response with IV dilt.
Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol.
Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near normal alb.
a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin metabolism.
Gave Vit K 10mg QD X 3 daysfibrinogen and haptoglobin high so likely not DIC.
# Nutrition: PEG inplace, Nutren Renal with benefiber TF at 45mL/hr  # Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS with q6h then q4h checks.
Raised standing NPH to 12U q12H  # Prophylaxis: DVT: Pneumoboots then heparin SC Stress ulcer:  Famotidine VAP: Head of bed elevated.
