- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2197-5-2**] 5:45 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-1**], there has been placement of a new left-sided pacemaker with the single lead extending to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F NSH resident who presents with bradycardia in the setting of intravascular depletion and calcium channel blocker use.

She was stable and went for uncomplicated placement of a single-chamber permanent pacemaker through the left subclavian.
She is not on coumadin because of falls and is on full dose ASA for stroke prophylaxis.
