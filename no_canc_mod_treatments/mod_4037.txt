The graft required a stent placement postoperatively.
Ultimately, he developed an open wound at the level of the popliteal exposure, a graft infection with severe Staphylococcus bacteremia, and nearly died as result of multisystem organ failure of sepsis.
He subsequently recovered from that; but has still had a nonhealing wound in his groin, and a draining sinus at his popliteal space.

The patient's hyperkalemia was treated aggressively in the OR and afterwards in the CVICU with kayexalate, IV lasix, calcium gluconate, albuterol, and insulin.
His potassium on arrival on [**8-10**] was 6.8 which with treatment was normalized to 4.2 prior to discharge.
On [**2146-8-12**] he was discharged on his home medication regimen which notably included KCL 20meq daily, Carvedilol, Spironolactone, losartan, and digoxin.
After discharge he saw his PCP who according to patient's family (records not available at this time) stopped KCL and his multivitamin but kept his medications the same otherwise.
It is uncertain if a potassium was checked in that period.
The next potassium measurement that we have in our system is from [**9-20**] which was drawn prior to surgery and was 7.4.
He received 2 units of pRBCs in the OR.

GU: Foley in place Skin: Erythematous maculopapular rash on arms that is reportedly much improved from prior  Labs: See OMR  Assessment/Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old gentleman with a history of CAD (s/p CABG), PVD, CHF (EF30% s/p AICD) who was directly admitted for scheduled removal of infected R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft on [**9-20**] and was found to have hyperkalemia on arrival.
Patient also arrived hyperkalemic during the previous hospitalization on [**8-10**] and was treated appropriately but was discharged on his previous home medications which included spironolactone, losartan, carvedilol, and KCL.
- Agree with primary team's management of acute hyperkalemia including frequent K checks, telemetry, and IV lasix.
- Would restart carvedilol prior to discharge as its effects on potassium are typically small and cardiovascular benefit is likely greater.
He will need frequent electrolyte checks until his medication regimen is stabilized.
Would not restart losartan or spironolactone prior to discharge.
If patient's cardiologist feels that benefit for treatment of CHF outweighs risk, would restart losartan or spironolactone one at a time and at low dose with frequent electrolyte checks.
- Please contact patient's PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20796**] to discuss medication changes and also to gather collateral information including interim potassium measurements if available.
Also will need to clarify duration of antibiotic therapy as patient's family mentioned osteomyelitis however I do not have any records of that available.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1366**], MD PhD       Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted as same day admission on [**2146-9-20**] and underwent Removal of infected right graft, and replacement with right common femoral to below-knee popliteal artery bypass with non-reversed left greater saphenous vein and angioscopy.
He was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and flagyl postoperatively.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU.
In the PACU, he was hyperkalemic with K of 7.4, which was treated with bicarb, lasix, regular insulin, and dextrose and K went down to 6.2.
They recommended that we hold spironolactone and losartan and have the patient follow up 2-4 days after discharge.
On POD 3, the patient received concurrent lasix and NS boluses to reduce potassium and promote diuresis.
POD4, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells with lasix for hematocrit of 22.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] antibiotics were discontinued and PICC line was removed.
He was restarted back on doxycycline and will follow up with his infectious Disease physician.
Patient is scheduled to follow up with his PCP and cardiologist for potassium check and follow up of medication regimen.
