Brief Hospital Course: In the ED on [**2139-5-6**], the patient was sedated with Propofol and intubated for airway protection.
The patient became hypotensive and Propofol was discontinued.
Fentanyl was used to sedate her overnight and to obtain an MRI.
She was hemoconcentrated (hematocrit 52.1) and acidotic (bicarb 13 with anion gap of 29) upon arrival; both of these abnormalities were resolved on the morning of [**5-7**] after IV hydration.
Her home medications (Lipitor 10mg, Lisinopril 20mg, and aspirin 325mg per day) were continued in the hospital.
The patient elected not to start an antiepileptic medication at this time, with the understanding that if she did in fact have a second seizure, the chance of having recurrent seizures would rise exponentially and she would likely need to start a medication at this time.
