TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed with IV contrast.
For example there is a subcarinal node measuring 10 mm in shortest diameter and a left hilar node measures 12 mm in diameter.
Possible etiologies include sarcoid, granulomatous disease, and lymphoma.
Her C2 dens fracture was managed non operatively with a hard cervical collar to be worn until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], Neurosurgery, in 6 weeks.
She was taken to the operating room on [**7-6**] for repair of her right femur intratrochanteric fracture.
She was started on Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Her pain was initially managed with PCA Morphine; this was later changed to longer acting narcotics which will likely require further adjustment given her increased pain postoperatively.
Because of pain control issues and her deconditioned status patient had required supplemental oxygen to maintain her saturations >93%.
