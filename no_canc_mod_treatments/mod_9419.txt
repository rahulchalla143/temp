Admission Date:  [**2108-6-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-6-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-6-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, known coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2098**] and prior percutaneous coronary interventions) who presented for elective catheterization after experiencing increasing dyspnea and angina on exertion.
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2098**] with a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to ramus intermedius, and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery.
The saphenous vein graft to ramus intermedius was found occluded and was stented.
His symptoms returned six weeks later, and the patient went for re-catheterization on [**2108-3-14**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications included sulfasalazine 1000 mg p.o.
b.i.d., niacin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., vitamin C, and vitamin E.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  An ex-smoker.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for elective catheterization.
The left circumflex with 100% intermediate in-stent restenosis with discontinuity at the distal end consistent with spontaneous stent fracture secondary to chronic flexion extension at the saphenous vein graft touchdown site.
Saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery had an ulcerated 50% proximal lesion; otherwise was normal.
The patient was sent to the Coronary Care Unit overnight with a Swan-Ganz catheter in place.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was started on aspirin.
Heparin was held secondary to possible myocardial bleed.
He was continued on his Zocor dose and eventually restarted on a beta blocker.
The patient was placed on Imdur 30 mg p.o.
Since the percutaneous coronary intervention was unsuccessful, the patient will require medical management for now and hopefully self-revascularize.
The patient was initially hypertensive when he was brought to the floor, but throughout the course of the night his blood pressure fell without medical intervention, allowing us to put him back on his beta blocker regimen.
His lungs remained clear, and Lasix was not deemed necessary.
Sulfasalazine 1000 mg p.o.
Niacin 500 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Zocor 20 mg p.o.
Vitamin C. 7.
