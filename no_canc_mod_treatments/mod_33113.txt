He was starte on Keflex and the wound healed.
He was again started on Keflex and is still currently taking it.
Patient underwent an isthmus ablation on [**2120-1-14**] for his a-flutter.
On [**2120-1-15**] BiV ICD placement was attempted, but the LV lead could not be placed; therefore, he only received a dual chamber pacer on the left.
