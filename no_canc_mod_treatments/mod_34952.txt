Although the Pt has a hx of non-compliance w/ medication and follow-up, if the Pt was dialyzed yesterday this level of hyperkalemia 1 day after dialysis is surprising and likely comes in the setting of a significant Potassium load by diet.
A nutrition consult was ordered, but he was also educated on potassium containing foods by the team.
Restarted home antihypertensive regimen [**2155-8-1**] AM w/ appropriate holding parameters.
Also level of Pt compliance w/ medications is unclear.
He also says that the primary reason for the delay in this process is that he has not been impressed by the results of kidney transplantation by the recipients he meets in the community and at Dialysis.
