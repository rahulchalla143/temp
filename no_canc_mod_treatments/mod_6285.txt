Was seen in liver clinic two days prior to admission with increase in total bilirubin to 26.2 and was sent home.
Cultures were sent and therapeutic paracentesis was performed.
Patient given intravenous fluids and lactulose, Levaquin, Flagyl and transferred to the floor for further wore up and treatment.
Status post living related door transplant with rejection in operating room, cadaveric transplant 24 hours later wit question CMV status.
The transplant was performed [**2200-10-18**].
In [**2199-12-9**] noted increased liver function tests with MRI showing biliary stricture of the anastomosis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stenting.
In [**2200-1-9**] biliary stent occlusion was noted with stents being replace.
She was readmitted with a stent occlusion and the stents were removed and ducts ballooned.
2) Recurrent biliary stricture [**2199-12-9**], endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement and [**2200-1-9**] stent occlusion with tent replacement, status post stent removal with ballooning, status post treatment with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for cholangitis, status post a Roux-en-Y.procedure [**2200-10-9**].

Right hepatic tube without drainage.
She was treated with aggressive lactulose titrated to 4,000 a day initially.
She was continued on her Actigall and her Interferon and Ribavirin were held.
Therapeutic paracentesis was performed for need for patient comfort.
For her increasing creatinine she was continued with gentle intravenous fluids and additional albumin was considered.
She was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl initially.
The following morning she was taken for esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The recommendations at that time were to continue to administer lactulose rectally from the encephalopathy  because the patient had only one bowel movement overnight despite q two lactulose p.r.n.
The patient's hematocrit dropped to 22.5 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
After the two units of packed red blood cells the patient's hematocrit was stable at 23.8.
An infectious disease consult was obtained and recommended starting Vancomycin to cover for possible urinary tract infection and T tube infections in the past.
Vital signs were stable but again was noted to have a low hematocrit of approximately 24 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
After the procedure the patient was observed to be nearly comatose due to concerns of altered mental status, airway protection and hemodynamic stability.
Patient was transfused four units of fresh frozen plasma and one bag of platelets, received vitamin K subcutaneously and was transfused an additional two units of packed red blood cells.
She was continued on intravenous Protonix.
Lactulose was continued via nasogastric tube and per rectum.
Cardiovascularly she was hemodynamically stable and the fresh frozen plasma was given to help intravenous volume repletion.
Pulmonarily her O2 saturations were stable and she was placed on biPAP for airway protection but did not require intubation during her Intensive Care Unit course.
In addition, the patient was continued on Meropenem, Vancomycin per the infectious disease service and cultures were drawn.
BIPAP was initiated with improvement in the respiratory component of her acidosis.
