Left knee proximal tibia open biopsy.
Split-thickness skin grafting of right thigh donor site.
Partial closure of left knee arthrotomy.
In [**8-/2156**] he suffered a complex proximal tibia fracture requiring multiple surgical procedures.
On [**2156-9-13**] he had an ORIF with external fixator and then a split thickness skin graft.
The external fixator was removed in [**10-2**].
The pt continued to have pain and a CT scan noted a nonunion along the medial side of the tibial plateau fracture and pt underwent repair in [**2157-6-26**] with ORIF with iliac crest bone graft, removal of deep hardware and placement of a medial proximal tibial locking plate applied to the medial tibia over the nonunion site with a total of 8 locking screws.
Due to continued complaints of pain, in [**Month (only) 958**] of [**2157**], he underwent surgical lysis of adhesions with a medial and lateral meniscectomy.
This surgical intervention did not help and patient continued to have pain localized to the left leg, both medially and laterally in the region of the plate so he underwent hardware removal on [**2158-6-23**].
At this time, ID got involved and recommended no antibiotics and watchful waiting.
Patient decided on total knee replacement due to his unbearable knee pain.
ID recommended that tissue be sent from the OR and if there was growth of CoNS, he would be treated aggressively with 6-8 weeks of IV abx and likely oral regimen following.
The patient came in [**2159-10-22**] and was admitted to the plastics surgery service for aLeft knee proximal tibia open biopsy, Left knee antibiotic spacer,Transfer of free anterolateral thigh flap from the right thigh to the left knee with microvascular anastomosis, Split-thickness skin grafting of right thigh donor site, and partial closure of left knee arthrotomy.

Left knee proximal tibia open biopsy, 2.
Left knee antibiotic spacer, 3.
Split-thickness skin grafting of right thigh donor site, 5.
Partial closure of left knee arthrotomy.
The patient tolerated the procedures well.
Neuro: Immediately post-operatively, the patient was maintained on Dilaudid PCA.
As soon as he could tolerate POs the following meds were added along with the dilaudid PCA: Tylenol 1000mg every 6 hours ATC, oxycontin 50 mg po Q8h, neurontin 1200 mg TID.
On [**2159-10-24**] the patient was still complaining of pain so a Pain consult was called and they increased his Oxycontin from 50mg to 60mg Q8h and they also added a Ketamine IV infusion.
He actually requested that the ketamine IV infusion be stopped and the team was in agreement so the Ketamine was discontinued the morning of [**2159-10-25**].
The Pain Service agreed with this and requested that we re-consult them when attempting to wean patient off of the dilaudid PCA and when trying to taper off the oxycontin.
The dilaudid PCA was discontinued in the afternoon on [**2159-10-25**] and patient was transitioned to dilaudid PO for breakthrough pain.
He continued to require very high doses of dilaudid and was transitioned to oxycontin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
