History of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, status post open reduction and internal fixation of the left hip at an outside hospital on [**9-17**].
The patient presents on Vancomycin dosed by level less than 15.
He had prominent bowel sounds and soft abdominal examination, nontender, nondistended.
Range of motion on the left is limited secondary to pain since his open reduction and internal fixation in [**Month (only) 4278**].
The patient was maintained on heparin drip for a left atrial appendage thrombus.
Cardiovascular:  Atrial fibrillation was controlled throughout this admission for this period of time on Amiodarone 200 mg q. day.
The patient had a known left atrial appendage thrombus and was maintained on heparin until all interventions were performed.
The patient was transitioned to Coumadin starting [**11-16**] after his permanent hemodialysis access had been established.
Cardiovascular disease:  The patient was on aspirin, heparin, beta blocker, Isosorbide, Hydralazine per the CCU regimen.
The patient was maintained on Vancomycin levels, dosed when blood levels were less than 15.
A bone scan was performed which demonstrated increased uptake in the left proximal femur and acetabulum, consistent with osseous repair following fracture and surgical repair and infected component could not be excluded from the proximal left femur based on the bone scan findings.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted.
They suggest a six week course of Vancomycin with a follow-up bone scan at that time to further evaluate the surgical repair versus hardware seeding of this patient's Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
They suggested antibiotic regimen and follow-up with a rescan to assess the progression of the hematoma versus the abscess in four to six weeks.
The patient was maintained on hemodialysis.
Initially, a temporary line was placed until the patient was cleared of infection and white count had returned to [**Location 1867**].
On [**11-16**], a permanent dialysis catheter was put in place.
The patient was started on Wolfram.
The patient will be dosed with Vancomycin at hemodialysis as an outpatient.
Diabetes:  The patient was maintained on 15 units of NPH at breakfast, 4 units of NPH at bedtime as well as six units of regular insulin at dinner, on top of a regular insulin sliding scale as well as a diabetic diet.
He also had a fungal rash, for which he was treated with appropriate Miconazole powder and Nystatin ointment.
Access:  The patient had a PICC line placed for access for his heparin infusion.
This PICC line may be discontinued as the patient is transitioned off heparin to Wolfram as his Vancomycin will be dosed by levels and may be administered at hemodialysis.
He is getting hemodialysis per catheter and is being transitioned to Wolfram from his heparin drip.
Status post open reduction and internal fixation, left atrial appendage thrombus.
He needs a six week total course of Vancomycin post discharge.
The patient will be followed at dialysis per routine.
