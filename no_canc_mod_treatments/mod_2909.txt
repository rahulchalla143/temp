Antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) were begun.
He was given metoprolol 5 mg IV X1 for both hypertension and tachycardia.
While in the unit, he was aggressively volume resuscitated, but he did not require pressors as his BP was fluid responsive; he was positive 10L/first 24 hours in unit.
The rest of his hospital course is significant for ERCP that did not show any evidence of clear obstruction; however a stent was placed in an area of stenosis with adequate biliary drainage.
In SICU, he was given Zosyn and Vanco intially both, then Vanco was d/c'ed when the patient stabilized.

Status post total colectomy with right lower quadrant ileostomy.
Small amount of air noted within the bladder likely relates to introduction of Foley catheter.
A biliary stent was placed.
Successful cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotomey using a free-hand technique.
Successful placement of a 7cm by 10Fr Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent for drainage 7.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-1-3**] Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for enlarged pericardial fat pads as shown on recent CT abdomen study of [**2120-12-31**].
He was admitted for presumed urosepsis versus cholangitis; he was given IV antibiotics (vanc/zosyn, then just zosyn) and aggressively fluid resuscitated (+10 liters) in the SICU.
The patient had been treated with antibiotics prior to admission; this had likely cleared prior to presentation as (1) E. Coli was pan-sensitive, (2) UTI was uncomplicated and easily treated with more than 3 days of a quinolone and (3)all urinalysis and urine cultures were negative on this admission.
There was no evidence of cholangitis on ERCP; however, a diagnosis of cholangitis unclear as patient's total bilirubin decreased with biliary stent placement.
The patient was switched from IV zosyn to ciprofloxacin PO/flagyl PO but began spiking fevers again with continued RUQ pain, and zosyn was restarted.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy was placed by interventional radiology on [**2121-1-3**] with 200 cc of bile immediately drained; bile cultures grew Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
The patient was discharged on ciprofloxacin and also scheduled for outpatient surgery followup for interval cholecystectomy.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage was to be monitored by the patient daily.
Interval removal of the percutaneous cholecystostomy drain is deferred to surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at his outpatient surgery followup appointment.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 50% less than on admission in a time course of less than 4 days from admission.
All heparin products were discontinued.
# ARF: Creatinine was elevated on admission, likely due to dehydration.
ARF resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation for sepsis in ED.
Held heparin in setting of thrombocytopenia.

You became septic in the surgical ICU and were treated with fluids and antibiotics.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy drain was placed to drain the infected fluid in your gallbladder, and you improved.
The gallbladder fluid (bile) grew a bacteria called Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was sensitive to an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin.
Please followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as below in 2 weeks for further instructions regarding your drain care.
In the meantime, a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] you with drain care.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will also discuss scheduling a cholecystectomy (surgery to remove your gallbladder), which will likely be in [**3-9**] weeks.
* Please resume all regular home medications and take any new meds as ordered.
=============== NEW MEDICATIONS =============== Please complete a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin as prescribed.
