She was initially maintained on amiodarone gtt.
Right subclavian line was placed.
She was treated for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol 60mg IV Q8, in addition to azithromycin and ceftriaxone due to concern for RUL infiltrate.
She was also diuresed w/ lasix 40mg IV Q8, then transitioned to PO diuresis with lasix 40mg PO BID yesterday.
She was saturating at 92% on 5L NC prior to transfer.

Radiology  A. CXR HISTORY: Systolic CHF recently extubate, to assess for edema or infiltrate.

# Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient likely had COPD exacerbation Given absence of leukocytosis, fever, pneumonia felt less likely.
Patient maintaining saturations of 91-93 % on supplemental oxygen.
She was treated with a 5-day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone (the latter for a presumed RUL pneumonia) in addition to nebs and steroid taper.
Patient will need PFTs either inpatient or outpatient for further characterization of her COPD and medical management regarding her aneurysm.
# Tracheobronchomalacia: Patient is to follow-up on outpatient basis with interventional pulmonology for further work-up and consideration of stent.
She was subsequently diuresed and started on labetalol.
She was discharged on an ACEi, statin, ASA, and beta-blocker.
Cardiology was consulted and will follow the patient and potentially plan for a pre-op cath to evaluate for CAD.
Her RCRI perioperative risk of MI or cardiac death is approximately 5.4 %, and medical optimization was recommended including lisinopril, statin, ASA, and beta blockade.
She will likely need a pre-OR cardiac cath if she undergoes surgery.
# Status post Cardiopulmonary Arrest: After intubation, patient went into PEA arrest.
Given her low EF, consideration for future ICD placement.
