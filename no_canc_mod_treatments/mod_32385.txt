Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo M with h/o IDDM, dCHF, afib on coumadin presenting with right foot pain, found to have cellulitis who was transferred to the ICU on the night of his admission for dyspnea.
Was treated with abx for e coli UTI and cardiac meds were titrated.
#Reason for MICU transfer: on arrival to the floor, the patient's temperature increased to 103 and he was tachycardic with rates in the 160-170s and tachypneic and wheezy who met SIRs criteria and was admitted to the ICU.
Cardiology was consulted and EKGs showed resolution of these changes with administration of IV metoprolol, therefore likely demand ischemia.
ON arrival tot he floor he recieved ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
His urine grew out pansensitive E Coli and cefepime was swithced to cipro and was dsicharged on a total 5 day course.
He was given vancomycin in the ED.
he was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin but only cipro for uti at time of dc.
His uric acid level was 9.1 However, decision regarding starting allopurinol was deferred as pt asymptomatic and recent flare.
He likely had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of a-fib with RVR.
#Atrial Fibrillation- in the setting of an infeciton, he developed afib with RVR.
His CHADS2 score is [**3-8**] who is on coumadin at home and rate controlled at home, on arrival he was therapeutic on his coumadin.
His metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of dc.
Patient received a TTE which showed EF 55%, however was unable to comment on diastolic function.
No further management changes were made for his chronic condition.
He was diuresed with IV lasix in ICU and was on home torsemide on med floor and did well.
