HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female with Sjogren syndrome and history of temporal arteritis on steroids who was recently discharged to a rehabilitation facility after a prolonged stay after a lower GI bleed from diverticulosis.
She presented to the surgery service where she was admitted and treated with percutaneous drainage and IV antibiotics.
She was also treated for her adrenal insufficiency and ultimately required transfer in a prolonged SICU stay.

Lasix 80 b.i.d.
Lopressor 75 b.i.d.
Clonidine 0.2 b.i.d.
Lasix 80 b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives at home with an 83-year-old sister, but on this past admission and from prior has been admitted to a rehabilitation facility.
Cardiovascular: Given her history of hypertension, she was maintained on labetalol and Norvasc.
Her labetalol dose was slowly cut back to allow for greater overall perfusion, which she tolerated well.
Bronchoscopy was performed, and she had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothoraces.
She did have hyponatremia associated with her hyperkalemia and had been diuresed after that point most recently with only small doses of Lasix given appearance of CHF on recent chest x-rays.
However, there was thought that she was somewhat hypovolemic and did require some fluid boluses of normal saline and close monitoring of her electrolytes.
FEN: Her tube feeds were advanced after she was out of the acute phase and because of her electrolyte abnormalities, was maintained on [**3-6**] strength Nepro with a goal of 45 cc or should she be able to advance to full strength, then her rate would be 60 cc per hour.
Of note, the patient was on TPN for sometime and developed cholestasis with an elevated alkaline phosphatase of around 1,100.
She was started on Actigall with significant improvement in her alkaline phosphatase.
She was maintained on Prevacid and Carafate for anti- ulcer prophylaxis.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: As forementioned,  the patient was kept on tube feeds.
ID: She was on multiple antibiotics given her pelvic abscesses.
This was treated with oral Flagyl and quarantine precautions.
Her treatment was transitioned to oral vancomycin for the time course while she was on antibiotics and this was eventually tapered on a daily, then every other day schedule to off.
Endocrine: She initially required a stress-dose steroid and was on IV hydrocortisone.
However, her being able to tolerate orals and be hemodynamically stable, she was then transferred to oral prednisone at a dose of 20 mg via her G tube daily, which is her maintenance dose.
She did require some transfusion and was started on erythropoietin with reasonable success.
She also had chest tubes that had been removed the week prior by thoracic surgery.
Respiratory: As the patient at about 2 or 3 weeks prior to transfer to rehab, had actually done quite well off ventilator support.
However, after about 20 hours, she did require ventilator support and subsequent to that has tolerated only 1-2 hour increments on tracheostomy collar.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Facility for further vent weaning.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Tube feeds to consist of [**3-6**] strength Nepro at 45 cc per hour.
The patient's feeding weight is 60 kg, which would translate to a full-strength tube feeding rate of 60 cc per hour.
She is to receive local wound care to a sacral and back decubitus ulcer.
She is also to receive standard tracheostomy care.
The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] in approximately 2 weeks after discharge from rehabilitation facility.
The patient should have weekly nutrition labs checked including prealbumin and transferrin.
