He vomited non-bilious non-bloody material.
He gave himself 2 insulin injections with Humalog yesterday, although he does not recall how many units.
He does not use Lantus every night, and uses Humalog 1-2 times daily.
His last insulin injection was just over 24 hours prior to presentation.
He denies fever, cough, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, (prior to day of presentation), diarrhea, skin changes, or any other problems.
These episodes appear to be secondary to insulin non-compliance.
He was bolused 7 units insulin (0.1 unit/kg) and started on insulin gtt at 7 units/hr.
Per report at 2300 his FSBS was 249, however this is not documented and chemistry at 2340 showed glucose of 655.
He also received Zofran 4mg for nausea.
On arrival to CCU, the patient complains of gastric discomfort ("hunger pains") and thirst, no other complaints.
