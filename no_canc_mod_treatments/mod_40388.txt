She is now s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] of L periprosthetic femur fracture, transferred post-operatively to MICU for hypotension and inability to wean ventilator in the PACU.
She initially presented on [**2-10**] after tripping over oxygen tubing in her kitchen.
EBL 1000 cc.
Her ventilator settings were changed from CPAP to CMV at 1700, when she appeared to be using accessory muscles to breathe.
Medications given in PACU included morphine (total 4 mg IV), acetaminophen 650 mg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC, kefzol 1g IV, and hydrocortisone 100 mg. .
On arrival to the MICU, the patient matained her blood pressure on phenylephrine 4 mcg/kg/min.
The rhythm initially appeared regular on telemetry, and adenosine 6 mg was given without effect.
She was given metoprolol 5 mg and amiodarone 150 mg push without any appreciable change in her heart rate or rhythm.
A subclavian line was placed, and amiodarone gtt was started.

A left hip prosthesis is in place as before.
Later images appear to demonstrate good alignment of fracture fragments.
83 y/o F with a history COPD (baseline 2L home O2 requirement), RA (on chronic prednisone 2.5 mg daily), hypertension, CHF, recent T LHA c/b CHF and afib who was initially transferred to medical floor from OSH on [**2-10**] for L periprosthetic femur fracture w/elevated INR, now s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] on [**2-12**] with postoperative transfer to the MICU for hypotension and weaning off the vent; pt extubated on [**2-21**], transferred to the floor the evening of [**2-22**] in stable medical condition.
Will continue ppx Lovenox 40mg SC daily until INR reaches 2.0-2.5 on coumadin.
Required ongoing post-operative vasopressor support which necessitated transfer to the MICU.
Initially multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemic (significant decrease in hgb/hct, despite two unit RBC transfusion this morning), sepsis (fevers in setting of recent surgery), adrenal insufficiency (on chronic glucocorticoid therapy), or cardiogenic (given ECG changes and SVT).
Stress dose glucocorticoids were started with improvement and sedation was weaned which also helped.
Eventually the pressors were weaned off with IVF boluses and her home anti-hypertensives were reinitiated.
Her steroids were also weaned back to her home dose (which she takes for rheumatoid arthritis).
Home sotalol was held and Amiodarone load was started with resultant conversion to sinus rhythm.
She then had bradycardia and amiodarone had to be discontinued.
She flipped back into Afib with RVR multiple times and a dilt gtt was intermittently used for rate control.
Eventually the patient was transitioned back to her home dose of sotolol which was uptitrated to 80 mg po bid as she developed a.fib with RVR on the home dose of 80 mg daily.
Pt was initially w/supratherapeutic INR at time of admission; coumadin was held and reversed in setting of pre-op period and dropping hct, which was likely due to bleeding at site of fracture.
Pt was started on lovenox and coumadin post-operatively; coumdadin restarted on [**2-22**] at lower than home dose, 1mg daily.
Lovenox 40mg SQ daily should be continued for DVT ppx until INR at goal of 2.0-2.5 x 48 hours per orthopedic surgery.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] discharged on home Lasix 40mg daily.
# HCAP: The patient had difficulty being weaned from the ventilator post-operatively and her respiratory status was further compromised by presumed HCAP for which she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn, to be [**2146-2-20**].
She was diuresed and slowly weaned from the ventilator with extubation accomplished on [**2-21**].
She was subsequently weaned back to baseline supplement O2 requirement on NC.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Initially continued PO prednisone but with hypotension was transitioned to stress dose glucocorticoids as above.
As her hypotension resolved, she was placed back on her home dose prednisone and discharged hemodynamically stable on home dose of prednisone.
Code status reversed for procedure then changed back per discussion with patient and daughters on [**2-22**].
Medications on Admission: Coumadin 2mg one day, 2.5mg the next day, skip 2 days, then repeat Lasix 40 mg daily Prednisone 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] Sotalol 80 mg daily Protonix 40 mg daily Amlodipine 5 mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM.
Lasix 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
3. prednisone 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
4. sotalol 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Protonix 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
6. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
7. cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
8. enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous DAILY (Daily): Please d/c once INR between 2-2.5 for 48 hours.
9. calcium carbonate 400 mg (1,000 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO three times a day.
Please have your INR checked daily; your coumadin was held at first as your INR was too high.
It is being restarted at a lower dose; the dosage may be changed to reach a goal INR of 2 to 2.5 for your atrial fibrillation.
Please continue all other medications as prescribed.
