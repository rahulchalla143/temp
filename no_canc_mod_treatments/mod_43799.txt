Admission Date:  [**2164-10-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-11-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-3-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old woman with a history of viral myocarditis at age 11 as well as a history of multiple abdominal surgeries including a Billroth II procedure, partial vagotomy and partial gastrectomy in [**2153**].
She had a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy for poor gastric emptying in [**2156**].
In [**2160**] she had transverse colon volvulus and had a hemicolectomy with an ileosigmoid anastomosis.
In [**2161**] she had a procedure for lysis of intra-abdominal adhesions and was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service on [**10-7**] with chest pain.
At that time they noted a perforation of her previous jejunojejunostomy secondary to an adhesive obstruction.
During the procedure, there were some small bowel contents filled into the intra-abdominal cavity and a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.
The patient completed a course of Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl after the operation.
She first developed a pneumonia with Senna Trepomonas.
On [**10-18**], her sputum culture revealed 2+ Senna Trepomonas which was Levofloxacin sensitive as well as 2+ yeast.
On [**10-23**], her Clostridium difficile toxin was positive and she was treated with a course of Flagyl.
Toprol XL 25 mg q. day 2.

Right side leads were negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] and Surgical Intensive Care Unit course as above.
She had a pulse of 79, blood pressure 100/56 sating 100% on a ventilator set with pressure support of 18 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, FIO2 40%.
Her sputum cultures as in history of present illness on [**10-18**] grew Senna Trepomonas sensitive to Levofloxacin and yeast.
The patient was transferred to us with her main issue being failure to wean from ventilator as well as question of how to best manage her congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy.
She also at that time was reported to have increased white count and glucose as well as a history of anxiety and benzodiazepine addiction.
Medications on transfer included intravenous Lasix prn, Lopressor, Captopril, subcutaneous Heparin, Fioricet, Prozac, Levoxyl, Klonopin, Haldol, TUMS, magnesium oxide, iron, Prevacid and after transfer to our service we titrated up her Captopril, we added Aldactone and we also added Digoxin.
We tried to wean down her pressure support over the first several days, however, the patient was not able to successfully be weaned.
On [**11-12**], the patient had a tracheostomy placed at the bedside without any complications.
She continued to receive her tube feeds.
She had some slightly liquid stools, therefore we changed her tube feeds to a tube feed with more fiber.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy interviewed the patient.
It was decided that after the tracheostomy the patient would need time to let that heal so it was decided to just continue the tube feeds and let her have a swallow evaluation and otorhinolaryngology evaluation after discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
The patient remains stable and plan to change her Lopressor and Captopril to a q. day medication.
