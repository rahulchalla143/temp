Admission Date:  [**2157-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3513**] Chief Complaint: right facial pain, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 87151**] is an 81 year old gentleman with a history notable for CAD, hypertension, afib off coumadin, PVD s/p left and right carotid end arterectomy, and type II DM who came to the ED on [**2157-9-21**] with a chief complaint of right sided facial pain and hypotension.
I spoke with the patient's PCP who says that he began ramping up the patient's tegretol up to the most recent dose of 400 mg of tegretol SR.
The PCP discontinued the patient's coumadin (for afib) as a result of these falls.
He was discharged on Monday ([**2157-9-19**]) from NWH on 400 mg tegretol SR [**Hospital1 **] as well as a neurontin 200 mg PO TID.
In addition to the neurontin, he has been taking percocet Q2-4 hours to manage his pain.
The patient had taken percocet that morning.
After 2L IVF bolus his BP improved to SBP 92, and another 2L NS of fluid were given and bp stabilized at 128.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease with angina PVD s/p bilateral CEA with residual right-sided facial numbness Type 2 DM Arthritis bilaterally in his hands Hypertension Carpal tunnel syndrome status post release s/p TURP for benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p knee surgery for cartilage tear.
There was a question of an opacity on portable chest x-ray, but f/u PA and lateral films were more suggestive of atelectasis than infection and the patient had no clinical evidence of infection.
The patient had taken percocet on the morning of presentation and this provided a very likely explanation.
The patients family expressed concern that he has not been taking his medications correctly and so med effect was considered a possible cause.
MI and tamponade were considered, but the patient ruled out in the ED and had a bedside u/s negative for tamponade in the ED.
He was followed on telemetry and did not show evidence of a new arrythmia.
He was maintained on his home BP med regimen during this admission with a change in his metoprolol to Toprol XL 200mg daily.
As such, his metoprolol was increased to Toprol XL 200mg daily and Cardizem SR 120mg [**Hospital1 **].
He came in on tegretol, neurontin, and percocet for control of his pain.
The patient was continued on his 800 mg/day of tegretol without neurontin and percocet and his pain improved dramatically on the first day.
The neurontin and percocet were discontinued due to mental status changes on admission.
They felt that no additional w/u was needed and recommended that the patient be started on lyrica (pregabalin) which was titrated up to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
He can hold these medications for increased sedation .
As such, we will leave the decision about restarting coumadin up to the PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 92837**], the patient will taper off of tegretol and this will make dosing the coumadin easier.
His rate was controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem as outlined above and he should continue on the long-acting forms of these medications after discharge, as detailed.
# DM: The patient's glyburide and metformin were held and he was started on an insulin sliding scale.
