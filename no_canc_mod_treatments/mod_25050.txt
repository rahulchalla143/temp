ACTIVE ISSUES: # Aortic stenosis: Critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-29**], NYHA stage IV diastolic CHF.
Pt diuresed gently with lasix given preload dependence.
On hospital day 2, pt had flash pulmonary edema as lasix was held in the am.
He was transferred to the CCU after morphine, lasix bolus, and on a non-rebreather.
He was given diuril and lasix gtt, and produced good UOP.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2167**], has stable coronary artery and graft disease on cath in [**10-30**] (prox Cx 100% stenosis, prox RCA 100% stenosis, all grafts widely patent.
He was continued on ASA 81mg.
He was given cautious diuresis initially.
However, as above, pt had flash pulmonary edema, and required transfer to CCU overnight for brief use of CPAP, and diuresis with lasix and diuril.
He was maintained on a fluid restricted, low sodium diet.
# Tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**]: EP evaluation and interrogation of ICD/PPM to determnine whether it needs to be suppressed during the valve procedure, which will involve rapid right ventricular pacing (up to 200 bpm) during balloon valvuloplasty and 110 BPM during valve placement.
He was started on Bipap with improvement in his oxygenation and ventilation.
His foley catheter became displaced during transfer necessitating removal and replacement with coude catheter with subsequent mild hematuria.
The patient was diuresed with diuril and a lasix gtt once his catheter was in proper postion.
He diuresed well, and was weaned off Bipap within 3 hours to 50% face mask.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-procedurally was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-procedure  weight.
By the time of discharge on post-procedure day 6, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
