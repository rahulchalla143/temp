She takes four units of NPH insulin in the morning and checks her sugars frequently during the day, about five to six times responding by skipping meals for high sugars and taking snacks for low sugars, but little use of the regular insulin.
The patient here was reduced to 20 units of insulin NPH in the morning and giving her regular insulin sliding scale which controlled her sugars well.
The patient's Levothyroxine was increased from 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day.
