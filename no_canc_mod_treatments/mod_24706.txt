Endotracheal intubation.
History of Present Illness: 25 y/o M w/ history of hyperlipidemia and obesity, with the diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, as determined by wedge biopsy following a two-month workup for dyspnea.
On day of admission he was scheduled for a bronch but was hypoxic on room air and dyspnic.
The patient went to the [**Hospital1 18**] OR on [**4-7**] for whole right lung lavage, where he had 10 L of normal saline infusion, with all 10 liters successfully lavaged.
He tolerated the procedure well, but reportedly had no subjective improvement of his dyspnea.
He was hypoxic to the mid-80's during the procedure, and the procedure was aborted.
His ETT was changed from a double lumen to single lumen, with position confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

He subsequently had a right wedge resection of the right lower lobe, with pathology consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
Non-IV contrast limits full evaluation of the great mediastinal vessels, but vascular variant is noted, including a right-sided aortic arch and a right-sided descending aorta.
There are separate aortic origins for the right subclavian and right internal carotid artery.
Aortic variant including a right-sided aortic arch and right-sided descending aorta, aberrant left subclavian artery, and separate origins of the right common carotid and subclavian arteries.
A single channel ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet.
[**2162-4-12**]: In the interval, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube have been removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 25 y/o M with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, s/p bilateral whole lung lavages.
Did require intubation and ventilation in MICU.
# Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: Patient underwent whole lavage of right lung with all fluid removed.
However, he continued to experience symptoms so he underwent left lung labage also.
About 1 liter of normal saline was not retrieved from lung during left lung lavage and patient developed pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, likely representing interstitial diffusion of lavage fluid.
He was intially on 4L of oxygen but this was weaned quite quickly.
Patient has been on home oxygen in the past.
He was advised to continue home oxygen as needed, i.e.
Patient will follow-up with outpatient pulmonologist in [**State 1727**] as well as with interventional pulmonary at [**Hospital1 18**].

Oxygen Continue using your home oxygen as needed   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis  Secondary: Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for further treatment of your lung disease, called "pulmonary alveolar proteinosis."
You underwent two procedures to help your breathing.
You were admitted to the ICU after the procedure and did very well so you were transferred to the medicine floor for further care.
Please resume your medications as prescribed by your outpatient providers  If you develop fevers or shortness of breath, please contact your primary care physician or go to the emergency department immediately.
