is a 68 year old with a history of aortic dissection s/p arch repair and fem-fem bypass, started on coumadin [**7-19**] for clot in the bypass, who presents with nausea/vomiting, and feeling off balance since friday (3 days PTA), found to have a cerebellar hemorrhage on OSH head CT.  Pt.
INR was checked and was 3.97, and he was given Vitamin K 10 mg PO x 1.
Here he received Profiline x 2 vials at 14:30.
Past Medical History: - aortic dissection with aortic hemiarch repair, aortic root repair, femoral to femoral bypass, and RLE fasciotomy for compartment syndrome - multiple bilateral strokes (right parietal and bilateral frontal) thought to be embolic from aortic arch repair, initially with some residual L facial droop and L hand weakness, now resolved per family and pt.
- Left ear surgery for decreased hearing - L vitreous hemorrhage, L retinal detachment s/p surgical repair   Social History: Pt is a retired machinist.
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
CTA OF THE THORACIC AORTA: The patient is status post ascending aortic repair with ascending aortic graft visualized.
The soft tissue at the level of the aortic root including the aortic graft measures 59.7 x 57.6 mm, previously 53.6 x 53.9 mm.
Overall interval increase in the size of the soft tissue at the aortic root/site of ascending aortic graft with increased size of the pseudoaneurysm medial to the site of the anastomosis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-7-31**] 9:56 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalu  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man with midline cerebellar hemorrhage in the setting of coumadin use REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus given mass effect on 4th on OSH CT CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Stool and gas is seen in the large bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a very pleasant 68 year old gentleman with history of aortic dissection s/p arch repair and fem-fem bypass, multiple embolic strokes felt to be due to the surgery, with no residual deficits per the patient prior to this admission, also hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presented with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and gait ataxia.
The most likely etiology of his hemorrhage is due to the recent initiation of Coumadin and hypertension, however an underlying mass lesion could not be ruled out.
1) Cerebellar Hemorrhage- The patient was symptomatic for 3 days prior to presentation, and likely had already reached the peak of edema, however there was evidenc by CT for pressure on the 4th ventricle.
He did not require surgical decompression or other surgical intervention.
His INR was reversed with profiline and vitamin K. Given the location in the posterior fossa and risk of brain stem compression, he was admitted to the Neuro-ICU for observation and started on mannitol diuresis.
His blood pressure was tightly managed on his home regimen in combination with a labetalol gtt.
He was later changed to his home regimen alone with excellent blood pressure regulation.
His neurologic examination remained stable in combination with stable head CT. His gait ataxia persists necessitating acute rehab placement.
His cochlear implant and clip for his vitreous hemorrhage will need to be cleared for this MR examination.
2) Aortic dissection- Cardiac surgery was consulted for possible widened mediastinum by admission chest xray.
This was considered to be an expected finding with aortic grafts and no further intervention was warranted.
He was continued on Dyazide, Altace, and Norvasc and metoprolol TID for tight BP control.
3) Femoral Bypass Graft Thrombus- Coumadin was held on admission given hemorrhage.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] would like to be contact[**Name (NI) **] for further discussion should Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] feel coumadin therapy is warranted.
Aggressive bowel regimen relieved his symptoms significantly.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 75 TID ASA 81 mg QD Colace Norvasc 10 mg QD Zocor 40 mg QD Dyazide 37.5-25 QD Altace 5 mg QD Coumadin 2.5 mg QD (started [**7-19**] for clot in bypass)   Discharge Medications: 1.
Simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, T > 100.4.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

Amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazid 37.5-25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap PO DAILY (Daily).
This was likely related to coumadin use.
Do not take coumadin or aspirin until you are seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in vascular surgery, if Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] would like to start coumadin he should confer with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Neurology) prior to doing so.
Please continue to take all medications only as listed in this discharge summary.
Please call for a follow up appointment to see your cardiac surgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding your aortic graft in 3 months.
