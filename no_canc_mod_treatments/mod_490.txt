He was noted to be hypotensive, but was not responsive to IVF resusitation.
As a result, he was placed on norepinepherine.

Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
Evidence of right heart failure with congested liver, periportal edema, trace ascites, and gallbladder edema (no evidence to suggest cholecystitis).
Age-indeterminate T12 compression fracture  [**2147-9-27**] CXR: CONCLUSION:  New right PICC in standard position, terminating in the low SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o parkinson's disease, chronic respiratory failure (s/p trach, ventilator dependent) admitted to the ICU with acute encephalopathy, UTI and pneumonia.
Despite large volume IVF resuscitation and urine electrolytes showing a pre-renal picture, the patient's creatinine continued to worsen.
A family meeting was held on HD#4 with the patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **], to discuss the patient's poor overall clinical status as well as his progressive, likely irrevocable, renal failure and the decision was made to pursue comfort care options at that time in concert with his wife's understanding of his wishes given the clinical circumstances.
The patient became progressively bradycardic during HD #3, and by 19:35 he progressed to asystole on telemetry monitoring.
His ventilator settings were optimized by increasing TV and PEEP in an effort to assist him with clearing his acidemia.
Due to his extensive wheezing on examination, he was started on albuterol and ipratropium MDIs through the ventilator to aid with bronchidilation, as well as methylprednisolone to help reduce airway inflammation.
His respiratory exam improved throughout his ICU course on this regimen, and his ventilator settings were weaned back to his baseline.
Norepinephrine was titrated to maintain MAPs > 60, and the patient recieved IVF boluses for BP support as well.
The patient was started initially on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for broad spectrum empiric coverage, which was titrated down to ceftriaxone in the setting of his sputum culture results.
He was maintained on the antibiotic regimen stated above, and final urine cultures were negative.
# Acute encephalopathy: Multifactorial etiology, with contributions from CO2 retention, hyponatremia, and infection.
Just with IVF given in the ED his serum sodium began to slowly correct, although he subsequently deteriorated while in the ICU.
# Glaucoma: The patient was continued on his home regimen of Latanoprost, Artificial Tears  # Parkinson's Disease: The patient was continued on his home regimen of sinemet, entacapone, mirapex   Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation.
