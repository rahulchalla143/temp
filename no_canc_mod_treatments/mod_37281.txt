She received Lopressor for her blood pressure, and a head computed tomography showed a small acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern and fourth ventricle.
The patient was given Demerol for pain and Phenergan for nausea and vomiting.
She was to have arterial line put in.
At that time, it was decided to put a ventriculostomy drain in place.

Her head computed tomography showed good placement of the ventriculostomy drain.
Her ventriculostomy drain at this point was at 15 cm of water.
The patient was requiring hydralazine, captopril, and metoprolol to maintain her blood pressure at less than 140.
Her captopril was increased on [**7-11**] to maintain her blood pressure at less than 160.
At this point, she still continued to have her ventriculostomy drain in.
On [**7-13**], the patient's ventriculostomy drain was raised to 20.
The patient did have a subclavian quad-lumen catheter placed on [**7-14**] for intravenous access to receive her vancomycin.
On [**7-15**], the ventriculostomy drain was clamped.
Her ventriculostomy drain was discontinued on [**7-15**] earlier in the day, and she had done well.
At that point, the patient was started on amlodipine 30 mg q.4h.
Her blood pressure medications were readjusted so she was only on Lopressor 25 mg twice per day.
She was already on subcutaneous heparin which was continued.
The patient was also continued on intravenous fluids at 100 cc per hour.
Her central line was discontinued.
Her Foley catheter was discontinued.
