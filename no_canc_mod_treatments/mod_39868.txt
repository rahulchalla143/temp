Admission Date:  [**2120-3-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-4-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-2-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nafcillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: knee pain, drainage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left knee total knee replacement resection with antibiotic spacer, left knee Irrigation and Debridement paracentesis, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage   History of Present Illness: 54yo male referred in to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of reported increase in pain and drainage from knee surgical incision site.
Patient reports surgical incision staples were removed late last week and he noticed fluid dripping down his leg intermittently since [**2120-3-10**], while ambulating with physical therapy.
Patient reports increase in activity with physical therapy on [**2120-3-12**], leading to some increased diffuse knee pain that completely resolved at rest.

Status post total knee arthroplasty without evidence of hardware failure.
Expected post surgical changes including soft tissue swelling as well as a surgical drain are noted.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcification, right, left, and left anterior descending segments.
[**2120-3-23**] Bilataral LE U/S: Complete thrombosis of the left anterior gastrocnemius vein (communicating vein/perforator vein) of the left calf.
The changes are suspicious of non-recent pneumonia, combined to atelectasis, which has already been suspected on previous chest films.
Stable appearance of the IVC filter, post-pyloric NG tube, rectal tube, and Foley catheter.
[**2120-4-3**] Bilateral UE U/S: Occlusion of the distal segment of the right radial artery, without evidence of flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old man with EtOH cirrhosis, recent MSSA bacteremia with left septic prosthetic knee and left septic shoulder, initially admitted to the ortho service with increased drainage from the left knee, s/p L TKA resection, with course complicated by development of hypoxemic respiratory distress requiring transfer to the MICU.
# GOALS OF CARE: After discussions between the MICU team and the patient's wife and family members, the decision was made to focus on comfort measures.
Was concern patient may have aspirated in setting of AMS [**2-14**] hepatic encephalopathy, and also concern for volume overload in setting of multiple recent transfusions given elevated JVP.
Patient briefly improved following administration of lasix, though given continued decline in respiratory status patient transferred to MICU for further monitoring.
Started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/cefepime given concern for HCAP.
Was already on cipro for L knee infection, with ID following, though ID felt cipro could be stopped [**3-20**] given broader coverage with vanc/cefepime.
Restrictive physiology from worsening ascites and abdominal distension was also felt to be contributing, though diuresis initially limited secondary to [**Last Name (un) **].
Once renal function initially improved, patient started back on lasix, was weaned to 2L NC, and underwent paracentesis with removal of 3L peritoneal fluid on [**3-21**].
Patient was electively intubated for return to OR on [**3-25**] and remained intubated post-operatively.
Antibiotic course continued through [**3-30**], for total of 13 day course of treatment for presumed HCAP.
Was also thought that PNA may have been chemical insult from aspiration, as patient did not significantly improve on broad spectrum abx.
As below, patient started on CRRT on [**4-3**], and chest imaging did show improvement in bilateral pulmonary congestion.
Patient's vent settings were changed from assist control to pressure support, and patient did well, though extubation was limited by patient's mental status.
Patient was intubated on [**3-25**] for return to OR, and given initial sedation with propofol, and later with fent/midaz, was difficult to fully assess mental status.
However, patient weaned off all sedation, but remained unresponsive to voice and was not following commands.
# HYPOTENSION: Patient was on phenylephrine following intubation on [**3-25**], though this was weaned off within several days with stabilization of BP.
Patient had recurrent hypotension when starting on HD; was switched to CRRT and had arterial line placed for closer monitoring on [**4-3**].
Also received small fluid boluses as needed for recurrent hypotension.
Renal consulted, and felt presentation most c/w ischemic injury based on presence of granular casts and sheets of hyaline casts in urine.
Was some concern for HRS, given low urine Na, though patient was responsive to albumin challenge and maintained good urine output initially.
Went to IR for placement of temp HD line on [**4-1**], and was started on HD later that day with about 500cc volume removed.
Given hypotension occurring during HD, but desire to remove volume given persistent respiratory distress, patient started on CRRT on [**4-2**] to allow removal of greater volume.
Goal was for removal of 100-200cc/hr if BP would tolerate, and arterial line placed for closer BP monitoring.
HD line clogged on [**4-4**], though became patent again after administration of TPA.
Was on daptomycin and cefazolin, which had been started for MSSA bacteremia and VRE bacteremia during previous admission.
Patient taken to OR and all hardware was removed on [**3-15**].
Joint fluid culture did grow pseudomonas, and patient started on cipro.
Patient's JP drain removed while patient in ICU, though patient continued to have oozing from left knee given underlying coagulopathy from his liver disease.
Patient transfused additional 2 units pRBCs in ICU, and also given vitamin K given elevated INR.
Given concern about developing fluid pocket in right knee, with rise in patient's WBC, patient taken back to OR on [**3-25**] for I&D of left knee via arthrotomy, removal of antibiotic spacer and insertion of new spacer.
Patient electively intubated for procedure, and remained intubated post-op.
Had about 1.5L blood loss during operation, requiring additional transfusions of pRBCS and FFP.
Patient continued on antibiotics throughout his hospital course (see below), though when antibiotic course for multifocal PNA completed on [**3-30**], patient switched back to cefazolin for planned 6 week course of treatment of L septic knee, scheduled to end [**4-27**].
Patient initially continued on home regimen of spironolactone and lasix, as well as [**Month/Day (4) 89638**], though spironolactone and lasix later stopped in setting of worsening renal function.
[**Month/Day (4) **] was increased to 45 mg QID because patient was not having bowel movements and was felt to be developing hepatic encephalopathy.
Had repeat paracentesis [**3-21**] with removal of 3L fluid, and another paracentesis on [**3-25**] which was also negative for SBP.
Dobhoff placed in OR on [**3-25**] for increased nutritional support, and patient continued on thiamine and folate.
Started on heparin gtt, though drip stopped prior to patient's return to OR on [**3-25**] for I&D of left knee and replacement of antibiotic spacer.
Given surgery and concern for ongoing blood loss post-operatively, patient could not be anticoagulated and therefore had IVC filter placed.
He was continued on prophylactic heparin.
# DIARRHEA: Patient noted to have increased stool output on [**3-23**], and which was felt to be multifactorial from increased [**Month/Year (2) 89638**] dosing and antibiotic course.
Was concern for C. diff given hospital course and antibiotic administration, and patient was started empirically on IV flagyl.
Several stool samples negative for C. diff, and flagyl eventually stopped [**3-29**] after C. diff PCR came back negative.
Foley replaced, and eventually removed [**4-5**] as patient anuric.
