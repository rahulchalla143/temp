If the patient continues to have symptoms and clinical concern exists for malposition of tube, a dedicated antegrade nephrostomy tube study would be recommended.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65 year old female with history of MS, dementia, neurogenic bladder with indwelling foley, b/l calculi s/p left nephrostomy presenting with fatige and found to have urosepsis.
She has been considered for lithotripsy of left UVJ stone in past but thought to be high risk due to cardiac co-morbidities.
Patient was found to have foul-smelling urine from foley and purulent material emanating from nephrostomy tube in the ER.
She was started on low-dose peripheral levophed and transferred to the MICU.
She was started on meropenem for likely ESBL E. coli and vancomycin.
A Dobhoff tube was inserted and the patient was started on tube feeds.
A goals of care discussion was had with the patient's husband, and it was decided that the patient would seek comfort measures only (see below).
Her antibiotics were discontinued upon discharge.
After a long discussion, it was decided that the patient would be continued on IV antibiotics and tube feeds while inpatient.
The patient's husband wished to keep patient comfort at the forefront, but wanted to continue interventions until the patient either declined or discontinued them herself.
IV antibiotics were discontinued, as they would require PICC placement, which would not have been consistent with pt and husband's goals of care.
The patient's home baclofen and cyclobenzaprine were continued while inpatient.
She was continued on her ipratropium and fluticasone at home doses and she was given O2 by nasal canula as needed.
