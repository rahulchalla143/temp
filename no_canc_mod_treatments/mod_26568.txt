Mural fatty replacement of the ascending colon, suggestive of sequela of a prior inflammatory process.
Status post mitral valve replacement.
MICRO: Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2199-8-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
Patient was supratherapeutic on warfarin (INR 14), which was held initially.
Flex sigmoidoscopy was unrevealing.
CTA and CT-abdomen/pelvis were unrevealing.
GI performed EGD and colonoscopy and found diverticuli but no definitive sources of bleeding.
The patient was treated with IVF and proton pump inhibitors and his bleeding remained stable for the rest of the admission.
The patient had a single recorded fever during his stay, and he was started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for empiric treatment of a GI infection.
# Mechanical mitral valve replacment on warfarin with goal INR 2.5-3.5.
Given INR of 14 on admission, warfarin was held.
Heparin drip started when INR decreased below 2, while Coumadin was still being held.
Once the patient's GI workup was complete (as above) with no further bleeding, warfarin was restarted.
The INR responded slowly so heparin drip bridging was switched to enoxaparin bridging on discharge.
Chronic Issues: # HTN: The patient's home metoprolol was initially held, but was restarted on [**2199-8-5**].
Transitional Issues: 1) The patient will need follow-up of his INR to therapeutic range of 2.5-3.5 before discontinuing his enoxaparin bridging.

We treated you with blood products, IV fluids, pain medications, and agents to lower your INR.
We also stopped your warfarin(coumadin) and started you on a heparin drip for your mechanical valve.
Unfortunately, we could not find a definitive source of your symptoms.
We restarted your warfarin (Coumadin)and put you on heparin drip as we waited for your INR to return to its normal range.
Please note the following changes to your medications: You should START taking Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and Metronidazole (Flagyl) antibiotics until you finish the full course.
You may continue the rest of your medications as previously prescribed.
