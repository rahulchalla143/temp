HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially presented to the  [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**2150-4-25**], after suffering a left hip fracture (displaced subcapital fracture).
On admission to [**Hospital3 417**] she was placed in Bucks traction while various medical workup occurred in preparation for planned unipolar hemiarthroplasty.
She was given a course of amoxicillin for "bronchitis."
They felt she should be transfused with platelets before and after the surgery.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Rehab on [**4-29**] for aggressive wound care in the hopes that hip surgery could be performed around the end of [**Month (only) **].
She has had a cough that she says is old and chronic; minimal sputum production was reported.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung cancer relative unknown at time of dictation at present.
Several scattered dark non-tender distal bullae approximately 3-4 mm diameter on toes bilaterally.
Albumin 14.
ALT 36, CK 96, LDH 222, total protein 5.1, albumin 2.4.
At that time it was Dr.[**Name (NI) 2989**] opinion that the patient would not be a candidate for surgery until her decubitus ulcer infection was controlled.
The patient would be started on deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and Nutrition would be consulted along with Psychiatry secondary to the patient's dysthymia regarding her medical condition.
At that time it was recommended that the patient be started on Remeron at 7.5 mg to help with her anxiety and depressed mood.
On this date it was felt that the patient would be able to have the surgery and was actually typed, screened and cross-matched for two units of packed red blood cells in preparation for surgery.
The patient was started on 60 mg of intravenous Lasix on the morning of [**5-15**] and 80 mg of intravenous Lasix in the p.m. with only 300 cc of diuresis.
At this time it was felt that the patient was a poor operative candidate and the surgery would have to be postponed.
The patient had had left bundle branch block according to her outpatient cardiologist and also had a history of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion and on the [**5-15**] the patient was found to be in right bundle branch block.
The Cardiology consult felt that the patient would benefit from nesiritide as well as Lasix and transferred to ______ Two or Three (Cardiology floors) when available.
The goal for diuresis would be one to two liters per day and to follow the oxygenation lung examination and chest x-ray.
Of note, wound care per protocol was applied to the decubitus ulcer.
The patient was continued on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
The insulin sliding scale was adjusted accordingly.
[**2150-5-17**]:  The patient was transferred to the Cardiology floor (Far three) and nesiritide drip was started at 0.01 mcg/kg/min.
The patient's diuresis was slightly improved at 400 cc in two hours on nesiritide and Lasix 80 mg IV times one.
Repeat chest x-ray showed persistent congestive heart failure with effusions as described above.
The patient's nesiritide drip was increased to 0.15 mcg/kg.
At this point the patient was becoming increasingly frustrated with the progress of her medical conditions.
Substantial discussion was conducted regarding the need for intracardiac monitoring while the patient was being diuresed.
The patient, however, was extremely reluctant to undergo additional interventions such as Swan-Ganz catheter placement and was actually scheduled for the Operating Room on [**2150-5-18**], despite her poor oxygenation at 99% on five liters nasal cannula and poor diuresis (CHF).
Upon further discussion, the patient agreed to go to the Coronary Care Unit for intracardiac monitoring during her diuresis and on [**2150-5-18**], she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.
In the Coronary Care Unit a pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the left subclavian with CVP 25, PA pressure 57/28, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 30, cardiac output 6.6, cardiac index 3.9, SVR 21.
[**2150-5-19**]:  The patient continued to be hemodynamically stable, was breathing at 97% on three liters with an increased pulmonary artery pressure at 64/30.
[**2150-5-20**]:  The patient's levofloxacin and Flagyl was discontinued after cultures showed no growth and the chest x-ray was most consistent with congestive heart failure.
The patient was started on hydralazine 25 q.i.d.
At this point the patient's only antibiotic was vancomycin 750 mg IV q.o.d.
At this time the patient was on hydralazine 25 q.i.d., Lasix 10 mg drip per hour, metolazone 5 mg b.i.d.
and nesiritide 0.02 mcg/kg/min, _____ 25 q.i.d.
Due to the fact that the Swan-Ganz catheter was no longer needed but central access was still desired, the patient had her subclavian line changed using the Seldinger technique to a triple lumen catheter in the usual sterile fashion.
Possibly as a result of the decreased platelets and/or uremic platelets, it was difficult to attain adequate hemostasis post procedure, therefore, lidocaine with epinephrine was injected at the site.
After applying direct pressure for 30 minutes, finally after lidocaine with epinephrine adequate hemostasis was achieved.
[**2150-5-22**]:  Due to the fact the patient's pulmonary artery pressures had declined and central intracardiac monitoring was no longer required, the patient was transferred to the floor on Natrecor drip at 0.02 mcg/kg/min, hydralazine 20 q.i.d., Lasix 20 mg drip per hour.
[**2150-5-23**]:  The patient's Natrecor and Lasix drip were discontinued as it was felt by the primary team as well as the CHF Service that the patient was back to her baseline dry weight of 65.5 kilograms and her lung examination had improved.
Of note, the patient's hematocrit had dropped to 29.5 and she was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient was made NPO after midnight in anticipation of the repair of her left minimally displaced subcapital femur fracture on [**2150-5-24**].
[**2150-5-24**]:  A left hip hemiarthroplasty was performed.
Intraoperatively the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and [**Pager number **] cc of lactated Ringer's.
The patient completed the surgery without complications and was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.
