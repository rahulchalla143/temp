The patient was initially managed with Captopril, Lopressor, and aspirin; however, several episodes of spontaneously increased blood pressure over the course of his two hospital admission days resulted in the addition of nitroglycerin paste for additional pressure control.
Following extensive discussions with this patient and his family regarding the risks and benefits of surgical intervention, the patient was scheduled for an emergent coronary artery bypass graft procedure on [**2126-3-28**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a CABG times three with anastomosis from the LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to the PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
Total bypass time was 71 minutes; cross clamp time was 37 minutes.
The patient's pericardium was left open; intraoperative lines placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter; two ventricular wires and one atrial and one ground wire were placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed.
On transfer, the patient was on a propofol drip.
Shortly following arrival in the CSRU, the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication.
On postoperative day number five, the patient was begun on Norvasc to good effect and was thereafter noted to have reasonable blood pressure control for the remainder of his stay.
On postoperative day number three, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] diabetes consult was also obtained to assist the patient in home training and dietary control of his diabetes.
The patient was subsequently advised to refrain from ingestion of opiate pain medications and demonstrated progressive relief from his pruritic symptoms over the following days with therapy via Benadryl and Sarna lotion.
In addition, the patient demonstrated intermittent episodes of respiratory wheezing which were responsive to Albuterol nebulizer treatments.
The patient was subsequently trained in the use of an Albuterol inhaler following clear x-ray studies demonstrating no evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.
Following the removal of his Foley catheter, the patient failed a voiding trial and required reinsertion of the catheter with a postvoid residual noted of 925 cc.
The patient was noted to have mild persistent respiratory wheezing responsive to Albuterol inhaler treatment, as well as steadily improving opioid related pruritus.
