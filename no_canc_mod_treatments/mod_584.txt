History of Present Illness: 43 y/o male with h/o HTN who developed SSCP nonradiating associated with arm/feet tingling around 12:30PM.
He was given ASA, nitro gtt, morphine, heparin, IV lopressor 10 mg, NS, plavix 600, lipitor 80, and KCl 40.
[**Hospital1 18**] cath revealed normal hemodynamics, 99% LAD lesion with thrombus s/p thrombectomy.
EKG: NSR at 77, left axis deviation, normal interval, 1 mm STE I, aVL, 1-2 mm STE V2-6, TWI V2-V6, aVf, poor R wave progression  Pertinent Results: [**2145-9-7**] WBC-8.0 RBC-3.78* Hgb-12.5* Hct-33.1* MCV-88 MCH-33.0* MCHC-37.7* RDW-18.2* Plt Ct-337 Glucose-110* UreaN-10 Creat-0.9 Na-142 K-3.4 Cl-106 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 calTIBC-263 Ferritn-308 TRF-202 .
The LAD had a 99% proximal occlusion with freshthrombus which was excised with an exciser and export catheter.The LCXhadnoangiographic evidence of flow limiting stenosis.
Successful thrombectomy was performed with an Exciser and Export catheters in the proximal LAD.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD was performed with a 3.5x18mm Cypher stent postdilated to 4.0 mm.
Residual distal LAD thrombus partially lysed with manual manipulation.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca/stenting and thrombectomy of the LAD.
EF 35%  Brief Hospital Course: 43 y/o male with h/o HTN who presented to OSH with STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
He was found to have a large proximal LAD lesion which was stented with a Cypher stent x 1 and underwent thrombectomy.
He was transferred to the CCU post-cath on a nitro gtt for further monitoring and management.
Nitro gtt was weaned and he was started on oral BP agents.
He was maintained on ASA 325 mg PO daily and Plavix 75 mg PO daily.
He was on an integrillin gtt post cath which remained for 48 hours post-cath secondary to large thrombus componenet to LAD lesion.
He was started on a BB and ACEI.
He had an echo performed the next day after cath which revealed apical akinesis and he was started on a heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation.
He was started on Coumadin and was discharged on Lovenox for bridging.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will continue Lovenox until INR is in target range.
He was started on atorvastatin 80 mg daily and that will be managed as an outpatiet by PCP and cardiology follow up.
