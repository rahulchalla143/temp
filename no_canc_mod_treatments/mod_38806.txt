Given the above findings a leak at the gastric repair site cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Surgical ICU on pressors, had a central line and arterial line placed and then was taken to the OR for emergent  reopening of recent laparotomy with gastric wall biopsy and [**Location (un) **] patch of gastric perforation.
Post-operatively, he was transferred back to the Surgical ICU intubated, sedated, on pressor support, NPO with IVF and an NGT.
His hospital course as follows by systems: Neuro: Fentanyl and midazolam were used for sedation/pain control while intubated.
He was treated with Zyprexa with good effect.
Pt received quetiapine prn confusion while on floor.
He was readmitted to the ICU on [**2121-1-8**], shown to have a collections on CT scan and taken to the OR on [**2121-1-9**] for exploration and washout.
He returned intubated and sedated and his post-op course was complicated by hemodynamic instability and a need for pressors and prolonged ventilation.
He was kept intubated during this time and appropriately sedated.
CV: Patient was initially hemodynamically unstable likely due to sepsis from abdominal source and required multiple pressors in the initial pre and post-operative period which was ultimately weaned to a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**], Levophed.
Patient developed SVT on POD#5 that was controlled with metoprolol and then diltiazem drip/ Patient was started on intermittent Lasix for diuresis and Diltiazem drip was converted to po.
Patient was rate controlled and hemodynamically stable upon transfer from the ICU, and was maintained on diltiazem PO on floor, which was kept in lieu of home carvedilol.
He was on pressors postoperatively which were gradually weaned off with fluid resuscitation.
Patient was extubated on POD#4, and was gradually weaned off of supplemental O2.
Patient was re intubated for surgery on [**2121-1-9**] and kept on ventilator postoperatively.
He was gradually weaned off the vent with assistance from diuresis by CVVH, until he was extubated on [**2121-1-20**].
He was weaned off oxygen and had normal sats on room air.
GI: After abdominal washout and repair of the perforation in the OR, he was kept NPO with NGT and IVF.
JP drain was also placed in the OR, output was measured daily and it was removed with minimal serous drainage.
He received [**Hospital1 **] Protonix and was kept on antibiotics (please see ID section for more information).
Despite drainage and washout, patient had persistent fevers and leukocytosis.
Percutaneous drainage of the fluid collections seen on CT was performed on [**2121-1-18**].
NGT was kept in place and patient was tolerated tube feeds via Jtube.
He will be discharged with the drains in place and when he returns for outpatient follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic a log with his drain output should accompany him.
He continues to receive his tube feedings which were changed to Two Cal HN Full strength from the Nepro formula given his electrolyte imbalances.
His Cr was 2.5 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and was monitored, trending down to 0.8. he was also noted with scrotal edema, likely related to low albumin and aggressive fluid resuscitation while septic.
Edema improved with elevation and diuresis with Lasix.
Nephrology team was consulted and he was started on CVVH which lasted from [**Date range (1) 91863**].
His urine output gradually improved and he was treated with high dose Lasix towards the end of his course of CVVH, to which he responded well.
His K+ was low intermittently and was repleted accordingly; he was also noted with hypernatremia up to 150 and was ordered for free water flushes per Nephrology recommendation.
No further plans for dialysis per Nephrology despite his rising creatinine- it was felt that this would improve ove time and to continue with close monitoring of his electrolytes.
The dialysis catheter was removed prior to discharge.
He did receive 2 units of blood on [**1-11**] for a low hematocrit in the setting of persistent need for pressors, and was transfused another 1 unit PRBC on [**2121-1-24**] for a Hct of 22 (mostly stable but down-trending) in the setting of tachycardia.
SQ heparin and venodyne prophylaxis was in effect throughout his stay.
He was kept on Zosyn, but fluconazole was stopped on HD 13.
He was restarted on antibiotics at this time, vancomycin and Zosyn, which was changed multiple times to different regimens (including vanc/Cipro/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] at one point) but ultimately tailored to an antibiotic course of meropenem.
Full course length and list of antibiotics that were used: [**Last Name (un) **] [**Date range (1) 91864**]/12 Vanco [**Date range (1) 91865**] Cipro [**Date range (1) 91866**] Zosyn [**Date range (1) **] Flagyl [**Date range (1) 29260**] Fluconazole (d/c'd [**1-15**])  His WBC count increased around the time of his recurrent sepsis, peaked at 24.9 and slowly and gradually decreased to 9.0 upon discharge from ICU to the floor on [**2121-1-24**].
He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended for an acute level of rehabilitaton care after his hospital stay.
