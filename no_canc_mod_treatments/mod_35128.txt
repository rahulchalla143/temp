# Mental status: Initial differential included seizure, toxic-metabolic (hyponatremia), stroke unlikely given CTA imaging, CNS infection (initially afebrile but then developed fever on arrival).
Started empirically on Ceftriazone and Vancomycin.
Hyponatremia resolved with normal saline administration.
# Elevated CK: This was thought initially to be an effect of a seizure.
The large increase however may have been related to succinylcholine given in intubation.
# Respiratory Failure: Intubated in the setting of obtundation and possible seizure.
