Pt was empirically started on IV Acyclovir pending results of viral testing.
PICC line was placed and placement confirmed.
Neurology also ordered a Voltage-gated K channel antibody test for further eval, and this is pending.
Anti-TPO was checked and elevated in setting of hypothyroidism.
PT/OT was consulted it was felt that pt would benefit from continued supervision given persistent confusion.
On day of discharge, pt was still only AOx1-2 (self and sometimes place), but alert and interactive.
Only new medication recently is levofloxacin (for presumed UTI), so SIADH secondary to Levofloxacin is possible but it has not been traditionally associated with SIADH.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with SIADH, and sodium did not improve with fluid challenge.
The patient was treated with hypertonic saline in the ICU with resolution of the hyponatremia at an appropriate rate.
Antibiotics were not initiated for pna.
She was continued on asa and statin.
Atenolol and Imdur were continued.
Utility of continuing Atenolol further given hx of CAD and PCIs should be discussed with PCP.
Blood pressures normalized after receiving home medications, and it is likely that patient was not taking her meds at home secondary to confusion.
She was continued on home levothyroxine.
# h/o breast cancer: s/p lumpectomy and XRT.
# FEN: cardiac diet, fluid restriction 1500ml .
# PPx: heparin sc .
# DISPO: rehab for continued recovery.
