Intubated in ED.
She was intubated and ventilated on AC and then PS modes.
She underwent treatment with 8 days CTX and has since been afebrile with clearing of her CXR.
But she was finally extubated and a NG tube was placed by IR.
Would recommend holding patient's bedtime doses of trazodone and ativan if still drowsy.
# Infection: Ms [**Known lastname 97865**] was initially borderline hypotensive with suspicion for sepsis.
She was treated with aggressive IV fluid boluses with normalization of her BP.
She was also covered broadly with vancomycin and zosyn for potential pneumonia and possible meningitis.
She was treated with an 8-day course of antibiotics with documented clearance of bacteremia, urinary infection, and pneumonia.
All of her antibiotics were stopped as of [**12-24**] as no further positive blood culture and patient remained afebrile.
She was aggressively diuresed with lasix boluses + lasix drip.
She was also started on a beta blocker for treatment of hypertension and for prolonged filling time.
# Hypertension Once patient was stabilized and transferred to the floor, she was found to be somewhat hypertensive and was started on a beta blocker for treatment of hypertension and for prolonged filling time and also an ACE inhibitor.
Upon discharge, patient was stabilized on metoprolol 25mg PO bid and had started lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily.
Upon discharge, it would be recommended that patient have her ACE inhibitor increased while her beta blocker could be decreased.
# Hypothyroidism- continued on thyroid replacement .
