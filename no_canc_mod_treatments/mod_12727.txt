Discharge labs [**2119-10-3**] 142 / 108 / 21    AGap=11 -----------------  96 4.1 / 27 / 1.2  Source: Line-PICC  WBC 13.8  HCT 25.3 PLT 452  Brief Hospital Course: Assessement/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo blind, Russsian speaking F with HTN and significant hx for smoking was admitted s/p mechanical fall, suffered a right hip fracture and underwent right hip [**Age over 90 24785**].
She tolerated the procedure well requiring 2U blood transfusion, however post op course was complicated by confusion, agitation as well as pneumonia/hypoxia requiring transfer to the ICU.
Was oxygenated using NRB, did not require Bipap or intubation.
The staples were eventually removed and replaced with steristrips which are to be left in place until they fall off.
We provided adequate pain control for the patient initially with oxycodone as needed, then standing tylenol as well as Lidocaine patches were added for the comfort of the patient.
She was continued on renally dosed Lovenox throughout hospitalization for prevention of DVT in setting of hip fracture.
Lovenox will be stopped on [**2119-10-10**] to complete 4 week post fracture course.
Her therapy for pneumonia was also continued at this time.
# Aspiration pneumonia/hospital acquired: Sputum grew out gram negative rods postop and she was started on Levaquin for a 7day course.
However, she decompensated with hypoxia requiring transfer to the unit before the therapy was completed.
She was started on Vancomycin/Flagyl in addition to Levaquin.
Vancomycin was discontinued after 4days of therapy, however the other antibiotics were to be continued to complete a 2wk course.
Given her extensive smoking hx nebulizers were administered and will be continued until post pneumonia wheezing resolves.
# Agitation/delirium: Progressively worsened after hip surgery in the setting of blindness as well as being Russian speaking only.
Also, age and given that she was in a strange environment, agitation was to be expected.
She was managed with Zyprexa initially then small doses of haldol IV, also required a family member to be at bedside to help orient pt.
We also tried to limit lines and tubes by discontinuing her telemetry and foley when it was appropriate.
Required transfusions only in the immediate post operative phase.
There was however, a large area of ecchymosis, ?resolving hematoma around area of surgery R hip; did not increase in size.
Diltiazem was initially started at 30 QID, then titrated up to 60mg QID.
Changed to long acting diltiazem 240mg daily prior to discharge to simplify her medication regimen.
Given age and fall risk, pt not considered a good candidate for anticoagulation therapy.
# Hypertension: Pt was initially on Lisinopril 40mg on admission, however, we continued Diltiazem, also for rate control.
Patients primary care doctor may decide to restart lisinopril after discharge.
#Access - PICC line was placed during admission as she had limited access.
