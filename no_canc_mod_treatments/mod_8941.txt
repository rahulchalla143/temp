Admission Date:  [**2199-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-12-11**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Novocain / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**] Chief Complaint: Jaundice, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Patient is 83 year-old female transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-11-20**] for management of gallstone pancreatitis.
She was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for an ankle fracture, for which she underwent orthopaedic surgery and an external fixation device was placed.
Post-operatively at [**Hospital1 **] she developed 3 days of epigastric pain and jaundice and was diagnosed with pancreatitis and stone in the gallbladder.
She was evaluated by [**Hospital1 **] cardiology for paroxysmal a-fib and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previously not anticoagulated CAD, stable angina TIA HTN Hypercholesterolemia s/p TAH/BSO s/p pinning of Right ankle  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   ALT(SGPT)-94* AST(SGOT)-115* LD(LDH)-413* ALK PHOS-286* AMYLASE-118* TOT BILI-7.1* [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   LIPASE-68* [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   WBC-21.5* RBC-4.29 HGB-13.0 HCT-37.5 MCV-88 MCH-30.3 MCHC-34.7 RDW-16.1*  Discharge labs: ([**2199-12-11**]) INR 1.6, wbc 6.6, hct 28.6  CT [**11-29**] 1.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/ceftazidime/Flagyl), hydrated, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was successfully placed by ultrasound guidance.
Her white count dropped to 3.3 after the procedure and there was initial concern that the patient she was developing a septic picture, however blood cultures were negative, bile cultures grew MDR E-coli (although sensitivities at this point were still pending).
She was started on clears on [**11-23**] and MRCP was entertained but held given the presence of the external fixation device, as well as decreasing total bili and the recent OSH MRCP that did not reveal an obstruction.
She was transferred out of the ICU on [**2199-11-23**], with pancreatic enzymes normalized, and her antibiotic regimen was changed to imipenem once the bile cultures-Ecoli sensitivities returned.
Patient was tolerating a full diet however her intake was poor, and TPN was initiated on [**11-28**] via a newly placed PICC line.
Coumadin was initiated with a brief period of lovenox until she became therapeutic.
Due to persistent leakage around the cholecystostomy tube a paracentesis was performed on [**2199-12-4**] that drained several liters of clear, non-bilous ascites.
Infectious disease was consulted and did not recommend treatment with flagyl for likely bacterial shedding.
Her meropenem was discontinued on [**12-6**] after a full, 2 week course.
Her Picc line was removed on [**12-10**] and the TPN was weaned off.
She will need very close follow-up with her internist/the rehab internist, orthopaedics, general surgery and possibly thoracic surgery as outlined in the PAGE 1 referral.

You have also been started on a new medication, coumadin, and your blood levels will need to be monitored very closely at first, with adjustments in the coumadin dosing as necessary.
Please keep the area of your cholecystostomy drain clean and dry.
Your PCP will need to manage your coumadin levels, and all the blood work will need to be sent directly to him/her.
Thoracic surgery was consulted during this hospitalization for a small abnormality on a chest x-ray, of which the patient and family were made aware.
If you would like to follow-up with thoracics, they recommend a dedicated chest cat scan as an outpatient and then to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] of thoracics in [**1-3**] weeks.
