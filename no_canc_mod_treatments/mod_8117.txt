Admission Date:  [**2190-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-2-19**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Keflex / Lipitor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Aphasia plus R sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Subdural evacuation per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]   History of Present Illness: The pt is an 88 year-old right-handed man well known to me from his last admission on [**2-8**].
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 27271**] has a PMH of a recent SDH, afib off coumadin, HTN, HLD and a recent admission for transient weakness and difficulty producing speech lasting 20 minute.
During this hospitalization he was found to have a slightly subtherapeutic Tegretol level of 3.5 therefore his dose was increased to 300mg daily from 200.
In regards to his afib, he was restarted on aspirin and coumadin was to be considered at his follow-up appointment.
Today, Mr. [**Known lastname 27271**] was at rehab when he had an episode of right face, arm, and leg hemiparesis and dysarthria.
Past Medical History: - A-fib now off coumadin - HTN - HLD - CAD - Parkinson's ?
CAROTID STENOSIS - PUD - pacemaker implantation in [**2179**] - BPH - Seizure disorder (last seizure 15-20 yrs ago) with GTC - Appy - Eye surgery for congenital cataracts/lens implants - Hernia surgery - Glomerulonephritis 2 yrs ago - recent SDH as above - ?
-Coordination: + resting tremor, R>L as well as postural tremor and intention tremor.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 88 year-old RH man with a complex PMH including seizures, CAD and afib off coumadin, recent traumatic SDH and very recent admission for transient difficulty producing speech and R hand weakness.
He now presents with a similar episode although the symptoms were more extensive involving right face, arm, and leg hemiparesis and dysarthria.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] performed the left-sided burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of the symptomatic left SDH without complication.
Post-op imaging showed expected post surgical changes.
Given his risk factors including CAD and Afib, aspirin 81mg was started the next morning and he remained symptom free including speech and R arm weakness for the remainder of the admission.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], neurosurgery, the patient should not restart Coumadin until 3 months after the left SDH evacuation.
