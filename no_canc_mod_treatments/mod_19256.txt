Pt also had a leukocytosis (wbc 36) and positive U/A, and was started on vanc/levo/flagyl.
He was given aggressive fluids via CVL.
Pt briefly on lidocaine drip from the ED, but never required pressors.
He required a lasix drip [**Date range (1) 46801**] for fluid overload from resuscitation.
He was then transfered to medicine for further management.
On [**11-24**] Lasix was held for hypotension and dyspnea worsened.
Heparin gtt was started.
On [**11-25**] BP stablized and pt has responded with increased urine output to Lasix IV bolus with Metolazone.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] today for management of NSTEMI and better management of fluid status.

He was resuscitated with defibrillation, epinephrine, and started on a lidocaine drip.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were markedly elevated as expected after defibrillation and troponin reached a peak of 1.95 and then trended downward.
He was initially placed on aspirin , plavix and atorvastatin 80mg and later re-started on metoprolol as tolerated by his blood pressure.
