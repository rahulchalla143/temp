Patient was evaluated by [**Hospital1 **] spine who felt this required medical management with antibiotics and was nonoperative.
She received an additional 2L NS with improvement in SBP to 90s-100s.
She did not receive further antibiotics.

Persistently low BP's after fluid resuscitation.
Persistently low blood pressure after fluid resuscitation.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images of the cervical spine were obtained, with axial gradient echo and T2-weighted images.
Following intravenous gadolinium administration, sagittal and axial T1-weighted images of the cervical spine were obtained.
Findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-6.
Interval C5-6 corpectomy and C4-7 anterior reconstruction with debridement of discitis/osteomyelitis.
Heterogeneous marrow with numerous foci of T1/T2 hyperintensity without abnormally high signal on STIR or post-contrast images most likely represent hemangiomas as well as reconversion of red marrow in the setting of patient's known anemia.
Final Report CLINICAL INFORMATION: 52-year-old female who presented with an epidural abscess and is status post C5-6 corpectomy and anterior reconstruction.
FINDINGS:  CERVICAL SPINE: The patient is intubated, status post C5-6 corpectomy with placement of interbody spacer device.
Interval C5-6 corpectomy and C4-7 anterior reconstruction with debridement of discitis/osteomyelitis.
Apparently, the patient is already scheduled for posterior decompression and debridement.
Residual fluid collection anterior to the spine at the C5-6 level most likely represents post-operative seroma; attention should be paid to this region on any follow-up study.
MRI was concerning for cervical epidural abscess and the patient was taken to the OR for anterior C5-6 corpectomy / cage / fusion on [**2131-2-13**] and C6-T1 lami / C4-T2 PSF with ICBG on [**2131-2-14**] without complication.
Intravenous antibiotics were administered in the form of nafcillin + vancomycin followed by nafcillin alone once cultures returned MSSA.
A PICC line was placed for long term antibiotics.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs.
The foley was removed on POD#3 following the second procedure.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
She is to continue taking nafcillin via PICC as recommended by the infectious disease consult service.
