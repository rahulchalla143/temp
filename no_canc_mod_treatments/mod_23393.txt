ED team got CT head which revealed 3.2 cm right cerebellar bleed, hence neurology and neurosurg were consulted.

Brief Hospital Course: 1) Neuro: Patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, unsteadiness.
No neurosurgical intervention was required.
Antiseizure prophylaxis was not indicated given the region of the hemorrhage.
The hemorrhage secondary to the amyloid angiopathy was then likely exacerbated by the patient being coagulopathic secondary to the Coumadin the patient was on for a. fib (initial INR was 2.9).
The INR was corrected with FFP and Vitamin K. INR should be less than 1.6 to avoid extension of hemorrhage.
The patient continued to note vertiginous symptoms and was started on Meclizine for symptomatic relief.
The patient was started on baby aspirin (to avoid further bleeding risks) for anti-platelet activity.
A lipid panel was performed as part of the stroke work-up and this noted dyslipidemia, so the patient was started on Simvastatin.
While on floor, patient eventually passed speech and swallow and was started on regular diet.
Patient received prn doses IV Hydralazine to help control blood pressure.
For continued elevated BP, patient was on Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
The patient continued to require IV doses Hydralazine despite the standing anti-HTN meds; however, one night after receiving a dose of IV Hydrlazine for a BP of 170s systolic, the patient developed an episode of epigastric pain and chest pain without radiation that was associated with lightheadedness.
The patient received IV Metoprolol and PO Metroprolol was increased to 50 mg tid.
Will avoid anticoagulation with Coumadin for the a. fib at this time given the hemorrhage.
Another possibility for the elevated creatinine is the addition of Lisinopril for blood pressure control.
HTN: Patient initially required IV Hydralazine prn for BP control.
Patient initially started on lisinopril for BP control but given elevated Creatinine, this was swtiched to Amlodipine 5 mg daily, with possible need to increase to 10 mg daily in future if BP remains elevated.
Medications on Admission: Terazosin 10 mg po qhs Metoprolol (dose unknown)  Discharge Medications: 1.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: R cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to amyloid angiopathy atrial fibrillation Acute kidney injury Demand Ischemia HTN Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The bleed was likely made worse because of Coumadin, the medication you were on for your heart arrythmia, atrial fibrillation.
Because of the bleeding, your Coumadin was stopped.
You were also started on a medication called Simvastatin for a high cholesterol.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also had an episode of a fast heart rate, so your Metoprolol was increased to 50 mg three times a day.
Also, on Friday [**2141-8-4**], would like you to have your kindey function checked with labwork (BUN, Creatinine) as the time you were hypotensive seemed to affect your kidneys, though function has improved with the IV fluids you received.
