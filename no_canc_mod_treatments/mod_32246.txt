He was intubated at the OSH and given 50 of mannitol as well as cerebrex.
MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-1**] 6:05 PM MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS: For the purposes of this study due to the fact that the patient was intubated and with an A-line in place, the right arm was imaged up and the left arm down.
Note is made of consolidation at the left lung base, which is likely due to aspiration and/or contusion.
Interval evolution of subdural hematoma and cerebellar contusion, with resorption of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Assessment for change and enhancement is not possible given lack of any prior contrast-enhanced studies.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for infection / pt with left occipital open skull fracture s/p washout and    closure without [**Last Name (un) 2043**] repair...now with bump in WBC from 14 to 20 without    obvious source... CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Additional smaller foci of enhancement involving the left cerebellum and left cerebellar tonsil are noted at the site of prior hemorrhagic contusions and likely relate to enhancement around the hematoma although superinfection cannot be excluded by imaging.
TECHNIQUE: Axial acquired images were obtained through the brain prior to and after the administration of intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Unenhanced images of the brain display hypodensity at the patient's known sites of prior hemorrhagic contusions within the left cerebellar tonsil and left cerebellar hemisphere.
The degree of mass effect within the posterior fossa appears slightly improved with post-surgical changes from prior suboccipital craniotomy again noted.
Assessment for change and enhancement is not possible given lack of any prior contrast-enhanced studies.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for possible abcess in left cerebellar region / eval postop wound    washout.... thank you CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Final Report HISTORY: Open ankle fracture status post debridement of superinfected subcutaneous collection.
TECHNIQUE: Axial contiguous images were obtained through the brain without and with intravenous contrast.
Post-contrast administration there is better identification of improvement of the previously identified large thick rim-enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection which has underwent interval evacuation.
Decreased rim enhancement surrounding the hemorrhagic intraparenchymal contusions involving the left cerebellar hemisphere with no new regions of intraparenchymal enhancement or extra-axial fluid collections to suggest subdural/epidural empyema.
Final Report CLINICAL INFORMATION: The patient is an 28-year-old man who had infection and needed PICC line placed for antibiotics.
PROCEDURE: PICC line reposition.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as local anesthesia were explained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
The right arm and the existing PICC line was prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
A scout image was taken which demonstrated the PICC line tip was located in the right IJ.
The PICC line was then pulled back under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip located in the right brachiocephalic vein and then the PICC line was advanced forward with the tip lodged into the SVC.
The PICC line was aspirated and flushed easily.
The PICC line was secured to the skin and sterile dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Repositioning of PICC line with the tip of PICC line in SVC and the catheter is ready to use.
He also had MRV which showed the left transverse sinus demonstrating narrowing in its midportion at the site of fracture and therefore was started on aspirin.
He was kept NPO until formal swallow eval copuld be done [**12-29**] absent gag reflex.
Speech and swallowing evaluation was done and he was started on a regular; dysphagia diet with no difficulty.
He was started on Nafcillin and Micafungin IV for definative treatment.
A PICC line was placed on [**2195-5-18**] for abx use.
Wound packed with Idodiform gauze and will be re-packed daily.
He is to be discharged today [**2195-5-20**]   Medications on Admission: Medications prior to admission: Received Cerebrex and 50 of mannitol at OSH.
