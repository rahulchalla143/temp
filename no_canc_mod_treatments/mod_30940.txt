#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure with hypoxemia/Obesity Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Before pt became altered she was able to communicate that she developed wheezing earlier in the day.
She was put on BiPAP, nebulizers and diuresed with IV lasix.
She was started on vancomycin to cover her previously diagnosed strep bacteremia as well as potential new cellulitis as she reported difficulties with [**Month/Day (2) 26204**].
#Group B strep bacteremia: She had GBS bacteremia diagnosed on her prior admission for which she was treated with penicillin.
However patient reported problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] in the past so this was switched to vancomycin per ID recommendations.
Her Losartan was discontinued and this should be held on discharge until PCP follow up to determine if it is safe to restart given her recurrent admissions with hyperkalemia.
# Anemia: microcytic, wide RDW and markedly low MCV.
# Hypertension : She was initially started on her home medications.
However she remained significantly hypertensive so her metoprolol was switched to labetolol which improved her BP.
Losartan was discontinued as above and patient was discharged on Labetalol.
She was continued on home oxycodone and given lidoderm patches.
Pain is likely from chronic lymphedema and swelling with potential neuropathic component as well.
Pain could also be due to cellulitis as patient's right shin looks mildly erythematous.
Patient is on antibiotic treatment to cover for cellulitis, however given her morbid obesity, there is concern that the antibiotics may not adequately penetrate the tissue, and a prolonged course of IV antibiotics is likely indicated.
If pain continues, can consider initiating non-narcotic pain medications such as gabapentin, for neuropathic type pain in addition to standing tylenol.
Transitional Issues: 1)Patient should have weekly outpatient lab work: CBC w/diff, BUN/Cr, LFTs and vancomycin troughs to be faxed to her ID specialist: [**Name10 (NameIs) **], [**Name8 (MD) **] MD.
2) Consider adding gabapentin to treat neuropathic-type pain, if pain is not improving with treatment of right leg cellulitis.
Oxycodone was not increased further out of concern for patient's already compromised respiratory status.

at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1353**] All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns.
We believe this happened because you were not using your BiPAP enough.
We also changed your penicillin to vancomycin to treat the bacteria in your blood.
You should continue the vancomycin until you see Infectious Disease.
We also changed your metoprolol to labetolol because your blood pressure was high.
Please START: -Vancomycin 1000 mg IV twice daily -Labatolol 200 mg twice daily -Lidoderm patch daily for pain  Please STOP: -Metoprolol -Losartan  Followup Instructions: Please set up a follow up appointment with your primary doctor within one week of leaving the rehabilitation facility.
