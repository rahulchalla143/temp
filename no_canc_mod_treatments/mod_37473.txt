She was transferred to the SICU where she received FFP and vitamin K to reverse a supratherapeutic INR.
The vascular surgery team evaluated the patient for placement of an IVC filter.
However, she was not felt to be a good candidate for placement of a filter at this time.
It was agreed that the patient will be discharged from the hospital without Coumadin and will follow up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2140-7-27**] for re-evaluation.
A discussion was had with the patient who understands the risks and benefits of not taking Coumadin for anticoagulation for history of pulmonary embolus in the setting of a pannus hematoma, which occurred while the patient was supratherapeutically anticoagulated.
The patient was administered Ceftriaxone for her recurrent UTI.
This medication was changed to Cefpodoxime for a urine culture positive for Proteus sensitive to 3rd generation cephalosporins.
