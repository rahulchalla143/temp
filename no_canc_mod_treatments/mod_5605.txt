Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with history of ESRD on HD, multiple MRSA line infections, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who is admitted to the MICU for dialysis line placement, but was found to be febrile and hypotensive on admission, now with resolved fever and WBC count, grew MRSA in blood, now culture negative and clinically improved.
This was felt to be likely related to line infection, and Quentin was d/c'd after IR placed new groin line and INR was reduced with FFP.
Therefore he will be treated for suspected endocarditis given inability to perform TEE.
He needs to receive six weeks vancomycin from [**2132-8-30**] for empiric treatment of endocarditis.
Vancomycin will be dosed by level with his HD.
He was admitted on assist control ventilation,a nd has been weaned down to pressure support ventilation as low as [**6-27**], with short trach mask trials PRN.
Speech and swallow was consulted for a passy muir valve so that the patient can talk.
He should continue to wean further at rehab as tolerated with hope of breathing independantly again.

He is on aranesp and iron as an outpatient.
He was on Epo, and Fe supplements while hospitalized.
He was transfused 1 unit pRBCs on [**2132-9-9**] after his line placement, and his hemtocrit was otherwise stable.
