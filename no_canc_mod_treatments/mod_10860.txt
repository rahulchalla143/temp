Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
MRI can help for further assessment if clinically indicated.
She was started and completed a course of ceftriaxone for this.
Her examination remained largely stable; her level of awareness would often fluctuate in a manner that was consistent with her history of anoxic brain damage (at the time of prior AAA repair).
Her husband admitted that she stopped taking her medications several months ago.
He appeared rather overwhelmed attending to both his own medical needs as well as hers, and claimed that some of her medications would often make her sleepy, so she just stopped taking all of them.
Her blood sugars as expected were difficult to control, and in conjunction with the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service, we were able to obtain better control of her blood sugars using sliding scale and scheduled insulin.
She was restarted on her antihypertensives, anticholesterol medications.
She was initially placed on an antiplatelet medication.
We consulted neurosurgery regarding her aneurysm, and they reported to us that while she had received a coil placement to her aneurysm in the past, she had failed to come for a follow up angiogram.
Right common femoral artery arteriogram was done.
She did develop a groin hematoma, and required two units of PRBC transfusion to catch up with her blood loss.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from the division of Cerebrovascular surgery will see her in clinic in follow up.
She was seen by our physical therapists who recommended that she go to acute rehabilitation to build her strength and balance.
Her husband was educated and counseled about her medication noncompliance.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please be sure to have Ms. [**Known lastname **] meet all of her follow up appointments, including her follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from the Department of Neurosurgery - She requires anticoagulation as secondary prophylaxis against strokes.
Please continue her daily aspirin and daily warfarin.
Discontinue her ASPIRIN when her INR reaches a goal of [**1-24**].
- Please continue to titrate her daily insulin requirements.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **]:    It was a pleasure to care for you during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
Through a series of physical examinations, laboratory tests and neuroimaging studies, we determined that you sustained a stroke of your cerebellum, a part of your brain that governs balance and coordination.
Unfortunately, this was not successful, and so it is important that you return for a repeat procedure.
You will remain on aspirin until your blood tests reveal that WARFARIN is acting appropriately.
- We were able to organize a short stay at rehabilitation for you, where you will receive daily exercises and physical therapy to build your strength and balance.
- It is important that you take your medications on a daily basis as prescribed.
