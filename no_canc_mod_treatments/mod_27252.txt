Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 53899**] is a 65yoF with h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2108**], STEMI [**2113-9-16**] with proximal LAD occlusion treated with BMS, systolic CHF w/ EF 20%, and LLE DVT and multiple pulmonary embolisms.
# RECURRANT PNEUMOTHORAX - An IJ placed for her original MICU stay was the cause of her initial pneumothorax.
A chest tube was placed and her lung reexpanded.
A chest tube was placed and her lung reinflated on suction.
Her chest tube was then placed to water seal, and then clamped.
Followup CXRs showed lung reexpansion and the tube was removed on [**10-19**].
She continued to have slight bleeding from the chest tube site due to her anti-coagulation.
She was placed on a non-rebreather and code blue was called.
Her O2 sat increased to 88% on NRB and she was transferred to the MICU.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISMS - Diagnosed on prior admission.
Switched to heparin drip acutely for management of pneumothorax chest tube while admitted.
Transitioned to lovenox on [**10-19**].
Many of her medications had been stopped or tapered, including fluconazole (no evidence for fungal UTI), fluoxetine, wellbutrin and fexofenadine.
Her gabapentin was also decreased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Recommendation from cardiology was placement of an ICD for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, but due to her acute illness, this was deferred.
EP saw the patient prior to discharge and will followup for ICD placement soon.
Discharged on tiotroprium, advair and albuterol PRN.
Statin was held due to elevated LFTs.
Repeat TTE around [**2113-10-26**]  # DEPRESSION - Stopped fluoxetine and wellbutrin to minimize polypharmacy and reduce delirium.
Occasional oxycodone as needed.
Restarted ranitidine as she was previously on it.
TRANSITIONAL --- Pulmonary Embolisms - trend INR and discontinue lovenox when therapeutic --- ICD Placement - EP will contact [**Hospital 100**] rehab to arrange transfer on Wednesday [**10-25**] for ICD.
