He was coded for 54 minutes, during which time he was intubated and received 12 mg Epinepherine, 5 mg of Atropine, and was started on Lidocaine and Dopamine gtts.
He underwent successful primary PCI and had a BMS placed in his RCA.
He was weaned off the pressors, and heparin and integrilin were discontinued as the patient continued to have substantial bleeding from his nares.
The patient was intubated and sedated upon arrival to the CCU and was thus unable to answer ROS.
Past Medical History: Dyslipidemia Hypertension Percutaneous Coronary Interventions:   - [**5-/2115**] at [**Hospital6 33**], PCI of LCx   - [**6-/2115**] at [**Hospital1 112**], DES to the LAD  Social History: Single and unmarried per [**Hospital1 112**] file, works as an accountant and employment benefits manager.
Physical Exam: VS: BP 111/78, HR 83, RR 19 O2 sat 99% on CMV with TV 600, FiO2 100%, RR 25, PEEP 5 GENERAL: Middle aged man, intubated and sedated, in NAD.
There has been interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
The LCX had patent proximal stent and a large OM2 branch with mild diffuse disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular filling pressures and RA / PCWP pressures suggestive of right ventricular infarction, with depressed cardiac output.
Successful manual aspiration thrombectomy and placement of a  3.5x18mm Vision bare-metal stent were performed in the mid-RCA.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 **] s/p cardiac arrest with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.
He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac catheterization.
He underwent cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Versed for sedation and Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours.
He was then rewarmed and weaned off sedation without complication.
He was started on aspirin 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, Lipitor 80mg daily, and metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
Heparin and integrilin were held due to nose bleeding post-cath.
He had episodes of hypotension over the 24-48 hours after cath, and was aggressively given IV fluids to maintain blood pressure.
He was given ipratropium nebulizers and was diuresed with Lasix prn for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
# Neurologic Status - Patient was intubated and sedated on arrival to our hospital.
He will be discharged on an ACE and a beta blocker.
# Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nosebleed in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
The bleeding stopped with Afrin nasal spray and the patient's Hct has remained stable.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient had thrombocytopenia approximately 5 days after being started on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
There was concern for HIT so heparin was stopped and a heparin antibody was pending at time of d/c.
This may be related to a previous condition, or may be a result of brain injury after his cardiac arrest.
