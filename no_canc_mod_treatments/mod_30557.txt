A catheter is seen coursing over the right hemithorax.
Small amount of intracranial hemorrhage, with blood layering in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 5.7 cm above the carina.
Increased hyperdense material anteriorly within in the left hemispheric extra-axial collection is likely redistribution of blood products or additional new blood.
Increased rightward shift of midline structures, now 17 mm, previously 7 mm.
[**2141-12-2**] CT cervical spine: No fracture or malalignment  [**2141-12-2**] 21:48  CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Status post evacuation of a left subdural hematoma via left frontal craniotomy, with no evidence of new acute hemorrhage or large vascular territorial infarction.
Multilevel moderate-to-severe neural foraminal narrowing as described above.
Left PICC line tip is in the SVC.
Unchanged appearance of the left occipital craniectomy and left cerebellar hypodensities from prior hemorrhage.
Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter unchanged appearance within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle without hydrocephalus.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2141-12-20**] 3:18 AM FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.5 cm above the carina and is adequately placed.
Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriate.
Left PICC line ends at mid SVC.
CXR [**2141-12-22**] Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.8 cm above the carina, left PICC line ends at lower SVC, and orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, though distal end is beyond the radiograph, all are appropriate.
[**2141-12-23**] MRI brain with and without contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Evolution of blood products in the left cerebellum and presence of blood products in the ventricles, in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
[**2141-12-28**] CXR: no changes  [**2141-12-29**]: no changes  [**2141-12-31**]: The patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy tube was placed.
In the interval, the nasogastric tube has also been removed, the left-sided PICC line is in unchanged position.
Right transfrontal ventriculostomy terminates in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, as before, without change in ventricular size or shape.
[**2142-1-5**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**1-4**], the tracheostomy tube remains in place and there is pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
He was also given 3 days of Vitamin K.  Postoperatively he remained intubated for periods of apnea.
His exam slowly improved to withdrawal of all 4 extremities and purposeful left arm movement.
On POD2 the patient underwent placement of IVC filter as he cannot be anticoagulated given his acute SDH evacuation and multiple falls.
Post-procedure the patient had multiple episodes of seizure activity involving right arm rhythmic jerking and right facial twitching that resolved with Dilantin 300mg IV and ativan 2mg IV.
His dilantin dose was increased to 200mg IV BID.
On POD3 [**12-5**] the patient was placed on continuous EEG monitering which showed frequent seizures in the setting of corrected dilantin level > 10, that did not resolve with dilantin boluses.
Epilepsy team was consulted for recommendations and cessation of seizures occured after Ativan IV and IV Keppra bolus.
His dilantin dose was increased and he was placed on standing Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **].
He remained on Continuous EEG monitoring.
Patient continued to require respiratory and nutritional support via tube feeding.
On [**12-15**] dilantin was corrected to 13.
Hi secretions continued to be prominent on [**12-16**], therefore extubation was not attempted.
He was given ativan and per neuromed consult recs was bolused with vimpat.
Also LENI's were performed for routine monitoring and was consistent with deep vein thrombosis again seen in one of the two posterior tibial veins in the left calf.
On [**12-22**], The patient was on a continuous EEG which was read per the neurology service with frequent worseing spikes and the lacasomide was increased to 300 [**Hospital1 **].
The patient continued on lacasomide 300 mg IV BID, ativan(standing)1 mg IV QID,keppra 2g [**Hospital1 **],Fosphenytoin 300 mgIV Q8H(on hold [**12-22**]) per Neurology's recommendations.
His dilantin was increased to 350mg TID as well.
On [**12-26**] his guardian was officially appointed and consent was obtained for trach and PEG, also he was placed on versed for supression x 24 hours and on [**12-27**] it was weaned off.
On [**12-29**] he underwent Trach and PEG placement by general surgery and toelrated it well.
On [**12-29**] the patient underwent Trach and PEG and tube feeds were restarted and titrated to goal on [**12-30**].
He was started on empiric antibiotics for pneumonia as the patient continued to have copious secretions.
He continued to have epsiodes of fevers on [**1-2**] while on triple antibiotics.
Dilantin was again recommended by Neurology.
This behavior continued in to [**1-6**] and Ativan was given.
ID was consulted as well and they left recommendations for treatment which were not followed.
Neuromedicine was again called and the felt that he should not be treated for this.
Formal recommendations recieved on [**1-7**] were to give standing Ativan 2mg q4hours x 24 hours while attempting to attain goal Dilantin level of 20.
On [**1-8**] his Dilantin level 18.4 corrected and he had continued drainage fro his trach site.
cultures were sent and his antibiotics were changed to nafcillin only.
On [**1-9**] his Dilantin level was 16.8 corrected he and recieved a 500g Dilantin Bolus.
Issues by system: Neurologic: - neuro checks Q4 hrs - Keppra [**2130**] [**Hospital1 **]; Vimpat 300 [**Hospital1 **], fosphenytoin 250 TID, ativan 2mg q4h until dilantin levels are at 17-20; monitor renal function since may have to adjust AED - Taper ativan to off within the next week as long as he is seizure free  Cardiovascular: - goal SBP 100-160 - amlodipine 10 qday, metoprolol 25 daily, stopped lisinopril, spironolactone and hydralazine on [**1-11**] - Ok to stop amlodipine if still hypotensive  Pulmonary: - episodes of apnea on CPAP, back on MMV.
