The patient with known cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology with known coronary artery disease by MIBI echocardiogram, scheduled for an elective catheterization but had increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, therefore admitted prior to his cardiac catheterization and ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
His catheterization at [**Hospital6 2911**] showed 50% left main, left main 80% left anterior descending, 70% right coronary artery with an ejection fraction of 20%.
He was started on Dobutamine with relief of symptoms and was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Therefore his catheterization was to be repeated after arrival at [**Hospital6 256**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 70/30 60 units b.i.d.
; Plavix 75 mg q.d.
; Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.
; Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
; Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.
; Metformin 1000 mg q.d.
On transfer his medications included Dobutamine 2.5 mcg/kg/hour; heparin drip at 900 units/hour; insulin 70/30 60 units b.i.d.
; Plavix 75 mg q.d.
and Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.
as well as Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d.
; Lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
; Ativan 0.5 mg t.i.d.
At that time an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting +/- aortic valve replacement.
On [**12-13**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room and at that time he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two as well as an aortic valve replacement, please see the operation report in full details and summary.
The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 as well as an aortic valve replacement with a #23 Mosaic valve.
The patient tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient had Dobutamine at 5 mcg/kg/min.
In the postoperative period the patient was noted to have frequent premature ventricular contractions and for that reason he was weaned from his Dobutamine and started on Milrinone.
He was also started on Amiodarone drip at that time.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and ultimately discontinued on postoperative day #1.
His sedation was discontinued and he was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
An nasogastric tube was placed and his abdomen was decompressed without further complications.
By postoperative day #7 his ileus had resolved and his nasogastric tube was removed.
On postoperative day #8 it was felt that the patient was stable and ready for transfer to Far-2 for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
The patient's beta blockers were discontinued as was his Amiodarone and his diuretics.
The Foley catheter was placed.
Following consultation with the patient's cardiologist, it was decided to start him again on a low dose beta blocker as well as Digoxin and a small dose of Lasix.
The patient tolerated all of these additions well and on postoperative day #20 it was decided that the patient was stable and ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility for continuing postoperative care and rehabilitation.
The sternum is stable, incision with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.
