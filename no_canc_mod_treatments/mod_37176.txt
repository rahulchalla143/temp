She was treated with Lasix which is new for her congestive heart failure, even though the ejection fraction was 60 to 70% by transthoracic echocardiogram.
She was also given a Prednisone taper for suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare which ended on [**2167-9-17**].
Since discharge on [**2167-9-3**], the patient did fine for the first week, however, four days prior to admission, the patient called her primary care provided, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with increased bilateral lower extremity edema because she had stopped her Lasix secondary to excessive urination.
She was started on two liters of home O2 one day prior to admission and then returned to her primary care provider on day of admission looking pale, off her oxygen.
Her saturation was 60% on room air and 88% on two liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Her respiratory rate at that time was 32 and she was saturating at 90% on ten liters and non-rebreather.
Since she was somnolent, she was started on Bi-PAP 5/5/35% FIO2 with oxygen saturation at 98%.
