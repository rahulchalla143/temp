He then awoke with a "rope-like" non-radiating chest discomfort with no associated symptoms except perhaps chills that resolving except the portion "over the heart."
He was given 81 mg ASA x 4, 4500 units heparin bolus with drip at 1800 units/hr and 5 mg IV lopressor.
He was given plavix 600 mg PO x 1 prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for c. cath.
He completed a course of levofloxacin, was placed on flomax, and is scheduled to follow-up with urology.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

Cath ([**2193-4-26**]) ** PRELIM REPORT ** BRIEF HISTORY:   78 M presented to OSH with chest pain and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.
We planned to treat this thrombus with aspiration thrombectomy/PTCA/stenting and heparin/integrilin given prophylactically.
An XB LAD 4.0 guiding catheter provided good support for the procedure and a Prowater wire was advanced into the distal LAD with moderate difficulty.
We then proceed with an Export AP aspiration thrombectomy but unable to deliver device distal to subacute thrombus.
We then stented the mid LAD with a Promus Rx 2.5x18 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) post-dilated with an NC Quantum Apex MR 2.75x12 mm balloon inflated at 20 atm for 20 sec.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow in the vessel, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the newly deployed stent but acute cut-off in distal LAD showed diffusely diseased small apical vesswel that remained unchanged despite mechanical dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
The R 6Fr femoral artery sheath was removed post limited groin angiography and an Angioseal closure device was deployed without complications with distal pulses confirmed post deployment.
Contrast injected:           Omnipaque 175 cc total contrast during procedure Anesthesia:           1% Lidocaine SC, fentanyl 25 mcg IV, versed 0.5 mg IV total Anticoagulation:           Heparin [**2182**] units, integrilin bolus and infusion  COMMENTS: 1.

# STEMI Patient has known history of CAD given prior stent placement in OM2.
It is uncertain why the patient is not on any cardiac medications for risk reduction.
He was continued on an integrilin infusion for 18 hours post PCI for thrombus and abrupt cut-off of distal small vessel apical LAD unchanged despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
He was placed on aspirin 325 mg PO qD indefinitely, clopidogrel 75 PO qD for at least 12 months for DES.
He was started on crestor given concern for myalgias.
He was also started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
# Hyperlipidemia Patient was not on lipid-lowering therapy on admission.
He was started on statin as above and advised to initiate lifestyle modifications.
He was continued on flomax during hospitalization and will follow-up with urology after hospitalization.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure where a drug eluting stent was placed in one your heart arteries and you did very well after this.
You will need to take a number of medications to keep your heart healthy and make sure the stent stays open.
We have made the following changes to your medications: START taking aspirin 325 mg and Plavix daily.
Do not stop taking aspirin and Plavix unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] says that it is OK. START taking Rosuvastatin (Crestor) to lower your cholesterol.
START taking Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
START taking Metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
START taking nitroglycerin if you have chest pain at home.
Continue to take Flomax as before.
