Integrillin was continued for 18 hrs, initiated on aspirin 325mg daily, plavix 75mg daily, and beta blockade.
A statin was not started due to her reactions to statins in the past.
She was transferred briefly to the CCU, where she was aggressively diuresed and placed on standing hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.
On the floor, she continued to receive 60 mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] for diuresis and she stabilized, was comfortable off oxygen and ambulatory and wanted to be discharged on [**4-26**].
Early on [**2114-4-27**], she had a NSTEMI with troponins up to 7, and went into severe pulmonary edema requiring face mask, with severe respiratory distress that did not respond to 160 mg IV lasix.
She did not respond to a total of 180 mg IV lasix and was put on a lasix drip.
She also received metolazone 10 mg PO.
She diuresed 5 liters on this regimen however her creatinine bumped to >4 (baseline around 2.5.)
She was on a nitro gtt for 2 days as well in the CCU.
She was not intubated and required a facemask briefly.
She was weaned to room air before transfer to the floor on the 11th and was transferred off lasix in view of the ARF.
On the floor, she remained off lasix for 24 hours with no edema.
On the 12th, she was put on 40 mg PO lasix qd, and she tolerated this regimen well, with appropriate diuresis and creatinine down to 3.5.
She also has a hx of A Fibrillation.
She remained in sinus rhythm, and not on coumadin due to a history of GI bleed.` .
RENAL FAILURE: Acute on chronic renal impairment: The patient's baseline is 2.5, which increased to 3.5 upon diuresis on the floor.
We felt this was most likely c/w contrast nephropathy plus possibly some prerenal azotemia in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
Thus, the team held off on aggressive diuresis the day of transfer to the floor.
As above, lasix was held for 24 hours, then restarted at 40 mg PO qd, with creatinine stabilized at 3.5.
