GI scope upon arrival to ICU showed evidence of recent bleeding but no clear etiology and no active bleeding; no interventions were performed.
He was continued on IV PPI and metoprolol, aspirin and plavix were held.
This resolved with IV lopressor, but the procedure was deferred until the following day.
The following day however, his oxygen saturations in low 90's at rest and decreased below 90% while laying flat therefore the procedure was again postponed for gentle diuresis to improve oxygenation.
He was discharged on PPI with GI follow-up.
His aspirin and plavix were held given GI bleed.
Aspirin was scheduled to be restarted after discharge and patient will discuss with his primary cardiologist risks vs benefits of restarting plavix  # Tachycardia: Patient had persistent tachycardia despite adequate fluid and blood replacement.
After remaining hemodynamically stable with no evidence of re-bleed, he was restarted on metoprolol with heart rate stable around 100.
He has chronic bilateral pleural effusions that have not responded to diuresis and have required thoracentesis previously therefore it was decided to proceed with thoracentesis to improve oxygenation.
Patient was symptomatically drastically improved after unilateral thoracentesis and was able to tolerate repeat EGD.
# Hypertension:  Anti-hypertensives were held initially and restarted as above.
Aspirin 81 mg daily 2.
Clopidogrel 75 mg daily 3.
Metoprolol 25 mg daily (used to take [**Hospital1 **]) 4.

You received several blood tranfusions and your blood counts remained stable.
