She underwent an irrigation and debridement of her hand for treatment of this abscess versus cellulitis.
The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, pericarditis and is status post a pericardial window and endometrial cancer.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant for coronary artery bypass graft in [**2164-6-23**].
MEDICATIONS:  Her meds at home were Lasix 40 mg once a day, Toprol XL 50 mg once a day, Diovan 80 mg once a day, Digoxin 0.125 mg once a day, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, Omeprazole 20 mg once a day, Dolobid one 3 times a day, potassium, aspirin 81 mg once a day, as well as some creams.
LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent initial laboratory included an initial sodium of 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 19, BUN 93, creatinine 3.0.
Amylase 113, T-bilirubin 0.6, and a lipase of 152.
Subsequently her hospitalization was complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure ultimately requiring intubation, and the sepsis requiring several antibiotics and several pressors.
While the patient did make some progress on all these fronts, the patient ultimately decided on a consultation with multiple attending surgeons, as well as social work to become comfort measures only and was placed on a morphine drip and ultimately expired early on the morning of [**5-18**].
In addition, because of her complicated hemodynamic status, she initially required monitoring with a Swan Ganz catheter, which was ultimately changed to a triple lumen catheter on hospital day 6.
From a GI perspective the patient was given high doses of IV Protonix for her duodenal ulcer.
This high dose of Protonix was maintained for the majority of the patient's admission.
From a fluid, electrolyte and nutrition perspective, the patient was given TPN during the admission and was intermittently bolused and then diuresed depending on her volume status.
From a renal perspective the patient's anuria ultimately resolved and her creatinine slowly drifted down once better renal perfusion was achieved with the use of Levophed and IV fluids, and the patient began making urine several days after admission.
From an ID perspective, the patient was initially admitted on oxacillin for her cellulitis.
However, because of the development of right lower lobe pneumonia the patient was switched to levofloxacin and vancomycin.
Flagyl was subsequently added to her regimen.
The yeast was subsequently changed to voriconazole and at the time of the patient's death she was noted to be on Vancomycin, Levophed, fluconazole, erythromycin and amoxicillin.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  No discharge medications and obviously no follow up plans.
