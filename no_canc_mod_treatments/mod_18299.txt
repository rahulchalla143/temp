He has a history of calf claudication for which he received a right femoral to peroneal bypass with in situ saphenous graft in [**2153**].
Given his renal insufficiency, he is being admitted pre-procedure for renal protective measures for a scheduled angiogram tomorrow.

Renal protective measures included mucomyst and bicarbonate drip.
Accordingly he would require a Fem-->Peroneal bypass.
He therefore underwent a L Fem-->peroneal bypass with RUE arm vein on [**2159-7-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], who was away at the time and the patient preferred to have the bypass performed asap).
He received a R IJ CVL due to limited venous access, and was monitored via a R axillary arterial line since further distal access attempts were unsuccessful and the other three limbs being unavailable (two involved in the procedure and the RLE having a prior bypass was contraindicated for femoral arterial line placement).
Procedure proceeded fairly straightforward; please see operative report for details; at the conclusion he had a palpable vein graft pulse medially and dopplerable signal distally.
Post-operatively he had sustained hypotension, responding to crystalloid volume but requiring neosynephrine drip.
Due to the IVF volumes given in response to the earlier hypotension, diuresis was later successfully initiated with lasix gtt then lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] for several days.
It was initially covered with antibiotics which were discontinued on POD 1.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult managed his diabetes and insulin regimen during his hospital stay.
Physical therapy evaluated him post-operatively and determined need for rehab placement.
He was noted by bedside RN to have difficulty swallowing, was evaluated by swallow consult and video swallow study who approved him for grounds solids, thin liquids, and crushed meds.
DVT prophylaxis was maintained with heparin SQ, and GI prophylaxis with PPI.
