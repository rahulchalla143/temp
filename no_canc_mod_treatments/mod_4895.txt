His ventilator settings were SIMV with pressure support, title volume of 800, rate 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and FIO2 60%.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white blood count 12.8, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11 and 33.3, platelets 462, MCV 90, sodium 142, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 61, creatinine 2.8, glucose 105.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 74 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, status post open reduction and internal fixation for left trochanteric fracture, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency who presented with worsening shortness of breath times one day and was also noted to be febrile to 102 on admission.
He was continued on Aspirin, beta blocker and Amlodipine.
Pump, he was given Lasix for diuresis which was able to get extubated without any difficulty and he was weaned off oxygen, now down to 2 liters, started two days before discharge and starting to have increased wheezing.
He was started on nebulizers which seemed to help but also decreased urinary output most likely to fluid overload, so on the day before his discharge his Hydralazine was increased to 75 q.i.d.
and he was started on a nesiritide to better perfuse the kidneys since his creatinines were bumping and also to decrease his afterloads.
Since admission he is on Amiodarone and beta blocker for now and continuing to be checked on Telemetry.
Pulmonary - The day before discharge he was initially extubated without any difficulty and weaned off of the oxygen without any difficulty.
On the day before discharge he was on 2 liters of oxygen but continued to have extreme wheezing, bilaterally diffuse and he was started on scheduled nebulizers which helped the patient and will continue with the nebulizers when discharged to the rehabilitation center.
He was also started on nesiritide for afterload reduce and perfuse kidney further which decrease in volume overload will help his pulmonary status.
He was started on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and to continue a 14 day course.
Neurology - He has baseline dementia of unknown etiology, questionable.
He is started on a nesiritide data before discharge to better perfuse the kidneys, also Renal Consult Service was consulted to put in their input.
