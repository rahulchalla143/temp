Advancement of pancreatic enzyme supplements was done but with only minor improvement in his symptoms as he required six to eight tablets every meal.
Given the chronic nature of his stented duct and dilated mid-body pancreatic duct (up to 8 mm with significant calcification and atrophy elsewhere) a Puestow drainage procedure was suggested in order to improve his steatorrhea.
He had an indwelling stent for the better duration of 2 years that was frequently exchanged by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10108**], and he has a tight intrapancreatic biliary stricture demonstrated on ERCP.
He was taken to the OR that day and underwent a Puestow procedure, Roux-en-Y biliary bypass (choledochojejunostomy), open cholecystectomy, and an intraoperative ultrasound.
Immediately post-operatively, the patient was placed on CIWA protocol for concerns of alcoholic withdrawal given his longstanding history of alcoholism.
He, however, was without incident and did well after his procedure.
