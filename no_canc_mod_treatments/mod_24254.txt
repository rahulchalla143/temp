Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.
In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.
Cardiology was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.
The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still in the ER.
He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and continued on a drip following.
DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].
At this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was discontinued.
He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP, however this was discontinued prior to transfer.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Instead the patient was started on an amiodarone drip with beta blockers in an attempt to control his rate.
Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis contributed to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
As the patient remained in a narrow complex tachycardia, the team felt comfortable using diltiazem for rate control in addition to beta blockers as his rate was not well controlled and the likelihood of him converting into a wide complex tachycardia was low.
His rate was eventually controlled on a diltiazem drip and the amiodarone was discontinued.
The patient then spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm with a wide QRS indicative of a right posterior/inferior bypass tract consistent with WPW.
The diltiazem was discontinued and the patient was controlled on beta blockers alone.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation from the time of admission and coumadin was started during hospitalization.
The patient was discharged on propranolol, as there is a possibility thyrotoxicosis could have initially contributed to the A fib with RVR, and coumadin for management of his A fib.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip during his hospitalization and started on coumadin.
The patient was discharged on coumadin with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician for an INR check on Monday following discharge.
As the patient has had cough, malaise and general body weakness flu was on differential, however ruled out during hospitalization.
The CXR on admission showed possible LLL and RLL infiltrate, thus the patient was started on doxycycline and ceftriaxone for CAP.
The patient was continued on ceftriaxone and doxycycline during hospitalization and discharged on cefpodoxime and doxycycline to complete a 10 day course.
# Hypertension:  Initially held antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR with episode of hypotension at OSH in order to up-titrate beta blocker for control of AF as much as possible.
Once the patient was stable on propranolol 80mg TID, lisinopril and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide were restarted.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Lipids checked and were not elevated despite lack of statin therapy.
Consulted endocrine who said the patient was on too high of a replacement dose of levothyroxine.
They recommended adding levothyroxine 150mcg back once stable.
# S/P Gastric Banding:  Continued vitamin supplementation and diet restrictions.
# OSA:  Continued on home CPAP settings, pressure of 10, while inpatient.
The line was pulled prior to discharge.
