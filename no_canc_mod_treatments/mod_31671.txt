In brief this a 56 year old female h/o ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, who was admitted with acute respiratory failure, s/p 2 PEA arrests in the ED and with acute MI s/p DES X2.
When she was laid flat for intubation she had PEA arrest.
CPR was initiated for 3 minutes and patient was given epi and calcium chloride, with spontaneous return of circulation.
She was given lasix and prior to transfer to MICU, she became bradycardic and PEA arrested again.
CPR was initiated for 4 minutes and she was given Epi and atropine.
She then awoke and was following commands and therefore cooling protocol was not performed.
The patient was planned for emergent dialysis however her RUE AVG was noted to be thrombosed and therefore a temporary dialysis line had to be placed.
A left IJ line was attempted with difficulty and U/S confirmed the presence of a left IJ clot.
Also on [**2156-10-18**] EKG was performed which was remarkable for atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate 155bpm, STE in III, STD in V4-6.
CKMB was elevated up to peak of 86, troponin was also elevated and has not yet peaked.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended cardiac catheterization.
Proximal and mid LAD stenoses were noted and were treated with DES x2.
She was also started on heparin, given ASA 325 and started on Atorvastatin, and plavix was continued (home med).

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 96136**] is a 56 year old woman with h/o ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, who was admitted with acute respiratory failure and who had 2 PEA arrests in the ED.
s/p cardiac arrest/NSTEMI: There was concern for ACS, given EKG changes and elevated troponin, despite her end-stage renal disease.
Her cardiac enzymes were positive, with her CK-MB peaking at 86 (MB-index 6.5) and troponin up to 8.43.
She was given full-dose ASA, high-dose statin, heparin IV, and continued on home Plavix.
She got two drug-eluting stents without any complications.
After the procedure she was started on metoprolol instead of her home labetalol for rate control.
She was also started on a low-dose ACE-inhibitor.
The patient was discharged on ASA325mg (increase from prior home dose of 81mg) and Plavix 75mg.
The patient was treated with atorvastatin 80mg while in house.
Prior to discharge she reported a history of myalgias with multiple different statins (not listed on medication allergies).
The risks and benefits were discussed with the patient including the strong indication for statin therapy given recent MI.
A conclusion was decided that patient will start atorvastatin at lower dose (40 instead of 80mg) and she will stop medication and call PCP if any recurrence of myalgias.
She was given Lasix and nitro gtt in the ED, and on arrival to the ICU she underwent emergent dialysis.
Her dialysis fistula had no thrill and seemed clotted (similar to [**2-/2156**]), so a temporary HD line was placed on arrival to the MICU.
After dialysis, patient did well on the ventilator.
ESRD: on HD MWF.
Temporary HD line was placed in the right IJ on arrival to the MICU.
Her fistula had clotted (s/p thrombectomy and revisions x2 in [**2-13**], done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], so transplant surgery was consulted.
She eventually underwent attempted thrombectomy by IR which was unsuccessful therefore she had a tunneled line placed on the right.
She will follow-up outpatient in approximately 6 weeks for consideration of surgical thrombectomy once she has stabilized from a cardiac standpoint.
She was continued on cincalcet, nephrocaps, and increased sevelamer to 3200mg TID.
Given that patient is asymptomatic, the decision was made not to anticoagulate for the time being, as the patient is already on Aspirin and Plavix and therefore high bleeding risk.
She was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
She will have volume management by HD.
HTN: She was previously on Clonidine, Amlodipine, and Labetalol.
These were discontinued and she was started on metoprolol succinate and lisinopril to optimize heart failure management .
Given MRSA history she was started on vancomycin while inpatient and she will receive 3 additional doses of vancomycin IV at her next 3 dialysis sessions.
PAD: She was continued on ASA, Plavix .
DM2: on Lantus and ISS as outpatient.
She may benefit from outpatient diabetic counseling.
TRANSITION OF CARE ================== - Patient will need ASA indefinitely and Plavix for at least one year, and more likely indefinitely given her severe PAD.
- Patient with history of myalgias on statins in the past but with strong indication for statin therapy given recent MI.
PCP should trend CPK regularly and d/c medication if concerning elevation or symptoms.
- Patient should receive 3 additional doses of vancomycin IV at her next 3 dialysis sessions.

It appears what happened was that you had a heart attack on Sunday night prior to your admission.
Therefore these blockages were opened up with stents.
It is also important that you keep taking Aspirin and Plavix every day.
Your Aspirin dose will be increased to 325mg daily.
Do NOT stop taking aspirin and plavix without talking to your cardiologist first.
Therefore you had a tunneled line placed for you to have dialysis.
You received antibiotics in the hospital and you will receive 3 more doses at dialysis.
You should also apply antibiotic ointment to the area of skin breakdown once daily for 1 week.
The following changes were made to your medications: STOP: Clonidine STOP: Amlodipine STOP: Labetalol INCREASE: Sevelamer Carbonate to 3200mg (Four 800mg tabs) Three times daily with meals INCREASE: Aspirin to 325mg daily START: Metoprolol Succinate (Toprol XL) 200mg daily START: Lisinopril 5mg daily START: Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 40mg daily before bed START: Vancomycin 1000mg IV for 3 doses with dialysis START: Triple Antibiotic Ointment apply daily to affected area on left arm for 1 week.
Many of your medications were adjusted therefore it is important that you bring an updated medication list to all of your doctor's appointments.
