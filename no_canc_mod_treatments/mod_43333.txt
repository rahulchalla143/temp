She initially went to see her gastric surgeon, as she had had a bypass revision 6 weeks pta.
In the MICU, she was treated with vancomycin, ampillicin-sulbactam, and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim showed a basal level > 20 but a small increase.
S/p lap RNY gastric bypass [**11-27**] complicated by gastroparesis.
Has had 3 surgeries subsequently to evaluate failure, including lysis of adhesions TPN dependent since [**1-30**].
H/o of PICC infections, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] admission [**6-28**].
Aortic Insufficiency and Mitral Regurgitation [**1-28**] phen-phen use.
Left ureteral stone, s/p stent placement.
Anemia, normocytic, following bypass surgery, baseline 25-32.
Based on [**2186**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Findings could all be due to atelectasis, but may also represent aspiration or developing pneumonia.

Left PIC catheter passes into the right atrium where the tip is indistinct.

Her hospital course as summarized by problem was as follows: .
In the MICU, she was treated with fluids and covered empirically with Vancomycin and Unasyn.
Within 24 hours, her blood pressure had sufficiently stabilized for her to be transferred to the floor.
However, although she did not have a line at the time of presentation, she did have a history of PICC line infections with the same organism that showed similar patterns of antibiotic resistance.
She was consequently treated with Vancomycin for several days (roughly six), until after more blood cultures had returned negative.
One urine culture (of six) was also positive for bacterial growth, producing enterobacter and morganella.
Given the relatively low sensitivity of this test for endocarditis, a transesophageal echo was suggested, but the patient was highly resistant to this, even after the bariatric surgeon who was consulted assured her that this would not be contraindicated in a patient with her previous surgeries.
This was presumed to be the ultimate cause of her malaise, fevers, and tachypnea.
She was treated with Vancomycin and Unasyn initially; Unasyn was later removed and Zosyn added to cover both aspiration and hospital-acquired (e.g.
Vancomycin was discontinued after roughly six days (two days after the ID consultants recommended stopping it), when enough blood cultures had been negative to convince us that the initial coag-negative staph was a contaminant.
Zosyn was stopped after nine days, when she had shown clinical improvement (afebrile for 72 hours, WBC count falling from peak of 36 to 26, respiratory rate decreased from 26 to 22) and when the Hematology consultants suggested that it may be responsible for her worsening thrombocytopenia (see below).
Two days prior to stopping Zosyn, she had been started on Flagyl for presumed C. diff, despite the negative C. diff Toxin A test; she received 3 days of this antibiotic.
Heparin-dependent antibodies, 95% sensitive for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), were negative.
Fibrinogen and coagulation times were normal, making DIC less likely.
All Heparin products were also stopped.
DVT prophylaxis was effected with pneumatic boots.
She was aggressively hydrated with lactated Ringer's solution in place of normal saline.
She was noted to have a poor nutritional status after gastric bypass with multiple revisions.
She was given a diet with 60-70 grams of protein per day.
Her creatinine rose to a peak of 1.5 after receiving IV CT contrast.
This was thought likely due to diarrhea combined with acute stress (catecholamine response); she was repleted to maintain K > 3.6. .
9. s/p Gastric bypass.
Her abdominal exam was followed and her nutrition was supplemented with the recommendations of a nutritionist.
She was transfused with one unit of packed RBC with the thought that this might improve her symptoms of tachycardia and fatigue.
Before further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions could be enacted, she became markedly tachypneic, and "triggered" for a respiratory rate of 36.
A code blue was called to intubate her on the floor; during the intubation she became bradycardic and received atropine and epinephrine.
