By report, his seizure started around 8:30 pm with tensing and shaking his bilateral shoulders, arms, and face.
He has been taking Keppra 1 tablet [**Hospital1 **] at home instead of 2 tables of 750mg = 1500 mg as prescribed by his neurologyst.
His last seizure was in [**7-24**] in the setting of a UTI and medication noncompliance.
He was urgently intubated and sedated, but developed seizure in the ED each time propofol was weaned.
While in the ED his SBPs dropped into the 80s and he was started on Levophed.
An LP was recommended but not performed in the ED due to a policy of not doing LPs on patients with hardware in the CNS.
On the floor he is intubated and sedated.
Review of Systems: Not obtainable as Pt is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed  Past Medical History: - Traumatic head and neck injury s/p MVC in [**2091**] in Bolivia with brain and spinal cord damage, s/p shunt and shunt revision.
Baseline non-verbal, spastic quadriparesis.
- Recurrent complex partial seizures with secondary generalization s/p MVC, described in prior notes as a "shaking of his extremities, facial twitching and/or mouth movements/lip smacking", usually occur in clusters and are prolonged.
Patient was instructed to take Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], but was only taking 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] "because his mother did not make the dose increase as recommended because he has not had any seizures and becuase she is trying to make Keppra last longer."
- History of pansensitive Proteus UTI with urinary retention [**2104-3-18**] - History Staph aureus bacteremia s/p 6 weeks of nafcillin initially planned to be completed in [**8-25**] - Line associated right internal jugular thrombophlebitis diagnosed in [**7-25**] with plan at that time for 3 months of AC - Known history of aspiration  Social History: - He lives with mother and is minimally functional since the accident per his mother "like a one month old baby".
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2106-11-16**] 9:44 PM FINDINGS: As before, one ventriculostomy catheter via right transparietal approach, traverses the right lateral ventricle and septum pellucidum, to terminate in the dilated frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
A second ventriculostomy catheter, via right transfrontal approach, terminates with ts tip in the floor of the third ventricle.
The patient is intubated and the endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina.
An orogastric tube coils within the stomach.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-11-16**] 9:24 PM FINDINGS: Patient is status post ET tube placement.
An NG tube is seen terminating in the stomach and coiled within the stomach.
A VP shunt and central line are unchanged in appearance.
ET tube 3.0 cm above the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 year old gentleman with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, bactreremia with a VP shunt in place on long term antibiotics (cephalexin to [**3-/2107**]), and aspiration in the past who was admitted in status eplipticus with a high fever and possible pneumonia on CXR.
# Status eplipticus: Required lorazepam and propofol to control initially.
He was intubated for airway protection in the ED.
Etiology in unclear, but likely due to medication non-compliance and infection.
He was weaned off of standing lorazepam.
He tolerated all these changes well without any evidence of seizures.
His final EEG off on lorazepam on [**2106-11-27**] was not concerning for new seizures per Neurology consultants.
Initially treated empirically with CeftriaXONE 2 gm IV Q12H for CNS penetration, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV Q24H for CAP, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H for Gram positives give history of long term nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, and MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500 mg IV Q8H aspiration (in combination with vancomycin and levofloxacin).
Initially on Dexamethasone 10 mg IV Q6H for possible Strep pneumo meningitis.
Once CSF results ruled out meningitis, was transitioned to ceftriaxone 1g IV daily, azithromycin and metronidazole 500mg IV TID for aspiration PNA.
Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the infectious disease specialist, who saw him before was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding the course of cephalexin and stated that he will need to be on this medication till [**2107-3-17**].
# Aspiration: Dophoff was placed initially for tube feeds.
After a family meeting, the decision was made to place PEG tube for long term nutrition and medications.
Sugery was consulted and patient underwent PEG placement by surgery on [**2106-11-26**].
Patient tolerated the procedure well.
Patient was started on warfarin after the PEG placement.
He continued to take treatment dose lovenox throughout his stay here.
He was taking VTE treatment dose dalteparin prior to admission for the h/o RIJ thrombus.
We asked the mother to bring in the dalteparin medication which was verfired by the pharmacist ([**Doctor First Name **]) as correct medication and dose.
He was asked to start taking dalteparin as bridge to warfarin.
# FEN: Patient had tube feeds after Dobhoff placement and free water flushes 150cc q4h for hypernatremia.
His tube feeds were changed to PEG feeds after placement and he tolerated it well.
