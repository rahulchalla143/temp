An NG tube lies with its tip below the diaphragm although the tip is not visualized on this study.
There is increased opacity at the right base with homogenous opacification consistent with a pleural effusion.
Endotracheal tube is seen 5 cm above the carina.
The nasogastric tube is seen coiled with the tip within the antrum of the stomach.
This right kidney lesion can be further evaluated with ultrasound after the patient's acute clinical condition resolves.

Pertinent labs on discharge: Hemoglobin 7.5 Hct 22.6.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 y/o M with Stage IV CKD (Cr 4.5), HTN, DM2, p/w weakness & SOB x 3 days, found to have RML/RLL PNA and acute on chronic renal failure, transferred for consideration of urgent hemodialysis.
Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Patient arrrived intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation.
He was treated initially for community acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but switched to vancomycin and cefepime as he did not intially improve.
Urine legionella antigen was positive and antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin.
He was continued on levofloxacin with a planned total course of 21 days (Day #15 at discharge).
Chest compressions were started promptly, he received epinephrine, atropine and received one electrical defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation.
He received adenosine for SVT, then switchedinto atrial fibrillation with RVR.
He was give amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an infusion at 1mg/hr for six hours, then 0.5 mg/hr for 18 hours.
He was initially treated with kayexalate, and IV bicarbonate.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed and CVVH was initiated.
A left internal jugular tunneled catheter was placed, and he was started on intermittent hemodialysis.
He was started on Aluminum Hydroxide, this was changed to calcium acetate on discharge.
He was noted to be severely anemic (Hct 22-25) and possibility of transfusion was discussed, but patient refused.
After completing his course of amiodarone post arrest, he was started on diltiazem 30mg PO qid with fair to good rate control (80s to 100s).
He was started on a heaprin drip and warfarin.
Heparin dependent antibodies were sent and he was initially switched to argatroban; antibodies returned negative.
He will require INR checks on [**2180-4-14**] and [**2180-4-17**] with further adjustments as needed.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not require insulin therapy upon discharge.
This was thought to be secondary to levofloxacin therapy.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] will need to arrange for regular INR checks while on warfarin after discharge.
- Patient will need INR monitored tomorrow and Monday and warfarin dose adjusted accordingly.
- Patient will complete his course of levofloxacin after 3 additional doses Q48H (next dose [**2180-4-14**]).

You were started on warfarin anticoagulation therapy to minimize your risk of stroke.
You improved on antibiotics and were transfered to the medical floor where your respiratory status improved and you defervesed.
You were continued on dialysis 3x per week.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: - STOP TAKING atenolol while using the diltiazem.
- STOP TAKING minitran patch while using the diltiazem.
- BEGIN TAKING diltiazem 30 mg PO every 6 hours for heart rate control (your doctor may wish to change you to a once-daily formula once you are stable on this regimen) - BEGIN TAKING warfarin 2.5 mg PO daily (your doctor will need to monitor your INR and may need to adjust your dose) - BEGIN TAKING Phos-Lo to control your phosphate levels (total 4 tablets daily or as directed by your nephrologist) - BEGIN TAKING aspirin 81 mg PO daily - TAKE AS NEEDED acetaminophen for fever or pain - COMPLETE COURSE of levofloxacin (antibiotic) for your pneumonia (3 more doses over 6 days)  Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
You should review your medications with your doctor and discuss referral to a cardiologist for your atrial fibrillation.
You will also need to have your INR monitored regularly while on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.
