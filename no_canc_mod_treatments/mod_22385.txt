The left chest tube remains in place.
The tip of the right-sided PICC line is identified in the distal portion of the right subclavian vein.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Orally administered Optiray contrast was observed under fluoroscopic guidance passing freely into the stomach with no evidence for extra luminal extravasation.
Thin barium was then orally administered for better resolution of the esophagus.
On that day, he underwent a repair of his cervical esophageal perforation with wide drainage of the neck, right thoracotomy, exploration and wide drainage of the mediastinum, placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, placement of left chest tube, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy.
He was placed on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole as prophylaxis.
Lastly, he had been on tube feeds throughout his hospital course and which were begun on POD 4.
Furthermore, a JP fluid culture from [**9-22**] was also positive for Klebsiella and he was then switched from Unasyn to Levofloxacin on [**2101-9-24**] for more narrowed, specific antibiotic coverage.
He, however, continued to spike intermittent fevers during his initial hospital course despite broad and specific spectrum antibiotic coverage.
His vancomycin was stopped at that time and he was continued on zosyn, fluconazole and levofloxacin which will continue for about one month after discharge from the hospital.
He is asked to return each week for follow-up so that his last remaining neck drain may be evaluated and slowly removed.
