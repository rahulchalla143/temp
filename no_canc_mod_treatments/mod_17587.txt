Admission Date:  [**2186-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia s/p elective ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: This is a 75 yo F with a past medical history significant for COPD, CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CVA, who became increasingly hypoxic and tachypneic following an elective ERCP today.
She underwent an ERCP at that time and had a stent placed in the CBD.
She was treated with antibiotics and volume resuscitation and discharged to [**Hospital1 1501**] with a scheduled follow up ERCP when the patient had stabilized.
She was intubated for the procedure and received a total of 400cc LR during the procedure and 500cc of fluid in the PACU.
She was given a nebulizer and a MICU eval was requested.
An ABG and CXR were requested and given the patient's history of CHF and the fact that she takes daily lasix and received almost 1L of fluid in several hours, a dose of 40mg IV lasix was suggested as well.
A foley was placed and lasix administered, which the patient responded to promptly, with improvement of her symptoms.
Past Medical History: COPD CAD s/p CABG, s/p MI CHF (reported EF=50%) HTN s/p CVA, on coumadin - residual L hemiparesis recent history of cholangitis s/p ERCP in [**4-24**] with gallstones identified; reportedly was septic at this time.
Hyperlipidemia Hx of psychosis GERD, PUD Hypothyroidism 5cm AAA s/p R hip replacement Paget's ds depression, anxiety Constipation Diverticulosis dementia   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: vitals: T 96.2 HR 101 BP 157/67 R 18 Sat 88-96% on facemask with nasal airway in place General: elderly female, asleep, drowsy, NAD HEENT: AT/NC, PERRL, OP clear.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with acute hypoxia and tachypnea following elective ERCP, due to volume overload, exacerbated by sleep apnea.
Respiratory Distress: Given her improved CXR and clinical picture post-diuresis, it appeared that the primary cause of respiratory distress was likely fluid overload, and most likely, given that her sats were already decreased pre-procedure, that she was already volume overloaded before even receiving the additional liter of fluid pre-procedure.
Blood gas analysis suggests improvement of respiratory acidosis with bipap 10/5/5L, likely chronic compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
By the time she was transferred out to the floor, she was on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L by NC, and tolerating bipap at night well.
On the floor the patient had one episode of oxygen desaturation to the 70s which resolved with increasing oxygen via nasal canula to 5L.
The patient's diuretic regimen was increased to 40mg po bid however her serum creatinine continued to rise and her lasix was held.
Her oxygen saturation however has remained stable at her baseline requiring 2Liters nasal canula to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-94%.
We have restarted her lasix at a lower dose of 20mg daily.
She has continued on her prior COPD regimen of spiriva, low dose prednisone and nebs prn.
2. s/p ERCP - patient is stable from an ERCP perspective with successful removal of stone from CBD and subsequent sphincterotomy.
Her BP meds were initially held after she was transferred to the ICU however the isosorbide was added back upon transfer to the floor.
She was started on lipitor 20mg po daily and will need to have her LFTs monitored in the future.
6. s/p CVA - coumadin held for ERCP -Resuming coumadin at prior dose of 5mg po daily.
She is not a candidate for lovenox given her renal function and it was felt that the risks outweighed the benefits for starting her on IV heparin at this time.
Depression, anxiety, ?psychosis - continue ritalin, lexapro - continue to hold all sedating meds .
Continue to monitor electrolytes.
PPx: heparin subcut, bowel reg, ppi was administered while she was an inpatient.
