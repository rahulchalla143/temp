She took off his CPAP machine as she figured it must have been disfunctioning.
Per records, he presented with a nasal trumpet airway and was assisted with bag valve respiration in a postictal state that was not improving.
He did not arrest but was intubated given altered mental status.
His inital ABG after intubation showed: pH 6.7, PCO2 54, PO2 239.
He was not given IV bicarbonate.
He was given 100mg IV keppra (due to an allergy to dilantin, which was previously used for seizure prophylaxis after his pituitary tumor resection).
The patient was started on Norepinephrine IV gtt.
He was empirically started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for possible community-acquired meningitis.
He was also started on acyclovir for possible HSV encephalitis.
The patient was also started on Norepinephrine IV gtt for hypotension, and he had a femoral central line and OGT placed.
Past Medical History: 1) Pituitary adenoma s/p resection ~ 7 years ago with reoccurance of growth s/p XRT 2) panhypopituitarism 3) Diabetes Mellitus 4) HTN 5) HL 6) OSA on CPAP    Social History: He lives with his wife in [**Name2 (NI) 479**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Name (NI) 108**].
He obtains his medications at [**Company 4916**] (phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 112158**]).
The patient is status post surgery, in the sella.
Focal area of altered signal intensity in the left frontal lobe with very minimal peripheral enhancement and extensive foci of negative susceptibility within, likely relates to an area of prior blood products.

Following resting images and 20 seconds following intravenous regadenoson, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
He has been placed on levetiracetam 750mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
# Respiratory: Initial respiratory difficulty presumably was a result of altered mental status during post-ictal phase.
# Cardiovascular: Initial lab abnormalities included elevated cardiac enzymes.
On initial presentation he was hypotensive so he received pressor support and anti-hypertensive medications were held.
Thereafter he received home medication, amlodipine.
Given the EKG changes and CKMB elevation on admission, it was decided that during his admission he should have a pharmacological stress test with nuclear imaging.
Throughout this admission he slept with CPAP to continue his treatment for OSA.
A stress dose of steroids was given in the MICU.
Throughout his admission he was continued on thyroid hormone replacement, DDAVP, and prednisone.
He should follow up with an endocrinologist to discuss his regimen, including whether he needs stress-dose steroids for illness and other emergency situations.
Medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins were avoided.
He had no difficulties eating, drinking, or taking medications by mouth throughout this admission.
Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Prednisone 7.5 mg PO DAILY 2.

After being stabilized and intubated at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital, you were transferred to our ICU.
Because you had a seizure, we started you on an antiepileptic medication called levetiracetam (Keppra), please continue taking this at 750 mg twice daily.
Specifically, you should discuss whether you should get a home prescription for stress dose steroids in case of an illness.
You should follow up with occupational therapy and perhaps an orthopedic surgeon for your rotator cuff injury.
You should have outpatient physical therapy for your L shoulder injury.
