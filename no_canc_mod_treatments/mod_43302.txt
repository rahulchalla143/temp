Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by issue)  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Etiology was thought to be multifactorial with LV failure and subsequently pulmonary edema as well as the severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was treated aggressively with antihypertensive regimen, as well as diuresis, appropriate amounts of sedation as the patient was highly anxious with minimal stimulation with increase in her pulmonary artery pressures to systolic measurements of 100 mmHg.
Etiology of her chronic pulmonary hypertension was most likely secondary to hypertension of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, but seemed to be adequately treated with aggressive antihypertensive regimen.
The patient was re-intubated and treated with aggressive doses of IV steroids and eventually transitioned to PO Prednisone, of which she will taper off.
Subsequent re-attempts at extubation were successful without any evidence of recurrence, laryngeal edema.
She was treated with a ten-day course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl and improved clinically.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was kept on her home regimen of diabetes treatment and had fairly well controlled blood glucose, except for when she was on high doses of steroids during which time she briefly required an insulin drip.
HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient was stable on a dose of Levothyroxine and had a normal TSH.
