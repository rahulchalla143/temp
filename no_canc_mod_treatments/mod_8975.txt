Initial Cardiology recommendations advised conservative management with a beta blocker, but no Heparinization given the patient's lumbar puncture results.
The patient subsequently stated that he would like to be discharged immediately; however, following discussions with case management and primary team, the patient was convinced to remain in-house for the duration of his medical workup.
Given the patient's negative head scan and markedly improved mental status with little intervention, the leading diagnosis for his acute mental status change was believed to be a postictal state.
The patient was subsequently restarted on his outpatient seizure and Parkinson's medications to good effect.
The patient was subsequently advised to remain on an one-to-one sitter for risk of elopement, and Ativan standing dosage was recommended given the potential for the patient to go into benzodiazepine withdrawal.
The patient subsequently recommended for a cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2189-4-6**], which subsequently demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease with 70% proximal irregular stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, total occlusion of the circumflex, and total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery.
Following a discussion of the relative risks and benefits of surgical intervention, the patient subsequently consented to undergo a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve repair to take place on [**2189-4-8**].
On [**2189-4-8**], the patient therefore underwent a coronary artery bypass graft using anastomosis from the LIMA to the LAD, and a mitral annuloplasty using a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.
In addition, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted via the patient's right femoral artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 122 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 79 minutes.
Patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, CVP catheter, and IAVP; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; mediastinal and right and left pleural tubes were placed intraoperatively.
Drips on transfer included milrinone, epi, and propofol.
On postoperative day #4, the patient's PA catheter, pacer wires, and chest tube were removed without complication, and on postoperative day #5, the patient was cleared for transfer to the floor.
The patient demonstrated several additional episodes of anxiety attacks through the course of his time on the regular patient floor, all of which responded well to Ativan administration.
Patient's Foley catheter was subsequently removed without complication.
On postoperative day #6, a routine chest radiograph demonstrated evidence of a left basilar infiltrate versus atelectasis; the patient was subsequently begun on levofloxacin for a 10 day course to be completed as an outpatient.
Patient was subsequently cleared for discharge to home with home VNA services and home Physical Therapy on postoperative day #7, [**2189-4-15**].
