ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to Atrovent, ampicillin, amoxicillin, sulfa, Macrodantin, Biaxin and erythromycin.
The chest was clear bilaterally with well healed surgical scars.
It was felt that the patient would benefit from mitral valve replacement; however, the patient stated that there were technical problems with her prior surgery at [**Hospital6 1129**] and the surgery was delayed until the records could be obtained and reviewed.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2133-6-23**] for re-do mitral valve replacement with a #27 Carbomedics valve via a right thoracotomy.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
At the time of transfer, she had an arterial line, a Swan-Ganz catheter, two atrial pacing wires and two pleural chest tubes.
She was weaned from her propofol and weaned from the ventilator and extubated on the morning of postoperative day #1.
Later in the day, she was transferred from the intensive care unit to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Her chest tubes were discontinued and she was started back on her Coumadin to protect her remaining mechanical valve.
At that time, she was treated with Lopressor and started on procainamide.
Both her Lopressor and procainamide were continued.
Also on postoperative day #5, she was started on heparin to further anticoagulate her while waiting for her INR to respond to the increasing Coumadin doses.
The thoracotomy incision with staples was open to air, clean and dry with small ecchymotic areas along the margin and no erythema.
The right groin incision with staples continued to drain clear serous fluid with no erythema or ecchymosis.
