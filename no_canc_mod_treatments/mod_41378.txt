The patient is status post CABG with native coronary calcification.
The spleen and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with subjacent atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema.
Sub-cm hypodensity within the right kidney, too small to characterize, but likely simple renal cyst.
Was placed on CAP coverage and diuresed for suspected new onset CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 2686**]), eventually broadened to vanc/cefepime and placed on a lasix gtt.
A family meeting was held to discuss goals of care; at that point, we felt that we either needed to pursue intubation with full therapeutic management (ARDSnet volumes, aggressive suctioning for secretions, etc) or be made CMO as he was approaching 4 days on bipap without any improvement and was already maximized on other therapies.
He was placed on a morphine gtt and actually maintained on the bipap until his whole family arrived.
Eventually, the morphine gtt was increased and his bipap was removed.
