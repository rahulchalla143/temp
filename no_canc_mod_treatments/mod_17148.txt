Endotracheal tube heading towards right mainstem bronchus.
Following gadolinium administration, no convincing enhancement is noted within or surrounding the right pontine hematoma except for mild subtle enhancement along its margins.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo woman w/ HTN, DM, atrial fibrillation on coumadin presented with acute onset mental status changes and hemiparesis.
Her admission exam was notable for ability to follow axial and appendicular commands, symmetric and reactive pupils, a hypotropic R eye, a conjugate gaze paralysis with difficulty crossing midline on rightward gaze, R UMN facial droop, and decreased left sided strength with L arm antigravity but ataxic, L leg anti-gravity and right arm purposeful and leg antigravity.
She was given Nalaxone, Vitamin K, and Proplex.
Her mental status was found to be deteriorating and she was intubated for airway protection.
Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies were initially held and readdressed in 2 weeks time.
If neuro-active medications are required, please use Seroquel.
Hypertension: Her blood pressure was controlled initially with a labetolol drip and PRN hydralazine for target SBP < 160, DBP < 105, and MAP < 130.
This was later changed to metoprolol, diltiazem, and lisinopril with good blood pressure control.
She initially required a diltiazem drip and then PRN metoprolol IV for rate control.
She was transitioned to PO metoprolol and diltiazem but remained with slightly elevated rates despite maximum doses of these medications.
As her rates remained elevated, she was started on digoxin and with full dose metoprolol, diltiazem and digoxin her heart rate improved significantly.
With neurology approval a low dose aspirin was started for anti-platelet benefits.
Patient should follow-up with her cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management of her atrial fibrillation.
She was extubated on [**2-26**] however had increasing secretion and tachypnea and required re-intubation.
A discussion was held with the family regarding tracheostomy and she underwent tracheostomy placement on [**3-1**].
She was diuresed with IV lasix prn.
The patient will be with the tracheostomy at rehab and will likely need to be reevalutated by speech and swallow as she improves for considerations of a PM valve and eventual considerations for reversal of tracheostomy.
Urince culture was positive for pan-sensitive Citrobacter for which she received 7-day course of Ciprofloxacin.
Patient defervesced on this regimen.
Blood cultures without growth at time of discharge, sputum cultures with 1+ GNRs which may or may not be contaminant.
Coagulopathy: Coagulation labs and platelets were checked 1 hour after administration of proplex and 2U FFP and vitamin K 10mg SQ.
She required 1 pack platelets for low platelet count (83,000) and additional 2U FFP for elevated INR 1.4.
She also received vitamin K 10mg SQ x3 total for complete reversal of coumadin.
Hyperglycemia: She was treated with insulin sliding scale, her home metformin, and new glipizide.
FEN: PEG was placed after discussion with family (HCP) on [**3-1**].
She was given tube feeds and tolerated this well.
Mild leaking was noted around PEG tube site; surgical team re-evaluated incision site and felt that area was within normal limits.
