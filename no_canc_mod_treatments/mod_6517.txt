220 ml serosanguinous fluid was removed from pericardial sac, pigtail was placed for continuous drainage.
Baseline resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right sided pressures (RA mean 10 mmHg), normal pulmonary, and normal left sided pressures with a normal cardiac index (3.3 l/min/m2).
Pericardiocentesis was performed and approximately 220 ml of sero-sanguinous fluid was removed until pericardial pressure was less than 0.
RA pressure following the intervention was 5 mmHg.
A pericardial catheter was left to drain and the patient left the laboratory in stable condition.
# Pericardial effusion and Cardiac: Differential Dx:  Possibilities for etiology of pericardial and pleural effusion include drug-induced hypersensitivity (increased serum eosinophil count), drug effect (patient was taking copaxone for years and zenapax for 4 months, both of which deviates T cells to a Th2 response, which promotes an eosinophilic response), infection (GPC in broth from pericardial biopsy), and autoimmune disease (unusual presentation of lupus or vasculitis to have isolated effusions).
The patient was taken to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis with removal of 220 ml of serosanguinous fluid and placement of a pigtail catheter.
Another 200 cc drained on the floor before the catheter stopped draining and was pulled on [**3-17**].
Following pericardiocentesis and drainage, she continued to have a large circumferential pericardial effusion by TTE without signs of tamponade.
Patient's fever improved after surgical evacuation of pericardial effusion, with maximum temp 99.5 during last day.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient was advised to follow up with her neurologist and stop taking Copaxone (glatiramer) HS and Zenapax for life.
