There was a left femoral neck fracture for which the patient underwent open reduction, internal fixation at [**Hospital6 5016**].
He also sustained a left distal radius fracture, right humeral head fracture, and lacerations of the head.
He received six units of packed red blood cells.
On the evening of [**2184-10-20**], the patient became markedly hypoxic and was not responsive to Lasix and nebulizer treatments.
MEDICATIONS ON ARRIVAL:  Tequin, Kefzol, Procardia, Lipitor, and Pepcid.
An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube were in place.
Two chest tubes were placed and the patient remained intubated.
Since then he has done well with aggressive pulmonary toilet.
He was on nebulizer treatment around the clock and was getting aggressive chest therapy with incentive spirometry.
Other studies performed here included chest CT scan angiogram which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, the pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and pneumothoraces seen initially and consolidations of the lung bases.
Orthopedics:  The patient has a left hip fracture status post open reduction, internal fixation.
The patient is remaining on Coumadin for his hip fracture and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
The patient was placed on vitamins for a question of Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome.
This issue was treated with community reorientation and support from his family.
Infectious Disease:  The patient presented initially on Tequin and Kefzol.
Numerous sputum cultures, line cultures, and other investigations for infectious disease were negative.
The patient subsequently had an ultrasound guided hip joint catheter to rule out infection there, which was also negative.
At one point, the patient was placed on several antibiotics, including vancomycin, for empiric treatment.
It was unclear if the patient had a febrile response to the treatment or if he actually had an infectious disease.
For the remainder of this [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he has been off of antibiotics and has been afebrile.
He has had mild tachycardia which we feel is secondary to Albuterol treatment.
He is eating with encouragement and assistance.
He is making urine and stool is to be transferred to [**Hospital6 **] facility today for continued chest physical therapy and strengthening exercises.
