# Confusion: Ddx included hypoglycemia, sedating medications, infection, central neuro process, malnutrition., hypercarbia.
We then gradually restarted her antipsychotic medications.
She is reportedly on 15/5 BiPAP at night but has been recently on it all day at rehab.
She then tolerated trach collar for >8h on [**10-17**] but returned to SIMV at night.
We continued her inhalers and oral care.
Recent cx data from [**Hospital1 **] include sputum w stenotrophonomas, acinetobacter, and pseudomonas.
She was discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-1**] with cefepime and vanco to complete course of PNA rx.
She then was on levaquin and clinda for PNA but switched to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] on [**10-13**].
She was also on PO vanco for  c diff.
On presentation, we initially covered her broadly with cefepime, vanco, and PO vanco.
Given stable resp status, we stopped antibiotics within 24h, except we continued CDiff treatment with PO flagyl.
- A sputum culture grew Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, with sensitivities similar to what had been obtained at rehab.
She had no clear infiltrate on chest CT, but given her initial respiratory failure, we empirically began a 7-day course of meropenem (for the Pseudomonas) and tobramycin (for the Acinetobacter) for presumed tracheobronchitis.
Her respiratory status immproved with these antibiotics, and she will complete a 7-day course.
We held her lasix and antihypertensives and her BP stabilized within 24h.
Lasix was resumed one day prior to discharge, with SBPs remaining in the 100s.
We continued to hold her Isordil in order to allow for diuresis with her Lasix.
# Atrial fibrillation: We initially held her coumadin in the setting of her low hematocrit, but this was resumed on [**10-18**].
Continued neurontin for neuropathic pain .
Statin was continued.
Allopurinol continued.
# Nutrition: Prior to admission, she had had no tube feeds for 2wks.
An NG tube was placed so that tube feeds and medications could be administered.
She will continue the tube feeds at rehab until she is able to sustain her nutrition by mouth.
# PPx: bowel regimen, PPI, SQ Heparin .
# Access: PICC line .
# Dispo: She is being discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab for continuation of her above antibiotics, continued respiratory support for her chronic obstructive sleep apnea, and for continued nutritional and physical support, as above.
