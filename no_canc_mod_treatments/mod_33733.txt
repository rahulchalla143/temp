Physical exam revealed large amount of nasal flaring and pt reported orthopnea.
Pt did not receive influenza vaccination this year.
O2 saturation was noted to be 87% and patient was receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.
He was then given nebs and was placed on a venti mask at 12LPM at 10:03 with a sat of 89%.
He was placed on bipap with oxygen saturation coming up to 100%.

Pt was maxed on pressors, was treated with broad spectrum abx, electrolyes were repleted, and patient was maximally fluid resuscitated.
In the ICU patient, the patient developed a PEA arrest from which he was resuscitated with atropine and epinephrine.
Despite maximal vent settings we only achieved oxygen saturations in the low 70s.
