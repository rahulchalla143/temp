IMPRESSION:  This is a 64 year old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and a quiet Factor [**Month (only) 7060**] inhibitor diagnosed earlier this year who presents with her second left thigh hematoma.
As the patient was symptomatic with hypotension and some lightheadedness it was decided to transfuse the patient with 1 unit of packed red cells.
She received this transfusion without complications.
She was treated with small intravenous fluid boluses until the blood was prepared.
Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide which is both for her rheumatoid arthritis and acquired Factor [**Name (NI) 7060**] inhibitor, she was initially given as stated above Factor VII, q.
On the morning of hospital day #2 the patient's hematocrit had stabilized at 27.2 after a unit of packed red cells.
In order to do this, the patient had to be temporarily transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] as these transfusions could not be administered on the floor q.
Her hematocrit remained relatively stable and she required no further blood transfusions.
She was continued on her Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Her discharge medications were not changed from her admission medications.
