Labs on discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old woman with DM2, morbid obesity, PMR recently restarted on steroids admitted with hyperglycemia, diarrhea, tachycardia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, all now improved.
Unclear precipitant but most likely related to recent diarrhea/infection in addition to steroid use.
Of note, patient also missed her PM dose of insulin prior to presentation.
Has mild leukocytosis but no fever although steroids may be masking a fever.
Patient was continued on her home insulin regimen.
Hyperkalemia: Likely related to renal failure in setting of ACE and spironolactone use +/- dietary indiscretion.
Patient will hold her ACEi and aldactone until discussion with her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] BP here was well controlled off these medications.
Hyponatremia: Initial corrected sodium 129 (122), now improved with IVF resuscitation suggesting most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Has improved back to baseline with IVF in ED.
HTN: Held all meds except metoprolol and BP remainded stable.
I asked her to stop her aldactone and resume Lasix and ACEi (lisinopril) and see her PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 2678**] on her way out.
