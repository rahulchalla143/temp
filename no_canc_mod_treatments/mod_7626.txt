History of Present Illness: 57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, dm2, bilateral RAS, copd p/w sudden onset SOB to OSH.
He was given morphine, labetalol IV 20, nebs, solumedrol 125 IV, ceftriaxone 1 gm, d-dimer was 1800(nl is 400).
He received 200 lasix IC as well and put out well.
There were non-specific small ST elevations II, III, aVF that resolved with improved bp control.
CABG [**12-19**], LIMA-LAD, SVG-RPL-RPDA, SVG-D1, L radial artery-OM.
Radial-OM stented at this time complicated distal edge dissection.
OM filling via radial graft which has 70% mid vessel lesion.
Grafts on last cath: LIMA-LAD 80% proximal stenosis; stenting of ostium [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 35065**]-OM 90% instent stenosis; stenting of ostial ISR arterial graft .
- PVD - [**1-20**] - directional atherectomy to R SFA.

Brief Hospital Course: 57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, DM2, Renal Artery Stenosis, COPD p/w sudden-onset SOB to OSH.
Underwent angiography & stenting of Right Renal Artery & celiac artery [**2131-7-4**].
PE was considered as a possible cause of the acute respiratory decompensation given the history; however, the pt's rapid improvement with diuresis argued against this.
He was treated with aspirin, [**Month/Year (2) **], Statin and beta-blocker.
Prior to renal artery stenting, pt required Nitro gtt and multiple anti-hypertensive to try to control his SBP.
Following RRA stenting, pt was weaned off Nitro drip & BP normalized, though still on multiple anti-hypertensive medications.
The day prior to discharge the pt's SBP ranged from 110's to 130's on the following regimen: Toprol XL 200mg daily, HCTZ 25mg daily, amlodipine 10mg daily, Imdur 120mg daily, and hydralazine 25mg QID.
His regimen was re-adjusted on the morning of discharge: the hydralazine was discontinued and lasix 20mg daily (his previous dose) was started.
Initiation of an ACEi was considered, particularly given the pt's h/o CHF & diabetes; however, given the number of changes made to the pt's anti-hypertensive regimen prior to discharge we refrained from this.
Once the pt has been stabilized on his new regimen as an outpt, he will likely benefit from an ACEi.
He was given ceftriaxone x1 was given at OSH.
He recieved albuterol & tiatropium inhalers .
## Proph: pt received sub-cutaneous heparin and PPI ## Code: full ## Social: pt seen by social work--SOCIAL WORK:  Pt referred to SW to support pt/family coping.
