Pt is somewhat of a poor historian as she is post-op on arrival to the ICU, but is able to state that she called the ambulance after she began feeling "so hot".
She denies any recent cough, dysuria, diarrhea, no sick contacts, no recent travel; last hospitalization approximately one month ago for MS exacerbation.
The patient had a left SC port-a-cath that had been placed in [**2139**] for better access for IV steroid requirements during her MS flares.
This was thought to be the likely source of infection, and surgery was consulted.
She was given a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin along with 3 liters IVF in the ED, and admitted to the MICU for further management.
The port was removed by surgery on the day of admission.
Hypotension resolved with fluid boluses, and pt did not require any pressors.
Pt was initially started on Vancomycin and Levo changed to Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime after culture data returned; Pt was afebrile for 72 hours before discharge.
A PICC line was placed for long term antibiotic treatment(2 week course), pt was discharged with VNA for IV services.
Resolved with IVF and continued on vitamin D; phosphate was repleted.
# Hypertension- possibly secondary to pain - initially held hctz and lopressor in setting of infection; restarted after port-a-cath removal and 24 hours stability on regular medical floor.
