CPK total was 47 and troponin 0.3.
She was placed on intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin and she was on BIPAP mask and was pan cultured.
She was empirically placed on antibiotics for presumed pneumonia.
A cardiology consultation was obtained and it was the thought of the cardiology service to consider aortic valve replacement at that time.
Cardiothoracic surgery consult was obtained on [**2135-9-17**] by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] who felt that she was an appropriate candidate for aortic valve replacement which was scheduled for [**2135-9-19**].
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2135-9-19**] where she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #21 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve.
She was AV paced on propofol drip.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained fully paced on intravenous amiodarone, apparently to suppress her history of atrial fibrillation which was her baseline rhythm as well.
Her Neo-Synephrine was placed on the night of surgery and weaned off by the morning of postoperative day #1.
She was weaned off all vasoactive drips.
She was weaned from mechanical ventilator and extubated successfully and her chest tubes were discontinued.
She was begun on Coumadin for anticoagulation for her chronic atrial fibrillation, as well as her mechanical aortic valve and she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor.
Her incision is clean, dry and intact with staples in place.

She also received 5 mg of Coumadin on [**9-22**].
She is scheduled to receive 2 mg of Coumadin today, [**9-23**], as she is therapeutic with an INR today of 2.4.
The patient had received some captopril postoperatively, but there was a question of a possible history of renal artery stenosis which is not possible to ascertain definitively at this time.
It was felt best not to continue the captopril since her blood pressure had been fairly well controlled on the Lopressor.
Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement 2.
She is also to follow up with primary care physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in three to four weeks or upon discharge from rehabilitation facility.
