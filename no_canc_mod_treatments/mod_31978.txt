He was started on Zosyn and insulin gtt.
Past Medical History: DM2 CAD, s/p MI 2 yr ago with RCA stent   Social History: Lives with girlfriend of 25 years.
ETT in place.
Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic prssure of 100/60 with 1:1 iabp support and dopamine as the patient entered the lab in cardiogenic shock.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal rca with a 3x18mm vision stent and of the mid rca with a 3x30mm driver stent which were post dilated to 3.0mm.
Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal lad with a 2.25x18mm mini vision stent.
His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and a dopamine drip; and respiratory failure of unknown etiology for which the patient was intubated on transfer.
He was successfully weaned off of the IABP and dopamine drip, and extubated on [**2161-1-17**].
Over the next 2 days he developed significant pulmonary edema requiring CPAP, lasix drip, and pressor support with dobutamine and milrinone.
The patient was treated with a high-dose statin, aspirin, plavix, and a heparin gtt.
His heparin gtt was discontinued on [**1-20**] as he was guaiac positive and on multiple blood thinners.
We were holding captopril and beta blocker for low BP .
Cardiogenic shock: His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, requiring IABP and dopamine gtt for pressure support.
He was weaned off of pressors and IABP on [**1-17**], but developed new pulmonary edema requiring high flow mask with FiO2 of 1.00 on [**2155-1-20**].
We treated him with a lasix drip and CPAP, and attempted to improve forward flow with dobutamine and milrinone.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation with intermittent RVR, which initially responded well to an amiodarone load.
He was transitioned to a po regimen of amiodarone 400mg po qday and monitored on telemetry.
DM: Managed with insulin gtt .
Was being treated for presumed PNA at OSH, though CXR did not clearly show an infiltrate here, though difficult to visualize in setting of pulmonary edema.
His PA catheter was pulled and the tip cultured.
We continued with vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage as his clinical status was tenuous.
Respiratory failure: S/p extubation on [**1-18**], since then with a respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia on ABG, which as responded to high flow oxygen mask initially, and then required CPAP.
Thrombocytopenia: Improved with removal of IABP, likely caused by shearing effect.
