Admission Date:  [**2100-12-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-6-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man with known three vessel coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% who had a planned coronary artery bypass grafting scheduled for the morning of admission when he was noted to be acutely short of breath while undressing in the Preoperative Holding Area.
He received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix, Captopril, Lopressor and was started on Nitroglycerin drip.
Over that day he was weaned off of his Nitroglycerin drip and was seen to have improvement in his symptoms.
He had noted one month history of increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and had been admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) 1096**] with similar symptoms.
An echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesis and a catheterization reportedly showed three vessel disease for which he was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]  on [**2100-12-2**].
He was started on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and heparin and received Levaquin for a urinary tract infection plus a possible pneumonia.
Due to his infection, his coronary artery bypass graft was subsequently deferred at that time and since he had a history of stable angina he was discharged to home at that time to return for elective surgery.
He does drink occasional alcohol and does not use intravenous drugs.
MEDICATIONS:  His medications at home include Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lopressor 15 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o.
His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 119 beats/minute with T wave inversions in V5 and V6 which were old and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V1.
On [**12-31**], he was thought to be stable and he was brought to the Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting times four with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal sequential to the ramus and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
This surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 123 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 91 minutes.
The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable but critical condition on Levophed, Milrinone and Propofol drips.
He also was started on an insulin drip for blood sugars greater than 120.
By postoperative day #1, his Milrinone was weaned off and he was started on Amiodarone drip for brief runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
By postoperative day #2, he continued on his Amiodarone drip to help prevent further ectopy and required Levophed for blood pressure support.
He had his chest tubes discontinued without incident on postoperative day #3 and was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on this date.
On postoperative day #3 he was transferred from the Unit to the Surgical Floor and was started on cardiac rehabilitation physical therapy.
He continued with diuresis and repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day #5 showed slight improvement in this effusion and it was felt that the patient was ready to be discharged to home with the [**Hospital6 1587**] services.
