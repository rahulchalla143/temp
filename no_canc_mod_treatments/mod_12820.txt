KUB [**2106-10-29**]: FINDINGS: The tip and the side port of nasogastric tube are below the gastroesophageal junction within the fundus of the stomach.
Because of her abdominal pain and question of pneumatosis of the ileum she had been started on empiric therapy with ciprofloxacin/metronidazole that had been broadened to tigecycline/metronidazole by her time of presentation here.
At presentation here she was seen by surgery who remained with relatively low concern for an acute surgical abdomen but did think she had a significant enteritis and thus tigecylcine was continued.
Unfortunately, due to a large amount of retained barium from her outside hospital scan, which proved refractory to attempts to clear it with mineral oil, aggressive bowel regimen including docusate, senna, and lactulose, and eventually a GoLytely prep she was unable to be reimaged with CT prior to discharge.
As she had drastically improved regarding her abdominal pain and had no clinical sigsn of periotonitis or fever even after antibiotics were stopped (on [**11-4**]) she was discharged to continue her work-up as an outpatient.
Likely the patient should have a full inflammatory bowel disease work up including colonoscopy and upper endoscopy after she has had time to clear her barium.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued on [**10-28**] and pantoprazole was changed to famotidine.
During her MICU course the patient frequently requested narcotic pain medications asking for several medications by name.
Security was called as she had medications in her purse.
Subsequently, her pain medications were kept at a minimum; with her only receiving approximately 1-2 mg of PO hydromorphone Q6hrs.
Hepatitis serologies were all negative and other labs were unimpressive for an autoimmune vasculitis.
Dermatology was consulted who thought the rash was due to dihydrotic eczema and started a hydrating ointment along with clobetasol cream.
This led to resolution of the vesicularl lesions though she did continue to have dry and cracking skin on her extremities.
PSYCH: The patient presented on an impressive list of psychotropic medications with multiple anti-depressants and mood stabilizers.
Clonidine was restarted due to her anxiety and hypertension and then trazodone was restarted for sleep.
After confirming her outside doses citalopram and buproprion were also restarted though her quetiapine was held on the advice of psychiatry who were unconvinced the patient had bipolar disorder and thought it best to minimize medications in the acute setting.
The patient received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She received pantoprazole then famotidine for DVT prophylaxis while NPO.
