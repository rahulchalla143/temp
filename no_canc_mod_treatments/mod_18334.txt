This prompted assessment with LSPINE MRI on [**2192-10-24**] for which he received Ativan for sedation.
ICU Course ([**Date range (1) 20343**]): # Acute on Chronic Back Pain: Pain service recommended medical management and no interventional strategies.
Pain was managed with gabapentin, duloxetine, and PO dilaudid.
# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: Bipap was initiated.
Suspicion that ativan given for MRI sedation combined with narcotic analgesia and underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea contributed.
However, this was quickly reversed and pt maintained on an ISS with standing humalog 75/25 40units at lunch and dinner for the rest of ICU stage.
Sleep Medicine was consulted, and they suggested that while in house, the patient can stay on CPAP autoset ([**12-5**]), or BiPAP 10/5.
Cr was monitored as ACE-I was increased and IV lasix was given with mild increase in Cr.
# Hypertension: On home lisinopril 5 mg po daily, started amlodipine.
Pt was diuresed with IV lasix to good response while in the ICU.
Diuresing massively with small doses of lasix, he developed worsening renal failure (creatinine 2), so lasix discontinued and the renal function then stabilized.
