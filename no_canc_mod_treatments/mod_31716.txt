She received adenosine 6 mg then 12 mg with little effect.
In [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] she was started on dilt drip and digoxin 0.5mg without effect.
She also uncerwent head CT and C-spine CT for her fall which were negative except for old C2 fracture and cervical stenosis/DJD.
There was also concern for PE so she received one dose of lovenox and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her lactate was normal and her first set of troponins was normal.
She was given 6mg IV adenosine which slowed the vent rate and demonstrated flutter waves.
She received 1L NS bolus and digoxin 0.25.
The most recent time she was treated with levo/flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA.

[**2193-3-29**] TEE ECHO Findings Patient was intubated in the ICU and sedated with a versed and fentanyl drip.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical spray.
Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 4.6 cm above the level of the carina.
Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal tip not well seen.
CXR [**3-28**] New right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery (best seen on the digitally augmented view).
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Right PIC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC.
[**4-5**] CT TORSO CT CHEST: 64-row MDCT was performed from the thoracic inlet to the base of the lung following administration of 150 mL of intravenous contrast.
The endotracheal tube is in good position above the carina.
Tip of the NG tube is in the distal stomach.
CT PELVIS: 64-row MDCT was performed from the iliac crest to the symphysis pubis following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter.
[**2193-4-13**] CXR POST-PICC PLACEMENT FINDINGS: The PICC line has been re-positioned and the tip is now in the mid SVC.
CXR [**2193-4-23**]: IMPRESSION; In order to differentiate recent widening of left upper mediastinum due to engorged mediastinal vessels which appears reasonable as reflected by interval worsening mild pulmonary edema vs acute aortic pathology, erect view is recommended for further evaluation.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Cannot exclude a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.

She was cardioverted and anticoagulated following the procedure for the prescribed amount of time.
Patient had a prolonged ventilator course with dense delirium.
She received a trach and was weaned to trach collar.
She was taken off of sedation and had gradual but steady improvement in delirium to the point of being cooperative in her care and not agitated.
She was started on pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/Levofloxacin).
Her blood cultures grew two bottles of coagulase negative staphylococcus though her sputum cultures did not grow any pathogenic organisms.
Her body habitus and high PEEP requirement made hemodynamic monitoring difficult and she persistently required pressors so a swan ganz catheter was placed for further hemodynamic monitoring.
Her atrial flutter was believed to be decreasing her cardiac output so she was cardioverted after TEE did not show and thrombus or vegetations.
After cardioversion, fluid resucitation, and antibiotics she was able to be weaned off pressors.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics on [**4-4**].
She was treated with a course of vancomycin, levofloxacin and zosyn for a total of 10 days.
Eventually her vent settings were weaned and she successfully underwent a tracheostomy on [**2193-4-17**].
She was weaned from the vent after tracheostomy and was tolerating trach collar at time of discharge.
She was discharged on fluticasone and ipratropium and albuterol inhaled.
Salmetrol was held for potential QT-prolonging interaction with seroquel, which she is on for delirium.
She was being diuresed with good effect on 60mg PO BID with potassium repletion on discharge.
She was discharged on the above lasix dosing and potassium repletion to be followed and titrated to effect on discharge.
Her rhythm was more apparent after she was given adenosisne which demonstrated clear flutter waves.
She was started on digoxin for rate control though her rate persisted in the low 100s.
A TEE was performed which did not show any clot and she was started on heparin and succesfully cardioverted.
She was then started on warfarin and amiodarone.
Heparin was stopped when her INR was therapeutic.
She was planned to receive one month of anticoagulation after her cardioversion.
She failed digoxin and was continued on amiodarone, however this was discontinued out of concern for continued drug fever.
Patient remained rate controlled on low dose metoprolol which was discontinued after patient remained in sinus rhythm for greater than 2 weeks after cardioversion.
Warfarin was continued for anticoagulation and titrated for therapeutic INR for the prescibed duration post-cardioversion.
She was already started on vancomycin for her PNA as above.
The PICC line that was placed on the day after admission was removed.
Later her central line and arterial line were removed and cultures of the catheter tips were negative.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics on [**4-4**] and did not have any subsequent positive blood cultures.
UTI: Patient had a positive UA on [**4-15**] and was started on ceftriaxone.
PICC line was placed on day of admission and was later removed and culture negative, RIJ (cordis) placed later while on vanc and was susbequently pulled with negative culture tip as well.
UA then showed moderate leukocytes, and patient was started on ceftriaxone.
Spine surgery evaluated the film and did not recommend further workup.
After treatment with albuterol and ipratropium at the OSH she was noted to have an enlarged L pupil so a repeat head CT was performed which again did not show any acute changes.
Psychiatry was consulted in the setting of acute agitation and inability to wean from vent and patient was trialed on seroquel and haldol alternating.
Seroquel was eventually used primarily with haldol prn, but patient continued to become delirious at night, requiring extra sedation.
Antipsychotics were weaned as tolerated and benzodiazepines were avoided.
On day of discharge, she was requiring seroquel QHS and with a prn daytime seroquel dose that she was not requiring.
In the settin of her acute respiratory illness, her home medications were held and she was switched to standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
She was discharged on fluticasone MDI (she had been on salmeterol/fluticasone at home prior to admission, and only the inhaled glucocorticoid was continued on discharge).
She was also discharged on standing ipratropium and albuterol nebs.
DEPRESSION: Patient's home venlaxine was held and she was placed on duloxetine with increased dosing while in the hospital.
CHRONIC PAIN: Given patient's AMS, sedating medications were held and she was given tylenol for pain.
She had only a complaint of mild cramping abdominal pain associated with tube feeds during her stay.

OUTSTANDING CLINICAL ISSUES: -patient will require titration of psychiatric and pain medications stopped on this admission for altered mental status as mental status clears -on discharge, patient was positive approximately 7 liters estimated for fluid balance.
She had bumps in creatinine with more agressive diuresis, but was continued on lasix 60 PO BID for moderate diuresis with good effect, but requirement for potassium supplementation.
She should be monitored for creatinine, fluid status, and potassium at least daily on discharge -patient's chronic pulmonary medications may need adjustment as she is transitioned to a home regimen, keeping in mind the QT-prolongation associated with salmeterol and seroquel -patient requires close follow-up with pulmonology  Medications on Admission: venlafaxine 75 Daily tramadol 50 mg QID Oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 mg-325 mg [**12-10**] Tablet(s) Every 4-6 hrs, PRN Ambien 10 mg QHS cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Tab Oral omeprazole 20 mg daily fluticasone-salmeterol 500 mcg-50 [**Hospital1 **] tiotropium bromide 18 mcg mupirocin 2 % Ointment Topical gabapentin 800 mg Tab Oral QHS gabapentin 400 mg Tab Oral daily duloxetine 30 mg Cap, delayed release Oral 2 daily fluticasone 0.05 % Topical Cream Topical PRN Celebrex 200 mg Cap Oral daily   Discharge Medications: 1. ipratropium bromide 17 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation QID (4 times a day).
