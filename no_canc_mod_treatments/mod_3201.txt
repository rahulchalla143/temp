She had an episode of profound bleeding prior to this admission where she was treated with methotrexate 25mg x2 without a leucovorin rescue.
Unfortunately a leucovorin rescue was initiated too late and she has had no effect, and clinically she suffers from thrush, candidal esophagitis, and mucositis.
She was afebrile, however, a CXR demonstrated new patchy RLL infiltrate and so antibiotic coverage was broadened from cipro/metronidazole to cefepime/vanc.
She also received lasix IV for presumed total body fluid overload, to which she urinated 300cc.
An urgent femoral line, and arterial line were placed, and the patient was intubated.
Patient was hyperventilated, started on mannitol with HOB elevation to 30 degrees to reduce CNS pressures.
