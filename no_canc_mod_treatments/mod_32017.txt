On the morning of admission, the patient had desaturations and required ventilation with an ambu bag.
The patient was then placed on assist control 450/12/O peep and FiO2 of 40%.
The patient was currently treated with Zyvox which was d/c'd and broadened to Zosyn/flagyl for concern of possible aspiration.

Note that it is impossible to rule out a spiculated lesion from this extensive scarring given the absence of prior study for comparison.
Followup in three months is recommended.
Persistently over-inflated tracheostomy tube cuff as well as termination of the left PICC in the right brachiocephalic vein.
Her tracheostomy tube was changed after bronchoscopy.
She was found to have a developing Pneumonia on transfer for which she will be treated with Doripenem & Vancomycin  until [**2201-2-9**].
Ventilator dependent respiratory failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname 116**] was transferred for evaluation of her persistent tracheostomy leak.
She was evaluated at bedside by interventional pulmonology (IP), underwent bronchoscopy via tracheostomy tube which showed copious purulent secretions which were aspirated.
The tracheostomy tube was changed and replaced at the bedside.
The leak persisted, but the patient tolerates CMV with tidal volume set at 600 (breathing ~ 350).
She was treated with morphine to resolve symptoms of air hunger.
A fentanyl patch 25mcg was applied daily to relieve pain/anxiety which also improved her respiratory status.
Our IP team has no further mechanical interventions to offer at this time.
Pneumonia:  Gram stain of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage was significant for Gram negative rods and Gram positive cocci.
She has been started on Doripenem and Vancomycin to be administered via placed PICC line for a 2 week course to end [**2201-2-9**].
As we achieved therapeutic success with antibiotics her tachcardia improved.
The patient was continued on all other medications on which she was transfered.
