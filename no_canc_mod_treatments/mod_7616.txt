He abides by his 1500cc daily fluid restriction despite his diarrhea, and continued to take his diuretic and [**Last Name (un) **].
He was treated broadly for antibiotics of possible bowel source with vancomycin/zosyn/levaquin.
He was placed on a NRB for apparent increased work of breathing- sats remained nearly 100%.
Prior to transfer, VS  126/66, hr 83, rr 23, sat 99% on bipap .

For precise characterization of the findings, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered as well as re-evaluation of the patient after diuresis.
Right PICC line is in place but its tip cannot be clearly seen.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname **] is a morbidly obese 48yoM initially presented with N/V/D and acute renal failure and was admitted to the MICU for labored breathing whose hospital course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and massive fluid diuresis and was found to have aortic valve endocarditis with worsening aortic regurgitation.
# ACTIVE ISSUES: 1) Respiratory Status: Patient was initially admitted with labored breathing requiring continuous use of BiPAP (settings IPAP 23, EPAP 18).
Additionally pt received several fluid boluses given concern for hypovolemic status.
Renal agreed with plan and pt was started IV diuresis.
PE was considered and was empirically started on heparin however after further evaluation, it was discontinued as patient improved with diuresis.
Pt was on lasix drip initially then changed to bolus lasix and ultimately to PO torsemide.
Pt uses BiPAP at night at with the following settings: IPAP 22 and EPAP 12.
TRANSITION ISSUES: - Continue torsemide 80mg with goal to be euvolemic to negative to 500cc.
- Will need electrolytes to monitor K and Creatinine twice a week - Will need to remain on 2L fluid restriction - Needs agressive physical therapy in order to improve respiratory status .
2) Aortic Valve Endocarditis with Worsening Aortic Regurgitation: Of note patient completed course of MSSA bacteremia with vancomycin on [**2157-9-29**].
Cardiac surgery was consulted who recommended finishing 6 week course of antibiotics as well as cardiac catheterization prior to evaluation for surgery.
PICC line was changed on [**10-15**].
Of note patient complained of muscle spasms with daptomycin infusion.
Lastly given worsening aortic valve endocarditis, aggressive afterload reduction was implemented with goal Systolic BP < 160.
Nodal agents were stopped and should be avoided.
Last day will be on [**2157-11-24**] - Will need weekly CK, CBC with diff, BUN, Creatinine to be faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] attn: ID nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] follow up - Has follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart failure clinic - who will arrange for follow up Echo - Has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with cardiac surgery - Monitor BP and titrate medication as tolerated to keep systolic BP < 160.
- Needs agressive physical therapy for strength prior to AVR - Patient will need dental evaluation prior to cardiac surgery .
Antibiotic was changed to cefazolin however after having a rash, pt was started on vancomycin.
Creatinine continued to raise despite removal of offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] which was thought to be [**1-26**] ongoing diuresis.
Renal agreed with diuresis given respiratory status and felt that creatinine would slowly improve with time.
TRANSITION ISSUES: - Aggressive Physical Therapy .
Pt initially presented with respiratory complaints (see above) requiring continuous BiPAP.
7) FEVERS/NAUSEA/DIARRHEA: Initially presenting symptoms however resolved with definitive etiology.
8) Muscle Spasms: Patinet complained of muscle spasms while receiving daptomycin infusion.
Seroquel and flexeril were both tried with limited response.
Pt will to cope with spasms as long as daptomycin infusion is during day time hours.

You were sent to the medical ICU, where you were given antibiotics and fluids.
You ultimately finished a course of antibiotics while on the general medicine floor.
A breathing tube was placed to help your breath.
You were started on a medication help remove fluid to help with your breathing.
You will have to remain on antibiotics until [**11-24**] in order to appropriately clear this infection.
We had the cardiologist and cardiac surgeons evaluate for this valve replacement and they will continue to follow you as outpatient.
Because of the long hospital stay, you became deconditioned and you will need intense physical therapy in order to get better.
