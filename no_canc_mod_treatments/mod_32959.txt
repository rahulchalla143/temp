No sphincterotomy was done, only brushings.
She was treated with antibiotics, aggressive IVF, and a dilaudid PCA, but developed an O2 requirement, mild ARF, and a significant leukocytosis, though she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment and surgical evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course: OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION None  CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION General Surgery MICU  PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES Severe, Necrotizing Post-ERCP Pancreatitis ARDS Acute Renal Failure Pancreatic pseudocyst formation (likely) Delerium in the setting of severe illness  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE ***Please note that the patient was under the care of the MICU team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with consultation from general surgery from [**2179-3-10**] - [**3-22**].
I am summarizing the entirety of her hospital course but she was directly under my care only from [**3-22**] - [**3-30**]***  [**3-10**] The hepato-biliary team was consulted by MICU team for help with management of severe necrotizing pancreatitis; the patient had been admitted from an OSH tfollowing ERCP with development of severe abdominal pain and shock.
The patient was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem), an NGT was placed, as well as CVL and A line.
She was also intubated in the setting of respiratory distress in the setting of fluid resuscitation and her underlying severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
[**3-12**]- [**3-15**]  The patient was given PO contrast for CT scan but may have aspirated  after PO contrast, though no changes in her vent settings were noticed.
Diuresis was initiated as her blood pressure stabilized and her fluid requirements decreased.
Her antibiotics were discontinued given the lack of evidence for infected necrotizing pancreatitis.
Indeed, she did remain with a fever and leukocytosis to a height of 39, but this was attributed to pancreatic necrosis as her hemodynamics remained stable.
[**3-16**] The patient was weaned off sedation but, remained with a very poor mental status - initially quite unresponsive even off sedation as time passed - but she eventually improved to become oriented, interative, though remained with a much flatter affect compared to her prior mental status.
[**3-17**] IR c/s for dophoff placement, diuresing still [**3-18**] dophoff placed, put back on fentanyl gtt for agitation, diuresed [**Date range (1) 20011**] The patient was extubated, transferred to floor, her NGT was discontinued, she was started on sips.
She had a PICC line placed and was started on TPN.
She was started back on her PO meds (had been on IV synthroid) [**3-23**] PT consult continued, advanced to clears - the patient was tolerating well.
She was started on nebulizers for persistent wheezing and underwent a CXR that revealed a small effusion on the right.
This is expected in the setting of her mental status, her poor volition, and her severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
[**3-29**] She was started on creon for the diarrhea.
Her nebulizers were changed to PRN.
She does remain with a significant leukocytosis, however, this is consistent with prior levels, and I do not suspect this to be consistent with  Medications on Admission: [**Last Name (un) 1724**]: ativan 0.5', Ca, cymbalta 30', FeSO4, prilosec 20', zocor 80', singulair 10', [**Last Name (LF) 82671**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 81', avapro 150', florinef 0.05', toprol 50'  Discharge Medications: 1.
