CXR:  There has been interval placement of a right PICC line, with the tip overlying the distal SVC.
A nasogastric tube is seen within the esophagus, with the distal tube oriented cephalad above the left hemidiaphragm, apparently within a hiatal hernia.
The patient was loaded with dilantin in the ED.
Eventually she was transitioned to PO HCTZ, [**Last Name (un) **], labetalol and hydralazine.
She had G-J tube placed on [**2172-1-3**] by interventional radiology.
Prior to discharge, she was tolerating tube feeds without difficulty.
She will need to have her gastric tube changed in 3 months.
The patient was given a banana bag on admission.
B12 was borderline low, and the patient was started on supplements.
Dilantin was continued and Ms. [**Known lastname 58814**] required reloading to keep dilantin level closer to therapeutic range.
She was continued on dilantin until PEG tube placement.
Dilantin was stopped prior to discharge.
She was started on Levaquin on [**12-24**] for UTI diagnosed at the outside hospital.
Flagyl was added on [**2171-12-29**] given rising WBC to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was maintained on aspiration precautions.
The patient completed a course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
However, given recent cerebral infarct, hemorrhage, G/J tube placement and recent infection.
B12 level was borderline low thus the patient was given B12 in the hospital.
Her medications were adjusted.
On [**1-2**] the patient had a hypertensive episode with SBP in 250's while she was in interventional radiology for PEG tube placement due to missed doses of po meds.
She was rehydrated gently with NS at 80cc/hr.
She was rate controlled on labetalol with HR in 60's.
The patient was started on Coumadin on [**2172-1-6**].
Her Coumadin level needs to be monitored and Coumadin dose adjusted.
The patient was started on standing Lasix prior to discharge and her electrolytes need to be carefully monitored.
This was noted by nursing staff during Foley catheter change.
Final chest CT results showed two 3 mm RUL nodules, paraesophageal lymph node, pulmonary effusions, and vertebral compression fracture.
The patient developed anasarca and total body volume overload likely secondary to retention due to poor nutritional status, diastolic dysfunction, and possible as an adverse reaction to medications causing water retention.
She was started on Lasix prior to discharge with the goal of negative 1 liter volume balance a day.
NGT was placed and TF started.
PEG tube was placed on [**1-3**] for nutrition because the patient's mental status and cooperation remained poor to allow for independent feeding.
She was tolerating tube feedings well.
