Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo male history of dHF and NASH Cirrhosis admitted for persistent abdominal distention and pain, hospital course complicated by intubation for unresponsive state secondary to hypoglycemia, now s/p paracentesis x2.
He takes insulin at home.
Most likely a result of poor PO intake with continued insulin therapy.
He was extubated and weaned off of the insulin gtt, and transferred out of the MICU after 2 days to the general medical floor, where his unresponsiveness was resolved as of MICU callout.
Paracentesis was suggested in the ED however the pt refused as he prefers IR guided, so CTX was given empirically, and he was given morphine 5mg IV for pain.
In the MICU, he was put on a lasix drip, with good urine output.
He was transferred to the general medical floor on lasix bolus (100mg IV TID), where IR guided paracentesis was performed on [**2148-1-26**] and on [**2148-1-31**].
He was continued on ceftriaxone during his hospitalization but since no infection was proven, was not discharged on any antibiotics.
