Per husband, she had been tolerating interferon until week 3 when she "hit a wall" and began experiencing increased fatigue, forgetfulness and difficulties with concentration and memory.
She has been taking Celexa prn x 4 weeks to help with medication-related depression/insomnia, last dose 10 mg night prior to admission.
Patient had been on a 10 day holiday off of interferon after induction phase, about to begin 11 month course of self-administration.
On morning of admission, she drove to gynecology office for appointment where she had "confusion" such as not remembering medications or the date.
EMS found her sitting in her car in the middle of intersection, severely confused, tachypneic, with FSG in 120s after receiving oral glucose.
She was intubated and sedated on fentanyl and versed in order to obtain MRI around noon.
Her tox screen was negative and urine tox positive for benzodiazepines after versed.
Troponin T negative.
She was quickly weaned off of sedation and extubated at 6:30 pm.
OG tube was removed.
She became more alert as effects of sedation wore off and responded to some questions but remained confused.

FINDINGS: The study is compared with the craniocervical CTA, performed roughly two hours earlier.
There is no pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal, r dural enhancement to suggest intracranial metastatic disease.
Given the distribution as well as the lack of contrast enhancement, this is unlikely to represent acute demyelination, such as that related to interferon therapy.

Prolactin on admission was elevated, consistent with a possible seizure as a source of her AMS.
In addition, magnesium salts can cause net loss of phosphate by binding to both ingested and secreted phosphate.
