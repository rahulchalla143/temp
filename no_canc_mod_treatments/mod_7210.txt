Admission Date:  [**2163-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-12-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nickel / Aspirin / Plavix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 61-yo woman with PMHx of PUD, diverticulitis, s/p CCY, CAD s/p CABG, DM2, PVD, intestinal vascular insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, presenting with weakness and abdominal pain.
She is currently being treated with Bactrim for a left middle toe infection.
She had been given Dilaudid just prior to transfer, so her pressures initially responded to fluids, but she then developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and she became hypotensive again.
She was given fluids and started on Neosynephrine and Diltiazem drips for stabilization after she did not respond to metoprolol or digoxin.
She was then transitioned to Amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation, and transiently required both Neosynephrine and Levophed pressors for hypotension.

She was C. diff negative x3 now, and had relatively small amount of stool output, and her white count is stable.
She did have a positive UA at the OSH as well as chronic hydronephrosis.
We discontinued Vancomycin and Flagyl, which had been covering C. diff.
We continued Zosyn for coverage of GI/GU organisms given earlier septic presentation; although we do not have clear evidence for what we are treating it is reasonable to think we have treated something given her clinical course.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - After amiodarone loading she eventually remained in sinus.
This was consistent with an evolving blockage and ERCP was performed and included stone removal.
A summary description of the procedure was as follows: "Biliary dilation was noted.
(Sphincterotomy, stone extraction.)"
Original elevation in AST > ALT, suggestive of alcohol as a possible cause of [**Name (NI) **] and pancreatitis; however this would not entirely explain resolution of [**Name (NI) **] with increase in pancreatitis.
A rectal tube continued to drain liquid stool.
They recommended that she will need ulcer excision and removal of distal phalanx when stable.
She will be discharged to [**Hospital3 2568**] on zosyn and vancomycin.
Her glucose control was evolving given times on and off NPO and likely her scales will need to be adjusted further.
Hypothyroidism - Pt maintained on PO levothyroxine as outpatient.
We continued IV levothyroxine maintenance.
Access - LIJ, A-line [**12-8**].
PPx - venodynes, no heparin because of GI bleeding though if course continues well, could revisit this;  no bowel regimen given diarrhea but if stool output continues to reduce in quantity could consider gentle restart.
