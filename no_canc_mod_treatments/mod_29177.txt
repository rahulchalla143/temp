Diaphragmatic hernia repair and G-tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 6358**] is an unfortunate 55-year-old woman with mild mental delay and obesity who also has kyphoscoliosis and pulmonary hypertension.
She was palliated with a silicone stent and aggressive daily bronchoscopy to re-aerate the left lung and improve her hypoxemia.
It was recommended that she undergo reduction and repair of this large paraesophageal hernia.
Large amount of retained secretions causing near complete occlusion of left mainstem bronchi stent with complete left lung collapse and corresponding leftward mediastinal shift.
Slightly decreased findings of anasarca and haziness of the upper abdomen mesentery.
After some discussion w/ interventional pulmonogy it was decided to place a silicone stent in the left main stem bronchus to improve aeration prior to surgical hernia repair.
After agressive pulmonary tiolet pt was taken to the OR [**2195-6-17**] for Esophagogastroscopy,Laparotomy with reduction of type 4 hiatal hernia, repair of hiatus, Toupet partial fundoplication,Tube gastrostomy, Toilet bronchoscopy.
Post op course was complicated by prolonged intubation for pulmonary toilet in the SICU.
She continued to require aggressive pulmonary toilet w/ serial flexible bronchoscopies for therapeutic aspiration of left lung.
Attempts were made to open the left lung with non-invasive ventilation, chest PT, and obtaining a Thera-Vest (the latter could not be obtained in the hospital, but is recommended as an outpatient) She progressed well for an operative standpoint.
The G-tube should NOT be used for feedings but should be flushed at least daily.
