He had been battling recurrent retroperitoneal and intrabdominal sepsis for almost eight months before his operation while his nutritional and physical status was being buffed.
As expected, he had along post-op course in the hospital that involved extensive w/u for vomitting with tube feeds, eventually leading to G-tube placement (and with which he can tolerate TF when vented), also an antibiotic course for the organsims groan out of his peritoneal fluid and a questionable aspiration pneumonia.
He also received zosyn there after which he broke out in a full bodyred reaction.
He also had not been venting his G-tube at home, so vomitted with his tube feeds, improved once his g-tube was opened.

Brief Hospital Course: ID wrote: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year old man with a history of significant abdominal infectious issues after complications of embolization of pancreaticoduodenal artery for GI bleed in 4/[**2200**].
Currently, he is readmitted with fevers, rigors and vomiting after a recent definitive surgery for treatment of his abdominal issues.
Worrisome for etiology of his current symptoms is a recurrent abdominal process, particularly in the setting of the peri-drain purulence.
Also of concern is potential for pneumonia--despite relatively negative symptoms--likely due to aspiration for tube feeds.
This is a rather likely etiology, particularly given the time frame he outlines; although his cognitive status is intact, a supine position with nocturnal tube feeds may have predisposed to aspiration.
If fever or infectious symptoms persist or worsen, or if a blood culture is positive, investigation for endocarditis (possibly from hematogenous seeding during recent procedures) is warranted with echocardiography.
This may be narrowed as more data is collected, particularly to cover aspiration pneumonitis, but given prior highly resistant organisms, antibiotics are appropriate coverage.
After being admitted to the ICU, he responded to IVF and antibiotics and was transferred to the floor the next day.
CV:Monitor blood pressures, bolus IVF for hypotension.
Continue with G-tube clamping trials during the day to help train his stomach.
