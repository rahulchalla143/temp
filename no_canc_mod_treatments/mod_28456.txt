Per the patient, both her PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] warned her that she would have a stroke sometime in the next few months if she did not have this procedure performed thus she presented for elective carotid stenting.
Past Medical History: # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # DM - on insulin # CAD - w/ 3VD (LMCA 205 stenosis, LAD occluded after D1, LCx patent, OM1 70-80% stenosis) - s/p DES to mid LAD and proximal OM lesions [**2196-1-11**] - originally attempted POBA of LAD in [**12-6**] # PAD - laser atherectomy and balloon angioplasty of L SFA [**2197-7-26**] - stenting of proximal and mid/distal L SFA lesions [**2196-10-7**] - stent of R SFA lesion [**2196-9-9**] - PTA of L SFA [**2196-8-24**] - *unsuccessful* PTA of L SFA (was totally occluded) - PTA of R SFA [**2196-2-19**] # GERD # Colon cancer s/p right hemicolectomy # Bilateral carotid stenosis # s/p CCY # Left eye hemmorhage in [**5-7**], now resolved   Social History: Widowed.
She had another vagal with balloon inflation in the carotid treated successfully with fluid, atropine and dopamine.
Successful stenting of right internal carotid artery with XACT 8-6mmx40mm stent using Spider wire distal protection.
Plan for elective left carotid stenting next week.
Successful stenting of right internal carotid artery.
However, a solid lesion cannot be excluded and ultrasound correlation is recommended.
Patient tolerated procedure well, with transient vagal episode requiring atropine and dopamine.
Treated with dopamine drip to keep MAP>60.
Patient then went for L carotid stenting s/p two stents on [**12-15**] with transient hypotension requiring dopamine drip.
Was weaned off the dopamine with no complications.
She will be continued on ASA, Plavix for life on discharge.
Also will continue on outpatient Lipitor regimen.
She will continue on her outpatient Lasix and Atenolol regimen.
3) RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia at baseline, though additional decreased heart rate in the setting of her R carotid stent placement.
She received one dose of atropine on the floor for bradycardia, and an additional dose after her L carotid stenting.
As per EP, no need for pacemaker as bradycardia is likely reflex secondary to angiography and stenting of carotid artery.
Atenolol was held during admission for sinus bradycardia, but it can be restarted as an outpatient.
# Diabetes: The patient will continue her diabetic regimen including Novolin 70/30, Actos and Metformin.
She should restart the Metformin one day after discharge given the nephrotoxic dye load from her cardiac catheterizations.
She did receive peripheral dopamine on the left, however, no evidence of skin discoloration or signs of necrosis or other injury.
Of note, she states that she has had chronic ulnar-distribution paresthesias on the right for many months.
# Vulvovaginal candidiasis: Pt complained of vaginal itching on her final day of admission.
