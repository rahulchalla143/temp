Apparently, two days prior to his surgery he reported intermittent chest pain to his wife that he minimized.
The procedure was complicated by a perforation and dissection of his RCA.
A 9x20 balloon was deployed at the perforation and he was started on Neo and Dopamine for hypotension.
His pressures dropped and a balloon pump was placed with Neo and Dopamine running.
Two coated stents were placed at RCA along with one BMS distally.

Patient was monitored by a nurse throughout the procedure Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 50%  >= 55%  Findings Patient was intubated, sedated (on Midazolam and Fentanyl drips), and paralyzed (with Cisatracurium Besylate) for the procedure.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information section).
A catheter was noted at the RV outflow tract.
IMPRESSION: Low-normal LVEF with inferior hypokinesis.

He was initially on dopamine and neosynephrine to maintain MAPs in 50s but subsequently had increased pressor requirement, maxed out on dobutamine, dopamine, neosynephrine and levophed.
Initial CVP was high around 20 so he did not receive fluids but subsequently received 3L NS boluses due to low CVPs around [**1-10**].
He developed afib and cardioversion was attempted x 3 with 200J, 300J, then 350 J.
Transferred to the CVICU in critical condition on levophed, epinephrine, and propofol drips.
Over the course of the week, drips were titrated while RV and LV function were monitored closely.
CVVH was instituted for volume management with acute renal failure.
Necrotic areas noted on left hand and left foot.Continued to require epinephrine and levophed support.
Vasopressin required for escalating pressor support.
His marked acidosis continued with hypotension despite maximal pressor support.
Family decided to withdraw support and comfort measures only were instituted.
