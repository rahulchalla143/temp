The patient's current symptoms consist of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and weakness.
In the Emergency Department he was noted to have a blood glucose of 659 and he reported not taking insulin over the last two days.
He was given a fluid challenge, which failed to increase blood pressure or urine output so he was started on Dopamine with maintenance systolic blood pressure in the 100s.
He was empirically given Levaquin and Flagyl for an unknown infectious etiology.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin 70/30 typically 40 to 50 units split between a.m. and p.m. (usually 30 in the a.m. and 20 in the p.m.).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit directly from the Emergency Department and was continued on Dopamine for blood pressure support.
DIC panel was performed, which showed elevated coags, FDP and D-dimer, but elevated fibrinogen and unremarkable hemolysis studies.
A right sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed on [**2154-9-12**] and during placement large amounts of purulent material was obtained while accessing the renal pelvis.
Gram positive coxae were noted by gram stain and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
Despite receiving 8 amps of bicarb and fluid resuscitation his blood pressure fell and he was transferred back to the unit on hospital day number five.
The patient's second Intensive Care Unit course was fairly unremarkable with urine output increasing to 50 to 100 cc an hour with aggressive fluid repletion.
Blood pressures stabilized and bicarb normalized with additional repletion.
