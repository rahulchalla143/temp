IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 76420**]          ([**2103-9-29**]).
On presentation, the patients respiratory distress was thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation tissue within the patient's y- stent.
Her antibiotics were broadened to Zosyn as patient was no improving.
She completed a 14 day course of Zosyn, but due to rising WBC, low grade fevers, and increaseing secretions, she was started on Colistin on [**2103-10-3**].
Lasix gtt was used intermittently to treat assist in her diuresis.
Patient eventually began auto-diuresing and her vent settings were able to be weaned.
Due to borderline blood pressures, she was started on a lasix drip and antihypertensives were held.
When her renal function recovered, lasix drip was stopped and and antihypertensives were slowly resumed.
Lasix PRN and HCTZ was resumed on day of discharge to maintain even fluid status.
As above, patient was diuresed with lasix drip until renal function improved and then put on PRN lasix and resumed home HCTZ.
She was continued on celexa and zyprexa.
She received prn oxycodone for pain.
Her antihypertensive regimen was uptitrated with minimal effect.
Once her renal function began improving and the patient was put on regular olanzapine dosing (to treat delirium), her BP improved.
Her antihypertensives were held in setting of lasix drip, however these were resumed when lasix drip was discontinued.
She continued on albuterol and atrovent nebs.
Anticoagulation held after admission for GIB on prior admission.
Patient continued on glargine and regular insulin sliding sclae.
