Port was placed at [**Hospital3 68**] on [**12-16**] for ARF from dehydration from nausea and vomiting.
He was started on daptomycin.
His anti-hypertensive regimen was increased.
Here, he was found to have MRSA in his urine which was treated with linezolid (last dose planned for [**12-15**]).
He remained on cyclosporine for his renal transplant, along with azathioprine and prednisone.
Multiple etiologies were entertained, including cervical cord compression (MRI showed C5-6 disc herniation and moderate spinal stenosis), hypovolemia, medication effects (he was on labetalol and prazosin at the time), and neuropathy.
He was educated in various dietary changes and advised to keep upright posture as much as possible.
For his seizure disorder, he was transitioned from dilantin to keppra.
For his hypertension, his medications were changed to amlodipine and metoprolol, with higher thresholds given his newly diagnosed orthostatic hypotension.
Kidney transplant times four.
Kidney transplant times four in [**2145-1-16**] and [**Month (only) 956**] of [**2144**] with last transplant in [**2147-7-17**].
Open cholecystectomy in [**2145-3-17**].
Right ankle surgery in [**2148-3-16**].
Neck - no cervical LAD CV - 3/6 SEM best at RUSB, radiating to b/t carotids Chest - port to R anterior chest wall, non-tender, no erythema or fluctuance.
graft in LLQ with tenderness with deep palpation.
Ext -  Bilaterally assymetric in LE/UE; RUE larger proximally due to 'infiltration'; RLE larger diameter proximally/distally with large scar down medial border c/w with saphenous vein anatomy; 1+ edema in RLE Neuro - A& O x 2.

Aortic valve gradient was not assessed in this study.
The lack of IV gadolinium limits the evaluation for infectious process.
If there is strong concern for an infectious process, consider reevaluation with gadolinium.
RUQ U/S [**2153-1-18**] No gallbladder, post-cholecystectomy [**2148**].
[**2153-1-13**] 5:51 pm CATHETER TIP-IV      Source: right IJ.
Of note, there is a focal multilobulated lucent lesion extending to the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle, with a thin sclerotic rim measuring approximately 2.0 x 3.2 cm.
Multifocal bone infarcts including probable subchondral bone infarcts noted.
male admitted for MRSA, Enterococcus, Candidal bacteremia, s/p renal transplants x4 for Alports, most recently [**2145**].
# ID - POLYMICROBIAL BACTEREMIA, LINE SOURCE, ?GI source: MRSA, Enterococcus, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from [**1-2**] blood cx and OSH blood cx, likely from R chest portacath that was removed soon after admission.
He was hemodynamically stable on heavy anti-hypertensives, afebrile.
He was placed on Daptomycin and Fluconazole IV, and on PO linezolid and PO fluconazole and PO voriconazole when he lost IV access for one day.
The right IJ line was pulled on [**1-14**] and a new right IJ dialysis line was placed on [**1-22**].
Fluconazole was continued for + Blood Cultures, daptomycin continued for MRSA as indicated for bacteremia, and Linezolid was started for possible abscess in lungs.
The reason Vanco was not started initially was because pt had a question of an allergy to it (thus needed coverage with aztreonam and linezolid as above).
However, since questionable allergy, his linezolid and daptomycin were stopped and vancomycin was started.
Aztreonam was stopped and ciprofloxacin was started after sensitivites returned.
He was empirically treated with flagyl for CDiff, but toxin testing was negative.
Pseudomonas grew from the urine and he was switched to aztreonam because of his penicillin allergy to cover the pseudomonas.
Briefly he was transitioned back from linezolid to vancomycin but he was switched back because of leukopenia that developed from the vancomycin.
His fluconazole and linezolid courses will be complete on [**2153-2-24**].
GI also recommended a colonoscopy.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, KNOWN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, ALPORTS, S/P TRANSPLANT : Most recent transplant in [**2145**].
Renal function was worsening and pt was initiated on dialysis on [**1-14**].
He was kept on cyclosporin and prednisone; his azathioprine was stopped.
He was kept on calcitriol and epogen with iron at dialysis.
IV ACCESS IV access was extremely difficult in this patient.
After his portacath was removed, it was attempted to keep him free from IV lines for 24 hours, and he had a peripheral line placed that was pulled out by the patient by accident after 12 hours.
His right leg graft was last accessed in fall [**2152**], and his left leg graft was thought to be nonfunctional.
After the patient's infections were under control, the temporary dialysis line was changed for a tunneled line.
They did not see an indication for emergent surgery and wanted him medically optimized before eventually performing surgery in the future.
It will also be necessary to keep the patient off of anticoagulation for 5 days after the procedure which will be difficult while treating his DVT.
At rehab his movement restriction will be placement of [**Location (un) **]-J collar.
Surgery will be planned after treatment and completion of his antibiotic courses.
He was maintained on a heparin drip until the tunneled dialysis line was placed.
At that time, he was without IV access and heparin could not be continued.
He was bridged with lovenox until his coumadin levels were therapeutic.
The duration of his anticoagulation is at least six months, if not longer given that he has had a prior clot in the past.
His anticoagulation around time of spine surgery will have to be discussed with surgeons.
He was initially kept on clonidine, labetalol, and amlodipine until his SBP dropped into 90's.
His BPs started to increase and his BP meds were added back on as needed.
His HCT was monitored and he was given iron and epogen at dialysis  # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient was initially transfered to the unit for respiratory failure.
Thought to be due to combination of reglan and abilify.
Heavy sedating medications were avoided in this patient.
Care should be taken in future when ever sedating medications are given to this patient.
# COPD: He was kept on advair and albuterol during admission.
