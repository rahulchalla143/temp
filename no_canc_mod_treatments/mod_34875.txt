No structural heart disease (had TTE w/ EF of >55%, no LV dysfunction or aortic stenosis, no septal defects or vegetations), no ischemia (EKG w/o any evidence of this, all cardiac enzymes were negative), ingestions of medications, (pts serum Benzo positive).
His Dilantin was changed to Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **].
TIA and seizure were considered less likely on the differential, so Carotid doppler U/S and EEG were deferred and can be done on an outpatient basis.
Due to continued bradycardia w/ symptomaticity (hypotension), and a rpt Head CT on 7.25 showing increased midline shift, he was taken to the OR on 7.25 for SDH evacuation and given a pacer.
Pts bradycardia subsequently improved and temporary pacer was removed [**2170-8-13**].
Dilantin level was therapeutic at time of admission and albumin was WNL, but this medication can still cause sinus bradycardia even when not at toxic levels.
Pacer pads were kept in place, and atropine and dopamine were kept at bedside, but were never required.
His opiod medications were also held.
Following this, he was found to be bradycardic and symptomatic (hypotensive) requiring a dopamine gtt to increase heart rate.
At this point EP decided it was appropriate to to place a temporary pacing wire.
He was then re-transferred back to the MICU for monitoring, and after SDH evacuation, his HR improved and his temporary pacing wire was removed.
Dilantin was changed to Keppra (see above), and patient was given Tylenol and Codeine (low dose and as needed to prevent increased bradycardia) for chronic headache likely related to SDH.
He also received an evacuation of the SDH (see above "Seizure/Sinus Bradycardia") on [**8-10**] .
# Leukocytosis: Predominant lymphocytosis (WBC 13) more c/w viral etiology/stress response.
No antibiotics were given.
Dopamine and atropine were kept at his beside, but his BPs remained stable w/ MAPS > 60 while in the ICU and did not require pressors.
On the floor, his blood pressure was stable and he did not require further anti-hypertensive medication.
#[**Name (NI) **] Pt required occasional percocet to control HA on the medicine floor.
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no ASA or heparin SC given recent SDH).
#Access- 2 PIVs .
# Dispo: Home with at home safety evaluation   Medications on Admission: Dilantin 100mg TID x10 days (started [**8-3**]) Klonopin 1mg prn Ativan 2mg prn .
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
You had a pacer placed on [**8-10**] to stabilize your Heart Rate and this was removed on [**2170-8-13**] .
Your head bleed is stable on imaging, but was causing some increased brain swelling and continued low heart rate, so you underwent an drainage of the bleed.
The Dilantin was changed over to another medication called Keppra which does not have the same heart slowing effects.
