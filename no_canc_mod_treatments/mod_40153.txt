Diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities throughout the right lung and left lower lobe with a small to moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion also seen on [**2139-6-29**] consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Stable massive gastric distention with G-tube in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 28M with a very-complicated history of small bowel pathology s/p multiple ex-laps and rejected bowel transplantations, now TPN dependent, s/p VF arrest secondary to electrolyte abnormalities vs. IV contrast and ICD placement ([**Hospital1 112**] [**2138**]) c/b MRSA pocket infection and septecemia, now s/p device removal ([**2139-6-11**]) and s/p partial lead extraction on this admission.
This is very concerning especially given that the patient recently underwent instrumentation on infected hardware 24 hours ago.
Afebrile prior to procedure and then spiked and became tachy approx 18 hours after.
In the ICU, patient was on meropenem, micafungin, and dapto was changed to linezolid for both hardware infection and pulmonary coverage.
Patient received IVF while in ICU for hypotension/tachycardia, but never needed pressors.
Meropenem was discontinued after 48-72 hours of afebrile.
Patient was intubated on arrival to MICU and remained intubated for 2 days.
Patient was treated with linezolid and meropenem to cover for aspiration pneumonia.
He was initially treated with IV daptomycin for two weeks, but remained septic.
He subsequently underwent pocket removal in [**2139-6-11**] and IV daptomycin x 6 weeks (ending [**7-27**]).
He is now s/p partial lead extraction (remove communication between infected pocket and wires) on [**2139-6-26**].
Complete device removal will be an extremely high risk procedure as there is an epicardial pacer pad which will require OR and thoractomy.
CT surgery was consulted when patient was transferred to ICU.
Patient continued to spike fevers despite treatment of HAP, raising concern that pacer lead infection was causing fevers.
He was instructed to continue using LifeVest while the ICD was removed, although there has been prior issues of noncompliance.
Heme/onc was consulted and felt this was multifactorial due to active infection, malabsorption, TPN associated cirrhosis, and anemia of chronic disease.
Less likely due to meropenum and linezolid given history of pancytopenia.
# DVT - Patient will be continued on lovenox as an outpatient, though he reported noncompliance.
# Pain control - patient had significant complaints of pain that were treated with IV dilaudid.
He tolerated a swift dose taper to 0.25 mg q3 by the time of discharge.
Pt was followed by nutrition team, and received TPN and supplement IVF.
