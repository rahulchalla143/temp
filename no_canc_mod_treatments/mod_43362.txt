osteomyelitis.
RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: The patient is status post resection of the right big toe at the level of the mid proximal phalanx.
Patient is status post resection of the distal first phalanx.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with oral contrast.
There are bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.
INDICATIONS: 50-year-old man with cough and fever, status post PICC line placement.
IV therapy provided information that the tip of the catheter lies approximately 3 cm beyond the wire, and so it was suggested to pull back by 2 cm for appropriate positioning in the SVC.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging with and without IV contrast.

Patient is status post resection of the first toe at the level of the mid proximal phalanx.
No specific radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis, although MR would be more sensitive for detection of osteomyelitis.
