The aneurysm was found in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2097**] during workup for her long-standing chest pain/epigastric pain.
Given the persistence of her epigastric discomfort, size of her thoracic aortic aneurysm measured at 5.2cm and her relatively increased risk given her smaller stature and her gender, it was decided to go forward with elective endovascular repair.
There is again seen consolidation at the lung bases concerning for aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
There is also a right IJ line with distal tip in the mid SVC, unchanged.
FINDINGS: Right internal jugular line has been removed.
