Borderline voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave changes may be related to left ventricular hypertrophy/rate or rhythm.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 83 year-old male with hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus (diet-controlled), and renal carcinoma s/p right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**] presenting with new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cough/dyspnea.
The patient was started on azithromycin/ ceftriaxone/ and vancomycin (given + blood culture on day of admission) for broad coverage.
The patient was also placed on respiratory precautions given concern for TB.
On [**2-5**], the patient was found to have acute worsening of respiratory status with tachypnea, significant wheezing, and desaturations to 80%'s despite being on a non-rebreather.
Remainder of hospital course is by problem, as follows:  # Cough/ SOB: As above, the patient was initially started on antibiotics to cover for a possible bronchitis/ pneumonia.
He completed a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for this.
He completed a course of prednisone x 3 days and was started on Advair with prn levalbuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential COPD component.
There were no interventions done during catheterization, and there were no current indications for CABG.
The patient was continued on medical management with ASA, ACE-I, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.
# Rhythm: The patient presented with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation on this admission.
The patient was started on several agents for HR control, which were uptitrated to the following regimen with HR in mostly 60s-70s: metoprolol XL 300 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120 mg daily (added for rate control despite the severe LV systolic heart failure), and digoxin (therapeutic at 0.9 on discharge).
He was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; however, upon discharge decision was made not to pursue Coumadin therapy as patient was felt to be a poor candidate due to history of medication noncompliance.
He was continued on beta-blocker, ACE-I, and CCB for BP and HR control.
# Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertension to 160s/90s, which improved with diuresis, ACE-I, and uptitration of metoprolol and diltiazem.
# Decompensated Mitral Valve Disease: [**2-5**] echo revealed 4+ mitral regurgitation of unclear etiology.
Per the patient, injection was secondary to not using prednisiolone acetate 1% eye drops.
Ophtalmology was consulted, and they recommended to use prednisilone acetate 1% in R eye QD to prevent rejection of corneal implant.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has a history of RCC s/p right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**].
He was continued on an ISS while inhouse, but demonstrated good glycemic control on a diabetic diet.
# BPH: The patient was continued on outpatient finasteride.
Doxazosin was held due to low BP.
