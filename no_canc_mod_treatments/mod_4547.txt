She did not require chest compressions.
She was intubated without sedation but was started on propofol shortly afterwards dur to agitation.
Also, she continued to be hypertensive w/ SBPs in the 200s post arrest on 80mcg of propofol with other notable lab values being K 5.3, INR 3.6, Lactate 5.0.
In the MICU, her hypertension w/ SPB 200s persisted so was started on nipride gtt which dropped SBP to 40-50s hence propofol and nipride gtt was stopped.
She was then placed on nimodipine and then switched to her home hypertensives: valsartan 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10 mg QD, metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and maintained at SBP goal of 140s.
In the MICU, she was given IV Mg 1g Q6H and transitioned to amiodarone and plavix for her afib.
Her course complicated by MSSA VAP with lots of respiratory distress for which she got nafcillin/vanc/cefepime, improved and was extubated and placed on Bipap for 2 days.
Respiratory distress improved with abx and was weaned from Bipap to breathing room air.

Was intubated without sedation but was started on propofol shortly afterwards due to agitation.
No focus was found on electrophysiology study and she did not arrest on the floor over the course of her hospitalization.
Her respiratory status improved, was extubated and placed on Bipap for 2 days, weaned off and sent to the general medical floor ([**2138-5-10**]).
She was initiated on cefepime and vancomycin for healthcare associated pneumonia, which was narrowed to nafcillin after her sputum grew MSSA.
Initially, she was intubated for respiratory support.
She was subsequently transitioned to non-invasive ventilation and later to high flow shovel mask and nasal cannula.
She completed an 8 day course of antibiotics for her pneumonia.
#.ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Her dofetilide was discontinued since it can precipitate ventricular fibrillation.
She was started on amiodarone (initially IV then changed to PO) and was maintained in sinus rhythm.
She received oral vitamin K. She was then restarted on coumadin and had an INR of 1.5 at discharge.
She was not bridged with heparin because her CHADS2 score is 2.
#.ALTERED MENTAL STATUS DUE TO TOXIC/METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: She became slightly sedated after benzodiazepime and narcotic administration, but this resolved after 24 hours without any intervention.
Per her outpatient pyschiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29696**], she has a history of visual hallucinations at night with confusion which is resolved with Olanzapine 2.5mg QHS.
Because she was bardycardic, there was initial concern for ruptured aneurysm/subarachnoid bleed,; however, head CT, head CTA, and MRI were all negative.
Patient  was initially maintained on a nicardipine drip, which was weaned off once SBPs reached 140-160.
She was then restarted on amlodipine and labetalol was started as well with adequate blood pressure control.
Her metoprolol was changed to Labetolol 200mg TID and then Labetolol 400mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge to keep the BP within goal of <140 SBP.

Your arrhythmia medication was changed.
You were continued on your coumadin although your level will need to be closely monitored.
You were also treated for a pneumonia and had to be intubated to help with your breathing.
You were treating with antibiotics (Naficillin) for 8 days to treat the pneumonia which helped your breathing.
Your blood pressure medications were changed and your blood pressure control improved.
We talked to your outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29696**], who confirmed a history of visual hallucinations in the past which is controlled with zyprexa just before bed so we resumed that medication.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED Dofetilide STOPPED Valsartan STOPPED Metoprolol STARTED Amoidarone STARTED Amlodipine STARTED Labetolol   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the following providers: .
