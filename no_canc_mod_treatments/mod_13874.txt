At 2230 on [**4-2**], however, she again began having small-volume hematemesis (less than [**1-22**] cup total) and therefore came to the ED here.
She continues to have abdominal discomfort, bloating, and distension.
Pt may have bled from either esophageal varices or portal gastropathy Mosaic and giraffe skin appearance in the fundus and proximal body compatible with portal gastropathy.
Post EGD course complicated by fever, thought due to left sided nosocomial pneumonia, now on imipenum.
She was kept on an octreotide gtt for 5 days and protonix and carafate.
She was started on levo/flagyl for SBP prophylaxis on [**4-3**]; ceftaz was added on [**4-6**] and she was changed to imipenem on [**4-7**] (14 d course) when she continued to spike through this broad coverage.
Additionally, a urine culture ([**4-5**]) had enterococcus and MRSA [**Last Name (un) 36**] to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she received vancomycin for a short course ([**Date range (1) 26124**]); subsequent UCX [**4-6**] neg; UCx [**4-14**] pending on discharge.

The patient's antibiotics were changed as above (see ID).
She underwent another therapeutic thoracentesis (-1.0 liters) on [**4-9**].
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased after the second thoracentesis and diuresis for CHF, but she was still requiring 2L NC with ambulation; therefore she was discharged with home oxygen as needed while ambulatory.
She was continued on lasix and spironolactone, and her nadolol was continued apart from a brief period when it was held given her low blood pressures.
While admitted she received 2 units of FFP and 3 days of vitamin K 10mg sc q day.
