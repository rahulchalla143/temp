History of Present Illness: 87yo woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent ERCP with biliary stent placement aditted to the medicine servie [**5-9**] with UTI who now presents with acute onset left hemiparesis and left sided neglect.
Pt was brought for STAT head CT/CTA/CT perfusion revealing proximal R ICA occlusion just prior to bifurcation with prolonged MTT on perfusion images in R MCA territory.
Unfortunately given the location of the ICA thrombus the risk of distal embolization causing total MCA occlusion with mechanical and IA TPA clot disruption was high.
Per discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (stroke neurology), medical therapy was deemed most beneficial.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease s/p stent placement; MI in [**1-/2140**] S/p appendectomy S/p cataract surgery Transient isolated third nerve palsy- ([**2140**]) thought [**2-10**] diabetes, resolved fully by the time the pt was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] at [**Hospital1 18**] neurology.
Diabetes Lumbar spinal stenosis CAD- s/p stents, MI [**1-/2140**] Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia s/p ventral hernia repair s/p ERCP with biliary stent placement, new afib documented with this admission, coumadin held s/p procedure.
Large intraluminal filling defect, in the right distal common carotid, common carotid bifurcation, and proximal cervical internal carotid artery, as well as a tiny filling defect in the cavernous right internal carotid artery, related to thrombosis.
Patent mid and distal cervical, intracranial internal carotid, anterior and middle cerebral arteries.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of acute brain ischemia  Brief Hospital Course: NEURO 87yo woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent ERCP with biliary stent placement aditted to the medicine service [**5-9**] with UTI who developed acute onset left hemiparesis and left sided neglect.
Mechanism was probably cardioembolic as she has atrial fibrillation and was not on heparin or coumadin and INR was sub therapeutic.
She was not considered for IV tPA as she was out of three hour window.
Interventionlist Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] for potential IA intervention but she was not considered for IA intervention as right common carotid was completely occluded and there was significant concern that introduction of a catheter may cause dislodgement of the clot with distal embolization.
She had extinction to double sided stimulation, and a persistent neglect, motor impersistence and inattention.
* She was started on Heparin and transitioned to warfarin given the cardioembolic nature of the stroke (atrial fibrillation).
Heparin gtt was at 600 units per hour at the time of [**Name (NI) **] and PTT goal should be 50-70 until INR is therapeutic (2 to 3).
She should continue aspirin 81mg daily given CAD.
ABD She was able to eat thickened liquids and pureed solids, and was allowed to advance her diet.
