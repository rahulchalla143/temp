He then became hypotensive to 92/42, AT OSH, Urine culture, blood cultures drawn, X ray, and head CT performed and he received NS and tylenol.
On [**8-1**] a.m., he became acutely SOB, ABG c/w hypercarbic respiratory failure, at which time pt was intubated and started on levophed for blood pressure support.
He was extubated the evening of [**2145-8-1**] and his tunnelled dialysis cathter was removed [**8-2**] a.m.
Past Medical History: 1) Diabetes mellitus, c/b Diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy 2) End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis- new catheter on [**2145-7-13**] 3) Coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2133**] - [**7-7**] PMIBI: severe fixed inferior perfusion defect, partially reversible lateral defect EF 18% - [**7-7**] TTE: LA mod dil, RA mildly dil, inferior akinesis and severe anteroseptal and mid to distal inferolateral hypokinesis.

He required a brief period of intubation and blood pressure support, but was quickly weaned off of the ventilator.
Vancomycin and Gentamycin were started, with renal dosing.
The left subclavian hemodialysis catheter was removed, and prurulent drainage was visualized during removal.
A temporary right IJ was inserted for central venous access.
A temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in a left groin location.
Bilateral subclavian ultrasounds were performed, revealing no abscesses, but the right side was notable for a non-occlusive thrombus in the R subclavian.
For this reason, the decision was made to continue vancomycin treatment for 4 weeks, with trough goal between 15-20.
Gentamycin was stopped.
The patient was continued on his statin and Plavix, but due to his sepsis his beta-blocker was held until he was transferred back to the medical floor.
He was then started on low dose metoprolol, which can be titrated up as his BP increases.
These symptoms improved with treatment of the infection and the patient had returned to his baseline by the termination of the hospitalization.
5) Hypertension:  the patient's lisinopril and B-blockers were both held on admission secondary to hypotension.
The B-blocker can be titrated up after discharge, and his lisinopril can be added back as blood pressure tolerates.
Folate supplementation was also begun.
7) ESRD: Because the patient's permacath HD catheter in the L subclavian had to be discontinued due to the patient's septic state, a temporary L groin catheter was inserted for hemodialysis.
Hence, a new tunnelled right subclavian hemodialysis catheter was placed, with the long term goal of developing a fistula for continued HD.
Renal doses of his medications were given, particularly his antibiotics.
8) Type II DM: The patient was continued on his home dose of 6units of Lantus insulin qHS, as well as a regular insulin sliding scale.
The patient should be continued on this regimen as an outpatient in rehab.
A HIT antibody was drawn and heparin containing products were discontinued.
The HIT antibody came back negative, but because of the improvement off heparin products, it was decided to avoid heparin for the remainder of his stay.
