He was continued on lamotrigine at a slightly higher dose (175 mg/150 mg from 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]) concerning the possibility of increased seizure activity related to the hemorrhage.
This was done following the administration of steroids, H1 and H2 blockers as well as a bicarbonate preparation given his 1) chronic kidney disease with Cr 1.7-1.8, and 2) history of iodine contrast allergy.
This procedure was complicated a small groin hematoma that was not noticeable the next day.

His pain was well controlled with PO analgesics and he obtained good relief from his pain following one dose of IV toradol.
