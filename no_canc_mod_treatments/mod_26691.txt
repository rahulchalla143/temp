After several hours at OSH pt's MS improved so she sat up and tried to remove ET tube and thus was extubated and able to follow commands.
She was transferred here and admitted to the SICU overnight given acidosis and concern she would need liver transplant.
Other major issue has been acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis likely due to her time down for which she has received fluids with bicarbonate.

1) Acetaminophen overdose: The patient was started on N-acetylcysteine, and her LFTs initially remained stable.
The patient responded to NAC therapy and IVF and by the time of discharge her LFTs had been downtrending significantly.
2) Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury: The patient developed acute kidney injury with creatinine elevating to a peak of 2.5.
The patient was placed on IV fluids and by the time of discharge, her creatinine had improved to baseline at 0.7.
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that she was a danger to herself and a section 12 form was initiated.
The patient was started on ciprofloxacin for a 3 day course.
5) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 45 to 24.6 in the setting of large volume IV fluids.
Iron studies did not show an iron deficiency anemia, and a reticulocyte index was low; it was thought that the damage sustained to the kidneys may have temporarily decreased the amount of Erythropoietin produced, but that with further kidney recovery, the hematocrit would also improve.
6) Respiratory distress: The patient developed mild pulmonary edema and tachypnea during her hospitalization secondary to IV fluids for her acute kidney injury.
7) History of hepatitis C: Patient's viral load on this admission zero, therefore she had cleared her hep C.  8) Substance abuse: The patient came in on 75mg methadone daily for history of IVDU; this was decreased to 45mg in the setting of liver failure, but had been returned to her home dose by time of discharge.
9) Code: Full  Medications on Admission: methadone 75 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. methadone 10 mg Tablet Sig: 7.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
