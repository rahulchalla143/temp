Brief Hospital Course: This is a 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent DES to LCX and AS s/p valvuloplasty admitted on [**7-22**] for another CHF exacerbation, receiving diuresis/HD, pt course was complicated by GI bleeding, underwent dialysis prior to leaving.
It was decided that the patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention of the stenotic valve at this time.
She became refractory to Lasix dosing and required priming with diuril.
The patient had been receiving ASA and Plavix along with carvedilol, the ASA and plavix were discontinued after the episode of upper GI bleeding.
# Aortic Stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty, not thought to be good surgical candidate due to large atheroma.

The patient had her foley removed and she completed a course of cipro for 5 days.
The patient was given 1 more unit of blood and placed on Epo before discharge, Hct has been stable at baseline of 26 for the 48 hours prior to discharge.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient had been responsive to high doses of lasix (100mg) with diuril priming.
However, when the patient developed hematemesis and had an acute blood loss, she subsequently developed renal failure, and when she had a subsequent episode of flash pulmonary edema, she received urgent dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was placed.
