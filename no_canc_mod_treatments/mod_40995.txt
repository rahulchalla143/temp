After transient hypotension, she was admitted to the ICU where her pressures improved after volume resussitation and transfusion of 2 units of pRBC.
During that time she underwent 2 paracentesis of 3L each, most recent being day prior to admission.
She states she normally gets a paracentesis once/week at [**Hospital 3597**] [**Hospital **] Hospital, and then once/2 weeks at LGH, but lately, has been hospitalized so frequently she has not needed those outpatient appointments.
She received 4mg of IV morphine for pain control.

[**2147-3-20**] PARACENTESIS DIAG/THERAP W IMAGING GUIDE: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated bedside therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis via a right flank approach.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well with no early complications.
[**2147-3-22**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE/ERECT): Supine and erect abdominal radiographs again demonstrate mild small bowel distention, worsened [**3-21**] at 4:41 p.m. Hernial orifices are not imaged.

Brief Hospital Course: 54yo F PMHx HCV and EtoH cirrhosis decompensated with esophageal varices and ascites requiring weekly paracentesis, multiple SBOs, mesenteric ischemia s/p Ex-Lap/LOA [**10/2146**] p/w abdominal distention and pain, found to have chronic partial small bowel obstruction, which was managed conservatively.
Hospital course was complicated by encephalopathy requiring intubation and MICU admission, as well as Klebsiella UTI and [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient was made NPO and NGT was put to suction.
Patient's tramadol and gabapentin were increased, lidoderm patch to back, and baclofen.
While in the MICU, Transplant Surgery was consulted, and recommended conservative management of partial SBO with NGT, along with PO and PR lactulose.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for concern of airway production as patient was becoming increasingly more confused in the context of being unable to take her lactulose and rifaxamin due to abdominal pain.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**2147-3-19**], and intubated for airway protection rather than respiratory failure.
Mental status improved with decompression of SBO, rifaxmin and lactulose.
She was given a prescription for cefpodoxime to continue at home.
She was given a prescription for cefpodoxime to continue at home.
She appears cachectic, was planned for admission for Dobhoff and tube feedings on a separate occasion.
Patient was given dobhoff (could not be advanced post-pyloric at IR), and TF were initiated based on nutrition consult, but stopped when patient developed SBO.
Current plan is to reinitiate tube feeds on another admission.
#Gastritis: Patient was continued on home omeprazole.
She was recommended to pursue transplant at another institution.

While you were here, we performed two paracenteses on your ascites, and found that you did not have an infection of your peritoneal fluid either time.
We tried to initiate tube feeding during this admission, but this was complicated by your small bowel obstruction, so we were unable to initiate tube feeding at this time.
We controlled your pain with tylenol, tramadol, gabapentin and flexeril, but you were not satisfied with this pain regimen.
It required treatment with intravenous ceftazidime, but you did not want to stay for this treatment.
We discharged you on an antibiotic that might work for the infection.
Please note that the following changes have been made to your medications: - START cefpodoxime 200 mg by mouth twice per day for seven days - START simethicone four times per day for abdominal pain  You left against medical advice, but understood the risks of leaving the hospital.
