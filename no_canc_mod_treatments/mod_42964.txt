[**2160-10-20**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    86F with a PMH significant for CAD (s/p CABG [**2143**], PCI with stenting of the LAD  in [**6-/2153**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%), DM, HTN, HLD, CKD stage IV-V  (baseline creatinine 3.5-4) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of nausea  and emesis found to have acute CHF exacberation with resulting acute  respiratory failure requiring MICU admission for worsening acute respiratory   failure, complicated by NSTEMI with medical management, initiation of  hemodiayslis complicated by left femoral pseudoaneurysm vs. fistula who is hemodynamically stable  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: patient has temporary right IJ for HD - please replace with tunneled HD line   Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 86F with a PMH significant for CAD (s/p CABG [**2143**], PCI with stenting of the LAD in [**6-/2153**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%), DM, HTN, HLD, CKD stage IV-V (baseline creatinine 3.5-4) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of nausea and emesis found to have acute CHF exacberation with resulting acute respiratory failure requiring MICU admission for worsening acute respiratory failure, complicated by NSTEMI with medical management, initiation of hemodiayslis complicated by left femoral pseudoaneurysm vs. fistula who is hemodynamically stable.
Given these findings, she was medically optimized at that time with Aspirin 325 mg PO, we continued her statin, dosed her beta-[**Month/Year (2) 7005**] and started a heparin gtt (this was intermittently on/off given concerns for a femoral left pseudoaneurysm, as noted below).
We continued medical optimization as listed above, added Plavix 75 mg PO daily given the delay in catheterization and titrated her beta-[**Month/Year (2) 7005**].
We trended her EKG findings, monitored her for chest pain, and trended her Troponins and CK-MB for resolution of her NSTEMI concerns.
On [**2160-10-2**], she saw her PCP who felt that the nausea was secondary to diuretics and her Metolazone and Lasix were decreased (or held?).
Of note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for acute CHF exacerbation ([**Date range (1) 29441**]).
At that time, Torsemide 100 mg was changed to Lasix 200 mg PO BID with 5 mg of Metolazone to augment his loop diuretic.
She was seen by Nephrology who opted for conservative management initially.
Because there was not significant improvement and her symptoms were worsening, the plan was for HD line placement in IR on the day of transfer to the ICU.
At 7:30 AM she became more acutely dyspneic and was satting 89% 4L NC and which improved to 96% on a NRB.
She was given Lasix 100 mg IV and put out 700 cc in the first hour, but remained dyspneic.
Nephrology then recommended placement of an emergent dialysis line so the patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2160-10-9**].
At time of transfer, her dyspnea had improved, but she remained on a non-rebreather.
In the MICU, on [**10-9**], the patient was preparing for HD line placement per Nephrology recommendations, Metolazone and Lasix were continued.
She was weaned to 2L NC before transferring to the floor on [**2160-10-14**].
We continued medical optimization of her CHF regimen (held off on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] given her renal issues) including Metoprolol, Imdur, a CCB and monitored her with daily weights, monitored her I/Os and aimed for a goal of even to negative 1L daily.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY (HEMODIALYSIS) - On [**2160-10-2**], she saw her PCP who felt that the nausea was secondary to diuretics and her Metolazone and Lasix were decreased (or held?).
Of note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for acute CHF exacerbation ([**Date range (1) 29441**]).
At that time, Torsemide 100 mg was changed to Lasix 200 mg PO BID with 5 mg of Metolazone to augment his loop diuretic.
She was seen by Nephrology who opted for conservative management initially.
Because there was not significant improvement and her symptoms were worsening, the plan was for HD line placement in IR on the day of transfer to the ICU.
Nephrology then recommended placement of an emergent dialysis line so the patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2160-10-9**].
At time of transfer, her dyspnea had improved, but she remained on a non-rebreather.
In the MICU, on [**10-9**], the patient was preparing for HD line placement per Nephrology recommendations, Metolazone and Lasix were continued.
She was weaned to 2L NC before transferring to the floor on [**2160-10-14**] (a temporary right IJ was placed for this purpose).
A permanent HD-line was tunneled on [**2160-10-20**] without issue and she will continue on outpatient hemodialysis.
# LEFT FEMORAL PSEUDOANEURYSM VS. FISTULA - After bilateral attempts at cannulation of the femoral artery for HD-access, the patient subsequently developed a large partially thrombosed left femoral pseudoaneurysm (6-cm) which may have progressed to an AV-distula based on imaging.
She underwent thrombin injection without avail and a repeat at thrombin injection which was again unsuccessful.
Vascular surgery was consulted and following with plan for surgical repair pending stabilization of her cardiac issues.
Vascular surgery operatively repaired this PSA via an open, primary approach on [**2160-10-17**] without issue, she tolerated this well.
# DYSPNEA, PULMONARY EDEMA - As noted above, the patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure in the setting of an acute CHF exacerbation with a new oxygen requirement which was weaned from NRB -> 4L to 2L via NC with initiation of hemodialysis and diuresis.
We continued aggressive volume control with hemodialysis, provided oxygen supplementation with plan to wean, and maintained her on albuterol and ipratroprium nebs as needed with pulse oximetry monitoring and incentive spirometry.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA - The patient presented with baseline chronic renal insufficiency-induced normocytic anemia with HCT in the 30-32% range with Epopoeitin injections monthly.
Upon MICU transfer she required 5 units of packed red cells during for a HCT of 24-25% which responded appropriately.
# INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS - The patient was admitted on Humulin 70/30, 20 units before breakfast and 26 units before dinner, as a home regimen.
The patient was continued on an insulin sliding scale as well with Q6 hour blood glucose monitoring.
# HYPERTENSION - The patient was continued on her home blood pressure regimen; with a goal BP < 130/80 mmHg.
Her cardiac medications were optimized this admission.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Her home Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily was changed to atorvastatin.
# GOUT - The patient recently completed a course of Prednisone on her last admission for gout flare and thus we continued her home Allopurinol medication (renally dosed).
# REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE - We continued her home Albuterol and Flovent medications; albuterol and ipatropium nebs were dosed as needed.
