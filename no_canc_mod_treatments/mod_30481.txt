Admission Date:  [**2169-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-11-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Percocet / Codeine / Nutren Pulmonary  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Urosepsis and pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement [**2169-11-2**]   History of Present Illness: 85F from [**Hospital1 **] with reports of R facial droop and slurred speech.
Was on a course of levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 **] for UTI.
In the ED, she received vanco, ceftaz, steroids, 1 unit PRBCs, and tylenol for hypotension and presumed sepsis.
Given her h/o multidrug resistant pseudomonas UTIs, she was started on meropenem with clinical improvement.
Given her clinical improvement, concentration of meropenem in the urine might be adequate to treat so she has been continued on it.
The lab is currently performing additional antibiotic sensitivities.
Additionally, cultures from a recent bronchial washing revealed MRSA and, given pneumonia on imaging and clinically with associated sepsis, she has been continued on vancomycin since admission.
She has been on steroids since the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**].
Recent hospitalization with intubation complicated by MRSA pneumonia, d/c on [**9-25**] to rehab.
Discharged on insulin following  her [**Hospital1 **] admission.
4)Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-peroneal bypass in [**2162**] 5)Multi-focal bacterial pneumonia.
6)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- PFT [**7-2**]- FVC 61% pred,  FEV1 56% pred, FEV1/FVC 92%, Reduced FVC related to gas trapping, ~400 cc worse than PFT from one year ago.

Family History: Asthma in her father  Physical Exam: T 97.1 HR 89 BP 131/66 O2 sat 99% on 2L NC Weight 61 kg Gen: pleasant cooperative NAD HEENT: very dry MM, PERRL Cor: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, II/VI systolic murmur heard loudest at the apex and radiating to L axilla Pulm: tachypneic, diffuse rhonchi, egophany in the RLL field Abd: +BS, soft/NT/ND, JPEG in place Ext: 2+ doughy edema B/L LE, dressing in place over stasis ulcers on B/L LE (L appears superficial, 1cm; R shows some muscle, but appears to be healing well), strength lower extremities [**1-29**] bilaterally, upper extremities [**3-1**] bilaterally.
Limited assessment for hilar mass due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Her blood pressures stabilized and did not require pressors, she was in addition maintained on Vancomycin renally dosed, as she recently had the history of MRSA pneumonia in [**2169-9-15**].
She is to finish a 14 day course of vancomycin and meropenem to be completed on [**2169-11-12**].
Once her pressures stabilized, she was actively diuresed with 40mg Lasix IV BID with good effect.
She was given an additional dose of IV lasix to which she responded well and again is maintaining oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room air.
She will be discharged on an increased dose of lasix from her admission dose of 40mg po bid--> 60mg po bid.
# Asthma/COPD: She was taken off steroids about 1 week ago abruptly and was restarted with a taper this hospitalization.
She finished her steroid taper while hospitalized and was continued on fluticasone, montelukast with good effect.
# Pneumonia:  She demonstrated a RLL infiltrate on imaging and given her recurrent aspirations, she was continued on meropenem (started originally for pseudomonas urosepsis).
She was also continued on vancomycin given her history of MRSA pneumonia.
She will need to complete a 14 day course of both antibiotics to be completed on [**2169-11-12**].
All of her medications are to be crushed and inserted into her PEG.
Her creatinine was 2.3 on admission which improved with treatment of her infections and active diuresis and was 1.4 on discharge.
She is now on 22 U at night plus humalog insulin sliding scale.
She did have a low blood sugar on admission due to tube feeds being stopped at rehab, but was within normal limits subsequently.
GI Bleed: Had one episode of BRBPR post PEG tube placement and denies any since.
Seems likely a reflection of her Bell's Palsy given mild chronic right sided deficits prior to this episode.
# H/O zoster: She reported pain on her right anterior thigh at the site of previous zoster outbreak, but no vesicles/rash were ever visualized.
She was treated with gabapentin and a lidoderm patch.
Neurontin may need to be titrated up as renal function improves as it is currently renally dosed.
# FEN: She is to be continued on tube feeds with goal of 50cc/hour.
She is currently receiving Probalance full strength and should receive a comparable solution for adequate caloric delivery.
