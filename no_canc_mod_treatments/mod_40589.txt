She received an MRV and CTV which revealed evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis for which she was initiated on IV heparin therapy (see images below).
She was noted to be net five liters positive over the course of her stay, as a consequence of IV fluids, free water boluses to treat hypernatremia, etc.
- Following her reintubation, she did receive IV diuresis aggressively, but this was briefly held secondary to an episode of hypotension that occurred over the weekend which was transient and responded quickly to a bolus of fluids.
She was initially started on vancomycin/tobra/cefepime, which have subsequently been narrowed to nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for the same.
- Her Cr increased to 1.8 after she was given an extra 40mg IV lasix on [**11-3**].
This improved once her PO lasix was held and PO intake was encouraged.
