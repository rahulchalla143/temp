Medications effect was considered and pt's pain regimen was altered and digoxin dose was reduced.
She was also started on TPN for supplementation.
There her nodal blocking agents were titrated up.
She was maintained on lopressor for HR and BP control.
Ideally, digoxin can be tapered off completely given narrow therapeutic range.
4) CHRONIC LEG PAIN: Continued on fentanyl patch.
Neurontin re-added to her regimen.
Avoid morphine or other IV opioids which were likely contributing to nausea.
5) DM2: Glipizide was held due to limited PO intake.
Pt was placed on sliding scale insulin and insulin was added to TPN.
Glipizide can be restarted when pt taking better POs.
7) ASTHMA: At home, pt on chronic prednisone, singulair.
It was not clear why pt was on chronic prednisone as this is not the ideal management of asthma.
Therefore, predisone was stopped, singulair continued, and given prn bronchodilators.
Her hct was variable between 24-30 but did not require any transfusions.
