She was seen by the Electrophysiology Service who concluded that this was a classic vasovagal episode in the setting of dehydration and recommended a vigorous hydration as well as treatment of her urinary tract infection.
If she has further episodes like this in the future, she may benefit from beta-blocker to prevent her vasovagal induced vasodepressor syncope.
