Admission Date:  [**2131-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Ibuprofen  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: ASA desensitization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization ([**2131-12-24**]) Intubation ([**2131-12-25**])   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed cardiomyopathy with EF 30% who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] with complaints of increasing SOB, DOE, orthopnea, PND, chest tightness, and wheezing.
He was treated as an acute on chronic CHF exacerbation with diuresis as well as a COPD exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers.
He was seen by Cardiology and Pulmonology consults, and repeat TTE showed an LVEF of 20-25% with global LV hypokinesis and chamber dilatation, and the possibility of an apical thrombus could not be ruled out.
He was started on weight-based heparin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Cath Lab for catheterization.
Given his ASA allergy, he is admitted to the CCU for ASA desensitization and investigation of viability of the anteroapical wall in anticipation of probable PCI of the LAD lesion.
ROS: He acknowledges a prior history of TIA but denies any history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Past Medical History: - severe COPD / bronchial asthma - cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30-35%, cause unknown - suspected TIA - h/o recent pneumonia - LBBB on ECG - nephrolithiasis - s/p cataract surgery - s/p hernia repair   Social History: Lives with his wife, fairly independent until symptomatic w/ SOB.
Right retrocardiac density, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
He was admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization with plan for repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI.
Aspirin desensitization - The patient was admitted to the CCU overnight for aspirin desensitization.
He completed the protocol overnight, but approximately 1 hour after completion he suffered from acute-onset of severe respiratory distress with chest tightness and wheezing, consistent with anaphylaxis.
He was treated with steroids, H1- and H2-blockers, as well as treatments directed at his COPD, CHF, and anxiety, with no improvement, so he was intubated for respiratory failure.
He was seen by the Allergy consult service, who felt that this was consistent with anaphylaxis, and recommended repeat desensitization after a couple weeks if needed.
On transfer, he was still mildly fluid overloaded, so diuresis was continued with Lasix and spironolactone.
He is being discharged on Lasix and spironolactone, as well as a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor.
Coronary artery disease - The patient underwent cardiac catheterization that showed a left-dominant system, an LAD with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout and mid-vessel 80% stenosis, and a LCx with mild luminal irregularities and mid-vessel eccentric 60% stenosis.
He was admitted for the aspirin desensitization protocol as above, but given his anaphylaxis he is not being discharged on aspirin.
It was also suggested that he would need a viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability in preparation for a potential PCI of his mid-LAD lesion, but his TTE showed no wall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemia as the reason for his cardiomyopathy, so there was felt to be no indication for viability study at this time.
He was transferred on an IV heparin gtt, but TTE here showed no evidence of apical thrombus, so this was discontinued.
This was significantly worsened after his intubation for anaphylaxis as above, so he was treated with IV Solu-Medrol and then quickly transitioned to Prednisone for a rapid taper.
He was otherwise continued on Advair, Spiriva, and nebulizers as needed, and showed significant improvement by discharge.

You do have an exacerbation of your COPD (chronic lung disease) and are being treated for it with steroids.
You will need to continue to take your medications as prescribed below.
You also have atrial fibrillation but were not treated with blood thinners because you were not on this medication at home.
You should discuss starting blood thinners (Coumadin) with your cardiologist at home.
