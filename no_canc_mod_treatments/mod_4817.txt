Admission Date:  [**2127-5-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-1-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4028**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy, persistent sinus tachycardia.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 23707**] is a 53 year old male with HIV (CD4 352 one month ago), Parkinson's Disease, HTN, chronic lower extremity edema and recurrent cellulitis who was  brought to ED from [**Hospital1 1501**] with lethargy and leukocytosis, and then admitted to MICU with colitis and persistent sinus tachycardia.
Of note, he was treated with course of ciprofloxacin for UTI in [**2127-3-9**].
He was given IV vancomycin dose in the emergency room, IV flagyl, ceftriaxone, and 5 Liters NS IVFs were given.
- Brain aneurysms s/p surgery - Depression - Schizophrenia - PVD - Urinary Incontinence x15-20 yrs - H/O hypogonadism - H/O L leg, knee, neck, shoulder pain - H/O cocaine dependence and opiod abuse - Status-post lap cholecystectomy  Social History: Patient is now living at [**Hospital 16662**] Rehabilitation and Nursing Center.
URINE STUDIES: [**2127-5-12**] 06:10PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.018 [**2127-5-12**] 06:10PM URINE  BLOOD-TR NITRITE-POS PROTEIN-TR GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-SM [**2127-5-12**] 06:10PM URINE  RBC-[**4-10**]* WBC-[**12-26**]* BACTERIA-MANY YEAST-NONE EPI-0 [**2127-5-12**] 06:10PM URINE  HYALINE-[**12-26**]* .
IMAGING: [**2127-5-12**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
There is wall thickening and pericolonic fat effacement involving the pelvic loops of large bowel.
[**2127-5-19**]: PLAIN UPRIGHT ABDOMINAL FILM Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern without evidence of pneumoperitoneum .
There was also an additional identification of a urinary tract infection which was treated with 7 day course of antibiotics during this admission.
He was started on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin with good clinical response and diarrhea and abdominal cramping decreased over several days.
Diet was slowly advanced from NPO to clears, then to a regular diet, which he has been tolerating well.
Surgery evaluated films and the patient and felt there was no need for any interventions given his rapid recovery on medications and recommended more conservative management with antibiotics.
The plan will be to continue him on PO Vancomycin liquid capsules and TID PO Flagyl for another 12 days for a 21 day total course.
Blood cultures returned negative but he had both a proteus UTI and C.difficile colitis on additional studies so his lethargic presentation was first felt to be from urosepsis vs. transient bacteremia from some bowel translocation effects.
As above he is still being treated with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl for his C.difficile colitis infection.
This was likely related to sepsis plus hypovolemia with high stool output and frequent urination associated with his UTI.
Over a 48 hour period his rapid HR improved markedly with IV fluids and he remained largely in the 60-80s range for the remainder of his hospital course.
This was discussed with [**Year (4 digits) 3390**] on day of discharge and patient will be placed back on 40mg daily lasix for now which he primarily takes for his LE edema and will advance back to his usual 100mg daily dose at a later date once his diarrhea has completely abated.
His diuretics, both Spirinolactone and Lasix were held, and he was initially given IVFs for resuscitation with concern of looming sepsis picture as above.
This was attributed to acute illness and dehydration as he recovered completely and was fully alert and oriented within 2 days after IV/PO antibiotics and IVF resuscitation was initiated.
# UTI: Mr. [**Known lastname 23707**] has a history of Pseudomonas (pansensitive) treated with ciprofloxacin about two months ago.
Here, he was found to have bacteria on urine study and a follow-up culture showed Proteus so he was treated for a complicated UTI with 7 days of IV Cefepime which he completed on [**5-19**].
Indwelling foley catheter was removed in favor of a condom catheter and portable urinal.
# HIV: On HAART therapy now.
He has been continued on his regimen of Truvada and Raltegravir while inpatient with no changes.
#Chronic peripheral edema: Team opted to discontinue his usual diuretics, lasix and spirinolactone, due to his dehydration and losses from diarrhea and urinary frequency with his UTI.
He was restarted on a lower dose of his usual lasix at discharge at 40mg daily (had been on 100mg daily dose pre-admission)and he is back on 50mg [**Hospital1 **] spirinolactone now.
# Parkinsons Disease:  He was continued on his usual home medication regimen which included benztropine, gabapentin, Carbidopa-Levodopa (25/250) 1 tablet PO QID.
# Depression/Anxiety: He was continued on PRN Ativan as well as his daily Valproate, and Aripiprazole 10 mg daily for mood stability in setting of bipolar disorder alongside his depression and anxiety.
#Smoking history: Patient was placed on a nicotine patch during hospital course which should be continued at discharge for 4 weeks and then tapered down, patient will follow up with [**Hospital1 3390**] for additional taper schedule based on his status and success at that juncture.
He had been on Chantix in the past but was not taking this after admission.
#Prophylaxis: He was placed on daily Famotidine for GI protection and Heparin SC for DVT prevention.
While he is fairly immobile he should continue with heparin prophylaxis at his rehabilitation facility until he is ambulating more regularly.
