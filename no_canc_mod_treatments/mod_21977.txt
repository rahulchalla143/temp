Fever/leukocytosis - The patient was pan cultured and grew out MSSA from her sputum for which she was treated with clindimycin.
The MSSA PNA was treated with clindimycin for a 2 week course.
A cardiac cath was performed which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease, moderate systolic ventricular dysfuction, and moderate diastolic ventricular function.
It was decided at this time that the patients CAD was not amenable to PCI and that medical management was the best option.
Hence the patient was optimized on a medical regimen which included hydralazine, clonidine, captopril, metoprolol, amlodipine, isordil, plavix, and aspirin.
On this regimen, the patients BP's were maintained with systolics in the 140's.
DM - The patient's blood sugars were controlled on an insulin drip.
