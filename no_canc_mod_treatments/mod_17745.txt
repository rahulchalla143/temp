She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit, where her INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. The gastroenterology service was consulted, but the patient and her health care proxy declined further work-up (EGD/colonoscopy).
2) Sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia: In the ICU, the patient was fluid resuscitated and covered with Zosyn/vancomycin with stabilization of blood pressure.
She had a speech and swallow evaluation, which recommended soft diet/thin liquids with no mixed consistencies.
She was transitioned to oral antibiotics (cefpodoxime/metronidazole) to complete a 14 day course.
Given suspicion for fluid overload, she was gently diuresed with IV Lasix without significant change in size of effusions.
The patient does not desire further blood draws and has decided to pursue hospice at rehab.
She was continued off coumadin given GI bleed (see above).
However, the patient did not desire further testing (MRI head, etc.)
The patient does not desire treatment or further diagnostic testing.
10) Goals of care: Extensive discussions were held with the patient and her health care proxy with regards to his goals of care.
They would like to complete the planned course of antibiotics for her aspiration pneumonia, but do not desire further tests or invasive procedures (MRIs, thoracentesis, lab draws, biopsies).
