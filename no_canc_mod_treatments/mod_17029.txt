Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
Pending pleural fluid cytology  Brief Hospital Course:  78 yo gentleman with pmhx s/f sacral decub and chronic obstructive uropathy transferred from OSH in shock (baseline pressures 120) with opacified left lung and found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure with severely altered mentation necessitating intubation.
However, after chest tube pleural fluid drainage fully expanded the left lung, the patient's respiratory status did not improve.
Records obtained from prior hospitalizations and nursing home clearly indicated that patient did not want intubation and mechanical ventilation.
A large amount was drained and pig tail catheter placed resulting in full reexpansion of lung.
Even after drainage and dramatic  radiographic improvement of left lung, the patient remained in hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Other than urine, potential sources included lung, which is unlikely in retrospect given the lack of consolidation on xray after pleural fluid tap and the non-infectious nature of the fluid itself, and stage IV sacral decubitus.
The patient was fluid resuscitated and placed on broad spectrum abx with zosyn, vanc, and levofloxacin to cover potential HCAP.
Likely contributing source for recurrent UTIs and was recently treated at OSH with levofloxacin for E coli UTI that was resistant to levofloxacin.
Pt was placed on broad spectrum abx.
