She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 70560**] for HAP; during that admission, she was treated for HAP x2.
She finished her antibiotics approximately 5 days prior to admission.
She was started on Levaquin 3 days prior to admission without improvement, so she was sent to the ED.
She was given Vancomycin 1gm IV x1 and Cefepime for HAP.
She was given diltiazem 10mg IV x1 for afib with RVR, and HR improved to 90s.
She was given 2L of IVF in ED.
She was placed briefly on BIPAP but desaturated to 86% and looked more uncomfortable.
[**Name (NI) **] brothers, no longer able to walk or take care of ADLs; decline in last few months since recurrent PNAs.
Confirmation with transesophageal echo was recommended.
After her thoracentesis she was easily extubated and transferred to the floor.
She was also treated with 7-days of vancomycin and 5-days of levofloxacin for possible pneumonia though it is not clear if this was a definite contributor in this case.
We decided to put her on prednisone given her continued symptoms for a planned slow taper.
She should continue on nebulizer therapy, advair, prednisone taper.
Her weight should be monitored carefully and lasix titrated to keep her weight stable so that she does not accumulate any fluid.
Of note, it is very important that she continue to receive oxygen therapy for her pulmonary hypertension as well as her COPD in order to maintain her oxygen saturations above 92%.
- prednisone 40 mg daily, plan for slow taper with decrease by 10 mg qweek down to 10 mg daily.
At that time, she should see pulmonary and they should help to determine further decreases in her steroids.
- continue O2 to maintain sats >92%, she should have oxygen at all times.
She is currently on a heparin drip with coumadin bridge.
When her INR is greater than 2, the heparin drip can be discontinued and she should continue on coumadin until she sees the cardiologist.
She is currently on metoprolol 25 mg every six hours and diltiazem 60 mg every six hours.
She was continued on her digoxin without any changes.
# DM - Her finger sticks were initially well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
However, once she was on steroids her finger sticks were more elevated.
She was started on lantus and this was increased to 20 units qHS at the time of discharge with sliding scale humalog prior to meals.
# chronic diastolic CHF - She was given several doses of IV lasix to aid with diuresis and her home lasix was increased to 60 mg daily.
# Malnutrition - as above, megace was discontinued given the atrial thrombus.
