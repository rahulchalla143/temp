PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with ESRD on HD, no IV access and clotted off IJs and subclavians bilaterally REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please check MRV of the chest to evaluate patency of vessels as it appears bilateral IJs and subclavians are occluded MRA OF THE CHEST.
Currently, inability to gain central access, evaluate for clot versus stenosis in central veins.
A central catheter appears present in the left subclavian/brachiocephalic vein with its tip in the SVC.
Findings consistent with linear thrombus (age indeterminate) or a fibrin sheath from a prior catheter in the right brachicephalic vein and superior vena cava.
Perhaps this thrombus somehow temporarily interfered with passage of the catheter through the venous structures.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis at L2-L3.
Disc protrusions at L4-5 and L5-S1 with features as discussed above.
Tunneled HD catheter placement: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with ESRD on HD needs permanent hemodialysis catheter; Catheter recently removed from LIJ b/c of MSSA bacteremia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: TUNNELLED HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER; attempt right side first, if unable may use the left HISTORY: 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease requiring permanent hemodialysis catheter.
Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the left brachial vein.
A 0.018-inch guide wire was advanced through the needle into the brachial vein and then the needle was exchanged for the inner 3 French stiffener of the micropuncture sheath.
Based on the findings of the diagnostic venogram, it was determined that the patient would be a suitable candidate for a left subclavian vein tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used to puncture the left subclavian vein.
A 0.018-inch guide wire was advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.
A 14.5 French double lumen hemodialysis catheter was placed through the tunnel after being bathed in orthopedic solution.
A 0.018-inch guide wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guide wire, and then the micropuncture sheath was exchanged for 10 French dilator, 12 French dilator, and then peel-away introducer sheath.
The guide wire was removed, and the catheter was placed through the peel-away sheath and positioned with its tip in the superior vena cava.
It was noted on fluoroscopy that as the peel-away sheath was removed, the dialysis catheter tip flipped into the azygos vein.
Therefore, an Amplatz guide wire was placed through the catheter, and the catheter tip was repositioned in the superior aspect of the right atrium using fluoroscopy.
The catheter was sutured in place with 2-0 silk sutures, and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.
Note that a 27-cm long cuff-tip catheter was utilized.
Successful placement of a 27 cm long cuff-tip 14.5 French double lumen hemodialysis catheter by way of the left subclavian vein with tip in the superior aspect of the right atrium.
In addition to the fat-containing umbilical hernia, there are several nodular densities in the anterior abdominal wall, the largest measuring 11 mm, of uncertain clinical significance.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo female with DM, ESRD on HD and HTN who presented with hypotension and UA suggestive of UTI, found to have MSSA bacteremia.
1) MSSA bacteremia/fevers:  The patient was initially admitted with hypotension after HD.
Blood cultures showed growth of G+ cocci so she was started on vancomycin.
Further speciation showed MSSA and she had her HD line removed on [**4-20**].
She was also changed to nafcillan from vancomycin when her sensitivities returned.
She had a temporary femoral HD catheter placed b/c the vessels in her chest were difficult to access.
She had a tunnelled HD line placed by IR on [**4-28**].
They had difficulty placing this line and also had difficulty placing a midline b/c of clot in the vessels.
She was treated with IVFs and sent to the MICU.
She was started on flagyl and had copious amts of diarrhea while in the ICU.
She completed a 14 day course of metronidazole for her presumed c. difficile.
She was being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, which was discontinued in favor of nafcillin, to be continued for a minimum of [**5-13**] weeks for high grade bacteremia and osteomyelitis.
She was also found to have a pseudomonal urinary tract infection, sensitive to cefepime, and she received a 7 day course of treatment for this as well.
She will follow up with infectious diseases as an outpatient, and will have course of therapy determined by them.
2) ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sa):  The patient was continued on her regularly scheduled dialysis on T/Th/Sa.
She was continued on renagel and nephrocaps.
As mentioned above, she had her HD line removed on [**4-20**] and received dialysis through a temporary femoral line for several days.
She had a new tunnelle line placed by IR on [**4-28**].
3) DM: Patient's blood sugars were well controlled and she was continued on 7 units of NPH at breakfast and 4 units at dinner.
She required a slight adjustment in this regimen during her stay and was also covered with a RISS.
She was continued on multipodus boots, zinc, ascorbic acid and received wound care.
However, doppler studies were performed, which showed minimal perfusion to the LLE, and patient was taken by vascular surgery to angiography where stents were placed in the left external iliac and superior femoral arteries, with repeat doppler studies showing improved flow.
Patient was kept nonweight bearing on the heel, and received local wound care.
She will continue high dose atorvastatin and clopidogrel.
Spoke with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from IP who said no further intervention necessary at this time.
8) Hyperlipidemia: Continued on lipitor 80 mg qd.
Patient's Synthroid dose was increased to 200 mcg qd prior to discharge 3 weeks ago.
10) H/o asthma:  Continued albuterol nebs .
13) Access: Patient had new hemodialysis tunnelled line placed on [**4-28**].
Patient also had PICC line placed during admission.
A speech and swallow evaluation was obtained and recommended dietary modifications, which patient was unwilling to comply with.
Due to concern for high clot burden in bilateral upper extremities, patient was placed on anticoagulation with coumadin.
She was briefly taken off coumadin for her vascular procedure, and at time of discharge, awaiting therapeutic INR with goal 2.0 to 3.0. .
