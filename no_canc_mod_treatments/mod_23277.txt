Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Coumadin was begun for her mechanical aortic valve.
There was a question of atrial thrombus and cardioversion was postponed.
Amiodarone was discontinued per EP recommendations with plans for TEE and possible cardioversion in 1 month.

She was loaded with Digoxin for rate control and Diltiazem was begun for rate control.
She was continued with Coumadin for anticoagulation for an INR goal of [**1-23**].
She will return for Electrophysiology follwo up and cardioversion at a later date.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 she was ambulating, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
