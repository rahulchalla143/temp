Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 168**], MD, Interpreting physician     Brief Hospital Course: Admitted for intravenous heparin prior to cardiac catherization to bridge off coumadin due to mechanical mitral valve.
Underwent preoperative workup including cardiac catherization, carotid ultrasound, and head CT,  Was brought to the operating [****] for aortic and tricuspid valve replacement and epicardial leads with new pacemaker generator.
She was started on coumadin for mechanical valves and lasix for diuresis.
On POD 2 she was started on heparin drip and remained in the intensive care unit for monitoring.
Dobhoff tube was placed due to absent gag and swallow evaluation ordered.
POD 4 she was cleared for thin liquids, dobhoff removed, and started on supplements with meals.
She was ready for discharge to acute rehab on heparin drip for mechanical valve until INR > 2.5 via PICC line.
