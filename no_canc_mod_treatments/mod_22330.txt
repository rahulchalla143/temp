IV access was obtained, and the patient was notably intubated prior to arrival and resuscitation attempts were started with multiple blood products, including fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells and platelets.
Intraoperatively, he received 5.5 liters of crystalloid along with fifteen units of packed red blood cells, ten units of fresh frozen plasma and four units of platelets.
Advanced cardiac life support and CPR protocols were initiated immediately.
Resuscitation efforts were carried out according to protocol, along with fluid resuscitation and replacement of blood products and correction of coagulopathy.
His rhythm degenerated multiple times into a ventricular fibrillation requiring electrical shock.
Despite aggressive efforts for resuscitation, the patient never regained a sustainable rhythm with a pulse after twenty to twenty-five minutes of resuscitation attempts.
After discussion with the trauma surgical attending, the trauma surgical chief resident and the anesthesia attending, who were all present throughout the entire resuscitation effort, it was felt that resuscitation efforts should be terminated, given the lack of chance for survival.
