Admission Date:  [**2143-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Hypertensive urgency and hypercarbic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Placement of arterial line Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: HPI: 47yo tob+ M with hx of PE ([**2138**], previously on coumadin which was d/c'd one year ago) and HTN who has been non-copmliant with his medications for the last two month (change in PCP/loss of insurance) who presents to [**Hospital6 3105**] with non-radiating SSCP associated with SOB.
VS were significant for 300/170, 132, 60 -> the pt was started on a nitro gtt with improvement in his VS.
However his BP then dropped to 88/58 (leading to addition of levophed gtt transient), with HR of 95.
The pt received 100mg lasix IV x1, NTG gtt at 120mcg/min.
The pt became acutely hypoxic resulting in intubation with 20mg Etomidate, 100mg Succinylcholine, 4mg Ativan, and Vecurronium.
The pt received an ASA 325mg PO x1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
He was intubated and sedated on AC: 600x16, PEEP: 5, FiO2: 100%.
CXR performed demonstrated appropriate placement of ETT and NG tube.
In addition, it also demonstrated cardiomegaly with CHF, R pleural effusion and RLL consolidation with inc. opacity and air bronchograms.
Here, the pt was found to have elevated WBC count of 18, equivocal CE and was started on hep gtt.
will examine off propofol in AM.
Echo demonstrated an EF of 40% with global LV hypokinesis.

He had no events on telemetry and ruled out for a MI with flat cardiac enzymes x 3 with peak CK 230, peak MB 7, and troponin (0.06-> 0.09 -> 0.05).
Lipitor 80 QD was initially started, and then discontinued when he ruled out and his cholesterol profile returned with LDL .
He was started on Aspirin, metoprolol, captopril, nitro drip and HCTZ with reduction in his blood pressure to ~200/100.
In the CCU, he was placed on a labetalol drip for possible pheochromocytoma (to avoid unapposed beta-antagonism) and the nitro drip was weaned off.
He was subsequently switched to labetalol 800 TID, lisinopril 40 QD and HCTZ.
The differential diagnosis of secondary causes of HTN includes pheochromocytoma, adrenal hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism (Conn's), renal artery stenosis and aortic coarctation.
Aortic coarctation was thought unlikely given his strong distal pulses.
Renin and aldosterone levels were sent, but were taken in the context of the patient being on an ACE-I, so are likely to be nondiagnostic.
Renal artery stenosis was thought to be unlikely given that he tolerated a high dose of captopril (100 mg TID) and had a Cr of 1.0.
In the cardiac cath lab, he was found to have pulmonary hypertension - systolic 55, diastolic 24, mean 33, and a high wedge pressure of 30, as well as clean coronary arteries and no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
He was started on lasix 20 mg QD to lower his preload.
- continue ASA 81 QD, labetalol 800 TID, lisinopril 40 QD, HCTZ 25 QD and Lasix 20 QD - consider switching from labetalol 800 TID to Toprol XL 200 QD and titrating up given patient's past history of medical noncompliance.
He was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the MICU and then converted to levofloxacin in the CCU to complete a 7 day course as an outpatient.
- finish 7 day course of levofloxacin .
[**Last Name (STitle) 15264**] of [**Hospital 66509**] Medical Associates reported that she did not know of his PE history, having only seen him twice, and did not know if he had received a thrombophilia or malignancy work up in the past.
Spot Prot/Cr 0.3 not significantly elevated to indicate end organ damage.
He was started on an ACE-I.
- continue lisinopril 40 QD .
As ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant, and his iron/TIBC ratio was low, he was started on iron supplements - Iron 325 mg QD .
