He was started empirically on Zosyn, Flagyl, and Vancomycin was dosed randomly for a level less than 15.
A new line was placed in the right internal jugular vein.
Transplant Surgery was consulted regarding whether the hematoma needed to be evacuated.
After the central line had been changed, it was decided that the antibiotics should be discontinued since it was unclear what we were treating.
The patient did not spike a temperature for 24 hours.
Transplant Surgery was consulted, who recommended a fistulogram to rule out a pseudoaneurysm.
