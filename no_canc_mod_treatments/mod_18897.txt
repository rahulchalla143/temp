Extensive free fluid and mesenteric edema, likely due to both pancreatitis as well as postoperative/postpartum condition.
[**7-29**] serum and urine tox neg (except opiates - administered here) .
Findings compatible with non-complicated pancreatitis, not significantly changed from prior, however the administration of contrast allows visualization of a homogeneous, non-necrotic pancreatic parenchyma and no significant pseudocyst formation or other related complication.
sputum [**8-1**], [**8-2**] and [**8-3**]: 1+ yeasts [**2173-8-1**] SWAB abd incision: 1+ PMNs, no org   Brief Hospital Course: 33yoF presented to OSH with severe abdominal and back pain, found to have acute pancreatitis and severe hypercalemia, presenting POD 0 s/p cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal heart tones, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.
She was placed npo, given aggressive IVF and placed on TPN with serial following of abdominal exams and lipase.
Respiratory distress: Patient failed pressure support trial on [**7-30**], with agitation and frequent desats to the 80s.
Pt was then on AC requiring increased oxygen requirements (up to FIO2 0.7).
Fluids were held/minimized and diuresis was attempted with 20mg IV lasix x2, with no improvement in O2 saturation.
She was transferred to the floor and gradually weaned off of supplemental oxygen.
-she did have some residual hoarsness most likely due to intubation which should continue to improve.
Pt was intubated for control of airway, and exhibited agitation in waxing/ [**Doctor Last Name 688**] pattern on both propofol and versed/fentanyl for sedation.
Intra-cranial process ruled out by neg.
Patient was started on haldol IV standing and placed on a 1 to 1 sitter.
Due to pancreatitis and respiratory failure, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics for a 7 day course.
Her antibiotics were stopped on [**8-6**].
5. s/p c-section (healthy male at 35 weeks): OB/gyn followed during the hospitalization.
Her staples were removed and she is healing well.
Hypercalcemia:  Calcium 15.3 corrected for albumin of 2.5.
Did have triad of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis (albeit mild w/ upper end nml HCO3 of 30 on presentation to OSH).
Hypercalcemia has resolved on HD2 with IVF resuscitation .
Likely prerenal given N/V and risk for 3rd spacing in setting of pancreatitis as well as probable diuresis with hypercalcemia as well as [**1-29**] to direct toxicity of calcium.
Home VNA will be arranged for post-op wound check and to assess for any physical therapy needs.
