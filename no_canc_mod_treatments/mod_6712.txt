HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2142-10-24**] and was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a redo sternotomy and redo coronary artery bypass graft times three, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
The patient initially required Levophed drip for maintenance of the blood pressure.
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient had several short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which he was started on Amiodarone infusion.
She was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on the first postoperative evening and postoperative day #1 the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor.
Intubation was without complications.
Chest x-ray after intubation showed diffuse interspace disease, right greater than left.
The patient was empirically started on antibiotics, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
The patient remained significantly hypoxic, requiring paralytics and sedation and pressure control ventilation.
Paralytics were discontinued on postoperative day #3.
All of the cultures from that time were negative with the exception of a sputum sample done during bronchoscopy which was positive for Methicillin-sensitive Coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was minimal growth.
On postoperative day #4 the patient had a pulmonary artery catheter placed to rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema that showed a cardiac output of 7.2 and a cardiac index of 3.17, SVR of 715.
The pulmonary artery catheter was removed as it was felt that the patient had adequate cardiac output.
On postoperative day #4, the patient was switched from pressure control ventilation to conventional ventilation with assist control and subsequent to SIMV.
The patient's sedation was slowly weaned down.
The patient's positive end-expiratory pressure and sedation were weaned.
It was thought that the patient did not require any anti-arrhythmic therapy.
The patient continued on triple antibiotic therapy.
The patient was weaning on the ventilator and had been weaned down to CPAP with pressure support, required Diamox for metabolic alkalosis.
Sedation had been weaned off, however, the patient was agitated and not following commands, restless in the bed.
By postoperative day #9, the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation and continued to improve from a pulmonary standpoint, was able to tolerate nasal cannula by the morning of postoperative day #10 and required some pulmonary toilet, encouragement with coughing and deep breathing.
Duoderm was applied and subsequent skin care specialist evaluated the patient and felt that it was a Stage 2 ulcer and recommended continuing Duoderm.
He was quickly weaned off of oxygen to room air by postoperative day #11.
