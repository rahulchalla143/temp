On [**2193-8-22**], blood cultures were found to be GPC positive, and after a T to 101, her hemodialysis line as well as her femoral line was d/c'ed.
Vancomycin was begun in the ER and was continued until the organism type was known.
However, in anticipation of discharge, and given her MRSA+ foot wound culture, she was switched back to Vancomycin, to be given at dialysis to complete a 2-week course.
Hemodialysis was continued while the patient was in the hospital.
On [**2193-8-23**] a Quenton was placed in order to continue HD after the catheter had been removed.
On [**2193-8-27**], a Permacath was placed by interventional radiology.
The patient continued to be hypertensive despite her admission regimen of metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 40 qd, nifedipine 90 qd, and doxazosin 4 qhs.
In the hospital nifedipine was increased to nifedipine CR 120 qd, and then hydralazine 25mg po q6 was added as well.
The patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale with tight glucose control.
Although not requiring insulin in the nursing home, she will require insulin sliding scale for monitoring, at least initially.
The [**Hospital1 1106**] service followed the patient and a right lower extremity graft surveillance was done on [**2193-8-27**].
Although this was felt to be most likely due to [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] drainage as a result of her LE bypass surgery, she was evaluated for deep venous thrombosis with LENI's, which were found to be negative.
The patient was given Epogen during HD.
Atorvastatin Calcium 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QD (once a day).
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

**Changes to medications: Will continue on vancomycin at hemodialysis for her MSSA bacteremia.
Last dose will be [**9-6**] at hemodialysis (2 week total).
Needed insulin for glucose control, and may need monitoring and treatment with sliding scale at the nursing home.
Nifedipine increased to CR 120 XR qd and hydralazine 25mg q6 was added.
