He had a colonoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2305**] on [**3-28**] with polypectomy x4 (2 in the ascending colon, 1 in the distal ascending colon, 1 in the transverse colon).
He restarted his plavix on [**4-1**] as instructed, and had not yet restarted aspirin.
Two 16g IVs were placed and he was given 1L NS.
1U prbcs also started.
Past Medical History: CAD -cath [**1-30**]- 50% Lcx, 60 % Ostial RCA, LAD stent patent -cath [**8-29**], LAD stent (cypher) -s/p NSTEMI [**4-29**] cardiogenic shock, PEA arrest COPD on chronic daily Prednisone, home O2 2L continuous BPH Sarcoid Gout Moderate AS Chronic Systolic Heart failure EF 50% in [**12-31**] Hx Pneumothorax Depression GIB-- AVM on at hepatic flexure- s/p embolization by IR (after 4 bleeding scans, c scope, push enteroscopy,etc.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 77 year old man with CAD, COPD, prior GI bleed, here with BRBPR, anemia, and hypotension s/p colonoscopy and polypectomy.
Of note, patient had a prior major bleed from AVM at hepatic flexure requiring transfusion of 15U PRBC and IR embolization.
This was thought to be secondary to fluid overload (in setting of holding diuretics and getting blood) so was given IV ethacrynic acid.
Also treated with BiPAP, Nitro gtt, and Solu-Medrol with improvement.
He improved fairly rapidly with these interventions and did have similar episodes during his hospitalization.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and troponin was mildly elevated to 0.13, CK peak 120, MB peak 15, thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
Additionally, ethacrynic acid was restarted prior to discharge.
Ultimately improved toward his baseline, and his antihypertensives were restarted prior to discharge without any complications.
# CAD: s/p DES to LAD in [**2183**] (patent stent on cath in [**1-30**]).
Aspirin and Plavix  were initially held given bleeding.
Statin was continue (switched to simvastatin as lovastatin is non formulary).
Continued home inhalers (changed to fluticasone and salmeterol as his home medications are nonformulary).
Briefly was treated with stress dose steroids as above, which were not continued as SOB was thought to be secondary to volume overload vs. COPD exacerbation.
# BPH:  Initially held tamsulosin for hypotension and continued Finasteride.
Tamsulosin was restarted prior to discharge, and he had no difficulty with post-Foley voiding.
