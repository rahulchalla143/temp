Cardiovascular-patient was weaned off of pressor support shortly after admission, he was maintained on iv metoprolol with adequate control of his blood pressure.
The daughter was told that the patient would likely benefit from tracheostomy and that extubation could very well lead to reintubation considering the patient's poor functional status.
GI-the patient was started on TPN for nutritional support.
He was also given tube feedings.
He is currently being maintained on tube feeds and no TPN.
His albumin has been stable with this regimen and he should be continued on this: Nepro 45% strength for Osm of 280 at a goal rate of 70cc/hour.
has been getting Lasix throughout his stay for help w/diuresis.
He is no longer requiring lasix and is making adequate uring on his own.
We do not anticipate that he will need any further transfusions.
was initially being treated for aspiration pneumonia and is requiring two more day of antibiotics to complete his course.
