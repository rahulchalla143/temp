Admission Date:  [**2196-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-10-12**]   Service: Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is an 82 year-old Asian male with a history of dementia, who was transferred from the MICU to the floor following a long stay for respiratory failure, complicated by fevers and complicated by bilateral iatrogenic pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement.
Briefly the patient was admitted on [**2196-9-26**] following a respiratory and cardiac arrest after choking on food.
The patient was resuscitated and intubated in the field by EMS.
In the Emergency Department the patient received a left pneumothorax following an attempted left subclavian line placement.
This left pneumothorax required a chest tube.
The Emergency Department course is also notable for hypotension requiring Levophed, as well as witnessed aspiration event.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] complications of the left chest tube resulted in a left tented pneumothorax as well as a right sided pneumothorax presumed secondary to high PIPs in the 90s.
The cardiac surgery was consulted and bilateral chest tubes were placed.
The patient was initially begun on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.
In addition, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which was responsive to Adenosine and vagal maneuvers.
On [**2197-10-5**] the patient was extubated and bilateral chest tubes were discontinued.
ALLERGIES:  Bacitracin and Neosporin.
Aricept 10 mg po q.d.
Zyprexa 25 mg po q.d.
Prevacid 30 mg po q.d.
Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
Vancomycin 500 mg q 24.
Flagyl 500 mg q 8 hours.
O2 saturation 100%.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is an 82 year-old Asian male with baseline dementia who is initially admitted after a prolonged cardiac/respiratory arrest.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with anoxic brain injury secondary to prolonged cardiac and respiratory arrest.
The was continued with supplemental oxygen with suctioning prn.
Because of worsening infiltrates the patient was continued on aspiration coverage with Levofloxacin/Flagyl.
Intravenous fluids were given to the patient to assist with the prerenal condition.
FEN:  The patient's tube feeds were continued initially.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was kept on a PPI and subcutaneous heparin.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical condition and treatment were discussed in depth regarding DNR/DNI, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, deep oropharyngeal suction, laboratory draws, chest x-rays and blood cultures.
[**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Location (un) **] stated that they did not want any intravenous fluids or any pressors.
It was decided by the family to discontinue all lines, intravenous fluids, with prn morphine given for comfort.
Regarding feedings, daughter felt that the nasogastric tube feedings "would not change anything" and they opted to have the nasogastric tube feeds discontinued as well.
A plan was made that the patient would be kept on supplemental oxygen for comfort, given prn morphine, oral suctioning as needed for comfort, as well as Scopolamine patches to decrease secretions.
From [**10-8**] through [**2196-10-12**] the patient was kept comfortable with oxygen, morphine and prn Tylenol.
Supplemental oxygen, Scopolamine patches to decrease secretions and morphine GTT were continued for comfort.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax status post subclavian line attempt.
Status post placement of bilateral chest tubes and removal of bilateral chest tubes.
Acute respiratory failure, requiring ventilator support while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
