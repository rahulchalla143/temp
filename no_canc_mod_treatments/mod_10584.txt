Admission Date:  [**2177-3-29**]       Discharge Date: [**2177-4-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-9-3**]       Sex:  M  Service: HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old right-handed male with history of hypertension (diagnosed five years ago), diabetes mellitus (since two years ago) and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin for one month now, who underwent elective cardioversion at [**Location (un) 511**] observed overnight and discharged around 4 p.m. the next day.
He went from the hospital to his orthopedist's office for routine follow-up appointment (he had undergone total knee replacement one month prior to admission).
He was also given Labetalol for elevated blood pressures to 192/109 mmHg.
He had a total knee replacement on [**2177-2-19**] and it was during his preoperative evaluation for this that the atrial fibrillation was noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old gentleman with a large left MCA infarct after 30 hours after elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 Neurology Service for further assessment and management of left MCA territory infarct.
Since he had a relatively large MCA territory infarct, his blood pressures were maintained between 140 to 160 mmHg and for blood pressures greater than 200/100 treatment is initiated with Lopressor 5 mg IV every six hours as needed.
He received isotonic fluids only (normal saline with 20 of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] as maintenance).
Mitral valve leaflets were structurally normal.
The patient, on admission, also had elevated creatinine kinase and troponin levels.
The third study of troponin on [**2177-3-31**] at 6 a.m. was 8.1 and creatinine phosphokinase MB was 1.0.
The patient was started on aspirin 325 mg daily and heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice daily for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, as well as pneumoboots.
The patient also had gastrointestinal prophylaxis with Ranitidine.
Because he failed swallow test, it was decided to have a gastrojejunostomy tube placed.
Under these circumstances, the patient underwent G-J tube placement and tolerated the procedure well.
Since the blood pressures could not be controlled with medical measures on the floor, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for vasopressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**] administration and control of his homostasis.
The patient was started on IV Protonix twice daily for better GI prophylaxis.
He also received vitamin K and fresh-frozen plasma.
Also, aspirin and Coumadin were held.
He was started on monitor and over the course of three days, edema and midline shift corrected and his neurological condition improved dramatically.
The patient improved dramatically with the help of physical therapy and he has been following commands involving the left arm and slowly regaining tonus on the right upper and lower extremities.
Pt's aspirin was restarted prior to discahrge.
Coumadin will need to be restarted in the future to decrease embolic risk.
pt was on vanco for MRSA in sputum and flagyl and levaquin for aspiration pneumonia during his stay.
Due to proably MI pt was started on betablockers and ace inhibitors need to be added as tolerated to his regimen.
