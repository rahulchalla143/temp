An NG tube has been placed and reaches far below the diaphragm.
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
Note: The findings are not inconsistent with the effects of gangcyclovir +/- viremia.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of two pieces of fragmented core biopsy with partial aspiration artifact measuring 0.6 cm in aggregate.
Erythroid precursors are relatively increased in number and show occasional dysplastic forms (asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular nuclear contours).
Myeloid elements are decreased and show full-spectrum maturation.
She was started on aspirin, atorvastatin, and plavix.
Her dobutamine was weaned off over several weeks, but she was unable to tolerate hemodialysis while off dobutamine.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had daily fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and negative cultures.
She was given steroids for a short period.
The patient eventually progressed to being weaned off the vent entirely, and was breathing comfortably on the trach mask.
Patient was ultimately started on dialysis in hopes that improvemento her uremia might improve her mental status.
Patient was given 2 units of cryoprecipitate for increasing DIC picture, and also started on heparin gtt without bolus for concern of TTP and increasing ischemia in lower extremities.
The patient progressed with hemodialysis for several weeks.
She was reaching the point where she was requiring fluid boluses after every hemodialysis session.
She was transfused cryoprecipitate and other blood products as needed.
Her coagulopathy was treated with IV heparin.
She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but continued to have daily fevers.
She was also given steroids for bronchospasm.
Her fevers resolved after discontinuation of steroids and antibiotics.
She developed C.Difficile colitis and was treated with flagyl and oral vancomycin.
She developed a CMV viremia and was treated with ganciclovir.
Her central lines were changed by interventional radiology on multiple occasions.
She was treated with IV fentanyl to treat her pain.
The family raised concerns that fentanyl administration was causing increased drowsiness of the patient, and requested that it be curtailed.
The patient was eventually transitioned to a fentanyl patch with the idea of weaning off her IV fentanyl administration.
Despite the fentanyl patch she was still requiring additional IV fentanyl.
Initially attributed to septic etiology; she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and placed on neosinephrine, vasopressin, and levophed.
Her neosinephrine and vasopressin was discontinued and she eventually remaned on levophed for blood pressure support.
Her levophed was discontinued and dobutamine was begun.
She remained in cardiogenic shock, dependent on dobutamine until [**9-18**].
Her dobutamine was weaned off and she was able to maintain a mean arterial pressure over 60.
She continued with periods of hypotension, most notable during or immediately after hemodialysis, and required fluid suport during these periods.
After one such hypotensive episode [**9-20**] she was not responsive to fluids and was restarted on levophed.
Her CVVH fluid was immediately changed to provide the maximum amount of bicarbonate.
She was bolused with a total of 15 amps of sodium bicarbonate over the next 10 hours, in addition to tromethamine which is a bicarbonate alternative.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem to cover for possible infection causing shock, in addition to coverage for clostridial species with flagyl, PO vancomycin, and clindamycin.
this would not be surprising in a patient with an underlying coagulopathy of uncertain etiology.
It was explained to her family that her current condition was not secondary to fentanyl administration, and that an acute unidentified event occured which is causing the patient's deterioration.
She was given epinephrine and atropine, and begun on neosinephrine and dopamine.
She was told that the cause of her impaired cardiac contractility was her underlying acidosis, and that nothing medically could be done to stop the acidosis from worsening.
She underwent a second PEA arrest at 5am, progressing to torsades de pointes.
again, she was told of her grave prognosis, and that her acidosis could not be alleviated.
