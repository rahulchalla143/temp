He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for Milrinone drip and for several days after the catheterization.
His medications had been adjusted in the past several weeks with resulting hypertension.
After 8 micrograms per kilogram of Dobutamine was 70%.
He was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on Dobutamine drip.
Hemodynamic monitoring, diuresis were continued and anatropic support.
He was also being considered for a cardiac transplant.

MEDICATIONS:  Coreg 12.5 mg po b.i.d., Zestril 5 mg po q.d., Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Tikosyn 0.25 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
He has a right arterial line and right vein sheath with a Swan in place.
Cardiovascular:  He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on a Dobutamine drip with very good cardiac indices.
He was fully diuresed to keep his PA diastolic pressure to 17 mmHg and his Dobutamine drip was fully weaned off.
Because his cardiac index remained above 2.20 and his systolic blood pressure was greater then 90 mmHg for two days a Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
The arterial line was discontinued and he was transferred to the floor on a 2 gram sodium diet with a 1.5 liter fluid restriction.
During his admission he was evaluated as stated for a cardiac transplant by the [**Hospital 4415**] congestive heart failure team, a carotid ultrasound, ankle brachial indices and 24 hour urine collection for creatinine clearance and protein were obtained for a preop workup.
Captopril was added for after load reduction and Digoxin was started to increase inotrophy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coreg 12.5 mg po b.i.d., Tikosyn 0.25 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg po q.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d., Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Captopril 6.25 mg po t.i.d.
