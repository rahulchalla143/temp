HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post questionable myocardial infarction five years ago; peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral, anterior tibial and left femoral popliteal bypass on [**10-19**] and [**10-26**] respectively here at [**Hospital1 69**].
She was transferred to a rehabilitation on [**2167-11-4**], where she was noted to become unresponsive at hemodialysis rehabilitation on Friday, [**2167-11-6**].
Mental status returned to baseline after CPR and the patient was taken to an outside hospital.
The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient was bolused with Lidocaine and noted to have no further ectopy on Lidocaine.
Status post left femoral popliteal bypass, [**2167-10-26**].
Status post right femoral proximal anterior tibial bypass, [**2167-10-19**], complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gangrene and Clostridium difficile colitis.
She is status post renal transplant in [**2160**] which failed and is back on hemodialysis.
MEDICATIONS AT REHABILITATION: Lanasalid 600 mg twice a day.
Flagyl 500 mg twice a day.
Levaquin 250 mg q.o.d.
Prednisone 7.5 q. day.
Neurontin 100 mg three times a day.
Nifedipine 30 q. day.
Lopressor 50 three times a day.
Lentis 12 units and regular insulin sliding scale.
ALLERGIES:  Vancomycin, Enalapril or ace inhibitors and Prazosin.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization during this admission for questionable ischemic cause of her ventricular tachycardia which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with her proximal right coronary artery diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 100% stenosed, proximal left anterior descending 30%, distal circumflex 100%, obtuse marginal one 70%, with an elevated LVEDP of 16.
However, no intervention was performed, secondary to difficulty of access for her right radial.
Her groin was not accessed secondary to her peripheral vascular disease and recent femoral-popliteal and proximal anterior tibial bypasses.
Therefore, the decision was made to start her on Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day for seven days and then 400 q. day for a month and then 200 mg q. day thereafter.
Additionally, the patient was initially placed on a Lidocaine drip which was discontinued on hospital day number one.
The patient again will be closely followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] and with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor, with daily transmissions.
The patient was continued on aspirin, a statin, and increasing doses of her beta blocker throughout this hospitalization.
Peripheral vascular disease:  The patient is status post left femoral popliteal bypass and right femoral proximal anterior tibial bypass.
Vascular surgery was following her throughout this hospitalization and recommended to continue her antibiotics, including Linezolid, Flagyl and Levofloxacin for two weeks.
Levofloxacin was discontinued and Ceftriaxone was started in place because of a risk of prolonged QT interval, predisposing her to more ventricular tachycardia.
Therefore, on discharge, the patient has another seven days of Linezolid, Flagyl and Keflex to finish.
Vascular surgery recommended not accessing any groin grafts at this time, due to recent bypass surgery.
Renal:  The patient is status post failed renal transplant on hemodialysis.
Additionally, Prednisone was continued 7.5 mg q. day for failed renal transplant.
The patient will be started on Erythropoietin three times a week only during her dialysis sessions.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus:  The patient was originally on Lentis 14 units q h.s.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was kept on Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile precautions throughout this hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg a day.
Lanasalid 600 mg every 12 hours for seven days.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Prednisone 7.5 mg p.o.
