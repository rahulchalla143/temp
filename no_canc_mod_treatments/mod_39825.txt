She was found to have a tension pneumothorax and a right sided chest tube was placed.
1 hour later, again became hypotensive and needed a central line placed and to be restarted on pressors.
She was started on vancomycin, ceftazadine, levofloxacin, and flagyl for broad coverage.
We proceeded with femoral arterial access (no palpable radial pulses), deep sedation, and pharmacologic paralysis.
She stabilized somewhat on pressure control ventilation and three pressors (levophed, neosyneprine, and vasopressin) but then nearly arrested again.
We proceeded with an epinephrine gtt and a trial of inhaled nitric oxide to attempt to unload the right ventricle.
