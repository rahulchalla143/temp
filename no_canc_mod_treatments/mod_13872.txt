She received thiamine to prevent against Wernicke's encephalopathy.
She was given folate and multivitamins.
She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam given concern for withdrawal.
Over the course of 48 hours she became more responsive and agitated on her ventilator requiring increased sedation.
She was changed to propofol as this would allow for rapid reversal and extubation.
Once extubated she was intermittently aggitated, which was treated initially with haldol and ativan and then transitioned to valium dosed for CIWA score>10.
She was also was started on a methadone taper which was brought down to 10mg IV q12h.

She refused sedation for further study.
She was aferbrile and had no headache or fever to suggest ongoing infectious processes, off of all antibiotics.
No acute intervention was felt indicated, and given the lack of clear evidence of an acute or subacute infarction, no anti-platelet therapy was indicated (and the patient's mother reported a history of allergy to aspirin).
She was evaluated by PT and OT, and rehabilitation hospital placement was planned.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented intubated and sedated.
She was subsequently ventilated per ARDSnet protocol with reduced tidal volumes.
It was felt that bronchospasm secondary to her asthma was also contributing and she was treated with aggressive albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments.
She was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pnuemonia and this was switched to zosyn and vancomycin for broader coverage.
Patient also has a history of asthma and was treated with inhaled bronchodilators.
She received a short course of IV steroids both for asthma exacerbation and for given possible septic shock (see below).
She was extubated after 15 days of intubation total and did well from a respiratory standpoint from this time forward.
She received aggressive IV hydration and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
She was started on stress dose steroids.
A central line was placed.
