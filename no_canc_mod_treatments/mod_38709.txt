He was continued on CMV to correct his respiratory acidosis.
He responded well to treatment and his vitals stabilized.
A perc trach was done on [**9-20**], and he was weaned off the ventilator over the next 2 weeks.
CV: After his initial CV shock, which required triple pressor therapy, he was weaned off these pressors.
Early attempts to wean sedation were met with hypertension & tachcardia, which have been controlled with beta blockade & hydralazine.
He will be discharged on oral labetalol & hydralazine.
Because of his severe smoke inhalation injuries, it was decided that he would require a tracheostomy to wean from the vent.
About HD 10, his lungs acutely decompensated, requiring additional vent assistance.
By the time of discharge, he is ventilating on his own via his tracheostomy.
A Passey Muir valve was placed on [**10-1**] and he is able to speak as well.
FEN/GI: After initial fluid resuscitation, Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was significantly volume overloaded (about 20 kg at one point).
He was diuresed with lasix & diamox to his baseline weight by the time of discharge.
In addition, his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected and his nutritional status was sustained with enteral tube feedings.
HEME: He had several episodes of anemia, which required multiple RBC transfusions.
MSK: His first degree burns on his lower back were treated with topical bacitracin.
TOXIC: The presenting carbon monoxide intoxication resolved after hyperbaric O2 treatment, dropping to 1% immediately.
A possible cyanide poisoning was empirically treated with thiocyannate.
