HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old man with a history of CAD status post CABG in [**2148**], admitted to [**Hospital6 3872**] on [**10-15**] with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, complaining of chest pain times six days prior to admission.
He was swanned and started on a Nitrocort drip, but that had to be stopped due to hypotension.
After that he was started on a dopamine drip which also was weaned off on the day of transfer.
All saphenous vein grafts were down.
He was evaluated in the emergency room at [**Hospital1 1444**] and then brought to the cardiac catheterization lab where an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease status post MI, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2148**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ETOH use.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg q.d., Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc q.i.d., digoxin 0.125 q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Ativan p.r.n., Haldol p.r.n., albuterol and Atrovent nebs p.r.n.
Groin on the right with intra-aortic balloon pump in place.
He was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting and on [**10-26**] patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times five as well as mitral valve repair.
In summary, patient had saphenous vein graft to LAD and diagonal #2 sequentially, saphenous vein graft to diagonal #1, saphenous vein graft to RPL and PDA sequentially as well as mitral annuloplasty with a #28 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.
He tolerated the surgery well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
Upon arrival in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit, patient was noted to have a cool, mottled, left foot which was the side that the intra-aortic balloon pump was on.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was removed from the left groin and replaced into the right groin and vascular surgery was consulted.
He underwent bronchoscopy for reexpansion of the right upper and middle lobes.
He remained chemically paralyzed and was on several cardioactive drugs including Levophed, milrinone, Pitressin in addition to cisatracurium, propofol, insulin and intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.
During that period of time we were able to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump and ultimately discontinue the intra-aortic balloon pump also on postoperative day three.
He was slowly weaned from his Levophed drip during that period of time.
He was also weaned from assist control mode to CPAP with pressure support on the ventilator.
By postoperative day five patient's pressure support had been weaned down to 5 with 5 of PEEP and 50%, however, he was not able to generate sufficient tidal volumes.
A chest tube was placed which immediately drained 700 cc and drained another 300 cc over the next several hours.
As stated previously, he was slowly weaned off his cardioactive drips with the exception of milrinone and Pitressin which remained on.
Over the next several days patient was successfully weaned off Pitressin and milrinone.
Following the wean of Pitressin he did have several episodes of nonsustained VT.
Following the successful wean of Pitressin, patient was started on low dose beta blockade.
Remains on amiodarone and Lopressor, heparin at 850 units per hour.
