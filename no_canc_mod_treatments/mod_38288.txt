He was left with an end ileostomy and Hartmans pouch.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed on [**2196-2-15**] and returned bilious fluid.
This was subsequently drained and the drain was left to gravity on [**2196-2-18**].
He was then transferred for further management to [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU overnight last night.
He has an NGT in place, a cholecystostomy tube in place and another drain which is likely in the 'abscess vs pseudocyst.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia, hypothyroid, DM type 2  Past Surgical History: Subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch ([**2196-1-20**])  Social History: portuguese speaking, moderate ETOH but none x 3 weeks, former smoker, no IVDU.
Separate subhepatic fluid collection does seem to be continuous with the peri-hepatic ascites, drain has pulled out into the subQ tissues.
- [**2-27**] CT Abd: Decreased size of hepatic fluid collection inferior to the left lobe, status post pigtail drain placement.
Cholecystostomy tube remains in standard position at the gallbladder fundus.
A 5-mm stone is seen in the distal left ureter, with a 4-mm stone seen in the distal right ureter.
Status post subtotal colectomy.
- [**3-5**] CT torso: small pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, subhepatic collection decreased in size 13.7 x 1.7 cm, plastic biliary stent in plastic, liver unremarkable, no transhepatic/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, spleen normal, adrenals normal, bilateral distal ureteral stones, 6.6 x 5.4 cm simple fluid which partially replaces pancreatic head -> stable, stable [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch wall thickening, no new acute intra-abdominal processes, decreased subhepatic fluid collection, cholecystostomy tube in good position - [**3-7**] Echo: Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional systolic function.
- [**3-8**] Cholangiogram: flow of contrast around but not through CBD stent, contrast flows into the duodenum - [**3-8**] CXR: Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion, pulmonary congestion - [**3-9**] Triple Phase CT: No new acute intra-abdominal process identified, with relatively stable appearance since examination from [**2196-3-5**].
Slightly decreased size of subhepatic fluid collection inferior to the left lobe with pigtail drain well positioned within the collection, no measuring 55 x 15mm, previously 59 x 19mm.
Cholecystostomy tube in standard position within a relatively [**Name2 (NI) **] gallbladder with no pericholecystic inflammatory change.
At the time of admission, the patient was intubated and requiring vasopressors.
On review of the patients records and imaging, he was determined to have multiple fluid collections including a subhepatic fluid collection, a pancreatic fluid collection and free fluid in his abdomen.
At the time of admission, the patient had a percutaneous cholecystostomy in place, and laboratory analysis of fluid from this drain was c/w biliary output; microbiology showed pan sensitive enterococcus in this fluid.
A second drain was in the epigastrium draining fluid c/w pancreatic fluid and was contained in the subhepatic collection.
Infectious disease was consulted for assistance with his antibiotic management.
On hospital day 1 the patient had a nasojejunal feeding tube placed and was started on tube feeds for nutritional support.
A repeat CT was obtained on [**2-20**] to evaluate the status of his fluid collections.
His pancreatic drain was accidentally DC'd during transport, and following this, the patients abdominal exam was unchanged.
The pancreaticobiliary service was consulted and on [**2-23**] recommended replacement of the subhepatic drain, which was successfully performed in interventional radiology.
Additionally, on [**2-23**] a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy was attempted, but was unable to be performed because of aberrant anatomy of the cricothyroid cartilage, and given this was not an emergency, it was determined we would follow his respiratory status.
Continued to be persistently hypotensive requiring prn albumin and IVF.
Pressors were weaned on [**2-27**], with adequate BP and uop.
His nutritional status was maintained with tube feedings and he was also evaluated by the Speech and Swallow service who recommended thin liquids, pureed solids, medication whole with water and 1:1 supervision with meals to assist with feeding and maintain standard aspiration precautions.
A stent was placed in the distal bile duct due to stenosis.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor in stable condition.
His feeding tube was removed for the procedure was replaced the next day in Radiology to assure it was post pyloric.
Plans are for eventual cyclic tube feedings once his appetite improves.
He was reintubated, was adequately resuscitated with LR and albumin and a diagnostic/ therapeutic paracentesis was performed with 3L drained, pan-cultured, peritoneal fluid cultures finally grew pseudomonas.
His Urine culture grew VRE, so he was switched to meropenem + cipro + micofungin + daptomycin and then adjusted to Daptomycin + Ceftaz + Micafungin on [**2196-3-7**].
On [**2196-3-8**] he was successfully extubated, pressors weaned off, tube feeds were started.
CVL replaced, a-line placed, foley replaced.
A paracentesis was done for 3L and sent for cultures, giving 25g 25% albumin.
On [**2196-3-12**] Ceftazadime + Micafungin were discontinued, standing Colistin and Doripenem started, ERCP consulted and feels unlikely to benefit from endoscopic drainage.
Borderline blood pressures throughout day with intermittent marginal urine output requiring Albumin boluses, patient was made DNR by family but OK to intubate.
On [**2196-3-13**] patient was started on standing lactulose for worsening mental status.
