Pericardial Fluid Cytology ([**2156-10-30**]): Rare atypical cells, cannot exclude reactive mesothelial cells.
On the morning of HD #1, the pts BP was downtrending 120->110->90s and his HR was uptrending 80s->100s.
At this point the pt was bolused 500cc NS and repeat TTE showed moderate pericardial effusion with brief RA diastolic collapse.
Given the pt's deteriorating VS, elective pericardiocentesis was performed and 270 cc of serosanguinous pericardial fluid was removed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient's drain was pulled on [**2156-10-31**] and serial echos were obtained that showed small residual echodense effusion with mild restrictive physiology.
He was started on colchicine and ibuprofen for anti inflammatory effects with symptomatic improvement.
The patient's hydralazine was held due to concern for hydralazine induced SLE that could account for effusion; after d/c his anti-histone Ab returned negative.
All autoimmune Ab labs were negatuve.
# Hypertension: While in the CCU, his antihypertensive medications were initially held except for his Carvedilol because of hypotension.
However, on transfer from the CCU back to the floor, the patient was restarted on amlodipine (dose increased to 10 mg) and lisinopril 20 mg daily.
Of note, his hydralazine was discontinued, as there was some concern about hydralazine induced SLE that could account for this effusion; anti-histone Ab returned negative.
# HTN - We continued his amlodipine, carvedilol and lisinporil and d/c'ed his hydralazine.
