She was pan-cultured, given one dose of levofloxacin, and started on bicarb gtt; she was eventually intubated after a trial of BiPap was not tolerated.
Post-intubation, she was hypotensive but responded to 7 liters of fluid resuscitation and Levophed.
In the MICU, she was on a ventilator and treated for COPD and broadly covered for pneumonia (levo/flagyl).
A hemodialysis catheter was placed in preparation for HD, which was never required.
Vancomycin was added.
She had copious purulent sputum suctioned early in the course and had episodes of hypoxia; she was placed on a Lasix drip with good response.
