In the ED he was empirically treated with vancomycin, cefepime and cipro.
Given that he was recently hospitalized and discharge he was treated for HCAP with Vanc/Cefepime.
While in the ICU he had a new oxygen requirement, hwoever this weaned off with IV abx and autodiuresis.
His urine in the ED was remarkable for nitrites, +180 RBCs and +180 WBCs.
His greatest risk for developing UTI was that he had a foley placed during his last hospitalization.
Blood cultures came back positive for Ecoli that was also sensitive to cefepime and therefore likely urosepticiemia.
#Urinary retention- patient was admitted with indwelling foley from his recent sugery leading to urinary retention.
This was removed during his hospitalization and he was voiding without difficulty at the time of discharge.
-Doxazosin was discontinued as he dropped his blood pressure while on this and was no longer having urinary retention at the time of discharge.
Patient with recent cholecystitis requiring perc chole tube in [**2124-6-4**].
Did not have a cholecystectomy at that time due to inflammation but is now s/p choleocystectomy after having surgery earlier this month.
In the ED his abdominal pain was treated with oxycodone.
He was dontinued home medications including his asa and statin.
His antihypertensives (metoprolol and lisiopril) were held at admission as he was hypotensive to normotensive in the ED.
His metoprolol was restarted on [**2124-9-19**] and switched from succinate to tartrate (12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]).
His Lisinopril was still held and will need to be restarted for cardioprotective effects once it is clear that he is tolerating his metoprolol -restart lisinopril 2.5 mg po qday if tolerating betablocker -consider switching metop tartrate back to succinate when discharged back home for convenience -continued aspirin and atorvastatin  # Emphysema: Stable.
He was continued on tiotropium during this admission.
# Hypertension: see above changes made -stopped doxazosin -switched -held lisinopril  # Hyperlipidemia: Stable.
Continued on home atorvastatin.
Continued on home omeprazole.
Continued on home ropinirole.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -continue cefepime IV through [**9-23**] -continue vancomycin IV through [**9-20**] -restart lisinopril 2.5mg po qday once blood pressure stable on metoprolol -Labs pending at the time of discharge (blood cultures from [**9-17**], [**9-18**], [**9-19**])- will be followed-up by inpatient team -> final results showed no growth  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
