-CABG: none, AAA repair -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -PACING/ICD: 3.
COPD: Not on home oxygen, does not recall being intubated for breathing problems Hypertension Nephrolithiasis Chronic back pain Alcohol abuse: Quit drinking 1-1.5 years ago, drank again for 1-2 weeks recently but has otherwise remained sober Anxiety   Social History: divorced - lives alone, unemployed (used to work as a painter and handyman).
[**8-2**] PCXR: Moderate to large, non-dependent right pleural effusion has increased following removal of right pleural drains.
Right pleural tissue, thoracoscopy (A-C): Dense fibrous tissue with chronic inflammation and reactive changes.
Right visceral pleural rind, thoracoscopy (D): Fibrovascular tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
Right visceral parietal pleural rind, thoracoscopy (E-G): Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
S/P diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, c/b pneumothorax requiring urgent placement of R pigtail catheter.
# Pleural Effusion/Pneumothorax A CT chest showed evidence of increase in size of the known R sided pneumothorax, and Interventional Pulmonology was consulted.
They performed a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis, unfortunately complicated by formation of a sizable pneumothorax.
He was successfully stabilized and breathing comfortably after relief of PTX with placement of pigtail catheter.
The pigtail was removed 4 days later, and the pt is currently stable on 4L NC.
In the MICU, continued home aspirin, simvastatin and metoprolol.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
Pt's measurement of EF 40% was on TEE performed intraop during AAA repair and aortic cross clamping.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
In the MICU, the pt was given lasix and the pt was diuresed 1700mL after which his R pleural effusion on CXR appeared slightly improved.

A Pulm consult obtained, and they recommended IP thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis.
Further interventional management may prove difficult if lung does not re-expand [**3-9**] cortication, may involve thoracic surgery input for VATS, especially in the setting of his history of asbestos exposure during construction work in his early youth.
The hypoxemia was not considered to be due to pneumonia and antibiotics were not started.
