Attempt to open the artery with angioplasty was unsuccessful.
On [**2158-4-14**], the patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein to the diagonal.
Postoperatively, she was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery room from the operating room in stable condition on intravenous Milrinone, Nipride and insulin drip.
On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilator and was extubated, however, over the course of the next two days, the patient was noted to have decreasing urine output, decreasing cardiac output and requirement for inotropic support.
The following day the patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory to evaluate coronary artery disease and patency of saphenous vein grafts due to her continued need for inotropic support.
Catheterization revealed low cardiac output, revealed a 90% occlusion of her saphenous vein to the diagonal coronary artery graft as well as 80% left anterior descending lesion.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at that time due to hemodynamic instability.
The patient was transported emergently to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where she underwent repair of the anastomosis.
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery recovery room with intravenous Milrinone and Dobutamine as well as an intra-aortic balloon pump for support.
On [**2158-4-21**], the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and discontinued as were her inotropics at that time.
However, the following 24 to 48 hours resulted in worsening cardiac function requiring intra-aortic balloon pump to be replaced and inotropic support to be resumed.
Her intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued a few days later.
On [**2158-4-24**], the patient went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for placement of a DDD permanent pacemaker due to continued need for pacemaker support and need to suppress atrial fibrillation which was resulting in bradycardic rhythms.
Over the next week or so, the patient remained on low dose Milrinone and Dobutamine.
She required continued ventilatory support.
On [**2158-5-10**], the patient had a PICC line for continued intravenous access placed due to finding of a positive catheter tip culture of her central line which revealed E. coli as well as Enterococcus which were pansensitive.
On [**2158-5-11**], the patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well and continued very slow wean from ventilator support over the next week or so.

Current tube feeding is Promote with Fiber at 50 ml per hour.
She also receives Collagenase Ointment with dressings applied to her sacral decubitus b.i.d.
and a dry sterile dressing to the left leg p.r.n.
The patient's operative staples were removed today and Steri-Strips applied.
She previously has had atrial fibrillation which has been suppressed with Procainamide and Digoxin.
She is presently on pressure support ventilation which was turned down from 12 yesterday to 10 today, 50% FIO2 which are given her spontaneous tidal volumes of between 300 and 400 milliliters.
The patient also has a left antecubital PICC line in place.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post stent to the graft with perforation and resultant emergency operation to repair the anastomosis.
Atrial fibrillation with treatment resulting in bradycardia requiring DDD permanent pacemaker placement.
