woman with history of T1/T2 paraplegia s/p MVA, frequent PNA/UTIs who presented with unresponsiveness and apnea requiring mechanical ventilation and was found to have a RLL pneumonia and proteus UTI, complicated by altered mental status associated with sedating medications as well as septic shock requiring pressors in the MICU.
#) RLL pneumonia: Per witness, patient reportedly vomited and then became lethargic/unresponsive after being administered 1.5 mg clonazepam, with desaturation to 80s on baseline 2L NC.
Patient requiried intubation and mechanical ventilation in the MICU this admission due to persistent unresponiveness and hypoxia on admission after transient response to narcan.
-Blood cultures from [**8-15**] and [**2150-8-18**] pending at time of discharge  #) Proteus mirabilis UTI: On [**2150-7-30**] she had cloudy urine and increased incontinence for which she was given a 7-day course of Bactrim for what was found to be a Klebsiella UTI.
UA on admission showed large leuks, neg nitrites and she was started on meropenem for empric [**Year (4 digits) 40097**] coverage, though [**Year (4 digits) **] eventually grew >100k CFU of meropenem-sensitive proteus mirabilis  #) Hypotension: She was normotensive in the ED but became hypotensive to SBPs in the 80s while in the MICU soon after admission.
#) AMS: Per witness, patient became lethargic/unresponsive after dinner after an episode of vomiting following administration of PO clonazepam.
AMS likely due to over-sedation with medications given timing of medication administration, Utox positive for methadone, as well as bradypnea and transient response to narcan on presentation.
-Careful monitoring of polypharamcy with multiple sedating medications -Adherence to narcotics agreement and appointment at pain clinic   CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD/ Chronic Hypercarbia: On 2L O2 at home.
Was on 3L NC at time of discharge likely secondary to recent pneumonia.
Home albuterol and ipratroprium were continued.
Currently on lidocaine patches, baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin.
-Rescheduled pain clinic appointment (missed during admission)  #)Urinary Retention: Patient usually self-catheterizes at home but foley catheter used during admission extending past period needed for UOP monitoring because of patient request.
# Constipation: Continued on home polyethylene glycol  # Anxiety/Depression: Continued on citalopram, clonazepam and trazodone restarted when mental status improved.
# Hypothyroidism:  Continued levothyroxine  # Hypercholesterolemia: Continued simvastatin  # Hep C: Stable, no current treatment, no LFT abnormalities this admission.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole  Transitional issues for this patient: -Pain management -Sterile straight cath teaching for patient given recurrent UTIs -Consider outpatient speech and swallow evaluation given suspicion for recurrent aspiration pneumonias  Medications on Admission: 1. albuterol NEB Q6hr PRN dyspnea 2. baclofen 20 mg Qam, 10 mg 4PM, 20 mg Qpm 3. citalopram 40 mg PO DAILY 4. ipratropium Q6hr PRN dyspnea 5. levothyroxine 112 mcg PO DAILY 6. clonazepam 1 mg PO TID PRN (takes 2 mg QHS) 7. lidocaine patch - feet and shoulder blade 8. omeprazole 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] 9. oxybutynin chloride 10 mg Qam, 5 mg 4pm, 10mg QHS 10.Polyethylene Glycol 17g QD 11.gabapentin 600 mg TID 12.simvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY 13.sucralfate 1 gram TID 14.trazodone 100 mg QHS PRN anxiety.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure participating in your care during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
You were admitted for increased oxygen requirement and decreased responsiveness, and a breathing tube was placed for a machine to help you breathe.
You received antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) for eight days during your stay in the intensive care unit and your breathing improved and the breathing tube was removed.
