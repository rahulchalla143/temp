PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass grafting x1 on [**2196-10-31**].
His medications preoperatively were aspirin, atenolol, calcium, iron, Niaspan, probenecid, colchicine, vitamin E, Lasix, and Lupron.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient underwent the above procedure on [**2196-10-31**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
He had a prolonged operative procedure owing to the difficulty to the case.
He required large amounts of fluid during his long cardiopulmonary bypass run.
At the end of the case, attempts to initially wean the patient from bypass were successful, and the patient manifested right heart failure despite multiple maneuvers and medications, a right ventricular assist device needed to be placed emergently to facilitate weaning from extracorporal bypass.
The patient required massive fluid resuscitation and pressor support as well as ventilatory support during this time period.
Over the intervening 12 hours, the patient was requiring full hemodynamic and respiratory support that was reasonably stable.
At this point on postoperative day two, a valid attempt at massive diuresis was attempted in order to wean from right heart assist.
Lasix was started as an infusion as well as a bolus form with excellent response, with urine output in the 3-500 range.
Despite making the patient negative, there were increasing difficulties with ventilation and oxygenation.
Maneuvers including chemical paralysis and optimizing the ventilator in regards to oxygenation proved progressively insufficient.
Although his hypoxia was reasonable, his hemodynamic status was progressively worse despite drips of Levophed, Epinephrine, milrinone, and vasopressin in addition to replacing his clotting factors as well as blood.
After every viable option was entertained and tried, the patient was given comfort measures and expired within a few minutes.
