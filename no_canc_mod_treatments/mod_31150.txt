Bradycardia was responsive to atropine and the hypotension improved as the bradycardia improved.
Patient was also found to be hyponatremic which was corrected with diuresis and hypertonic saline.
A pneumonia was identified on chest xray and treated for HCAP with cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin.
Renal was consulted and recommended diuresis along with hypertonic saline which was administered with frequent Na+ checks.
She was started on HCAP coverage with vanc/cefepime for an 8 day course with addition of azithromycin for atypical coverage.
We did our best to reorient her and eliminate tethering tubes and drains.
Of note, her mental status made her an increased aspiration risk so she was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended pureed solids and nectar thick liquids.
She was initially hypotensive in the ED when bradycardic therefore her amlodipine and ACE-I had been held on admission.
Patient was restarted on her home blood pressure medications when her hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] resolved.
Once glucose levels improved, she was started back on her home insulin regimen.
Cr improved with diuresis back to baseline.
