Admission Date:  [**2133-5-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-7-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2115**], hypertension and elevated cholesterol who presented on [**2133-5-28**] with burning epigastric pain.
The patient was on dopamine transiently, which was thought to secondary to a gastrointestinal infection.
She was anemic to 24 and received multiple units of packed red blood cells.
She also began to spike some temperatures on [**2133-6-1**], despite being on antibiotics and continued to have fevers up until her transfer to the floor.
The patient was covered with ceftriaxone and clindamycin initially for a multilobar vent associated pneumonia.
The patient was ultimately transitioned from clindamycin to Flagyl in part because there was concern that the patient might have Clostridium difficile colitis.
Flagyl was ultimately discontinued after the patient had three negative Clostridium difficile cultures.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft performed at [**Hospital1 2025**] 15 years ago with a diagonal to LAD graft and saphenous vein graft to PDA graft.
Question history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  HOME MEDICATIONS (to be confirmed by her primary care physician): 1.
Aspirin 2.
Atenolol 3.
Lipitor 4.
Hydrochlorothiazide 5.
Regular insulin sliding scale 2.
Protonix 40 mg intravenous q 24 hours 3.
Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenous q 24 hours 4.
Flagyl 500 mg intravenous q 8 hours 6.
Lopressor 10 mg intravenous q6h 7.
Nitroglycerin drip for which the patient was currently being weaned off.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient complained of left wrist pain which later resolved after re-siting of the patient's peripheral intravenous.
In response to this culture result, the patient's Foley catheter was discontinued and replaced.
Sputum cultures were positive for Serratia, sensitive to ceftriaxone for which the patient received a 14 day course of antibiotics.
The patient was temporarily on anaerobic coverage for question of aspiration pneumonia, as well as for question of Clostridium difficile colitis.
The patient gradually defervesced on antibiotics and her respiratory status improved substantially to the point where she was saturating 95% on room air by the time of discharge.
Regarding the question of Clostridium difficile, the patient had three negative cultures and was taken off Flagyl following her transfer to the floor.
The patient's only other infectious issue was a question of a sinusitis, given recurrent fevers on antibiotics and the patient's history of having a nasogastric tube in place while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
Given that the patient was essentially afebrile following her transfer to the floor, she was taken off of Flagyl and this etiology was not further pursued.
We did hesitate to place an additional nasogastric tube for feeding purposes given this result.
The patient received TPN for nutrition while in the Intensive Care Unit.
As she was unable to take po's, she relied on intravenous Lopressor and hydralazine for blood pressure control.
After she was started back on po's, she was put on po Lopressor, po hydralazine and po Vasotec.
She has an intact ejection fraction with some posterobasal wall motion abnormality as noted on recent cardiac echocardiogram.
NUTRITION:  The patient relied on TPN while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She failed a swallowing study upon her return to the floor and was continued on TPN for several days.
She was subsequently taken off of TPN and her diet gradually advanced.
HEMATOLOGICAL:  The patient was anemic requiring transfusion in the setting of her Intensive Care Unit presentation.
Coronary artery disease with a history of coronary artery bypass grafts x2 2.

Hydralazine 25 mg po tid 4.
Lopressor 25 mg po bid 5.
