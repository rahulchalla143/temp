The NG tube is seen coursing through the esophagus into a low lying stomach.
IMPRESSION: NG tube in stomach around area of pylorus.
An NG tube terminates with its tip out of view below the diaphragm.
A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
We recommend withdrawing the PICC approximately 4 cm for placement at the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction.
Pacemaker leads ending in standard positions, in the right atrium and right ventricle, tip of the NG tube is beyond the frame of the radiograph.
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] late in the AM of [**7-5**] and she was not given thrombolytic therapy as she was outside the treatment time window.
NEURO: For her bilateral thalamic infarcts, she was started on a heparin infusion to anticoagulate her for prevention of further thromboembolism.
We started her on Modafinil 100mg qAM to help improve her level of awareness and subsequently added methylphenidate 5mg qAm and qNOON.
With the addition of these stimulant medications she is able to maintain alertness during the day.
Coumadin was started on [**7-16**].
Heparin gtt is to be stopped once INR is therapeutic.
She was initially treated with Bactrim for Proteus but when she continued to have low grade fevers and leukocytosis, she was re-cultured on [**7-12**].
These urine cultures are growing 2 types of GNR, pan-sensitive Proteus and enterococcus, sensitivites still pending.
She was switched to Ceftriaxone on [**2167-7-12**] with a plan to treat for 7 days (end date [**2167-7-19**]).
CARDS: After initially allowing BP to autoregulate, we restarted home meds Lostartan 100mg daily and Verapamil 80mg q8h (total 240 daily home does); additionally we added HCTZ 25 mg daily.
GI: The patient has had somnolence and decreased cough and gag reflex that has required an NGT, and then a PEG for tube feeds and medication delivery.
Please continue tube feeds until the patient is able to take in enough nutrition by mouth.
ENDO: For her diabetes type 2, the patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
Pravastatin 40mg po daily was continued.

The most likely cause of this was a clot from your heart given your history of atrial fibrillation with a subtherapeutic warfarin level.
We started you on two medicines to help your alertness, modafinial and methylphenidate.
This has continued to improve over time but we had to insert a feeding tube in the interim.
We have maintained you on a heparin gtt for anticoagulation during your stay.
