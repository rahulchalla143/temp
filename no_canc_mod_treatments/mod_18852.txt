ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old woman with history of aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis secondary to history of rheumatic fever who was admitted electively preop for a valve replacement.
Preoperatively, her aortic valve area was 1.07 and her mitral valve area was 0.88.
When she presented preoperatively, she was afebrile with a pulse in the 70s, blood pressure 140s and her O2 saturation was 98% on room air.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted, the patient was admitted on [**2201-5-24**] and subsequently taken to the operating room on [**2201-5-25**] where she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm Magna Supraannular CE pericardial valve and a mitral valve replacement with a 25 mm Mosaic porcine valve.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 147 minutes and cross clamp time was 122 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken immediately postoperatively to the Cardiac Surgery intensive care unit.
We began aggressive diuresis on postoperative day 1 and we were able to remove the chest tubes by postoperative day 3.
Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started empirically on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
After her cultures had come negative, it was felt that this was not secondary to any sort of infectious process and therefore antibiotics were stopped.
By postoperative day 5, the patient was doing quite well with physical therapy.
She was saturating 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
It was felt that as she was doing well that she could be discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
