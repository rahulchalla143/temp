Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 4.
The patient was started on nitroglycerin, heparin drips and transferred for cardiac catheterization.
Inderal 80 mg q.d.
Cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 35-40%, right dominant coronary artery system with severe left main and three-vessel disease.
There were also findings consistent with an acute inferolateral myocardial infarction and the patient was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.
In the coronary care unit he was maintained on his balloon pump.
Cardiovascular surgery was consulted and it was felt that the patient would benefit from revascularization surgery.
On [**2151-2-15**], the patient was taken to the operating room for coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 with intra-aortic balloon pump placed preoperatively.
The anastomoses were as follows: Left internal mammary artery to the diagonal artery, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery, PL and OM.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well without significant complication.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned from a 1:1 rate to a 1:2 rate.
The patient was ultimately extubated on postoperative day number one and the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued at that time as well.
The patient did require some Neo-Synephrine blood pressure support.
He received an amiodarone bolus intravenously followed by an amiodarone drip as well as Lopressor intravenous.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also made the decision that he would not need any further operative management.
The remainder of his postoperative course was concerned largely with physical therapy and diuresis.
Vital signs were 98.1, heart rate 77, blood pressure 128/63, respiratory rate 18, 100% on two liters nasal cannula.
Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg q.d.
Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
Clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d.
Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tablets p.o.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Primidone 50 mg b.i.d.
The patient is to continue incentive spirometry, ambulation and physical therapy at home.
The patient should follow up with cardiology in [**12-31**] weeks' time and address the need for continuing diuresis as well as adjustment of cardiac medications at that time.
