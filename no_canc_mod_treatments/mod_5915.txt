He was seen here at [**Hospital3 **] in [**2131**] for routine health maintenance and was also advised at that time to stop abusing cocaine and alcohol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Other than cocaine and alcohol use, he has no known hypertension and he denies any other history except for some occasional easy bruising on the arms and chest.
MEDICATIONS:  He does not take any medications other than Tylenol and aspirin p.r.n.
He was on a Nitroprusside drip at this time.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to Neuro Medicine.
His blood pressures were well controlled on a Nipride drip which was slowly weaned.
His blood pressure medicines were changed to Captopril 62.5 mg p.o.
three times a day and he was started on metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
He was discharged on [**10-27**] in good condition to home with physical therapy and occupational therapy scheduled for home visits.
He was discharged with a diagnosis of a right basal ganglia putamen bleed.
