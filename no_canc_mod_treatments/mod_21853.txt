Prenatal course notable for donor egg IVF with three implanted eggs with subsequent twinning of one embryo resulting in quadruplet pregnancy.
Mother was admitted at 24 weeks for cervical shortening and treated with betamethasone.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Respiratory:  [**Known lastname **] was initially in moderate respiratory distress and was intubated and received three doses of Surfactant.
Because of continued difficulties in ventilating, he was switched to high frequency oscillatory ventilation and remained on this mode of ventilation until day of life seven at which time he was successfully transitioned to conventional ventilation.
He was gradually weaned on settings and extubated to CPAP on day of life #19 and then weaned to nasal cannula by day of life 20.
At the time of this dictation, he was breathing comfortably in nasal cannula from 13-25 cc of 100% fraction inspired oxygen.
Since extubation, he is maintained on caffeine for apnea of prematurity, which has been fairly mild from [**1-2**] apneic and bradycardic episodes per day.
He received his first course of indomethacin within his first three days of life, but the murmur returned on day of life six and he was treated with a second course of indomethacin starting on day of life six.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 43285**] birth weight was 1125 grams.
[**Known lastname **] was initially kept NPO because of the PDA, and received parenteral nutrition until approximately two weeks of age.
He was started on enteral feeds on day of life 10, and advanced without difficulty to his current intake of 150 cc/kg/day of mother's milk or premature Enfamil supplemented to 30 kilocalories/ounce with ProMod by gavage feeding.
He also received supplemental vitamin E and ferrous sulfate.
GI:  [**Known lastname **] required phototherapy for direct hyperbilirubinemia, with peak bilirubin 8.5 on day of life 12, and most recent bilirubin 6.4 on [**10-16**].
He has been off phototherapy since [**10-14**].
[**Known lastname **] appears to have some mild spittiness, but has not required treatment with Reglan or Zantac.
His initial hematocrit on admission was 46, and he has been transfused once with packed red blood cells on day of life #4 for a hematocrit of 29.
Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname **] was initially on a 48 hour sepsis evaluation for prematurity and respiratory distress, and sepsis evaluation was extended to 72 hours because of his initial significant respiratory distress.
He had another negative sepsis evaluation on Vancomycin and gentamicin from day of life seven to eight, initiated for increased respiratory distress and reopening of his patent ductus arteriosus.
Neurology:  When [**Known lastname **] was on high frequency oscillatory ventilation, he required two doses of phenobarbital in his first several days of life, as well as intermittent Fentanyl prn to maintain sedation for the high frequency oscillatory ventilation.
He is due for a repeat one month head ultrasound.
Routine healthcare maintenance:  The first newborn state screen sent on [**9-30**] was not acceptable.
[**Known lastname **] has not yet received his first hepatitis B immunization, which will be due at one month of age.
Status post patent ductus arteriosus treated with two courses of Indocin.
