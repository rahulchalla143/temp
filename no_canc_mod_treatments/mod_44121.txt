He was placed on telemetry, and was kept NPO with intravenous administration of linezolid, metronidazole, levofloxacin, and fluconazole.
On HD 2, he underwent CT-guided placement of a pigtail catheter in his left lower abdominal quadrant and drainage of 50 cc from the recurrent iliopsoas abscess; cultures subsequently revealed pseudomonas, coagulase negative staph aureus, and probable enterococcus.
Cardiology work-up on HD 6 revealed an evolving apical MI.
At this time, the patient was deemed an inappropriate surgical candidate and his surgery was cancelled.
He was transferred off the SICU on HD 6 with continued drainage of fluid from his pigtail catheter.
The drain was repositioned by IR on HD 8, and upsized on HD 12 to expedite drainage.
The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on HD 14 with a PICC line for long-term IV antibiotic administration.
