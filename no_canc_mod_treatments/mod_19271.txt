Now only a thin and progressively FLAIR-hyperintense subdural collection, layering over only the most anterior aspect of the left frontal convexity; this measures only 3.5 mm in maximal thickness and demonstrates no mass effect on the subjacent brain; there is only at most 1 mm rightward shift of normally-midline structures.
Treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin x 5 days.
Treated infections as above.
Felt that this was not of significance and recommended MRI head.
MRI head performed while in MICU - resolving contusion and area of restricted diffusion in R pareital lobe.. Meningitis was entertained as possibility but felt less likely given that per signficant other, the patient has been at this mental status since discharge.
No surgical intervention at this time.
Initially the patient was very lethargic and confused and this was determined to be due to haldol dosing.
He was allowed to wash out of this medication and his mental status slowly improved although he did have episodes of waxing and waining alertness.
An LP was considered but the patient continued to improve as the neuroleptic medications were weaned off and he became much more alert and oriented.
He finished a course of azithromycin and his toxic/metabolic/infectious workup was unrevealing.
