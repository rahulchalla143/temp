Right-sided central venous hemodialysis catheter is again seen, terminating in the right atrium.

[**2115-4-24**] CHEST (PA & LAT): Right-sided central venous hemodialysis catheter is again seen, terminating in the right atrium.
Patient is status post median sternotomy.
Patient is status post median sternotomy.
Right-sided hemodialysis catheter has been removed.
[**2115-5-3**] Tunneled HD Line Placement: Successful uncomplicated placement of a 15.5F 27-cm tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis with tip in the right atrium.
Right sided temporary HD catheter was removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o male with DM II, COPD, and CKD stage V, started on hemodialysis approximately 2.5 weeks prior to admission, who presented with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia/ HD catheter infection.
Given recent HD line placement there was concern for sepsis from bacteremia.
He received Vancomycin and Cefepime in the ED for possible HCAP.
Although a urinary source was considered less likely, he was changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem (Meropenem due to prior UTI sensitivities).
ID was consulted early in his hospitalization and recommended HD line removal with a line holiday.
TEE for further evaluation was not pursued, as the decision was made to treat with vancomycin IV for 6 weeks empirically.
A temporary femoral line was placed into the right groin for better access.
On the medicine floor, the patient continued vancomycin dosed with HD.
Femoral line was removed and a RIJ temporary dialysis line was placed on [**4-29**], while awaiting permanent line, which was placed on [**5-3**].
The patient tolerated these procedures well.
The patient will need to continue vancomycin IV for 6 weeks, dosed with dialysis.
# CKD stage V: Patient was started on dialysis approximately 2.5 weeks prior to presentation.
Dialysis was not performed during his ICU stay due to removal of the HD line and tenuous blood pressures.
He initially required fluid boluses for hypotension but his fluid balance was subsequently managed with Lasix boluses.
A temporary HD line was placed on [**2115-4-29**] as noted above.
Patient required several units of FFP and doses of vitamin K to reverse INR enough for placement of a permanent HD catheter, which was done on [**2115-5-3**].
He ultimately received 4 units pRBCs for repeated hematocrits of high 20s-30, but also for hemodynamic support to avoid using crystalloid fluids exclusively.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD on 2L home O2: Patient presented on 2L of oxygen with saturations in the high 90s.
He continued to receive his home Fluticasone, Albuterol and Tiotropium throughout his stay.
# Diabetes mellitus II: He was managed on a Humalog ISS during his ICU stay.
# HTN/dCHF/right heart failure (EF>55%): His Metoprolol and Aspirin 81 mg were continued initially.
Metoprolol was held for hypotension but was restarted prior to floor transfer.
# Depression/Bipolar Disorder/Schizoaffective disorder: Continued divalproex, oxcarbasezpine, risperdone .
# Pulmonary Embolism on Coumadin: He presented with INR of 4.0 and Coumadin was held.
He recieved 4 units of FFP for femoral line placement in the unit.
For permanent HD line placement, desired INR was less than 1.5.
The patient received several units of FFP and doses of vitamin K while on the floor prior to this procedure.
On discharge his latest INR is 1.1, he will be continued on home regimen of 3mg daily, with INR to be checked by rehab and titrated for INR goal of [**2-8**].
# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA: He was continued on BiPap throughout his ICU stay and on the floor at night, and intermittently as needed for respiratory distress.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Vancomycin IV to continue for 6 weeks, dosed with HD.
Patient should have labs checked weekly while on this antibiotic: CBC with differential, BUN/Cr, AST/ALT, Alk Phos, Total bili, ESR/CRP, vancomycin level.
# Would consider further Psychiatric evaluation, and adjustment of medications to simplify regimen.
