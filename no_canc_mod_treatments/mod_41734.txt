He has known COPD and was reportedly not compliant with his medications and still smoking.
His DNR/DNI status was reversed in the ED at [**Hospital1 2177**] and he was intubated (initial ABG 7.13/96/234).
CXR showed left basilar PTX and urgent chest tube was placed by CT surgery.
A SC incision into the left chest wall ("blow hole") was done by CT surgery which resulted in slow improvement in his SC emphysema.
He continued to have persistent air leaks and 2nd chest tube was placed on [**6-10**].
He is now being transferred for placement of intrabronchial valve by IP service.
During his course at [**Hospital1 2177**], he completed a course of steroids and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate and he was started on vanco/cefepime for HCAP, although f/u xray showed chronic changes and antibiotics were stopped.
He was made NPO and started on IV fluids.
Currently, he reports pain at the site of his chest tubes and pain in his epigastrium.
He does know that he does not want anyone to attempt to place another NG tube.

Given that this is the admission radiograph and that the morphologic feature is complex, CT is recommended to obtain a better assessment of the complex morphology and a valid baseline for further followups.
On admission to the outside hospital he was in hypercarbic respiratory distress and required intubation (temporarily reversed his DNI status at that time).
He was ultimately extubated and required bipap while there.
He completed a course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation at the OSH.
On admission here he was originally on 6L of NC and was stable.
In the ICU he was placed on a shovel mask, received morphine and had an NG tube placed.
IP evaluated the patient and switched his Chest tubes to water seal on admission to the ICU and then pulled them on HD#3.
He complained of multiple episodes of air hunger and was treated with escalating doses of morphine.
#Small bowel obstruction- The patient had a known SBO at the OSH and had refused NG tube placement there as well as on admission here.
When he was transferred to the ICU he agreed to a NG tube placement and reported feeling better.
There was audible air that came out of the NG tube on placement.
Her reported right shoulder and arm pain after the fall, no fracture on right shoulder plain film and no fracture on pelvic fx.
He did not have any major apparent neurological sequelae of this subdural (pupils remained reactive and equal, moving all extremities) and no repeat imaging was obtained after his GOC were changed to [**Date Range 3225**].
