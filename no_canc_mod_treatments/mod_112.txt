During her hospitalization, she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic valve replacement.
Her postoperative course was complicated by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal failure.
Please see discharge summary from that hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after her cardiac surgery.
The patient was readmitted to the hospital on [**2195-6-6**] due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite being on intravenous antibiotics.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft as previously noted with an aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.
Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
Uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
She was on a ventilator via tracheostomy.
Patient was tachycardic with a regular, rate, and rhythm.
Patient was also noted to have Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she had been placed on intravenous Flagyl.
In the operating room the patient underwent a limited sternal wound debridement and drainage of some fluids at the inferior portion of her wound.
Postoperatively, the patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, where she has had problems with intermittent hypotension requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip.
Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube which was previously placed during her previous admission, which she had been tolerating well.
She was still on the ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.
Patient received a few units of packed red blood cells over the course of the next few days due to drifting hematocrit.
The patient was maintained on 3x a week hemodialysis treatments on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and has been tolerating those treatments well.
Patient's pressure support was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those ventilator settings.
Patient also required bedside repositioning of her jejunostomy tube which was done in the Intensive Care Unit successful with no sequelae from that patient.
Has been tolerating her tube feeds, has remained on minimal ventilator supports, and she is ready to be transferred to rehabilitation facility to progress with Physical [**Hospital 966**] rehabilitation, and ultimate weaning from a ventilator.
On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.
Stool on [**6-10**] is positive for Clostridium difficile.
