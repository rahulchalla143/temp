Plastic surgery saw the patient and determined that her facial fractures were nonoperative and she will follow up with them in clinic and sinus precautions while she was hospitalized.
Her pain was difficult to manage because of the suboxone but became manageable after the medication cleared her system.
Added PO oxycodone to pain regimen.
Her pain was frequently assessed and she remained on the Dilaudid PCA initially and was transitioned to an oral narcotic pain regimen subsequently, with which she reported adequate pain relief.
She was placed on telemetry with continuous O2 monitoring given her rib fractures.
However, difficulty remained weaning supplemental oxygen and a chest xray was obtained  on [**1-9**] which showed a very small right pleural effusion  (old) and new, small loculated, right pleural or extrapleural fluid.
She was tolerating a regular diet and started on a bowel regimen given her use of narcotics.
A foley catheter was placed on admission and removed on [**1-5**], at which time she voided without difficulty.
She was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy who initially recommended discharge to an extended care facility for further rehabilitation when medically stable.
Her blood sugars were monitored routinely and managed with her home metformin and a sliding scale of regular insulin as needed.
It was determined that her facial fractures did not require operative intervention at that time.
The patient was given a sling for comfort.
Opthlomology was consulted when the patient was in the ICU for her eye fracture who deferred to the plastic surgery team for acute management and recommended routine annual exams for DM/HTN.
