He denies dysuria, abdominal pain, HA, ST, chest pain, hematochezia, melena, myaligias.

Given the possibility of pneumonia, he was started on levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, which was discontinued on the equivalent of day [**7-6**] of the course (uncertainty based on changing renal function at the time of discontinuation).
Vancomycin was started as well for this, but was discontinued given that patient lives at home and has not had a lot of exposure to the healthcare system.
Vancomycin was re-introduced for concern for septic joint (see below).
As his renal function improved he had an episode of afib with RVR to the 150s, with hypotension (70s over palp), for which he was triggered, given IV metoprolol and IV fluids; this eventually resolved, and he was then continued on 80 mg sotalol [**Hospital1 **] thereafter, and had no further episodes of RVR.
He was started on enoxaparin (Lovenox) on [**2124-12-17**].
He was then started on warfarin on [**2124-12-18**].
He responded well to the fluids given during first day of admission.
Because of our initial concern for septic joint we treated first with Ancef, and then when his white cell count continued to rise and his joints appeared to be more inflamed, we switched to vancomycin with concern for MRSA.
However, he remained afebrile and joint cultures were negative, as were joint fluid gram stains; we thus discontinued antibiotics for the joint.
We consulted the [**Numeric Identifier 1083**] diseases service which recommended this discontinuation of antibiotics followed by close observation.
We treated pain with colchicine, celebrex, lidocaine patches, tylenol, ultram, and ultimately steroids to reduce inflammation.
We had been holding colchicine in the setting of ARF but restarted it.
With a climbing white count we were concerned for C. diff and had him on flagyl for several days; however, C. diff toxin assays were negative twice and he was taken off precautions and we did not continue flagyl.
With hydration and holding his lasix, his creatinine declined to 1.5 before rising slightly again before discharge once a small dose of lasix (40 mg daily compared to his 160 mg daily home dose) was restarted.
He will need to have his lasix dose titrated back up as his gout flare and renal function improve again, as he has consistently had lower extremity edema that has responded well to lasix in the past.
We restarted ASA 81 daily, as he does take this as an outpatient.
We monitored i/o, had him on a low Na diet, and checked several chest x-rays during the course of his admission to look for signs of worsening failure.
We held lasix as above but he did not have clinical indications of heart failure with us.
# Diabetes: Patient is on glipizide at home.
Given poor PO intake and his renal failure, his PO [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was held in the MICU, replaced by insulin sliding scale; and given changing circumstances of high white blood count, changing intake, and changing renal function, we continued his insulin scale while on the medicine floor.
# Parkinson's disease: We continued home medications of carbidopa.
# Coagulopathy: He received some vitamin K in the ED.
Coumadin was held.
His INR drifted down over the admission; as above, enoxaparin (Lovenox) was started on [**12-17**] and warfarin was restarted on [**12-18**].
# COPD: He had wheezes on exam fairly frequently which improved with nebulizers and beta-agonist inhalers (levalbuterol to minimize cardiac effect).
He is not on an inhaler at home, but his daughters report this is partly because when he has been prescribed them he has been unable or unwilling to learn how to use them properly.
# BPH: He had been on Flomax at home.
# PPx: Anticoagulated (high INR), PPI .

We held your lasix and reduced its dose on discharge because of concern about your kidneys.
Your allopurinol was stopped because of concern about your kidneys.
Finally, your 81 mg of aspirin was held because of the prednisone you are taking; it should be restarted once you are finished with the prednisone.
We have thus far avoided opiates for pain control because of concern about hospital delirium, which his family reports he has had in the past.
