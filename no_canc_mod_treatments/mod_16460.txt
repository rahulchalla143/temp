Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A straight tip .035in guidewire was placed.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A large 14 mm stone and large amount of sludge were extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon.
Infusion port catheter ends in the right atrium.
No free fluid within the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum to suggest hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with afib/TIA on coumadin, systolic heart failure (unknown EF), COPD on 3L NC, DM2, gastroparesis and gastritis who was for planned biliary stent removal with course complicated by cholangitis/sepsis.
1) Cholangitis/E coli sepsis: The patient was admitted for scheduled stent removal and had stent and stone removal with sphincterotomy prior to being admitted to the medical floor.
Soon after presenation to the medical procedure post procedure developed hypotension requiring pressor support and was transferred to the MICU.
Presumed source of sepsis was her biliary tree given interventions so she was empirically covered with IV piperacillin-tazobactam.
She improved with antibiotic therapy and was weaned off pressors to be transferred back to the medical floor on [**2110-3-7**].
When final blood cultures grew two species of E coli both sensitive to ceftriaxone she was transitioned to this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as well as metronidazole to cover any occult anerobes given source.
She should continue her antibiotics until [**2110-3-20**].
Discussion regarding removing her port-a-cath was carried out between IV team, ID, and medicine and given that this was not likely the source of her transient bacteremia and gram negatives less likely to seed port immediate removal was not pursued.
ULTIMATELY HER PORT DOES SERVE AS A POTENTIAL PORTAL OF INFECTION HOWEVER AND REMOVAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ELECTIVELY AFTER SHE COMPLETES HER CURRENT COURSE OF THERAPY.
2) Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had gastrointestinal blood loss in the context of sphinctertomy and received three units of pRBC's in the MICU with improvement of her hematocrit, which was stable thereafter.
Risks and benefits of indwelling foley should be continued with the patient and her caretakers.
Pt had ERCP and passage of large scope for this procedure essentially rules out significant peptic stricture (and none was seen).
Coumadin and aspirin were held for 7 days post sphincterotomy and should both be restarted on [**3-12**].
Her digoxin was continued as was atenolol.
She was continued on tiotroprium and bronchodilators.
She was continued on atenolol and digoxin.
Her lasix was held in house but should be restarted at discharge.
She was not on ACEi but starting this was deferred given complicated medical situation and lack of acute issues with her dCHF.
She was continued on amlodipine and atenolol.
10) Neuropathy/ Chronic lower extremity pain: She was continued on her gabapentin and oxycodone.
Transitional Issues: -She should have further conversations about risk and benefits of removal of chronic foley and port a cath as these both increase risks of infection.
-She should have PT to work on increasing functionality and ability to ambulate independently  -She should complete here course of antibiotics for cholangitis.
