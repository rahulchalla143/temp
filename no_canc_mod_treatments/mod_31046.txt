Sphincterotomy was not performed in the setting of elevated INR.
Instead, a 7 cm x 10 French plastic biliary stent was placed for decompression.
Transvenous pacer lead is continuous from the left pectoral pacemaker to floor of the right ventricle.
[**3-22**] IR report: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.
Preprocedure timeout confirmed the identity of the patient and the procedure to be performed.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 81 year-old male with a history of afib, CAD, ICM (?EF) who presents with fevers, RUQ, hypotension, and dilated CBD [**3-16**] to obstructing stone from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for ERCP.
He improved with IVF and IV unasyn.
His BP soon stabilized after aggressive hydration.
A sphincterotomy was not performed due to elevated INR.
In setting of acute cholangitis, A 7cm by 10FR Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary plastic stent was placed successfully for decompression.
AFter the plastic stent was placed he initially felt symptomatically improved and demonstrated quick normalization of his LFTs.
IV unasyn was switched to PO augmentin.
He however he spiked to 101 on this regimen and cipro was added for added coverage.
He continued to have low-grade temperatures on this regimen, so the antibiotics were broadened to zosyn and vancomycin.
In discussion with ERCP, a CT abd/pelvis was pursued on [**3-22**] given ongoing low-grade temperatures.
Upon discussion with surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and ERCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99779**], a percutaneous chole tube placement for GB decompression was felt to be the best option rather than CCY, given the extent of inflammation and the [**Hospital 228**] medical co-morbidities (though no active medical issues).
He underwent placement of the tube by IR the evening on [**3-22**] without any complications.
He was continued on zosyn and vancomycin, and had good output through the tube.
He will follow-up with surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**4-15**] for removal of the tube and discussion regarding CCY.
In addition, he will need a repeat ERCP in 1 month for stent removal, sphincterotomy and stone extaction, when off of coumadin.
#  Atrial fibrillation - the patient was continued on metoprolol for rate control.
The coumadin was discontinued post-ERCP and re-started, but discontinued again in preparation for the perc chole tube on [**3-22**].
He was restarted on coumadin on [**3-24**] per discussion with IR; this will need to be titrated up slowly to achieve goal INR [**3-17**].
His primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20948**], was notified of the current admission and agreed that bridging with heparin wasnot required as patient had not had a prior embolic event.
He developed acute on chronic sCHF [**3-16**] IVF resuscitation in the ICU; this was treated with IV lasix with good response.
His lisinopril was increased from 5 mg to 20 mg for good blood pressure control, as he continued to be hypertensive on his usual regimen (SBPs 160s).
He was continued on unasyn and cipro for it (on it anyway for acute cholangitis).
He was also treated with atrovent/albuterol for treatment of possible COPD component.
