He presented initially to [**Hospital3 **] and was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for definitive therapy for his evolving myocardial infarction.
In the Cardiac Catheter Laboratory, a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stenting of the proximal and then right coronary artery was performed using a 3.0 X 18 mm Bx Velocity heparin-coated stent.
He presented to the Medicine Service with the potential for going for a cardiac surgery later in the admission.
Status post colostomy for rectal cancer approximately ten years ago.
Aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.71 cm2 with gradient 49 mmHg.
ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Vitamin C, aspirin prn.
There is a focal 80% stenosis just after the first obtuse marginal artery as well.
After the marginal artery, there is more diffuse disease in the mid right coronary artery with subtotal 99% occlusion.
The mean aortic gradient was found to be 49 mmHg, calculated in aortic valve area, using the Gorlin equation with 0.7 cm2, consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
The patient was started on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, Aggrastat, and nitroglycerin while on the Medicine Service.
Surgery was initially planned, coronary artery bypass graft of three vessels, and aortic valve replacement.
Surgery was initially planned for [**2180-11-28**], but as the patient had been on Plavix prior to this, the surgery had to be delayed until [**2180-12-1**].
The patient went to the Operating Room on [**2180-12-1**], where he had an aortic valve replacement, a CE #23 valve.
He had saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.
The patient remained intubated at this time.
On postoperative day one, [**12-2**], the patient was extubated and was on a nitroglycerin and Nipride drip.
By postoperative day two, the patient was only on the nitroglycerin drip and was tolerating po after being extubated.
The patient's Foley catheter was removed and he was transferred to the Patient Care Floor.
On postoperative day four, the patient's chest tube and pacing wires were removed.
For this, he was treated by increasing his Lopressor to 50 mg po bid and he was loaded with amiodarone.
Otherwise, the patient's course has been uncomplicated and he was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day six.
Status post aortic valve replacement with a CE valve.
Coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Postoperative bleeding, status post re-exploration and closure.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 50 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po q twelve hours times one week, potassium chloride 20 mEq po q day times one week, Colace 100 mg po bid while on Percocet, aspirin 325 mg po q day, regular insulin sliding scale q AC and HS: for blood sugar 150 to 200 - 3 units subcutaneous insulin, blood sugar 201 to 250 - 6 units subcutaneous insulin, blood sugar 251 to 300 - 9 units subcutaneous insulin, Norvasc 5.0 mg po q day, Captopril 6.25 mg po tid, amiodarone 400 mg po tid until [**12-13**], then 400 mg po bid until [**12-20**], then 400 mg po q day, Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets po q four to six hours prn pain, ibuprofen 400 mg po q six hours prn pain.
