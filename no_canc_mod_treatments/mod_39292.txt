This EEG may reflect underlying severe brain pathology or still may be the effect of medication or the hypothermia protocol.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 70 woman with COPD, CAD, HLD and tracheostomy transfered from [**Hospital3 **] after PEA arrest requiring >60 minutes of CPR and defibrillation x 2 no admitted to the MICU who was placed on cooling protocol but did not regain corneal or gag reflexes.
Her EEG was isoelectric suggestive of cortical brain death.
She was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for empric coverage.
