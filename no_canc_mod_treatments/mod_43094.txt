Toxicology was called and suggested calcium gluconate 2g given that the patient is on a beta blocker, as well as an amp of bicarb to see if his QRS narrows (as the patient is on a TCA).
Given that the patient had a low sodium and elevated K a dose of decadron was given for possibility of adrenal insufficiency.
