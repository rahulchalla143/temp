HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 38-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, type 1 diabetes, hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, multiple digit amputations, who initially presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] with a right thalamus/basal ganglia intracranial bleed status post VP shunt with subsequent apneic/hypoxic respiratory failure with PEG and trach placement who continues to have intermittent fevers, has diffuse lymphadenopathy, chronically elevated alkaline phosphatase and persistent right atrial thrombus.
She has had an extensive infectious workup and is being treated currently with vancomycin dose by level greater than 15 for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus line tip infection in the setting of a known right atrial thrombus.
Length of treatment will be determined from the time the line tip was pulled which was [**2116-6-16**].
She will continue on vancomycin by level until [**2116-8-6**].
Additionally, she has a remote history of traveling to the West Indies and is being treated empirically with doxycycline 100 mg p.o.
She will continue on doxycycline until she is seen in Infectious Disease Clinic, time and date determined below.
For her intermittent fevers she should be continued on antibiotics, vancomycin by level and doxycycline and report if her temperature spikes greater than 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Respiratory failure:  The patient was initially trached for her apneic/hypoxic respiratory failure during her Intensive Care Unit stay for her intracranial bleed.
She had marked improvement during the later part of her stay with removal of the tracheostomy tube.
Of note, the patient has a tendency to become hypotensive following dialysis treatments which respond effectively to intravenous fluid boluses.
Hypercalcemia:  The patient has known hypercalcemia in the setting of a relatively normal PTH with normal vitamin B25 levels with vitamin B125 levels pending.
The patient was treated with pamidronate 30 mg IV times one on [**2116-7-7**].
Outpatient ________ will be followed on send-out labs to determine a cause for her hypercalcemia.
The outpatient primary care physician will need to discuss with Neurosurgery the possibility of reintroducing anticoagulation for this known right atrial clot.
Additionally, the length of the antibiotic treatment associated with intermittent fevers in terms of the vancomycin therapy is due to a presumed endovascular infection in the setting of a positive MRSA line tip with a known right atrial thrombus.
with a corresponding Humalog sliding scale.
Currently she is on Lentis 13 units q. hs.
with a Humalog sliding scale as we attempt to reintroduce a p.o.
The patient will be continued on the diabetic and renal diet.
At the present time her blood pressures are well controlled with hemodialysis and fluid removal.
She is receiving vitamin C and zinc for nutritional supplementation.

Currently, the patient is off tube feeds though she has a functioning G-tube in place.
Prophylaxis:  The patient should be continued on heparin subcu for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis as well as proton pump inhibitor.
She has been treated with Ativan 1-2 mg IV q.
Additionally, she was started on Celexa 20 mg p.o.
She is currently receiving aspirin 81 mg p.o.
