No tobacco, but husband smokes 3 ppd  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T 99.0 HR 96 BP 85/48 (in ED: low of SBP 70--> 96/60) RR 15 97% 4L GEN: Pale appearing, NAD HEENT: OP clear, anicteric, MMM, PERRL Neck: Supple CV: RRR, no m/r/g PUL: bibasilar crackles, o/w clear ABD: Soft, NT, midline scar, ileostomy in RLQ recently emptied without stool or blood present.
Using sterile technique, general anesthesia, and local anesthesia, an access was established to the right internal jugular vein using ultrasonographic guidance and micropuncture site.
A 5-French modified C2 catheter was then advanced through the sheath over the wire with its tip engaged into the hepatic vein under fluoroscopic guidance.
The catheter was then advanced distally and venogram was performed.
The catheter was then exchanged for a balloon occlusion catheter over the wire and CO2 portogram was performed after inflation of the balloon.
The portogram confirmed the position of the balloon catheter within the right hepatic vein.
A TIPS puncture site was then advanced through the sheath into the hepatic vein and the branch of the right portal vein was entered after several attempts with the needle.
A guide wire was then advanced into the main portal vein and a multihole straight catheter was then placed over the wire with the tip in the main portal vein.
The catheter and the sheath were then withdrawn into the IVC and then removed.
By the request of anesthesiologist, a triple-lumen central line was placed before the procedure through left internal jugular vein.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement with reduction of a pressure gradient between portal vein and right atrium at approximately 2 mmHg after the TIPS placed.
Patent TIPS stent with expected hepatopetal directional flow in the main portal vein.
Elevated velocities in the mid portion of the TIPS stent over 200 cm per second.
There is a TIPS stent in the posterior branch of the right portal vein and right hepatic vein.
Doppler interrogation along the stent shows velocity of 107 cm per second in the proximal portion, 116 to 160 cm per second in the mid portion and 129 cm per second in the distal portion.
Patent TIPS stent with appropriate velocities ranging from 107 to 160 cm per second.
A left subclavian central venous catheter has been placed and the tip is located at the level of the proximal superior vena cava.
Interim placement of left subclavian central venous catheter and TIPS stent.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 y/o female with UC s/p colectomy and colostomy 20 yrs ago and recently diagnosed cirrhosis after a variceal bleed in early [**Month (only) 547**] requiring ICU stay and a total of 11 units of PRBCs.
On [**5-20**], she had the sutures removed from her stoma.
Vitamin K was given for INR 1.5.
She had an ileoscopy on [**5-26**], which found friable tissue at the ioeostomy site exteriorly, with nonbleeding periileostomy varices.
She was started on octreotide, and maintained on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **].
Per GI and liver staff, IR consulted for TIPS procedure and possible embolization of prominent ileocolic vein.
On [**5-27**], she had a 1L BRB bleed via ostomy requiring an additional 2U PRBC and tamponade against liver via foley.
She had a successful TIPS procedure done on [**5-27**], and fall in pressure gradient to 2mmHg.
L IJ placed by IR on [**5-27**] at time of TIPS as well.
She was started on prophylactic Rifaximin on [**5-28**].
She states that her legs improved somewhat, but remained erythematous and edematous at time of admission, and she was switched to vancomycin on [**5-25**].
She was started on Zosyn, and transiently required O2 by 75% FT, again, the day after TIPS.
She was placed transiently on neosynephrine for MAPs in 50s, which was weaned off.
Her AM [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test was abnormal (10.0 to 9.0 to 9.9), and was started on hydrocort and fludrocort.
She has been receiving finger sticks and being maintained on a diabetic diet for blood sugars elevated to 190s, possibly in setting of infection vs steroids.
Once called out to the floor, a PA/Lateral CXR was done to better characterize opacities seen on AP film, which were read as more consistent with atelectasis.
She was diligent about using incentive spirometry, and her O2 was quickly weaned to off.
As Ms. [**Known lastname **] was doing extremely well clinically and afebrile, her Zosyn and vancomycin were d/c'ed.
Primary team believed that episode of fever/rigors was [**2-26**] transient bacteremia in setting of TIPS, and transiently increased O2 requirement was [**2-26**] atelectasis, which resolved with use of incentive spirometry.
