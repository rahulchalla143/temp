Vitals showed a pulse of 96, blood pressure of 156/96, respiratory rate of 28-32, and an O2 saturation of 100% after nebulizer treatment.

During the next couple days, series attempts were made at weaning off the nebulizer treatments and spacing them out, however, the O2 saturations dropped and the patient continued to complain of shortness of breath.
