Hospital Course:  #Neuro: The patient was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the NeuroICU.
Given his history of poorly controlled hypertension, recorded blood pressures as high as 220/120, and the location of the hemorrhage, it was thought most likely that this represented a hypertensive hemorrhage.
SQ heparin was restarted on [**3-17**] and can be continued for DVT prophylaxis.
He was intermittently placed on a labetalol drip, however due to bradycardia this periodically had to be stopped, and he was eventually brought under control with hydralazine instead.
His home doses of metoprolol and lisinopril were increased, initially with good control.
However, given slightly worsening renal failure, he was transitioned from lisinopril to amlodipine and also started on PO hydralazine.
Goal SBP remains less than 160, and he can be treated with additional IV hydralazine as needed, however blood pressures have been well controlled today (104/49-155/67) without need for IV medication.
A lipid panel showed significant elevation in triglycerides, but with normal cholesterol, so his simvastatin was increased and he was also started on fish oil.
On [**3-20**] he was noted to have continued respiratory failure, with significant difficulty clearing his secretions, and on [**3-21**] the decision was made to place a trach and PEG.
On [**3-20**] CXR showed significant aspiration pneumonia for which he was started on vanc/cipro/cefepime to continue through [**3-29**].
He should have repeat daily troughs drawn, with a goal trough of 15-20, and vancomycin should be restarted once his levels are back in therapeutic range.
The lisinopril was stopped, and diuresis was minimized, with slight improvement.
