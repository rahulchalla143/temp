4 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success.
The pt's ASA, BB, ACEi and Lasix were held.
She remained HD stable with SBP in 110s and HR in 70s after initial 2L NS bolus.
She was transiently on a PPI drip and was transfused a total of 4U with HCT coming up to 27 from 18.
GI did not feel that the pt was still actively bleeding, thus no urgent scope was performed in the MICU.
She was switched to PPI IV bid and started on clears which she tolerated well.
The pt was transferred to the medicine floor for further management.
This was injected with epinephrine and clipped; GI indicated that a risk of rebleeding remained.
The pt was treated with a Protonix gtt for >48 hours and then transitioned to PO therapy [**Hospital1 **].
The pt's antihypertensives were held in this setting and her blood pressure was well-controlled with only diltiazem.
The pt's home aspirin was held.
# A-fib/SVT: At the time of admission, the pt was taking ASA 325 [**Hospital1 **] for her prior history of PAF; this was stopped at the time of admission.
All of these episodes were asymptomatic for her and she remained HD stable.
Although the pt's HR responded well to re-initiation of her beta blocker, this did not suppress her SVT, and thus her beta blocker was transitioned to PO diltiazem.
A chest x-ray after several days without Lasix did not demonstrate any evidence of failure.
As above, the pt's ACEi, beta blocker and lasix were held at admission; ***these may need to be restarted in the future.
Her ASA was held throughout her hospital stay as described above.
When her HR was elevated, the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse ST depressions which resolved with better HR control, thus continued aspirin therapy, likely at 325 mg daily, would be ideal.
