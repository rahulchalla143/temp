She arrived in NAD with VSS and prominent right-sided weakness, as reported.
My NIHSS on arrival was 14 (see below for NIHSS and detailed Neurologic exam).
We got a NCHCT here, which confirmed absence of hemorrhage; CTA head/neck revealed near-total obstuction of the distal M1 on the Left, as well as collateral filling of several distal MCA-distribution vessels; CTP showed increased MTT throughout the Left MCA distribution, with a mismatched CBV result (mildly decreased volume in the Left MCA distribution, in contrast to the dramatically increased MTT; CBF was moderately decreased).
A stat NCHCT after the procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass effect into the R-LV; difficult to tell at this stage how much is contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs. how much is hemorrhagic conversion related to the procedure in the setting of INR 1.9.
