Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 98.7, 67, 112/64, 18, 99 RA GEN: AxOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, OP without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, jvd 6 cm, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: mild epigastric tenderness, pigtail drain in place RUQ draining bilious fluid EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
Four injections of Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] (total 10cc) were applied to the area surrounding this ulceration for hemostasis.
This resulted in the formation of a large adherent clot that could not be removed, and prevented adequate visualization for further endoscopic therapy.
Impression: A single cratered ulcer with a visible vessel on the gastric side of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis (endoclip) Previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with identification of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis Two superficial non-bleeding ulcers in the jejunum A single superficial ulcer on the jejunal side of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis, with active bleeding (injection) Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum  EGD: [**2142-5-24**] Previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with identification of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis All previously-identified ulcers examined closely Single clean-based and non-bleeding ulcer on the jejunal side of the anastamosis, with surrounding inflammation and friability Three small non-bleeding superficial ulcers on the jejunal side of the anastamosis Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum IR guided angio of Stomach: [**2142-5-22**]  INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with upper GI bleed.
Endoscopy revealing bleeding ulcers on both sides of the gastrojejunostomy site which could not be controlled by epinephrine injection and clips.
Moderate conscious sedation was provided by administering 200 mcg of fentanyl and 3.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 1 hour 45 minutes, during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by a trained radiological nurse.
Local 1% buffered lidocaine was also used at the arterial access site.
Superselective arteriograms of proper hepatic, gastroduodenal and left gastric arteries.
Under fluoroscopy and palpatory guidance, the right common femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single wall needle.
5 French glide Cobra catheter was used to catheterize the superior mesenteric artery and an arteriogram was performed and recorded digitally.
The C2 glide catheter was then used to cannulate the celiac artery,and artreiogram was redcorded, followed by selective catheterization of the splenic artrey to form [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13363**] loop to engage the left gastric artreey.
More selective arteriography was then performed after advancing the catheter over a wire into the  gastroduodenal artery.
The left gastric artery was difficult to securley cannulate using the 5 French glide catheter and hence it was exchanged for a 5 French SOS catheter using which we easily cannulated the left gastric artery.
A slurry of Gelfoam following coil embolization was also performed.
The microcatheter was then removed and hand injection was performed through the SOS catheter which demonstrated no flow in the vessels that supply the stomach through the left gastric artery.
The catheter and the sheath were removed, and firm pressure held at the right groin until complete hemostasis was achieved.
Superior mesenteric arteriogram is of suboptimal quality related to both patient breathing and bowel motion and catheter recoil.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated empirical coil and Gelfoam embolization of the left gastric artery for known bleeding ulcers at gastrojejunostomy site.
Status post left gastric artery embolization.
6mm nodule and 8 mm groundglass opacity of the lingula; comparisons can be made to prior exams if they become available.
Cholecystectomy changes, with moderate intrahepatic and common biliary ductal dilation.
Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and left gastric artery embolization.
The pigtail drain is in adequate position centrally within this area of abnormal liver parenchyma.
The patient was made NPO, 2 large bore IVs were placed, and protonix gtt started.
The patient was then given 2 units of PRBCs and sent down to IR where the left gastric artery was empirically embolized.
Bariatric surgery was consulted at this point, and she was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] service.
She was continued on a high dose PPI and sucralfate.
An abdominal/pelvic CT scan did reveal lobulated hypoattenuating non-enhancing abnormality within the lateral segment of the left liver with associated moderate left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and proximal common duct dilation to 1 cm.
At this time interventional radiology placed a drainage catheter into the fluid collection wich drained 100cc of bilious fluid.
A follow-up CT scan was done to evaulate the hepatic fluid collection after the drainage catheter had been removed.
A new drainage catheter was then placed which also drained bilious fluid.
She was transitioned to PO antibiotics per consultation with the Infectious disease team and antibiotics were then DC'd upon discharge from the hospital due to negative drain cultures.
On [**2142-5-31**] an US of the liver was obtained at the request of the hepatobiliary surgical team which showed a decrease in size of the hepatic fluid collection and the pigtail catheter well placed in the center of the collection.
Pt was discharged with pigtail catheter in place with instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her PCP as well as her bariatric surgeons from [**Hospital1 **].
# SLE, Sjogren's, Fibromyalgia: Initially all home medications were held but when the patient started taking PO she was restarted on her home medications.
