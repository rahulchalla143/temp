Imaging: [**4-30**]: Non-contrast Head CT: No intracranial bleed.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
There is no pleural effusion  Brief Hospital Course: 41yo man with h/o HIV, depression with suicidal ideation, cocaine and EtOH abuse who presented with TCA overdose and was intubated in the ER and transferred to the MICU.
# SSRI overdose: treatment was same as TCA overdose above.
# Leukocytosis: This was present on admission likely in the setting of aspiration of charcoal, as charcoal was suctioned from NG tube on arrival to MICU as well as in the ED.
No antibiotics were given as this was felt to be secondary to pneumonitis versus possible stress leukemoid reaction and resolved by the day after admission.
# respiratory failure/intubation: Intubated was for airway protection.
aspiration but patient asymptomatic, satting well on RA and afebrile so no antibiotics were felt to be warranted.
Self extubated on [**5-1**] and subsequently weaned off oxygen quickly to room air.
He was given PRN ativan for anxiety but only while in the ICU and not for long term treatment.
Of note, the patient's PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 24159**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **] call from patient from the ICU and he left a voicemail stating that he wanted a prescription for an anxiety and if he did not get the prescription "it was just going to happen again".
We agreed that this would be only a temporary treatment while he was in the ICU given his anxiety and feelings that he needed to smoke.
# Smoking: Patient was provided with nicotine patch.
