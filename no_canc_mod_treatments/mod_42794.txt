She was started on empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl but her pneumonia worsened, leading to eventual intubation [**2128-1-23**], to [**2128-1-24**].
Antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin/Zosyn 0/15/04, but unfortunately she was reintubated [**2128-1-27**], to [**2128-2-1**], secondary to mucous plugging.
Intensive Care Unit course was notable for ischemic acute tubular necrosis, fluid response of hypotension, culture negative, guaiac positive stools requiring two units packed red blood cells and PEJ placement [**2128-2-4**].

Chest x-ray showed a left sided effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, and endotracheal tube in place.
She did not have signs of infection and she was not initially started on antibiotics.
The patient was started on pressure support as soon as she arrived in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the day of admission, [**2128-2-24**], and was soon extubated when she did very well on her pressure support trial.
Over the next two days, the patient required frequent suctioning and chest physical therapy secondary to lack of a cough due to her severe multiple sclerosis.
Given the patient's recent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent mucous plugging after extubation secondary to thick secretions and her inability to clear them, the patient was offered a tracheostomy and the patient and her husband agreed to this.
On [**2128-2-26**], a tracheostomy was placed by the interventional pulmonology team without complications.
A regular size tracheostomy was put in place.
The day following the tracheostomy placement while the patient was being turned, she desaturated and some blood clots were suctioned out of the tracheostomy.
The patient remained on 50% face mask with 99 to 100% saturation during the rest of her hospitalization.
Lidocaine and Epinephrine was injected around her tracheostomy site where there was some oozing and this resolved over the course of the next twelve hours.
The patient was also continued on her nebulizers and Beconase Nasal Spray.
The patient was never with chest pain.
A Baby Aspirin was started.
A beta blocker was not started secondary to low blood pressure.
In discussion with the patient's husband, the patient had never had a magnetic resonance scan in the past to diagnose her, lumbar puncture, and had had very little treatment or workup for her disease.
In addition, the patient's daughter had been recently diagnosed with magnetic resonance scan and it was thought that this patient's disease was not multiple sclerosis given it was atypical.
