The patient has had a left hip replacement and revision in the past, is now here with a left acetabular shell loosening.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2097**], status post aortic valve replacement in [**2097**], status post TAH BSO, history of DVT, history of increased INR on Coumadin with a history of a left leg hematoma, history of lymph node cancer in the abdomen, diverticulitis, falls, possible hypertension.
The patient was on anticoagulation due to her aortic valve replacement, thus was waiting for her coagulation factors to be more optimal for operative management of her hip.
The patient at that point in time also had an NG tube that elicited approximately 200 cc of coffee ground emesis that cleared with 200 cc of saline.
She is currently status post an embolization by interventional radiology for the fall.
She is currently status post embolization, interventional radiology.
Upon discharge from hospital patient's orthopedic issues still were not treated due to patient's need for continued rehabilitation secondary to hypovolemic shock.
The patient was resuscitated with crystalloid, 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of FFP.
The patient was started on Dopamine 4 mcg/kg/minute while patient was fluid resuscitated.
While patient was fluid resuscitated, the patient required less pressors and ultimately was weaned off pressors completely.
The patient has remained hemodynamically stable after pressors were taken off and patient was adequately fluid resuscitated.
The patient's blood pressures during the last week of [**Month/Year (2) 12876**] were in the 140's to 160's/80's to 90's, not requiring fluid resuscitation, not requiring pressors for majority of [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
2) Aortic valve replacement - patient was on Coumadin with a questionable dose of 4 mg upon presentation to the hospital.
The patient has been on an IV Heparin drip since her presentation to the hospital.
On [**11-7**] the patient was switched from Heparin drip to Lovenox 30 mg subcu [**Hospital1 **].
This should continue for one week and then patient should be reevaluated to whether patient can be started back on Coumadin with a question of 4 mg dose.
With questions of Coumadin dose, please call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] which was patient's nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) 5001**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**].
The patient was intubated and then weaned appropriately and extubated on [**2104-10-31**].
On [**11-7**] it was found that patient's oxygen status was greater than 92% without face tent, thus oxygen was weaned appropriately.
Patient's Zestril was held at that point in time.
As patient lives adequately fluid resuscitated and improved during the hospital stay, patient's urine output became adequate and patient's creatinine began to creep downward slowly and on hospital day #16, [**11-7**], patient's creatinine reached a nadir of 1.6.
Patient was started on Captopril on [**11-1**], a low dose of 6.25, po tid which was increased slowly to 25 mg po tid to help patient's renal function.
The patient was discharged to home on Captopril 25 mg po tid.
The patient was empirically started on Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and Vancomycin on [**10-30**] for a question of bowel sepsis vs pneumonia seen as an infiltrate on chest x-ray.
The patient's Flagyl and Vancomycin were discontinued on [**11-2**] at first respectively.
Patient was continued on a 14 day course of Ceftriaxone for a question of pneumonia.
There is a question of sinusitis with NG tube placement and tube feeds.
The patient's central line tip was sent for culture which is still pending upon discharge.
An NG tube was placed.
Tube feeds were started on [**2104-10-30**].
The patient was started on tube feeds with a goal of 40 cc per hour and held for residuals of greater than 100 cc per hour.
Nutrition continued to follow patient's course and patient's tube feeds were changed to Ultracal 4% to a goal of 55 cc per hour as tolerated.
Speech therapy began to see patient on [**11-4**] and on [**11-4**] and [**11-5**] patient was felt to be an aspiration risk and the NG tube and tube feeds were continued.
Video swallowing study was done on [**11-7**] which showed that the patient still had risk of aspiration, thus speech pathology recommended that patient continue on tube feeds with NG tube for one week and then retry with an other video swallow to see whether patient is less of an aspiration risk.
Ultimately 200 cc boluses done q 4 through NG tube was done and patient's sodium normalized.
A Foley catheter was placed.
An NG tube was placed upon MICU admission.
An NG tube needs to be placed upon patient's admission to rehab for tube feeds to continue.
Patient's right subclavian line was pulled and two peripheral IV's are now present for access.
Status post fall with acetabular head dislocation, complicated by lumbar artery bleed, status post embolization for hypovolemic shock.
Patient should continue on tube feeds, the Ultracal at 55 cc per hour to be held for residuals of greater than 100 cc.
Patient should continue on medications on page 1 and should be evaluated for Coumadin use, change from Lovenox in approximately one week.
