CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 54-year-old Asian male with a history of adenocarcinoma of the right lung (status post lung resection) and history of pulmonary tuberculosis as a teenager who presented to the hospital on [**2133-5-29**] complaining of a several day history of shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on exertion, and bilateral lower extremity edema; who was ultimately discharged on [**2133-6-19**].
During his hospital stay he was tapped with thoracentesis three times with relief of symptoms; however, the patient had repeated fluid reaccumulation.
The patient was treated for a pneumonia early in his hospital course with azithromycin for seven days with no apparent change.
The thoracentesis procedures demonstrated a mixed picture.
Prior to admission, the Interventional Pulmonology Clinic placed a Pleur-X drain which will need to be repeatedly drained to help improve shortness of breath.
From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient was discharged home on oxygen, Lovenox for seven days (covering his internal jugular deep venous thrombosis with no evidence of pulmonary embolism) with followup to be coordinated with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (his pulmonologist and oncologist) following completion of the positron emission tomography scan.
He was treated with an ACE inhibitor which he initially responded to quite well with his protein decreasing from approximately 8 grams per day down to 2.5 grams per day on lisinopril 20.
In addition, the patient was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin.
The patient was initiated on his Coumadin treatment today for treatment of his internal jugular deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was to follow up in the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic on Monday and was to continue Lovenox treatment until he is therapeutic.
The patient's hypertension was treated with Lopressor 50 mg three times per day, hydralazine initially which was then discontinued prior to discharge in order to improve compliance, and lisinopril 20 mg which was ultimately increased to 30 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line in his right arm which prevented blood pressure measurements.
Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth three times per day  2.
Iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth twice per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Dulcolax 5 mg by mouth twice per day as needed (for constipation).

The patient was to follow up at [**Company 5620**] in two to three days (located at [**Street Address(2) 104133**] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 350**]) to assess Coumadin level, anemia, and kidney function.
The patient was to follow up with Interventional Pulmonology Clinic as needed for Pleur-X drain management.
Teaching for Lovenox injections.
