The patient at home had oxygen saturations in the 70s on 3.5 liters by nasal cannula and right-sided chest pain.
He received Lasix and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
Despite aggressive treatment with Prednisone and antibiotics, the patient was aggressively diuresed for congestive heart failure component, continued on his Prednisone and treated with Nitroglycerin drip, Captopril, Digoxin, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone and Morphine.
After extensive conversations with the family it was agreed that the patient would be taken home for home hospice care given the likely terminal prognosis and progression of his interstitial lung disease and congestive heart failure, and the fact that there was little medical treatment that we could provide at this point to cure this condition.
He was treated with Nitroglycerin, Lasix and Morphine.
The Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off and the patient was started on Nitroglycerin patch.
When the Nitroglycerin drip was turned initially the patient experienced some right-sided neck pain and chest tenderness that possibly could have been ischemic in origin.
The patient requires aggressive treatment with Morphine, Nitroglycerin and ACE inhibitor to minimize his discomfort related to the ischemic pain.
The Warfarin was discontinued on his admission and was not restarted given the hospice disposition.
