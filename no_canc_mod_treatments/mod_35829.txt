Currently, the patient has been at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation following his below-knee amputation on the right.
There were surgical staples in place.
He was started on vancomycin 1 g intravenously q.24h., levofloxacin, and intravenous Flagyl empirically for cellulitis of the left foot.
On the following day, the patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for a left lower extremity angiogram by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**].
Posterior tibialis and peroneal arteries had diffuse disease.
The proximal and distal anterior tibial artery underwent successful balloon angioplasty.
The patient was then scheduled for a right transmetatarsal amputation.
On [**2187-2-19**] the patient underwent an uneventful right transmetatarsal amputation.
The patient was to continue nonweightbearing for a total four weeks until sutures were removed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] in the office.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2187-2-23**] for a possible peritonitis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was continued.
However, the patient seemed to improve on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Therefore, antibiotics were continued.
A beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were recommended when the patient's blood pressure stabilized.
The patient was started on Lopressor which was titrated to 37.5 mg by mouth three times per day.
An ACE inhibitor may be added at a later date.
The [**Last Name (un) **] Service was asked to evaluate the patient on [**2187-3-1**] regarding resuming the patient's fixed insulin dose.
Up to this time, the patient had been on an insulin sliding-scale.
A suggestion was made that perhaps the patient's diarrhea was due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy given that the patient's Clostridium difficile cultures had been negative.
The patient was to be treated with a total of two weeks of oral vancomycin for presumptive Clostridium difficile colitis.
