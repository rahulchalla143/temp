After discussion, we determined providing a short course of benzodiazapine therapy over the course of the subsequent weekend prior to his presentation to rehabilitation in the coming week would be appropriate.
The patient's visitor was asked to leave the room while guidelines were discussed with him regarding the use of Ativan as an outpatient, namely: - Alcohol cannot be used with this medication, whatsoever.
- The medication should be only used if the patient felt any tremor, or experienced any diaphoresis.
