She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit initially and became progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy requiring intubation and ventilatory support.
She became progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation for survival.
This management initially entailed aggressive control and monitoring of intracranial pressures in conjunction with the neurosurgical service.
This required placement of an intracranial bolt and aggressive volume management with the use of hypertonic saline and mannitol.
She continued to receive aggressive cardiopulmonary support with again, as noted, full ventilatory support and vasopressor support for hypotension.
COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Neurologically, as noted above the patient required placement of an intracranial bolt for ICP monitoring.
This was managed with hyperventilation and usage of mannitol and hypertonic saline.
Her sedation and paralytics were weaned.
She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis to finish a 10-day course.
In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient required full ventilatory support and was extubated on [**2187-11-12**].
She initially did well, but, secondary to what was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on [**2187-11-13**] after failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
She had some degree of what appeared to be an ARDS-type reaction or transfusion- associated lung injury requiring high amounts of PEEP and oxygenation during the initial days of her intensive care unit stay.
This resolved over the course of the next several days with diuresis and supportive therapy.
In terms of her cardiovascular status, the patient initially had blood pressure support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her cerebral edema.
The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and there was no further requirement for this.
A Dobbhoff feeding tube was in place for post- pyloric tube feedings.
The patient's transaminases were elevated; this was thought to be secondary to a possible mild ischemic pancreatitis which might have developed during her requirement for vasopressors.
This volume overload was being managed with hemodialysis daily on an as-needed basis.
She currently receives hemodialysis through a left femoral hemodialysis catheter.
In terms of her ID issues, the patient was initially started on vancomycin for prophylaxis against intracranial infection with the bolt in place.
Sputum cultures failed to evidence any pneumonic process, and these antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient required special HLA-typed platelet transfusions in order to maintain a platelet count above 100,000.
At the present time, the patient is requiring intensive care for management of respiratory failure and renal failure.
At the time of transfer, the patient is receiving the following medications: Protonix 40 mg p.o.
once daily; insulin sliding scale; fentanyl as needed; heparin 5000 units subcu t.i.d.
; Keppra 500 mg IV q.12 hours.
