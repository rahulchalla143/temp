has been aggressively diuresed with natrecor and bumex .
She was receiving fluid boluses for oliguria.
Pt had episode of brady to 30s following versed administration (?related), but transient pacing.
Etiology of acute decompensation not totally clear, likely [**1-12**] combination of COPD, OSA not using BIPAP regularly during hospitalization, LLL PNA.
Currently doing well on PS vent.

Now appears to be slightly IV volume depleted, but total body overloaded.
Unclear what dx of "cor pulmonale" entails in this pt and may have salt/water retention in addition  -no diuretics, no fluid for now  -d/c digoxin & metoprolol as brady o/n and nl EF contractility; consider adding bk norpace once pt can take PO  3.
-Follow MS, now much better off sedation and able to interact w/us  5.
ARF, now resolved and CrCl at baseline: she was originally oliguric most likely [**1-12**] to lack of perfusion from R heart failure.
This is supported by rapid improvement in renal fx following HD stabilization and rehydration; creatinine now at 1.1 (creatinine on admission = 1.3).
OSA: on home bipap, but poorly adherent due to discomfort with the machine and not tolerating in-house.
Now intubated, but will likely require trach to bypass obstruction, especially given her HD decompensation when non-adherent with BIPAP.
Had surgical trach in past that was closing off and de-cannulated.
EP eval but not candidate for other anti-arrhythmics (amio, etc) and dil [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] re-DCCV not likely to help.
She is on heparin drip for anticoagulation, with therapeutic PTT.

HTN: BP under acceptable control currently.
Restarted metoprolol [**6-19**], but d/c'd [**6-23**] d/t persistent brady  10.
anemia: she is s/p colonoscopy on [**6-13**] w/diverticulosis, but no source of bleed.
-Start D51/2NS maintenance fluid  -may need PEG vs post-pyloric NGT  12.
Pt had decreased cortisol stimulation test and is now on hydrocortisone and fludracortisone.
Will be on these 2 medications for 10 days total.
