In the last several weeks, her INR had been low and she had been instructed to take 5mg instead of 2.5 mg of coumadin 2/nights per week.
At the OSH her INR was corrected with 2U FFP and a colonoscopy was performed [**2157-1-21**] which showed blood in entire colon with diverticulosis, active bleeding from diverticular opening treated with epinephrine and endoclip.
She says she received 3U of blood as well.
Her Hct fell after transfusion and she was transferred here for further evaluation and treatment of her unstable lower GI bleeding   Past Medical History: 1.
Coronary Artery disease - multiple caths with stents, last cath [**2156-3-5**], s/p MI X2 2.
previously on amiodorone, but d/c following deteriorating vision in last year.
CVA with left upper visual field cut occurred following one of her stenting procedures.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65 year old woman with history of CAD and Afib on coumadin transferred for treatment of an unstable GI bleed in the setting of an elevated INR to ~3.5.
The most likely source is recurrent bleeding from the diverticuli visualized on colonoscopy at the outside hospital.
Prior to transfer to our institution, her coumadin had been stopped and she had been given Vitamin K and 2U FFP to reverse her INR, however she continued to have active bleeding, was given 3U PRBCs, and was transferred here for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.
Repeat colonoscopy revealed several diverticuli in the distal colon/sigmoid region, consistent with the previous report, but none were actively bleeding and no interventions were undertaken.
Notably, this occurred while she was not receiving her metoprolol because of concerns over possible hemodynamic issues should her bleeding recur.
Once her hemodynamics proved stable, her metoprolol was restarted and titrated upwards to 50mg PO TID in order to control her heart rate.
Her coumadin was held during the admission given the risk of recurrant bleeding.
However, she was restarted on her aspirin and plavix given her multiple cardiac stents in place.
Diuresis was held during most of the admission over hemodynamic concerns, however, she ultimately began to have signs of volume overload including pedal edema, pulmonary crackles, and dyspnea on exertion so her home regimen of furosemide 120 PO QD was restarted.
Medications on Admission: Medications on transfer from ICU: Zantac 50mg IV q6h Nexium 40mg IV BID Metoprolol 25mg PO BID Lasix 120mg daily Lipitor 80mg daily Fish oil 1200mg daily Tylenol prn Plavix held, ASA (held in ICU) Zofran prn  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed diverticulosis blood loss anemia supra-therapeutic anticoagulation atrial fibrillation history of coronary artery diesase   Discharge Condition: stable, HR around 100 and normotensive and no longer orthostatic, Hct stable at 33.
