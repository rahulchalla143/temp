H/o apnea on depakote requiring intubation   Social History: He lives with his wife and step son (24) in [**Location (un) 14840**] and is a retired [**Company 2318**] worker.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year old man with DM type 2, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder vs pseudoseizures, and recent cholecystectomy with appendectomy who presented with multiple syncopal episodes, diaphoresis, and persistent hypoglycemia and was initially admitted to the ICU for close glycemic monitoring.
The patient had a history of DM Type 2 on Humulog 2 units [**Hospital1 **] (unusual treatment of diabetes!).
Potential etiologies included increased exogenous administration of insulin or hypoglycemic medications (self induced specially in light of history of pseudoseizures), increased endogenous production of insulin, or impaired gluconeogenesis.
He stated that he had not taken insulin for [**3-22**] days and had prescription only for Humalog (short-acting insulin).
Insulin, C-peptide, BHB, and cortisol were sent.
The insulin and C-peptide were still pending at the time of discharge but his cortisol stimulation test was completely normal.
The patient was discharge on Metformin [**Hospital1 **] to avoid hypoglycemia.
He was instructed not to take insulin and to follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic for future management of his diabetes.
The final diagnosis depends on the C-peptide and Insulin levels but we strongly suspected factitious disease.
