Patient reports increased dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry weight.
In keeping with her outpatient schedule, the pt went for a full session of dialysis on Wednesday.
ECHO showed an EF of 30% and so she was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril 2.5mg to possibly be started as an outpatient (and to be titrated up as her blood pressure will tolerate it and also to be held on her dialysis days).
After her dialysis session, pt's symptoms improved, physical exam demonstrated clear lung fields, and chest xray showed interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin.
She was put on PPI and carafate, which seemed to provide relief of her pain.
Her graft is well-functioning and her tunneled catheter was pulled.
She was continued on her home prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, and calcitriol.
The amount of fluid they were able to take off and the length of time spent on dialysis was limited by pt's low blood pressure.
# CAD: Pt was continued on her home statin and ASA.
She was continued on Aranesp with dialysis per her outpatient regimen and given 1 unit pRBC with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit.
She was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg qHS, with lisinopril to possibly be started as an outpatient as long as her blood pressure can tolerate it.
Her lisinopril should be held on hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
