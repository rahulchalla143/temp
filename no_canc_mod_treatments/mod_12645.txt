Admission Date:  [**2109-7-24**]     Discharge Date: [**2109-8-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old female with a complicated history including Sjogren's syndrome and a hip replacement [**2109-4-16**].
She was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2109-5-3**], but was readmitted on [**2109-5-9**], for recurrence of the right thigh hematoma.
Cultures from this evacuation grew Staphylococcus epidermidis and extended spectrum lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae requiring removal of the right hip prosthesis and placement of a cement spacer on [**2109-5-20**], which subsequently fractured.
An inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2109-6-4**], and she was maintained on Lovenox.
In addition, she had symptoms of depression and adjustment disorder and was started on Ritalin and Remeron with good response.
She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation on [**2109-6-17**].
Her stay at rehabilitation was notable for hypercalcemia treated with intravenous Lasix and intravenous fluids, Klebsiella urinary tract infection and was found to be Clostridium difficile positive on [**2109-7-17**], for which she was started on Flagyl.
She continued on a total of 6 weeks of IV antibiotics ( vancomycin and meropenem).
One week prior to admission and 1-2 weeks after completing her antibiotic course her right hip was aspiration to document clearance of the infection with reportedly negative cultures.
She was admitted preoperatively to go to the operating room for removal of cement spacer and new hip prosthesis.
Maintained on prednisone 5 mg qd.
Spinal stenosis with sciatica since [**2108-11-27**].
History of multiple deep vein thromboses, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, status post inferior vena cava filter [**2109-5-27**].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, angioplasty in [**2102**].
Peripheral vascular disease- s/p embolectomies and angioplasties for embolic disease as well.
Status post tubal ligation.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes rash.
Sulfa causes rash.
Skin - Healing scar on right hip, dressings clean, dry and intact on sacral decubitus plus heel ulcers bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went to the operating room on [**2109-7-25**], for removal of her right hip cement spacer and repeat right total hip replacement.
She received transfusions in the operating room and intravenous fluids plus Neo-Synephrine in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit [**2109-7-26**].
She continued to be febrile and received one unit of packed red blood cells on postoperative day one, but was able to maintain her pressures off Neo-Synephrine by that night.
She was placed on stress dose steroids.
Her clinical status improved on postoperative day two and she maintained her blood pressure off pressors with intravenous fluids and an additional transfusion.
Cardiovascular - The patient remained hemodynamically stable after postoperative day two, and her blood pressure medications were restarted during her hospital course.
At the time of this summary, the patient is being maintained on Metoprolol 50 mg three times a day, Captopril 50 mg three times a day, with good blood pressure control.
She was continued on her Atorvastatin 10 mg once daily.
She has been maintained on Lovenox since a prior admission.
We titrated her Lovenox by checking a Factor X-A level and at this time, she is on Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneous twice a day with no complications.
Her factor 10a levels (heparin levels) were ~0.6 on this regimen with therapeutic range at out lab (0.5- 1.0).
The patient's iron supplementation was discontinued due to a highly elevated ferritin level suggesting good iron stores.
An Epo level is pending at this time, but the patient was started on Epo 5,000 units three times per week for high suspicion of erythropoietin deficiency secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
SHe should not be placed on iron tablets as she is not presently iron deficient.
Infectious disease - The patient was empirically started on Vancomycin and Meropenem initially after the operation for suspicion of sepsis given her hypotension and low grade fevers.
She is not on antibiotics at the time of this summary.
She was admitted on Flagyl that was to be continued through [**2109-7-31**], for Clostridium difficile.
She had recurrence of diarrhea on [**2109-7-31**], that was suspected to be due to a Boost intolerance but given the recurrence of her diarrhea, it was decided to continue Flagyl through [**2109-8-8**].
Her calcium remained elevated with a stable phosphate and magnesium and then her phosphate and magnesium began to drop, with mild response to repletion.
Given her low calcium, she was empirically started on Vitamin D supplementation.
She was given stress dose steroids during her operation given her long term history of steroid treatment.
She was continued on stress dose steroids given her hypotension postoperatively and was quickly tapered off on postoperative day two to her baseline dose of Prednisone 5 mg once daily.
Orthopedic - As above the patient underwent a repeat right total hip replacement on [**2109-7-25**].
A right upper extremity ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis was negative.
Plain films of the right shoulder were negative for fracture or dislocation although did note diffuse osteopenia.
She will require aggressive physical and occupational therapy given her limited mobility since [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.
A neurologic consultation was obtained and noted that she had a superficial peroneal and sural nerve numbness with a flaccid foot and ankle.
She will require extensive rehabilitation of this extremity.
She suffers from a great deal of neuropathic pain in her right lower extremity and her Neurontin dose was increased to 800 mg three times a day.
Psychiatric - The patient was started on Ritalin and Remeron for symptoms of depression/adjustment disorder during a previous admission.
She was maintained on these medications throughout this hospitalization and while she is clearly frustrated by her situation, she did not show signs of worsening depression.
Rheumatology - Her Sjogren's syndrome has remained stable on Prednisone 5 mg once daily.
Recommended wet to dry dressing  changes multiple times a day.
She has required electrolyte repletion as described above.
Prophylaxis - The patient should be continued on Lovenox, pneumatic boots, a proton pump inhibitor and aggressive wound care.
