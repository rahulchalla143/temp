Reason for MICU transfer: Critical tracheal stenosis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy Rigid Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 39 yo WF with a hx of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**7-10**] complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP, LV systolic dysfunction (EF 35%), HTN, HLD, DM who presented with to an OSH 3 days ago with dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Her respiratory problems date back to her hospitalization for her CABG on [**2200-7-8**], after which she was intubated for 7 days for cardiogenic shock, successfully extubated and discharged on [**7-19**].
During that hospitalization, she was also noted to have upper airway stridor and hoarseness [**1-1**] tracheal stenosis found on CT-Chest that was treated with steroids and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-31**].
She was covered empirically with vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam, as well as micafungin for possible fungal infection and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given her course of steroids.
Here, she had another rigid bronchoscopy that revealed tracheal stenosis with friable/necrotic tracheal mucosa obstructing ~80% of her tracheal lumen that was subsequently removed.
She ultimately underwent tracheostomy and was admitted to the MICU.
Prior to transfer, ID recommended discontinuation of Vanc and Cipro and continuation of IV clindamycin for 10 days.
She continues to have pain over both her tracheostomy site and her sternotomy site.
Past Medical History: Anterior NSTEMI s/p 5 vessel CABG [**2200-7-8**] (one note of this actually being a STEMI in the DC paperwork) CHF (EF 35-40% on TTE [**2200-8-4**]) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Crohns disease Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Asthma Depression Fibromyalgia S/p ventral hernia repair S/p appendectomy S/p cholecystectomy S/p C-section with tubal ligation   Social History: Lives with husband in [**Name (NI) **].
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.1, 92/66, 89, 20 99 Trach Mask FSBS 135-264 General: sitting up in bed in NAD Neck: Trach tube in place Heart: RRR, nml S1/S2.
New tracheostomy with air visualized in the soft tissue spaces of the neck and tracking down to the mediastinum.
No CT evidence of tracheal perforation or mucosal tear (trachea above the tube is opacified with secretions and this section is not fully assessed) These findings are likely post-procedural.

rigid bronch was performed which revealed tracheal stenosis with friable tracheal mucosa for which she underwent cryotherapy and forceps removal of the necrotic-appearing respiratory mucosa; she ultimately underwent a tracheostomy with a long tube [**Last Name (un) 295**] (terminating ~2cm above the carina).
She was able to be weaned off positive pressure ventilation down to 40% FIO2 with trach mask.
She was weaned to a high flow trach mask and was cleared by PT to go home.
Case management was able to coordinate the appropriate home devices (suction, humidified air, oxygen tanks, and hospital bed) and she was setup to follow-up with interventional pulmonology as an outpatient.
She was initially treated with broad empiric coverage but this was narrowed to Clindamycin after cultures on this admission grew mixed oral flora.
Pt continues to have mild pain in the throat and on the skin about the incision site which was well controlled with MS Contin and MSIR.
Per ID recommendations she will continue clindamycin for a total of 10 day course.
We requested that the patient's antibiotics also be filled - her narcotic prescriptions we provided are of limited quantity (~35 tablets each).
She diuresed well with IV lasix.
On the floor, she demonstrated a mild increase of her lower extremity edema and was effectively diuresed with PO lasix and did not have any worsening in her respiratory status.
She was continued on her home dose of aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol and statin.
Given her cardiac risk, a low-dose ACE inhibitor was added on to her home regimen.
# T2DM: Her home regimen was initially held because she was NPO.
Given a sliding scale insulin requirement, her daily Lantus was increased to 35 units with minimal subsequent sliding scale requirement.
She will continue her home dose of mesalamine .
# Depression: She will continue her home paroxetine and seroquel .
Tracheostomy Care: The patient underwent tracheostomy teaching.
She could not tolerate a Passey Muir valve because of the degree of tracheal narrowing.
She will follow up with Interventional Pulmonology clinic for further management.
Please follow-up pain management as patient was given enough pain medication to cover her until her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**] #.
Please follow-up her blood pressure as she was started on lisinopril 2.5mg daily #.
Please follow-up her blood sugars as her insulin regimen was changed will inpatient.

In the emergency room, you were intubated, and subsequently had a procedure known as a bronchoscopy, where the pulmonary physicians were able to look down your airway and see what was causing your shortness of breath.
Given your difficulty breathing, you had a tracheostomy tube placed and were transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
There, you were treated with antibiotics and pain medications, which continued when you were transferred to the general medical floor.
