A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Although, based on his lung exam with wheezing and rhonchi, it was felt that there was also a COPD component to the patient's dyspnea.
Over the course of his initial ICU stay, he was treated with IV solumedrol, nebs, and cepodoxime/azithromycin for COPD flare.
He was also diuresed with lasix 120mg iv prn, though he autodiuresed aggressively on his own.
He was given lasix but remained tachypneic low oxygen sats.
The patient remained intubated for 4 days, during which time he was diuresed with lasix.
We increased his home dose of lasix for discharge to the rehabilitation facility and recommended strict daily weights.
Finally, based on his anatomy and observing him at sleep in the morning, he also may have a component of obstructive sleep apnea which may contribute to his pulmonary problems.
Diuresis continued through most of the patient's ICU stay.
Diltiazem and lisinopril may need to be restarted if he returns to hypertensive state, particularly his lisinopril from which he would likely derive benefit both for CHF and renal protection.
On admit, he was placed on albuterol/atrovent nebs, steroids, and antibiotics.
He was continued on the albuterol and atrovent throughout his course in the MICU.
His steroids were tapered down and stopped prior to his transfer out of the MICU.
# Hypotension - After his readmission to the MICU and intubation, the patient had some problems with hypotension.
He did require transient pressors for a short period of time to maintain his blood pressure.
In the setting of this bleeding, the patient received blood on [**2145-7-10**].
His antihypertensives other than lasix continued to be held in the setting of aggressive diuresis and low normal blood pressure, but lisinopril in particular should likely be restarted once his blood pressure returns to higher levels.
As stated above, the patient received blood on [**2145-7-10**].
# Bleeding from wounds - Mr. [**Known lastname 5981**] had a scab on his right face that he sometimes compulsively picked at despite expressing a wish not to, and for some time needed constant bandage changes in the setting of heparin and coumadin.
# Cytopenia - The patient remained thrombocytopenic across his entire admission, with platelet counts averaging approximately 90-100.
On admission, he had a supratherapeutic INR and his coumadin was held.
He was put on a heparin drip for anticoagulation, and his coumadin was soon restarted.
After the patient was more stable, the heparin drip was restarted.
After some adjustments, it was decided to keep the patient on the heparin drip until he reached his goal PTT of 60-80.
The patient remained on a heparin drip across his admission.
Coumadin was restarted at 5mg and then raised to 7.5mg, and the patient's INR rose to 1.9 at the time of discharge.
He was discharged on a Lovenox bridge with daily INR checks.
# DM - The patient was put on sliding scale insulin while he was in the hospital.
He was also put on 70/30 with a split dose [**Hospital1 **] and placed on a diabetic diet.
His blood sugars varied during his hospitalization but generally were <200.
His home regimen of insulin was continued at the time of discharge.
He was treated with lidex to his lower extremities and wound care by his nurses.
Dressing changes and wound care were provided by his nurses.
He was discharged with instructions for his wound care during rehabilitation.
Apparently, this is consistent with his actions on previous admissions.
While hospitalized, the patient was kept on his home regimen of geodon 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
Initially, he was kept on his home regimen of trazodone 600mg po qHS.
However, the trazodone was discontinued while he was intubated.
After extubation, he was started back on a lower dose of trazodone with the plan to wean him back up to his normal dose.
However, the patient's trazodone dose was held at half its original amount secondary to sedation.
