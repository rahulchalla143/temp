Then rotational atherectomy was attempted without much modification of the lesion.
She was transferred to CCU post-procedure with plans for return to cath lab the following day for repeat procedure to further open her stenotic AV, however pt declined further procedures.
2) CAD - pt continued on ASA, beta-blocker, statin, as well as being started on Plavix  3) Anemia - pt had slight decrease in hct post-procedure & was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's to maintain her hct > 30 due to her underlying CAD.
4) GI - pt with underlying dispepsia/GERD, usually taking Nexium as outpatient.
During hospital stay she was on protonix (formulary interchange) in addition to prn maalox/simethicone, however she was discharged back on her nexium.
