Pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor treated with bed rest at 24 weeks gestation.
Mother received a complete course of betamethasone on [**2193-8-3**].
Rupture of membranes occurred two weeks prior to delivery, leading to treatment with magnesium sulfate.
Her previous medical history of anxiety and depression was treated with Prozac and Klonopin.
Maternal temperature of 102.6 prompted cesarean delivery for chorioamnionitis and vertex-transverse lie.
Mother's amniotic fluid culture did grow out Staphylococcus epidermidis and the mother was treated with 14 days of antibiotics for Staphylococcal epidermidis bacteremia.
He remained on SIMV ventilation throughout, with gradual improvement and weaning of settings seen after day of life 3.
He remained on SIMV at time of transfer to [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2193-9-4**] for GI surgery (see below).
He remained on CPAP until day of life 30 at which time he transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen.
The infant was started on caffeine citrate for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity while at [**Hospital3 1810**] and remained on it until day of life 52, which was corrected gestational age of 34-2/7 weeks.
Since that time, he has had no significant apnea/bradycardia episodes, but does have an occasional drift in his oxygen saturation primarily associated with PO feedings.
Cardiovascular:  The infant initially did not require pressor support during the first several days of life, but was noted to develop a murmur consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus at the time of presentation with pulmonary hemorrhage.
The baby was transferred to the [**Hospital3 1810**] for a PDA ligation; the procedure was performed on [**2193-9-2**] without complication, and the infant returned to the [**Hospital1 18**].
He has remained normotensive throughout his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay and has not required any pressor support.
Just prior to his PDA ligation, he did require several boluses of sodium bicarbonate for persistent metabolic acidosis.
Of note, the infant had recently completed treatment for a PDA including ligation, but had never been fed.
Enteral feedings were introduced while at [**Hospital1 **], and at the time of transfer back to the [**Hospital1 **], he was tolerating breast milk or Special Care 20 calories/ounce.
Twenty-eight calories is achieved by using 4 calories/ounce of human milk fortifier, 4 calories/ounce of MCT oil, with additional promod.
He is also receiving supplemental ferrous sulfate 0.2 mL by mouth/per gavage daily of 25 mg/mL, and vitamin E 5 units by mouth/per gavage daily.
Earlier in his course, he did receive vitamin A 5,000 units IM times 12 doses on an every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.

He did receive a platelet transfusion on day of life one for platelet count of 88,000.

He did receive a seven day course of ampicillin and gentamicin.
His CBC before discontinuing his antibiotics had a white count of 7.7, 22 polys, 0 bands, platelets of 196,000, and a hematocrit of 39.8.
Antibiotics were discontinued on day of life seven.
Baby was clinically improved and antibiotics were discontinued.
CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  Continue feedings as described above:  Breast milk 28 with ProMod at 150 mL/kg/day, continue to encourage oral feedings.
MEDICATIONS:  Supplements to achieve 28 calories/ounce, ferrous sulfate and vitamin E.  CAR SEAT POSITION SCREENING:  Has not been performed at the time of transfer.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  Hepatitis B vaccine [**9-29**].
Pneumococcal 7 valiant conjugate vaccine [**10-26**].
[**Month/Year (2) 6961**] have been informed about potential dose of Synagis prior to discharge.
