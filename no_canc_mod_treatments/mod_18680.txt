Stable appearance of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage, interventricular hemorrhage, and associated edema.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-15**] 4:57 AM Essentially unchanged picture of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with the minimal leftward-shift of midline structure.
Unchanged positioning of ventriculostomy catheter and unchanged appearance to right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
I note that the patient has had a recent insertion of a PEG tube; however, at this stage, there should be no free air.
MRI Head [**7-25**]: FINDINGS: Evidence of right frontal/parietal/temporal craniectomy is again seen.
Contrast enhancement associated with one of these foci (series 10, image 11) is likely reactive.
Extensive blood products are again seen along the right anterior/inferior frontal and right temporal resection sites.
Small lacunar infarctions in the left pons and midbrain are unchanged.
Dural enhancement at the craniectomy site and in the region of the blood products is expected given the recent surgery and trauma.
If there is a clinical suspicion for a leptomeningeal infection, correlation with a lumbar puncture is suggested.
Increased opacification of mastoid air cells compared to [**7-14**], [**2164**].
Chest X-ray [**7-25**]: Tracheostomy tube tip is 3.2 cm above the carina.
In the OR, patient underwent a R hemicrainectomy with a left frontal lobectomy and partial temporal lobectomy and and external ventricular drain was placed to reduce intracranial pressure.
Patient was tachycardiac and has a history of benzo and opiate substance abuse, she was given labetalol to control heart rate.
Overnight and early the next morning the drain stopped functioning properly.
She was also started on methadone d/t her history of substance abuse.
She was transferred to the SICU for further management of her airway.
CXR was performed and a consolidation was identified and antibiotics were started.
Antibiotics were further narrowed for specific organisms per ID recommendations.
She was started on a much more aggressive bowel regimin and had several bowel movements resulting in impovement in abdominal distention.
She continued her antibiotics (Cipro and Bactrim) which were both scheduled to be given for a total of 8 days.
