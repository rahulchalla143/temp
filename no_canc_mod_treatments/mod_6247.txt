Status post ORIF of the left hip with short intramedullary nail and hip screw.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo female with PMH of CAD, CHF, PAF, AS, presenting s/p mechanical fall with subsequent left intertroch fracture s/p ORIF, transferred back to medicine for management of medical issues.
Pt was admitted to medicine prior to surgical repair given her comorbidities of a.fib, CHF, and severe AS.
On [**2-1**] she underwent open reduction internal fixation of her left femur fracture.
She tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well without intraoperative complication.
After the procedure she remained intubated and was monitored in the ICU as prophylaxis due to concern of possible flash pulmonary edema due to interoperative fluids.
She received routine post op care and pain was controlled with standing tylenol and IV morphine which was eventually weaned to a PO regimen, and eventually just standing tylenol.
She was started on lovenox 30mg SC daily which should be continued for 1 month.
She was continued on home amiodarone as well as asa-81 and remained in NSR throughout admission .
# Severe AS:  Pt with sever AS, valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 and aortic valve gradient 56 mmhg on Echo in 4/[**2138**].
Pt was euvolemic throughout admission and excessive IVF was avoided as above given her propensity to go into CHF.
She was continued on home toprol-xl 25mg daily, and home lasix regimen 40mg 4x/week, 60mg 3x/week.
Valsartan was held after Cr trended up to 2.0 but was 1.8 on discharge.
Valsartan should be restarted on discharge.
# CAD:  S/p PCI of prox LAD in [**2-23**], NSTEMI and in-stent restenosis treated with PTCA and DESx2 to mid-LAD in [**6-28**].
She was continued on home asa, simva, and toprol-xl 25mg daily .
She was given simethicone and an aggressive bowel regimen with resolution of pain.
However she remained constipated requiring manual disimpaction.
This was likely prerenal but we did not aggressively rehydrate with IVF given her CHF history.
