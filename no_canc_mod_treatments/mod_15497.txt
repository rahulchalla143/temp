An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70% proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on electrocardiograms prior to transfer.
Post Angio-Jet predilation 3 balloon, Lopressor, and deployment of 3.5 X 33 Hepakote [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 30272**] posterior descending artery jailed and lost, unable to engage with base, right coronary artery 0% residual stenosis, TIMI-III flow.
While transferring the patient to the stretcher status post catheterization, the patient was given a tablet of Plavix and became extraordinarily anxious upon attempting to swallow the pill.
She was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two and a nitroglycerin 200-mcg bolus followed by a nitroglycerin drip at 250 mcg/kg per minute.
She was also Fentanyl 25 mcg for anxiety.
She also reported wheezing after being given a beta blocker.
The right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2178-7-2**], the patient was on aspirin, Lipitor, morphine, heparin, Integrilin, and nitroglycerin drip.
On [**7-3**], the patient was placed on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her gas/bloating.
On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin when combined with Plavix.
On [**7-4**], the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
every day and changed to Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o.
Her Foley catheter was discontinued.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   She was sent home with the support of her daughter ([**Name (NI) 501**] [**Name (NI) **]) and given handouts on her condition.
Aspirin 325-mg tablet one tablet p.o.
