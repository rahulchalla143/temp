Patient received multiple doses of insulin overnight to keep sugars from climbing over 400 (up to 20+ [**Location **]) and there was a concern for stacking due to patient's poor renal function; however, the patient's blood sugar never dropped.
# Insulin Receptor Autoantibody Syndrome: Recently diagnosed with autoantibodies to the insulin receptor and started on oral prednisone for immune suppression as an outpatient; however, patient admitted that he only started consistently taking the prednisone a few days prior to admission.
Rheumatology consulted on [**2126-9-26**] and they started patient on prednisone 20 mg twice daily in the hospital.
Discussion with rheum consult also revealed possibility that hypoglycemia could be attributed to insulin autoantibodies that spontaneously release a large pool of insulin rather than antibodies to the insulin receptor itself.
Regardless, given patient's uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, dose of prednisone was reduced to 15 mg twice daily and patient was started on azathioprine prior to discharge.
Allopurinol was decreased to 50 mg QOD in setting of starting azathioprine.
In order to adjust dosing of azathioprine as an outpatient, a THIOPURINE METHYLTRANSFERASE (TPMT) level was drawn and returned as 14.8 U/mL RBC after the patient was discharged.
Nephrology was consulted and reported that the patient had been approached about dialysis and about having a fistula placed in preparation, but he had thus far refused the idea of initiating preparation for dialysis.
Nephrology consult did feel that patient would benefit from a kidney and pancreas transplant evaluation, thus he was set up to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the week following discharge.
# Hypertension: Patient presented with an impressive outpatient regimen of minoxidil, clonidine, metoprolol, diltiazem, doxazosin, and furosemide.
His minoxidil and metoprolol doses were increased as an inpatient.
As his refractory hypertension was thought to be partially associated with volume status, the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] 60 mg IV furosemide with appropriate diuresis and a reduction in his edema.
He was discharged on oral furosemide at a dose of 80 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Also, as his iron saturation was found to be 6.7%, he was initiated on iron replacement therapy as an inpatient.
