Admission Date:  [**2161-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-4-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 87 year old male with a history of COPD, recent pneumonia, and recent admission s/p fall with complex tibial plateau and non-displaced fibular head fractures.
He was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2161-3-12**] to [**2161-3-14**] and evaluated by Orthopedics, with a decision made to pursue nonsurgical management with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] hinge knee brace and rehabilitation.
Enoxaparin was continued during his stay and at discharge.
Prior to his recent pneumonia admission, he had not been on home oxygen, nebulizers, or systemic steroids.
He had Troponin elevation to 0.10 (<0.01 on [**2161-3-12**]) and proBNP 1188.
He was given Cefepime 2 grams IV, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and Vancomycin 1 gram IV.
He was placed on a Heparin drip and NRB.
He reported having looser stools than usual at rehab, but had been started on stool softeners, and mild periumbilical tenderness in his abdomen.
Past Medical History: recent bilateral pneumonia and influenza A&B & RSV Rx at OSH [**Date range (1) 97230**]/11 - Rx by nebs, O2, stable on prednisone taper and outpatient antibiotics - doxycycline HTN CVA CAD s/p 2 vessel bypass [**2135**] AAA 2.7 cm COPD nephrolithiasis h/o bladder and prostate ca OA osteoporosis spinal stenosis with h/o L2 vertebral # h/o B12 def, on monthly injection gout hard of hearing   Social History: He has recently been at rehab ([**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) 7658**]) since his admission for knee fracture.
He was started on a heparin drip and monitored in the ICU without event.
He continued to be stable on the floor and was transitioned to a lovenox bridge until coumadin was therapeutic.
His coumadin was somewhat difficult to titrate - initially minimally responsive to 5mg daily of coumadin then supratherapeutic rapidly to >4 on 6-7mg daily.
He requires INR measurement every day for now with coumadin dosing changes as needed based upon the results.
The duration of anticoagulation will be a minimum of 6 months and maybe 9-12 months or longer.
The patient had an episode of desaturation to high 80's% on RA improved to 90's% with nasal cannula oxygen with some associated altered mental status on [**2161-3-31**].
He was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and with sputum culture growing MRSA, this was weaned to Vanco monotherapy for an expected 10 day course.
He described some difficulty swallowing though speech and swallow eval cleared him for a ground solid, thin liquid diet.
The patient also received chest PT with good effect, allowing him to clear secretions better than he can independently.
He should also observe basic aspiration prevention measures - sitting upright with meals, chewing fully, swallowing multiple times and stopping eating if coughing occurs.
He may require repeat swallow eval if his symptoms persist .
Given his history of CAD and therefore known indication for beta-blocker, he was started on metoprolol for rate control, blood pressure control and to reduce atrial ectopy.
We continued ipratropium nebs Q6H and albuterol nebs Q4H PRN.
He received IV fluids and his Na normalized.
We controlled pt's pain with oxycodone 2.5mg Q4H PRN and acetaminophen 650mg Q6 PRN.
The patient continues on aspirin and new beta-blocker therapy.
He requires ongoing wound care and frequent turning.
