MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Protonix, Heparin subcu, Regular insulin sliding scale, Vitamin C, Combivent, Multivitamins, Senna, Colace, Lacrilube, TUMS, Zyprexa, Dulcolax, nebs, Tylenol, Captopril.
IMPRESSION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with CAD, CHF, status post Klebsiella and [**Female First Name (un) **] sepsis in [**2161-3-23**], now admitted with left parotitis.
Hypotension:  The patient was initially treated with Vancomycin for his parotitis.
The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Levofloxacin for UTI.
The patient was then started on Imipenem on the 8th which was then changed to Meropenem on the 9th.
That evening patient responded well to IV fluids and maintained adequate blood pressures at that time.
Fluid resuscitation was again attempted.
After third liter of normal saline patient's blood pressure was still only in the 70's, pulse 60, respiratory rate 16 and 96% on three liters nasal cannula.
In the MICU the patient was continued on IV fluids.
The patient was believed to be in septic shock and therefore was maintained on a complete course of Vancomycin times 14 days and Meropenem times 14 days.
The patient was started on Dopamine for pressor support on [**5-1**].
Throughout the rest of the hospital stay the patient was on varying doses of Dopamine which for a short period of time during MICU stay was weaned to off.
Within 24 hours the patient required pressor support once again.
After patient completed his two week course of both Vancomycin and Meropenem, the source became unclear.
Therefore, patient's Perma-cath line was discontinued as a potential source of infection.
The patient's creatinine remained stable status post discontinuation of hemodialysis.
The patient became very fluid overloaded and unresponsive to high dose diuresis including Lasix 160 mg IV bid and q d Zaroxolyn.
The renal team continued to follow patient but did not feel that patient was any longer a candidate for hemodialysis given severely decompensated state.
He received nebulizer treatments while in the ICU and received high flow oxygen.
The patient was started on tube feedings.
Discussions were lengthy and patient's family was informed of patient's poor prognosis as his condition further declined.
