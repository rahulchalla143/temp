He was started on lisinopril 5mg and flomax during that admission.
Pt was given solumederol 125, benadryl 25, famotidine.
Past Medical History: -Rectal bleeding, from diverticulosis -Adenomas on colonoscopy [**2-21**] -CAD s/p BMS LAD and RPDA -Hypertension -Dyslipidemia -Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -s/p CVA -Asthma/COPD -Urinary retention -Orthostatic hypotension: admit for syncope in [**5-19**] and for hypotension in [**10-19**].
Initial work-up consistent with medication induced orthostasis, also had formal autonomic testing and in [**10-19**] was started on florinef and midodrine (see d'c summary from [**10-19**] for details).
These medications were subsequently stopped by pcp due to hypertension -Paranoid schizophrenia: diagnosed 5-10 years ago admitted [**12-19**] x 2 weeks at [**Hospital 1263**] hospital; [**Date range (3) 24050**] [**Hospital1 18**] admit for psychosis after stopping risperidone for orthostatic hypotension- Outpt Psychiatrist: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24051**] at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] -Impaired glucose tolerance   Social History: Tob: 2ppd, quit [**2186**] No alcohol in [**7-17**] years No other drug use.
If clinical concern, MRI of the spine can be done for evaluation.
He had previously been on midodrine and florinef but was hypertensive so these were discontinued.
He has most recently been on flomax and lisinopril and was more orthostatic.
For now I have changed his regimen to norvasc 2.5mg po daily and thigh high TEDS stockings.
In addition given his CT C spine findings and his recurrent falls I feel that it would be dangerous for him to ambulate without an assist device.
I have recommended a walker with a seat so that he can sit down immediately should he feel lightheaded, I have strongly urged he use this at all times given his high risk to fall, and have suggested if this is ineffective he may at somepoint be committed to a wheelchair given his severe autnomic dysfunction.
