NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The progressive, relatively symmetric low- attenuation regions involving both frontal lobes may relate to evolving hemorrhagic contusions, as suggested above.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**3-19**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Redemonstrated is extensive multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, including intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.
The patient is status post prior left temporal craniotomy.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-3-22**] Continued evolution of multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, with decreased density and conspicuity of blood products on today's study.
Extensive edema is unchanged, with most prominent edema seen in the right frontal lobe, resulting in mass effect upon the adjacent sulci, frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral ventricle, and subfalcine herniation.
If not previously evaluated, this can be further investigated via thyroid ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.
On [**3-14**], his urine culture also grew positive for coag negative staph, and he was started on a course of cipro for days.

# DIABETES: Initially on regular sliding scale, will transitioned to humalog SS.
