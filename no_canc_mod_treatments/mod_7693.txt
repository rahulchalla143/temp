Initially there was no complaint of chest pain but during the Emergency Department course he began to complain of chest pain.
Electrocardiogram done showed ST elevation to 5 mm in V4 through V6 as well as milder elevation in 2, 3, and AVF.
He was started on Lopressor, Aspirin, Nitroglycerin, Integrilin and heparin and was sent to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
ALLERGIES:  He denied any drug allergies, though noted that Motrin causes gastrointestinal upset.
Cardiac - The patient was treated for his cardiac disease with a catheterization as above as well as aspirin, beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
There were no associated electrocardiogram changes; later he complained of a dull constant substernal chest pain, also without electrocardiogram changes.
Given these findings and the thrombus in his coronary arteries as well as his recent cerebrovascular accident he was treated with hepariin and coumadin.
He initially did not demonstrate signs or symptoms of CHF, however following aggressive volume repletion in the setting of his hyperosmolar nonketotic state he eventually developed mild dyspnea and hypoxia, and was diuresed accordingly with good response.
Endocrine - Without a diagnosis of diabetes, the patient had symptoms and glucose consistent with hyperosmolar nonketotic state, the glucose over 800 and mental status changes as well as seizures.
Upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit he was started on insulin drip and with the input of the [**Last Name (un) **] Consult Service his sugars were brought under control.
He was eventually switched over to subcutaneous insulin, and his regimen was titrated up to achieve better glucose control; his total insulin requirement at this point is over 100 units/day.
He was treated with anticoagulation as described above.
Hematology - Due to his stroke, myocardial infarction and thrombus in his coronary arteries particular workup was begun for hypercoagulable state while he was anticoagulated on heparin and started on Coumadin.
His platelets remained stable and his hematocrit slowly drifted down due to blood draws and hydration but remained above 30.
