Over the course of her ICU stay she was intubated and started on Keppra prophylactically with IV agents for blood pressure control as her pressures were difficult to control (goal was less then 160) - for her final regimen see medications below.
Before her arrival she was a known cocaine abuser and beta blockers were avoided.
She had her EVD clamped at one moment after drainage on an open valve of 15 showed less then 200 cc over a 24 hour period.
Starting on [**2-20**] her drain was progressively raised from 10 cm to 15 cm then 20 cm over three days, without increased ventricular size (that could not be accounted for by reducing edema after infarcts).
She tolerated drain clamping and removal without worsening hydrocephalus on imaging.
On the final day of drain clamping, she was febrile and a CSF pleocytosis was noted.
This can sometimes occur with ventriculitis in the context of drain and blood in CSF, but infection could not be excluded, so meropenem coverage (see Pneumonia below) was broadened to include vancomycin.
Pneumonia and Fever:   She was initially febrile and after multiple attempts to isolate an organism was found to grow pan sensitive Acinetobacter on sputum culture.
Her antibiotics were pared down to nafcillin then switched to meropenem to better cover acinetobacter given some respiratory distress on [**2-19**].
Vancomycin was added on [**2-22**].
The course of vancomycin and meropenem can end on [**2175-3-5**].
General Care:   During her ICU course she also received a PEG and a Trach and she subsequently tolerated trach collar.

The drain was eventually removed without worsening.
