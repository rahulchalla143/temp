CXR: [**4-2**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-4**] and [**4-1**]:  Right lung base is still elevated but there has been a substantial decrease in the volume of right pleural effusion.
CXR: [**4-2**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] at 6:31 p.m.  Elevation of the right lung base due in part to subpulmonic pleural effusion has worsened, and volume of right pleural fluid layering posteriorly and collecting in fissures has increased.
However, a small iatrogenic vascular malformation cannot be excluded (e.g., if the patient has undergone Swan Ganz catheter placement) and a followup contrast enhance CT is recommended in three months to ensure resolution or to further characterize if persistent.
There is new minimal pneumothorax on the right following pigtail catheter placement.

The patient's INR was 2.2 and she recieved 4U of FFP and underwent thoracentesis at the bedside and 1.6L were removed [**4-2**].
During the night the patient became hypoxic requiring 2-3L NC and Hct drop to 22.8 from 27.2 .
The patient remained stable, but again became hypoxic on [**4-4**] requiring NRB and continued Hct drop to 17.
The patient was transferred to the MICU and pigatail catheter was placed and drained via chest tube.
Her pigatil catheter was clamped and then removed after CXR did not show reaccumulation.
She recieved 1U FFP prior to removal and 1U FFP post-removal.
She was continued on lasix 40mg and spironolactone 100mg daily.
