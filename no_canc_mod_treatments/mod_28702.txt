HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**], with a history of right axillobifemoral bypass with a right fourth toe amputation in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year, who developed difficulty with ambulation over the last 3 weeks with progressing to cessation of his ambulation 2 days ago which is associated with leg fatigue and cool feet.
Daughter brought the patient to [**Hospital6 5016**] where he was treated for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Include Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Inderal LA 80 mg b.i.d., allopurinol 300 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, bilateral renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stenting bilaterally in [**2177-6-8**], chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine at 2.0-4.0, Alzheimer's disease, carotid stenosis with a totally occluded left internal carotid artery, and the right carotid is 70%, atrial fibrillation with paroxysmal episodes since [**2177-6-8**].
IV heparin was begun.
The patient underwent an urgent bilateral fem patch angioplasty with bilateral kissing common iliac angioplasty and stenting with ligation of the axillobifemoral graft at the common femoral arteries, bilateral profunda femoris and left superficial femoral artery and graft thrombectomy with bilateral 4-compartment fasciotomy.
The patient required vasopressor support for low urinary output.
IV heparinization was begun.
He was begun on vanco, levo and Flagyl for perioperative antibiotic coverage.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Postoperative day 1, the patient was continued on vasopressor support for his oliguria, and he had a T-max of 101.
Patient required 2 more units of packed red blood cells.
Tube feeds were begun.
Serial CKs were obtained, and he was begun on a bicarbonate drip for his rhabdomyosis.
His antibiotics were renally dosed.
On postoperative day 5, the patient returned to surgery and underwent bilateral below-knee amputations, guillotine.
His hyponatremia was treated with IV fluid, and he was placed on CPAP.
His IV heparin was discontinued, and subcu heparin was begun for DVT prophylaxis.
Postoperative day 8 and 3, his tube feeds were at goal at 60 cc/h.
He was weaned off his Levophed.
Hemodialysis catheter was placed.
His endotracheal tube was reintubated secondary to position of ET tube.
Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week was instituted, and he also required free water to be added to his tube feedings of 250 cc q.i.d.
Geriatrics did not feel that the patient required a head CT.
He continued on his tube feeds and remained n.p.o.
On [**12-22**], postoperative day 17, 12 and 7, PT and OT evaluated the patient and felt that he would require rehab, and at this time it was determined we might need to consider placing a PEG since we had replaced the nasogastric feed tube multiple times and was difficult to place.
A rectal tube which had been placed on [**12-9**] for multiple loose stools was discontinued.
He was begun on oral feeds of ground pureed food with nectar-thickened liquids and pills to be crushed and pureed, aspiration precautions and food assistance.
His medications were converted to oral route.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include albuterol aerosol puffs 4 q.4h.
as needed for wheezing, Epogen 4000 units subcu Monday, Wednesday and Friday, papaverine urea ointment to affected area daily, ipratropium bromide aerosol puffs 2 q.4-6h.
as needed, famotidine 20 mg IV q.24h--this will be converted to Zegerid 20 mg capsules b.i.d.
which can be placed in water or pureed food, acetaminophen 325-650 mg q.8h.
p.r.n., metoprolol 75 mg t.i.d.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Lower extremity postoperative extremity ischemia, postoperative pneumonia secondary to aspiration, postoperative blood loss anemia--transfused, postoperative acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyosis with contrast-induced acute tubular necrosis, postoperative acute renal failure status post continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis, postoperative hypertension secondary to hypovolemia--corrected, postoperative failure to thrive status post tube feed total parenteral nutrition.
MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:  Bilateral femoral patch angioplasty, bilateral "kissing" angioplasty of the common iliac artery with stenting, ligation of the axillobifemoral graft at the common femoral arteries with thrombectomies of the profunda femoris artery, the left superficial femoral artery and the graft on [**2178-12-4**], bilateral below- knee guillotine amputations on [**2178-12-9**], bilateral amputation revisions from BKA to AKA on [**2178-12-15**].
