Had 2-3 episodes of moderate chest pressure with numbness down the back of both arms, as well as, diaphoresis, nausea, and lightheadedness while at work.
The pt was given Lopressor 50 mg po, Morphine 2 mg, Heparin 5000 U x 1, Plavix 600 mg po, Aggrastast bolus 44cc/hour over half hour, then 11cc/hour IV, and Aspirin 325 mg x 1.
The guidewire and stent balloon were removed but he had continued VT and so was shocked.
Lidocaine was started and AIBP was inflated.
Then started on amiodarone 150 mg bolus followed by infusion; he was also intubated at that time for airway protection.
He was started on lidocaine gtt, Amiodarone gtt and Dopamine gtt while in the cath lab and then was transferred to the CCU intubated and sedated.
Family History: Mother - CAD (MI), DM Father - colon cancer  Physical Exam: VS on transfer to CCU: T 97.8 BP 94/56 HR 79 RR 12 sat 100 AC FiO2 100 TV 600 RR 12 Peep 5 Wt: 212 lbs Gen: intubated HEENT: perrla Resp: clear anteriorly CV: reg, systolic murmur (likely IABP) Abd: + BS, non-tender Ext: DP 1 + bilat, no edema Neuro: sedated  Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR - [**5-5**] - Satisfactorily positioned ET tube and OG tube.
Qs in II and aVF, resolution of ST seg elevation in V4-V6, ST seg dep in I, aVL .. TTE: [**5-6**] - EF 35-40% Regional LV and RV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61 yo M with Insulin dependent DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia who presents with inferior STEMI s/p PTCA complicated by hypotension requiring balloon pump and DA gtt as well as VT/VF resulting in Amio and Lidocaine gtt.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and was followed with daily ECGs with no further events.
He was discharged on aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril and clopidogrel.
Patient may need further intervention to deal with other areas of significant blockage, however, no intervention will be done acutely.
He may need stress-MIBI as out-patient prior to further intervention (PCI vs CABG).
He will also see CT surgery in [**5-29**] to discuss CABG.
Also weaned off dopamine and extubated on [**5-6**].
In an effort to keep volume status even patient was given furosemide as needed.
C.  Rhythm: The pt had episodes of VT and VT/VF in cath lab during the acute intervention.
He is now s/p loading with both lidocaine and amiodarone.
Lidocaine was not continued after transfer to CCU; amiodarone was continued for 18 hours but was subsequently discontinued.
DM:  Based on the findings of DiGAMI II, there is no evidence to support use of glucose/insulin gtt in the setting of ACS to improve mortality or morbidity in diabetics.
Patient was initially placed on an insulin gtt for better control of DM.
He was then transitioned to NPH and a regular insulin sliding scale.
Given the discomfort of the invasive monitoring in the ICU at this time (swan, arterial and femoral sheath, IABP), sedation and intubation was continued until the IABP was removed on [**2121-7-6**].
