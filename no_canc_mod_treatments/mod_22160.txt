Limited resting hemodynamics performed after angiography and intervention revealed normal right- and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 5 mmHg, mean PCW 19 mmHg).
Initial ECG showed anterior ST-elevations in leads v1-3 and he was treated with thrombolysis with tenecteplase at 10am.
His symptoms resolved but his ST-elevations only decreased by approximately [**11-27**], and he was transferred for PCI.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for emergent catheterization for management of failed thrombolysis of an acute anterior ST-elevation MI.
Limited resting hemodynamics performed after angiography and intervention revealed normal right- and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 5 mmHg, mean PCW 19 mmHg).
Successful stenting of the LCx into the OM1 with a 2.5 x 18 mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 3.5 mm balloon and finally with a 3.0 mm balloon.
Successful stenting of the LCx vessel with a drug-eluting stent and rescue of the jailed OM2 branch with 60% residual stenosis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.

He underwent successful stenting of the LCx vessel with a drug-eluting stent and rescue of the jailed OM2 branch with 60% residual stenosis.
He was kept on a heparin drip for 48 hrs post-cath with goal PTT 50-70.
Because these wall motion abnormalities put him at risk for thrombus formation, he was started on coumadin 5mg QD with a goal INR of [**12-28**].
He is to follow-up with his PCP on the [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] after discharge to check his INR and adjust coumadin dosing as needed.
This testing will be done on an outpatient basis, approximately one month after discharge.
He will follow-up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] and will continue plavix for 9 months after discharge.
He will also continue to take aspirin 325mg daily, lipitor 80mg daily, atenolol 50mg daily and lisinopril 2.5 mg daily.
While in house, he was counselled on the need for tobacco cessation and was started on Bupropion 150mg Qam.
Lipitor 80 mg daily was started and BP was well controlled on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 2.5mg daily.
