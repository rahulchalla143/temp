Admission Date:  [**2109-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-6-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Syncope/Chordae Tendinae Rupture of Mitral Valve   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left and right heart catheterization Intra-aortic balloon pump Mitral valve replacement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 5874**] is a 45 y/o male with a history of syncopal episodes and holosystolic murmur who was admitted to the CCU after a 9 second asystolic pause in the emergency department.
His procedure was deferred and he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation.
His EKG was NSR with a right axis deviation and signs of RVH.
When his blood was drawn for routine labs, the patient became nauseated and again syncopized, his heart rate subsequently decreasing into the 40s and then leading to 9 seconds of asystole, during which is SBP dipped into the 80s.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and felt that he needed an urgent (but not emergent) mitral valve replacement as this was likely a chronic problem.
His cardiac index was 1.7 and an intra-aortic balloon pump was subsequently placed for cardiogenic shock.
His ventilator settings were changed to AC TV 500ml, PEEP 5 at 22 breaths/minute to correct for his hypercarbia, which was felt to be related to low tidal volumes and frequency and for his hypoxemia, thought to be related to V/Q mismatch/shunt (pulmonary congestion) and alveolar hypoventilation (low TV) given the elevated A-a gradient (217; nl for age = 15.3).

He was intubated and had a swan placed and was found to have a low CI (1.7).
Patient had aortic balloon pump placed because of low cardiac output and impaired forward flow.
He had a temp max of 100.6 which we thought could be a pneumonitis from intubation causing gastric contents to irritate his lungs and cause a fever.
We started him on vancomycin and zosyn.
He was on a heparin drip because he was on the balloon pump.
On [**8-23**] pt was taken to the OR and underwent MV repair with #32 [**Company 1543**] ring resection of P2.
He arrived from OR fully vented on pressor and inotropes.
He remained intubated, sedated and on pressors and inotropes for several days.
All gtts were weaned off slowly.
He developed post-op afib and was started on amiodarone.
His sedation was weaned off and he eventually extubated on POD #4.
On night of POD#3 he had 2min seizure that was treated with propofol and ativan.
Pain meds were adjusted and he was seen by the Psych service for his depression and Wellbutrin was increased.
He was thrombocytopenic while IABP was in this had since resolved and he was started on anticoagulation for his a-fib.
His antibiotics were adjusted and he was treated with a course of meropenem at the recommendations of ID.
He developed intermittant atrial fibrillation and his lopressor was increased and he was started on amiodarone and coumadin.
he did convert to sinus rhythm and will continue on coumadin therapy upon discharge.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without incident.
By the time of discharge on POD #9 the patient was ambulating independently,  the sternal wound was healing with scant serosanguinous drainage from the distal [**2-5**] and he was placed on Keflex.
Pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
