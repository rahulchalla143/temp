With the help of a glidewire, the catheter was then advanced into the right hepatic artery and another arteriogram was performed.
The catheter was then repositioned into the left hepatic artery and another arteriogram was performed in several projections.
The catheter was then repositioned into the gastroduodenal artery and arteriogram was performed.
The catheter was then repositioned into the splenic artery and arteriogram was performed in multiple different projections.
