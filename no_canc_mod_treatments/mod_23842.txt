He experienced intermittent bouts of rapid atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone in addition to beta blockade.
Due to persistent bouts of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation, Coumadin was started and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 and 2.5.
Due to postoperative blood loss, he was transfused with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Over several days, beta blockade was advanced for rate control and medical therapy was optimized.
Amiodarone was slowly titrated accordingly.
He continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day seven.
At discharge, his INR was therapeutic and Coumadin followup was arranged and confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via his medical assistant [**Doctor Last Name **].
At discharge, all surgical incisions were clean, dry and intact.
