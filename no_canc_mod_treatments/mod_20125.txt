Urine culture was positive for vancomycin sensitive enterococcus five days after admission; antibiotics were not changed with this result given the above regimen.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed as well which revealed a gradient of 1.1 consistent with cirrhosis and borderline transudative process.
A difficult ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed which revealed marked steatosis with abundant intracellular hyalin and neutrophilic reaction.
Ciprofloxacin was added and later discontinued for SBP prophylaxis.
Caspofungin was started for possible fungal coverage.
Vancomycin, flayl, and zosyn were started, gram negative rod coverage.
The patient's blood pressure simultaneously dropped and she was unable to defend her blood pressures with aggressive fluid boluses.
In the intensive care unit, the patient did not require pressors to maintain her blood pressure because she responded well to several liters of iv fluids.
Antibiotics were continued, including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, caspofungin, and vancomycin.
Because of the patient's drug reaction to zosyn the strategy was to limit antibiotic exposure.
Flagyl was discontinued when c.diff was negative.
Post pyloric feeding tube was placed because the patient was unable to tolerate POs secondary to nausea.
Flagyl was discontinued with the thought of possible relation to mental status changes.
