He had already received 4 weeks IV antibiotics including vancomycin and Levaquin, with a set of blood cultures the prior week that were negative.
He was continued on IV vancomycin during his admission; Levaquin was d/c as he had completed his full course of therapy.
We consulted Neurosurgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] to assess the need for surgical treatment, and the pt underwent L4-L5 spinal fusion with disc biopsy on [**2187-12-21**].
Post-op pain was controlled initially with Dilaudid PCA, but was transitioned after a few days to oral methadone for long-acting analgesia, with good pain control.
He will require 5 weeks of continued IV vancomycin to treat his L4/L5 osteomyelitis.
Will need to continue vancomycin 750 mg q48s after hemodialysis for goal trough of 15-20 (day 14/42 on discharge).
Today vancomycin 33.5.
We stopped the long-acting opioids initially and used morphine for analgesia.
At discharge, pt is on oxycodone 5 mg q4-6 hrs prn with good pain control.
We should continue to avoid long acting opioids as likely major contributor to confusion.
At discharge, pt is mentating better, though sundowns with hallucinations and with agitation.
He is on Haldol standing as well as prn.
Seroquel and Paxil were d/cd during this admission.
However, pt had episodes of hypoglycemia on insulin at home, and so insulin had been discontinued before admission.
He was continued on outpt regimen of Norvasc, metoprolol, lisinopril, hydralazine; metoprolol was titrated up to 100mg TID, with good BP response.
After episode of post-op hypotension, BP meds were held until the pt was stabilized and sent to the Medicine floor.
Metoprolol and lisinopril were added initially.
R subclavian line was then placed with good positioning.
The pt was started on Neo-Synephrine gtt for hypotension with good response, and was transferred to the MICU.
He required Neo-Synephrine for BP support for 3 days; the drip was weaned to off on [**12-23**], and the pt was transferred back to the Medical floor.
After his episode of hypotension, BP meds were held until BP increased and required resumption of meds, as above.
He had been requiring increased opioids for pain before admission, which may have been contributing to increased confusion.
On admission, long-acting methadone was discontinued and pain was treated w/ IV morphine prn, with good pain control.
Post-operatively, pain was managed with Dilaudid PCA, which was then transitioned to methadone and then to oxycodone prn.
However, it trended down continuously during his stay to a nadir of 26, likely secondary to hemodilution as a result of continuous fluid therapy.
He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs during hemodialysis on [**2187-12-25**], with good HCT response.
He was also treated with Procrit during HD sessions.
He will require continued Procrit therapy during hemodialysis.
Paxil and Seroquel were discontinued.
Haldol prn and standing.
Definitive treatment would require parathyroidectomy, which may be indicated when acute issues resolved.
He will require follow-up for monitoring of serum calcium.
He is on hemodialysis on Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday.
He will need to continue hemodialysis after d/c on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
Pt was refusing tube feedings a majority of the time but was accepting them at the end.
Getting NS eye drops.
