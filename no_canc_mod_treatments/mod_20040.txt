She became hypotensive and was briefly on neosynephrine, but weaned off.
During her stay, she fell from bed and fractured both her left hip and left humeral neck.
The hip has been surgically repaired by ORIF, but not the humerus, with post-op delirium (pain meds) and 19pt hct drop (hematoma to back/thighs [**2-22**] to asa and lovenox use).
During course, also briefly intubated for hypercarbic resp failure, then weaned to bipap.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management, where she was found to be in respiratory distress and was quickly intubated for ventilatory support.

2) Lucency at the greater tuberosity, probably a non-displaced fracture.
At this point, in discussion with the family, it was decided the best course would be to perform a tracheostomy and have Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 62034**] be discharge to a rehab facility for prolonged rehabilitation and ventilator weaning.
As her sedation was weaned, she was initially started on haloperidol for agitation on the ventilator, but once she was trached this became unecessary as well.
By the time of discharge, she was off of haloperidol and all sedating medicaitons and was clearing.
)Ortho -- Pt is s/p hemiarthroplasty of left hip at the OSH.
Following immobilization, the focus was on pain control, which was achieved with IV fentanyl.
This was converted to a fentanyl patch with sc hydromorphone as needed for breakthrough pain.
)FEN -- She was placed on tube-feeds and advanced to goal without residuals.
)Hyperglycemia -- Related to her steroid use, she was placed on sliding scale insulin that will need to be titrated down at the rehab as she comes off the taper.
