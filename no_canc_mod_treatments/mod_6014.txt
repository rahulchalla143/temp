The patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting, and on [**9-5**], he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery disease times two.
In summary the patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting times two with a LIMA to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
He remained hemodynamically stable; however, he did require Neo-Synephrine to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
On postoperative day #1, an attempt was made to wean the patient from his Neo-Synephrine; however, his blood pressure dipped as the Neo-Synephrine was weaned, and he was left on the drip and therefore left in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #1.
On postoperative day #2, this patient was successfully weaned from his Neo-Synephrine.
His chest tubes were discontinued, and he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Following chest tube removal, routine chest x-ray showed a left pneumothorax.
