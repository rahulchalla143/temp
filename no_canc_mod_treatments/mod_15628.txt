She had a hypotensive episode of a systolic blood pressure down to 80 requiring four liters of Crystalloid and one unit of packed red blood cells.
A CT scan of her head was obtained after a ventriculostomy drain had been placed and that demonstrated the following: Acute thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage on the right with mass effect and a leftward trans-falcine herniation as well as diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in multiple sulci of both cerebral hemispheres and along the tentorium.
A right sided ventriculostomy catheter was present in the tip of the right lateral ventricle.
From a Neurological standpoint, she was admitted for serial neurological examinations with cervical spine precautions.
She was admitted for intracranial pressure monitoring with ventriculostomy and treatment of this intracranial hypertension with Mannitol and sedation to maximize her cerebral perfusion pressure and minimize her ICP.
A pulmonary artery catheter was to be placed if close monitoring of her volume status would be required.
Given the fact that she had potential pulmonary contusions and a lung injury, she was to be kept with plateau pressures less than 30 on light protective ventilation.
Her fluids were to be maintained as iso-osmolar and her prophylaxis included pneumoboots and Pepcid.
An immediate Neurosurgical consultation was also obtained for placement of a ventriculostomy drain.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where a right ventriculotomy drain was placed by Neurosurgery.
The patient was placed on Kefzol for antibiotic prophylaxis.
She was also started on Sucralfate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
Given her posturing and ventriculostomy drainage, she was continued on Mannitol until her sodium was greater than 150 or her osmolarity was greater than 320.
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed and, on SICU day number three, the patient was placed in a Pentobarbital coma after sedation paralysis and Mannitol failed to control her intracranial pressures, which were intermittently up to 30 with compromised cerebral perfusion pressures.
She was continued on Mannitol and she was also started on Norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure such that her cerebral perfusion pressures would be greater than 70 in the face of elevated intracranial pressures.
The patient was continued on mechanical ventilation and was also started on vasopressin because she developed central diabetes insipidus with large amounts of extremely hyperosmolar urine.
She was transfused packed red blood cells to maintain her hematocrit greater than 30.
She was continued on the Pentobarb coma for 24 hours but because her intracranial pressures remained elevated up to 40 to 50 despite burst suppression and a pentobarbital coma and continued therapy with Mannitol as well as vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures, the pentobarbital was stopped.
The patient was, at this point, started on Zosyn as well because she developed fevers overnight with sputums that were growing Gram positive cocci and a concern for a pneumonia in the setting of pentobarbital coma.
She also began to maintain her mean arterial pressures in the 100 range off of any vasopressors.
She was continued on the vasopressin for her central diabetes insipidus and by SICU day number ten, an attempt was made to turn off the vasopressin with return of large amounts of urine, approximately 400 cc.
in 20 minutes, hence, reinstitution of her vasopressin for persistent central diabetes insipidus.
She was on a pressure support mode for ventilation, and she was on total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was begun on tube feeds on SICU day number eleven and underwent a four vessel angiogram on SICU day number eleven to evaluate for cervical blood vessel injury from her trauma.
She was started on aspirin for this and a Stroke Service consultation was obtained.
Her tube feeds were then advanced to goal and her total parenteral nutrition was stopped.
Her ventriculostomy drain was subsequently clamped and removed and the family was approached about the direction of her care.
They had an extensive discussion with the Intensive Care Unit team where they decided to continue full support and a percutaneous gastrostomy tube as well as a percutaneous tracheostomy were performed on SICU day number 15, which was [**5-9**].
The patient subsequently was noted to be growing E. coli and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from her sputum and was started on antibiotics for this.
She was also started on subcutaneously DDAVP to wean her off of her vasopressin drip.
She tolerated this well and was doing fine until SICU day number 19, when she became tachycardic and moderately hypotensive and was pan cultured again for a fever and found to be growing Gram negative rods in her blood, for which she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was also found to be growing coagulase negative Staphylococcus from a central line as well as Klebsiella from her sputum.
The Vancomycin and Zosyn were begun on [**5-13**] with a plan of a 14 day course,  She subsequently had all central access removed and a PICC line placed and the patient has been doing very well since.
From a respiratory standpoint she does well on trache collar.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint, she is tolerating her tube feeds which are the following:  ProMod at 70 cc.
From a genitourinary standpoint she is requiring subcutaneous desmopressins, 2 micrograms q. eight hours for her central diabetes insipidus.
She is also on aspirin for her carotid artery injury with microembolization.
From an Infectious Disease standpoint, she is on day number eight of Vancomycin and Zosyn, requiring a completion of six more days for a 14 day course, and she has a PICC line place.
Her prophylactic medications include:  Subcutaneous heparin and venodynes.
Status post percutaneous tracheostomy.
Status post percutaneous gastrostomy.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.
Zosyn 4.5 grams intravenously q. eight.
Artificial Tears, one to two drops to each eye q. six hours and p.r.n.
Bisacodyl 10 mg p.r.
Erythropoietin 40,000 units intravenously q. week.
Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously q.
Desmopressin acetate 2 micrograms intravenously q.
Tube feeds at 70 cc.
She is to be maintained in a hard collar at all times for her cervical spine fractures.
