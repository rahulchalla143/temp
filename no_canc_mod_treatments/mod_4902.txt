You were then brought to the medical ICU when you were aspirated on your medications and were intubated and stablilized on antibiotics.
You then had difficulty swallowing, and we placed a feeding tube to nourish you.
Unfortunately, the feeding tube was pulled out and we had to place a PICC, an intravenous line, to provide you with nourishment.
We looked for concerning causes of loss of consciousness including a pulmonary embolism, as well as interrogating your pacemaker for an episode of unstable heart rates, but the studies were negative.
