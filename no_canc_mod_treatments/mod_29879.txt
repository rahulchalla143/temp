She was re-started on her home cardiac regimen in addition to Levofloxacin for the PNA.
She was given atropine 0.5 mg x 3, glucagon 5 mg x 2, 3 mg x 1, and calcium 1 amp without effect.
Cardiology was emergently consulted for possibly placing a pacing wire; however, due to her improvement during the transfer, they did not feel a temp pacing wire was indicated at this time, especially given her overall prognosis.
It was recommended that the patient continue her current diet of thin liquids and purees, as a PEG tube/NPO status will likely not not decrease her aspiration risk given her advanced dementia status.
DM 6. anxiety 7. s/p CVA 8. h/o of PVD s/p bilaterally AKA 9.

She was started on her home cardiac regimen of metoprolol XL 25mg once daily on [**2124-3-10**] AM.

During transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and placement of foley catheter and arterial line, the HR increased to 40s-50s with increase in systolic blood pressure to 110-140s.
All beta blockers were held.
Per cardiology consult, no need for transcutaneous pacer was warranted given her poor prognosis.
Considered MRI/MRA to evaluate for further progression of vascular dementia if mental status were to deteriorate; however, MS improved back to baseline after bradycardia resolved.
Imdur was also changed to isosorbide dinitrate as imdur cannot be crushed.
Afib - Held coumadin for supertherapeutic INR; restarted when INR<2.
