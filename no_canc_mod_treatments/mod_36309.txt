Previously he has used cocaine and heroin IV, and he is currently sexually active with women.
He was started on ceftriaxone.
His ceftriaxone was switched over to IV vancomycin as per ID.
Aggressive fluid resuscitation was used to maintain his blood pressure, and the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
Retroperitoneal density and retroperitoneal adenopathy were also noted.
In light of the MRSA positive cultures his antibiotic coverage was expanded to include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
The patient's central line was discontinued and a PICC line was placed for long-term antibiotic therapy.
On the floor, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Flagyl and vancomycin.
The patient continued to remain afebrile.
On the night of [**2-17**] the patient became lethargic and was started on rifamycin for possible encephalopathy.
For this ID was consulted again, and they recommended discontinuing the current PICC line and adding dactinomycin to cover both VRE and MRSA.
So, consistent with these recommendation, on [**2112-2-26**] vancomycin was discontinued and dactinomycin was initiated.
In order to control this edema, his furosemide dose was increased and the patient was continued on his dactinomycin.
On the 12th, surgery was also consulted for possible lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma to explain his thrombocytopenia and his lower extremity edema.
The patient remained stable and on current therapy until [**2112-3-2**] at which time he spiked to a temperature of 101.9.
His Foley was discontinued, and the patient was started on Diflucan and levofloxacin empirically.
Blood cultures subsequently found gram-negative rods in his blood, and he failed his trial of void for which a Foley was re-placed with a 22 French coude catheter, and ceftazidime was added to the antibiotic regimen.
The patient had also been started on lactulose p.o.
The patient had received 3 liters of crystalloid boluses in order to maintain his blood pressure.
PO Flagyl and ciprofloxacin IV were also added to his antibiotic regimen at that time.

On [**2112-3-11**] the patient was again transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of platelets, 3 units of FFP, and cryoprecipitate in order to maintain hemodynamic and coagulation status.
On [**3-12**], propofol and fentanyl were discontinued.
The patient was being maintained solely on Levophed and Pitressin for blood pressure support; but once again platelets dropped precipitously down to 19 from 50.
On [**3-14**], the patient's renal and hepatic failure continued to worsen as well as progressive necrosis noted in his lower extremity, and the team decided to discuss with the family the futility of ongoing aggressive measures in this patient and ongoing care which in their opinion would futile.
The patient was transfused a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells that night, 3 units of platelets, and 7 units of FFP.
The patient also required increasing doses of pressors in order to maintain blood pressure.
The patient continued to require increasing doses of pressors with less response.
