MRI abdomen (w/o contrast): The entire pancreas is swollen and edematous, of heterogeneous but increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequence.
It is noted that the images are degraded by artifacts, and subtle hepatic lesions for example cannot be excluded.
Complications such as splenic vein thrombosis, pancreatic necrosis and/or pseudoaneurysm formation are unable to be evaluated on non-contrast study.
There is a Foley catheter within a normally distended bladder.
Essentially stable pancreatitis, within the limitations of a non-contrast examination.
#  Pancreatitis:  She was treated with dilaudid PCA, NPO, and IVF resuscitation.
She underwent three seperate CT abd/pelvis--two of which were done with IV contrast.

She advanced to regular diet, though she still experienced some bouts of nausea and vomiting, for which she received Zofran ODT, which she will be discharged with this as a PRN medication.
She required intubation for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Given the multiple possible causes of her respiratory failure, she was treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and with ARDS-like ventilation protocol.
Her anti-biotic coverage included broad spectrum antibiotics (Aztreonam, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin) to cover for a possible HAP.
The patient was intubated for 3 days, and extubated without complication.
She was transferred to the wards, where she was weaned off of all supplemental oxygen.
A dilaudid PCA was used along with neurontin, tizanidine, and a lidocaine patch.
After extubation and with improvement in her renal function, low-dose MS Contin was restarted.
She continued using the lidocaine patch.
Given PCN allergy, pt was treated with 3 day course of IV vancomycin with subsequent urine cultures with no growth.
These medications were held upon transfer to the ICU in the setting of acute renal failure and altered mental status.
Methylmalonic acid was nml.
