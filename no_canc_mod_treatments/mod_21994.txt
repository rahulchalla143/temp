Per [**Hospital3 **] records during [**Month (only) 547**] admission, the patient was admitted for jaundice with a bilirubin peak of 38.8, which was down to 21.9 when he signed himself out against medical advice.
Propranolol 10 mg p.o.
Pentoxifylline 400 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Spironolactone 100 mg p.o.
Chest x-ray:  ET tube 4 cm above the carina, NG tube in place, 1-cm nodule in the right mid lung zone, bibasilar atelectasis.
Thus he was continued on lactulose.
His Lasix, spironolactone and propranolol were held due to hypotension and hyperkalemia.
He was continued on thiamine and folate and showed no evidence of withdrawal.
Initial ABG consistent with a persistent respiratory acidosis, thus his ventilator settings were manipulated overnight to improve ventilation and his pH subsequently responded.
He was maintained on scheduled nebulizers and initially started on 120 mg Solu-Medrol t.i.d.
Large volume paracentesis did not improve his respiratory mechanics.
In addition, Lasix diuresis caused elevation of the creatinine and thus was not tolerated.
Initial concern for prerenal failure due to hypovolemia in the setting of hypotension, however, as his urine output improved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support; however, his creatinine again later in the course of his hospital stay began to rise.
His bladder pressure at that time was noted to be 23, a large volume paracentesis failed to result in a improvement in his creatinine and thus he was started on midodrine and octreotide for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
As volume became an issue, Lasix diuresis was attempted; however, his creatinine bumped in response to this and no further Lasix was attempted.
He ultimately required hemodialysis for an increasing metabolic acidosis.
His worsening renal failure was attributed to likely a dense ATN in the setting of his hypotension requiring pressor support.
Sepsis:  The patient initially started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl for concern for SBP versus aspiration pneumonia.
His initial paracentesis was not consistent with SBP and his chest x-ray remained negative for infiltrate.
Nevertheless, he was continued on levofloxacin for a presumed pneumonia.
Blood cultures remained negative until later in his hospital admission following successful wean off of his initial pressors including dopamine and vasopressin, at which time, his blood cultures became positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
Nevertheless, as stated above, following wean off of dopamine and vasopressin, the patient again became hypotensive.
He was restarted on Levophed as blood and urine subsequently grew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
He was thus continued on linezolid and Ceptaz for a possible SBP and Flagyl for a possible Clostridium difficile in the setting of ongoing diarrhea.
Despite line changes and continued antibiotic support, the patient subsequently became fungemic.
He was started on caspofungin.
I was discussed with the patient's girlfriend regarding the futility of further fluid boluses or manipulation of his pressors.
He was continued on lactulose with minimal improvement.
Steroid-induced hyperglycemia:  The patient continued on a Regular sliding scale insulin for blood sugar control.
Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase:  During the course of the patient's admission, his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased concerning for obstructive-like picture.
The patient received DDAVP, cryo and FFP to alleviate bleeding.
FEN:  The patient started on tube feeds on [**2153-3-19**].
He received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia and was started on Renagel for hyperphosphatemia.
He required frequent free water boluses for hyponatremia.
