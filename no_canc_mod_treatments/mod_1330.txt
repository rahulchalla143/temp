HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] ([**2186-11-11**] through [**2186-11-27**]) with left sided pneumonia requiring intubation for airway protection and bronchoscopy for aspiration of a mucus plug and re-expansion of a collapsed lobe.
She also had acute renal failure during that hospital stay attributed to receiving intravenous dye as well as decompensation of her congestive heart failure requiring nesiritide and furosemide infusions.
Finally, her hospital stay was complicated by MRSA urinary tract infection for which she had a percutaneous inserted central catheter and received a course of Vancomycin intravenously.
On discharge, the patient's code status was made DNR/DNI, however, on arrival to the outside hospital with complaints very similar to those listed above, specifically respiratory distress preceding two days of shortness of breath, she and her husband asked that her code status be reversed.
Her blood gas in the Emergency Department of said hospital was 7.23, 57, 227 without documentation of ventilatory settings.
The EMS documentation reports that she received a total of furosemide 80 mg, midazolam 2 mg, pancuronium, morphine sulfate 2 mg, and succinylcholine as well as nitro paste.
In our Emergency Department, the patient received another 2 mg of Morphine, and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2185-10-28**] initially when she refused intervention at that time, she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit due to systolic congestive heart failure requiring intubation.
See below for interval echocardiographic results.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Indeed her husband states in her presence that she does not taking hydralazine as prescribed every six hours, but takes it approximately every eight.
Aspirin 325 mg daily.
Isosorbide mononitrate 20 mg daily.
Hydralazine 50 mg every six hours for which she takes every three hours.
Furosemide 40 mg twice daily, however, she does not recall having this medication prescribed for her.
Calcium acetate 675 mg daily.
Albuterol and Atrovent.
Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube are in place.
Extremities:  There is a right femoral vein catheter in place oozing a little bit of blood.
Blood, urea, and nitrogen 28, creatinine 1.9.
Arterial blood gas on ventilatory settings was described at 7.37, 48, 142.
Decompensated congestive heart failure:  The patient was subjected to diuresis with furosemide over the first two days; approximately 3 kg of fluid were removed.
Once the patient achieves her dry weight, furosemide 100 mg twice daily was instituted along with metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily along with her nitrate and hydralazine regimen of 50 mg every six hours and isosorbide mononitrate 10 mg twice daily.
Chronic renal failure:  The patient tolerated diuresis adequately.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient was placed initially on pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily.
Aspirin therapy was reinitiated.
A separate list of discharge medications should be included in that as well as Visiting Nurses Association arrangements to make sure the patient takes the stable cardiac medication regimen.
