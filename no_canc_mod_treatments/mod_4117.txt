Admission Date:  [**2127-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-9-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Red Dye / Gabapentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Cough, Dyspnea, and Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 55 yo female with history of hypocomplimentemia (C3 and C4), necrobiosis lipoidica with chronic leg ulcers on long term immunosuppressant, multiple past admissions for pneumonia presents with complaints of productive cough and dyspnea for approximately 2 weeks, worse over the last 3-4 days.
Patient was given vancomycin and zosyn.
She was given hydrocortisone due to chronic prednisone use.
Past Medical History: -Notable for cyclic neutropenia -Raynaud's phenomenon -hypothyroidism -sicca keratitis -MGUS -chronic anemia/pancytopenia -chronic right tibial wound, necrobiosis lipoidica -connective tissue disease, not otherwise specified -hypothyroidism.
-hypocomplimentemia (C3 and C4) -Depression  Social History: No smoking, drinking, drug use.
Given history of multiple pneumonias in the past, she was started empirically on vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin.
She was started on hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6hrs with SBP's in the 90's given concern for adrenal insufficeincy due to history of chronic prednisone use.
Based on history of recurrent pneumonias, she was dischaged on levofloxacin to complete a total of 10 day course of antibiotc therapy.
Both starins were sensitive to levofloxacin with a MAC of 0.25.
Continued on home prednisone dose of 20 mg qday by time of discharge.
Should continue to follow with outpatient rheumatologist and hematology physicians.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] held home pain meds given altered mental status; gave morphine IV PRN in the ICU.
Received MS contin 30 mg TID while in house, and patient reported being severely underdosed accompanied with chronic lower extremity/ankle pain.
Patient should be reevaluated for appropriate pain management, as outpatient regimen appears to be on extremely high doses of morphine, taking MS Contin 60 mg TID and Morphine Immediate Release 30 mg 1-2 tablets TID, approaching daily values of morphine as high as 360mg per day.
Alternatives to pain management should be sought, including pain specialist consultation for possible spinal injection.
Additionally, would benefit from phyiscal therapy and other pain relieving alternative such as gabapentin given patient's neuropathic nature of her lower extremity pain.
Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine 50 mcg while in house.
Asthma: given nebulizers as needed for shortness of breath.
Patient is very heavily medicated and on multpile sedating medications, including narcotics and benzodiazepines.
Should strongly consider alternatives to pain management in this patient, as she appears to be psychologically and possibly physically addicted to her current regimen.
Additionally, became very defensive and agitated when not receiving her furosemide for her "lower extremity swelling".
Does have minor swelling on physical exam, but given poor PO intake and nutritional deficits, may benefit from decreased dosing of 20 mg instead of 40 mg, or PRN dosing instead of daily.
