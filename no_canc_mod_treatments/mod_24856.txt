MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present.
The tricuspid prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted [**2134-1-31**] for bridge from coumadin with heparin drip.
She was transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative management.
In the first few hours she had significant ventricular ectopy that was treated with amiodarone boluses and drip with improvement however underlying rhythm was complete heart block and continued to be paced with epicardial wires.
She remained intubated overnight for hemodynamics and was extubated the morning of postoperative day one.
She was started on lasix for diuresis due to pulmonary edema and continued amiodarone.
Electrophysiology was consulted for rhythm management and she was placed on lidocaine drip with improvement but continued runs on ventricular tachycardia that worsened with activity.
Pain medications were adjusted, she was weaned off lidocaine and started on betablockers for rhythm management.
She was restarted on coumadin for history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation.
She was continued to be diuresed for pulmonary edema, however was noted to have hyponatremia with sodium to 122 with no clear cause that was treated with hypertonic saline and saline tabs and sodium improved however pulmonary edema worsened.
Her oxygen requirements increased and she continued to require aggressive diuresis and non invasive ventilation for few days.
She continues on intravenous lasix for diuresis via PICC line that she is being discharged to rehab with, and plan for PICC removal when no longer requires IV lasix.
