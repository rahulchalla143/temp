HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical problems and a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital status post myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
She was initially seen in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 1196**] and was evaluated and treated for left foot cellulitis the patient had for approximately one month.
(a)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2139**] with a left internal mammary artery to first diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery and obtuse marginal.
(b)  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2141**] with pericarditis.
Status post right carotid endarterectomy in [**2141**].
Status post a left carotid endarterectomy in [**2145-4-3**].
The patient has undergone a left femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2144**] with a left iliac angioplasty in [**2133**].
The patient is status post left anterior cerebral infarction from left endarterectomy with minimal residual.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Please see Past Medical History; in addition to a cholecystectomy in [**2099**] and a cesarean section times two.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications at the time of transfer to the Cardiac Service included)  1.

Calcitriol 0.25 mcg by mouth once per day.
The patient was intubated and given 180 mg of Lasix.
At this time, the patient was begun on intravenous heparin and 2-beta 3-A inhibitor.
The saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was patent with diffuse distal branch disease and 90% stenosis of the posterolateral branch.
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery was patent throughout.
Her post myocardial infarction course was complicated by recurrent pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure requiring afterload reduction and diuretics for improvement, diminished renal output secondary to hypoperfusion and microvascular disease, with a peak creatinine of 2.4, and difficulty with swallowing which was evaluated by a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
Recommendations were a regular diet with thick liquids and the patient to be sitting up when eating.
On [**9-24**], after Mucomyst and intravenous hydration protocol, an arteriogram which demonstrated abdominal aorta with moderate diffuse disease.
Because of the patient's renal failure, she did require a hemodialysis catheter placement and dialysis was begun for volume control.
After review of the arteriograms, the patient was transferred to the Vascular Service on [**10-1**] after undergoing a left AK popliteal to anterior tibial bypass with reversed saphenous vein.
She required adjustment in her diuresis.
She required multiple adjustments in her antihypertensive medications and beta blockers to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 120s to 150s.
On [**10-8**], the patient underwent a transmetatarsal amputation without complications.
A right internal jugular Perm-A-Cath was placed on [**10-10**].
A right renal artery stenting bilaterally with both arteries of the superior and lower arteries and a left renal artery stenting was done without complications.
On [**10-13**], she did require one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.
On [**10-14**], angiotensin receptor blocker and beta blockers were adjusted because of persistent systolic hypertension.
