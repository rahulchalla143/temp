She was unable to get him to take Ativan SL.
He again refused Ativan SL.
Of note, he did have 1 seizure yesterday morning at 1:00 am, which responded to Ativan 0.5 mg SL.
He denies missing any medication doses or self-tapering any medications recently.
He was initially started on Dilantin, which was transitioned to [**Year (4 digits) 17802**] because of side effects on Dilantin (unsteadiness, memory problems).
[**Name2 (NI) **] Lamictal was added but he self-discontinued that medication because of sleep and GI problems.
However, Gabpentin was restarted the beginning of [**1-14**].
The patient has had multiple recent admissions for seizure clusters: he was most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 17814**] with 3 GTCs waking him from sleep, in the setting of self-tapering [**Date range (1) 17802**] to 200/300 for concerns of sleepiness, poor concentration, and memory difficulty.
Prior to this he was admitted [**Date range (1) 17815**] for increased seizure frequency in the days prior to admission and for delusional thoughts/aggressive behavior.
Psychiatry was consulted and thought his symptoms were most likely a post-ictal syndrome given temporal relation to seizure cluster.
He was treated empirically for bacterial meningitis, but CSF cultures eventually came back with no growth.
