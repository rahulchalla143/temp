He was given CPR for 8 minutes, although the records document a pulse at one minute, and he received epinephrine, after which he had Vtach at 192, for which pt was loaded with amiodarone and started on amiodarone gtt.
He was continued on amiodarone and given levofloxacin for abx coverage.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt's VS were stable, however he was noticed to have left arm twitching and blood at the corner of his mouth.

Troponin was elevated in the setting of renal failure but had no ECG changes.
The patient was initially was dobutamine and dopamine for pressor support and then later to levophed which was discontinued after 2nd hospital day.
He was continued on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days for presumed adrenal insufficiency which was started prior to arrival to the MICU.
# Seizure/anoxic brain injury/stroke - Most likely [**1-13**] anoxic brain injury in setting of cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion to brain as well as later repeat MRI brain on [**5-10**] showed a new right posterior temporal/superior parietal/occipital regions, posterior to the chronic infarct, which was the culprit for seizure/twitching.
He was loaded with 1gm of dilantin initially and was continued on 100mg iv q8h which achieved a good therapeutic dilantin level.
His twitching improved with dilantin but still continued to have intermittent eye twitching.
Pt was switched to po dilantin on [**5-16**] and repeat dilantin level after 2 days of po dilantin was 12.4.
Continue current dilantin dosing.
Continued ventilation and aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet.
Chest tube to suction, and IP injected tPA x 4 days break up to loculation and further facilitate drainage.
- Pt was continue on Aztreonam 1 gm q8 for E.coli PNA c/b empyema during last admission, course until [**2141-5-28**].
Sputum was also growing MRSA and started vancomycin on [**2141-5-6**], last day at least [**2141-5-28**].
Vancomycin was held on [**2141-5-22**] with plans for dosing by level given renal insufficiency.
-  Chest tube # 2 was removed on [**2141-5-19**] after confirming no air leak and no further drainage.
However, Chest tube #1 continued to have air leak and drainage.
The right sided chest tube was placed to water seal on [**2141-5-22**] with a chest xray that showed a stable pneumothorax and no significant change or worsening with re-expansion of the right lung.
Please continue to keep chest tube in place until there is no longer an air leak present.
The Chest tube may be removed at that time.
Please continue IV Vanco and IV Aztreonam for 2 additional weeks (end date [**2141-6-6**]) to complete a total of a 6 wk course of Abx for his empyema.
# h/o CHF - EF 15%, was on afterload agents including BB, Isordil, digoxin, hydralazine.
Initially, all were held given pressor-dependent hypotension.The patient was restarted on BB and was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix and lasix gtt.
The lasix gtt was discontinued on [**2141-5-22**] and the patient was transitioned to lasix 100 mg IV TID and diuril 500 mg IV BID with goal -500 to 1 liter each day.
In the future, this high dose of lasix may not be beneficial and consideration should be made for bumex + diuril.
# Anemia-  The patient required intermittent blood transfusion for drifting down hct which was partially attributed to phlebotomy.
However, he had bleeding from trach site for which he underwent bronch on [**5-15**] and showed suction trauma with granulation tissues at the carina without any active bleeding.
He was given vitamin K. IP repeated bronch on [**5-16**] which only showed slight trach displacement with was repositioned and only saw granuation tissues.
However, H2 blocker was switched to iv PPI.
# h/o C diff colitis - Flagyl was discontinued on arrival to the ICU given its ability to lower the seizure threshold.
Anticoagulation was held given the low hematocrit and concern for GI bleed in addition to acute stroke, ?
The patient is on ASA 325 mg. .
# F/E/N - with G tube on tube feeds, monitor lytes .
