In light of his diabetes and three vessel disease, the decision was made to refer him to cardiac surgery for definitive intervention.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for diabetes mellitus with neuropathy and nephropathy, high cholesterol, nephrolithiasis status post left ureteral stent with lithotripsy, benign prostatic hypertrophy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as recently as two weeks ago, positive exercise treadmill test, recent burn to his left foot.
MEDICATIONS:  Mavik 2 mg po q day, Pravachol 20 mg po q day, Glucophage 1,000 mg po bid, Glucotrol 10 mg q a.m., 20 mg q p.m., Aspirin.
They noted that he has a left first and second dorsal digital wound secondary to a thermal burn and they recommended that we continue treating this with wet to dry dressings changed twice a day.
On [**2101-7-11**] the patient was admitted through same day surgery for coronary artery bypass graft times three.
His grafts are as follows: LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Postoperatively the patient was taken intubated to the cardiac surgery Intensive Care Unit on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
His oral and intravenous Amiodarone were continued and an electrophysiology consult was obtained.
They recommended that the patient be continued on Amiodarone and in the event that he continues to have paroxysmal episodes of atrial fibrillation, that he be anticoagulated.
The following day his chest tube and central line were removed and his beta blocker was increased for a higher than normal resting heart rate in the 80's.
He had further episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on the floor and for this reason the decision to start Coumadin was made in the event that he stays in a sinus rhythm for the next 1-2 months.
In addition he worked with physical therapy, they noted that he may benefit from a stay at a short term rehabilitation facility.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 10 mg q a.m., 20 mg q p.m., Glucophage 1,000 mg [**Hospital1 **], Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg q day, Lasix 20 mg po bid times 7 days, potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid times 7 days, Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], hold for heart rate less than 60, systolic blood pressure less than 100, Amiodarone 400 mg q day, Pravachol 20 mg q day, Coumadin 2 mg q day; this may require dosing adjustment as the patient's Amiodarone interacts with the Coumadin and was at a higher dose while he was in the hospital.
Three vessel coronary disease, now status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
