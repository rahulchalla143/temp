HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), with aortic valve replacement in [**2113**], with known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and reactive airway disease who has a history of falls.
The patient presents status post a mechanical fall at home with subsequent left leg pain and deformity.
The patient was assessed and stabilized in the Emergency Department and was subsequently brought to the operating room for an open reduction/internal fixation of his left intertrochanteric fracture on [**1-9**].
The patient was subsequently difficult to wean from sedation and remained intubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit following surgery.
The patient had received metizoline and Fentanyl intraoperatively and 10 mg of morphine postoperatively.
A phenylephrine drip was started, and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he subsequently was extubated.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient had improved oxygenation, having adequate oxygen saturations on oxygen via nasal cannula at 3 liters to 4 liters.
He required multiple normal saline boluses to maintain his urine output at greater than 20 cc per hour.
He did have an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on [**1-9**] and required one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 28.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement with a Porcine valve in [**2123**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy; status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Recurrent mechanical falls; status post right hip fracture with open reduction/internal fixation and fracture of the ramus.
Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Singulair 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Albuterol 2 puffs inhaled four times per day.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement) with known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a history of falls who presented with a left femur intertrochanteric fracture after a mechanical fall at home.
The patient required open reduction/internal fixation of his left femur and subsequent Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.
ORTHOPAEDIC ISSUES:  The patient was status post left femur open reduction/internal fixation.
A Physical Therapy consultation was ordered to facilitate rehabilitation.
Tylenol was continued for pain management.
This beta blocker was continued throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay and was continued at the time of discharge.
A phenylephrine drip was started.
Upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned from the phenylephrine drip, and his blood pressure returned to his baseline with intravenous fluids.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient required two units of packed red blood cells perioperatively.
With regard to the patient's anticoagulation, the patient did initially receive Coumadin 5 mg by mouth while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Coumadin was held for the remainder of his hospital stay, and his INR trended down toward the goal of 1.5 to 2.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**] will follow his anticoagulation status during his stay at rehabilitation and subsequently.
He had no obvious signs of infection after surgery, and the patient was continued on cefazolin intravenously q.8h.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient required intravenous fluids to maintain his urine output at greater than 20 cc to 30 cc per hour.
The patient required repletion of his potassium several times during his hospital stay.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient required 4 liters of oxygen through nasal cannula at the time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He remained on 4 liters for the next days.
He was intermittently wheezing during this time and did require albuterol nebulizer treatments on several occasions.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and anticoagulation throughout his hospital stay.
Tylenol 325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h.
Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day (hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 or a heart rate of less 60).
Levothyroxine 25 mcg by mouth every day.
Albuterol nebulizer inhaled q.6h.
Albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.4-6h.
Docusate sodium 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Montelukast 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Warfarin 1 mg by mouth at hour of sleep (to be started n [**1-13**] with INR monitoring daily and dose adjustment by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**] or in house physician; with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2).
Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day as needed (for weight gain of greater than 2 kilograms or as instructed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1266**]).
