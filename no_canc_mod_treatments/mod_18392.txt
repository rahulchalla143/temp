Per outside hospital records the patient had reported that her pain was relieved after SL nitroglycerin tablets x 3 and Lopressor 5mg IV x 3.
She was also given a loading dose of Plavix 600mg in the ER and 75mg the following morning and she was started on both Integrillin and Heparin and was transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**] and found to not have any obstructive coronary disease, LV-gram showing EF closer to 30% but prominent apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy presentation.
She began to have severe hypotension during her cardiac catheterization and was started on Dopamine then switched to Neosynephrine.
In the operating room the patient was continued on Neosynephrine, and had a right internal jugular central venous line placed and failed attempt at a radial arterial line.
Intubation was uncomplicated.
The patient was also given a total of 3.5L of NS and 2 Units blood were given.
Just prior to going to the operating room with the vascular surgery team the patient was also given IVFs and 2 Units of blood in cardiac catheterization lab.
She was able to be slowly weaned off of Neosynephrine and BP was 115/70 upon presentation to the CCU.
Per vascular team, the inferior epigastric artery on the right was ligated and a hematoma was evacuated, removing roughly 500cc of blood.
Patient arrived to the CCU intubated and sedated and a few continued bouts of intermittent low blood pressures.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: negative for Diabetes, no significant dyslipidemia, but positive for age, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle 2.
In terms of recent stressors the patient reports some anxiety regarding an upcoming Glaucoma surgery and some additional stress and residual grief as she learned that her brother died several months ago.
CVP 11  GENERAL: Intubated and sedated.

Inferior epigastric artery required emergent ligation by the [**Hospital1 18**] vascular surgery team and the patient also had about 500cc blood evacuated from hematoma site.
An A-line was placed for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring and the patient had been weaned off of her pressors prior to CCU presentation.
She was given 10mg IV Lasix to optimize extubation on CCU day 2 which she tolerated well.
Fentanyl and Versed were weaned down and RSBIs were in 50 range.
The team ultimately decided not to maintain the patient on anticoagulation for her apical enlargement/thrombus risk given the recent setting of her acute hematoma and hemorrhage.
Moreover, the data on anticoagulation and thrombus/stroke reduction rates in Takotsubo population is lacking and no clear recommendations exist.
Additional cardiomyopathy etiologies were explored which included a work-up sent off for TSH, lipid profile and iron studies (hemochromatosis).
Once the patient's blood pressure and hematocrits had stabilized she was placed on additional 25mg daily Toprol XL and her home dose of 5mg Lisinopril was restarted.
CORONARIES: The patient had very minimal CAD on cardiac catheterization with 20% LAD and mild 25% RCA plaques.
Aspirin therapy was initially held in the setting of her recovery from an acute bleed but she was advised to begin taking 81mg of Aspirin daily at time of discharge.
She had an initial Hct drop from 34 to 20 which stabilized after 4 Units of blood and over 6 liters of IVF resuscitation.
DIC workup was unrevealing and given the timeline HIT was felt to be a less likely culprit.
IV sites and surgical staples were in tact,clean,non-erythematous  and without any signs of discharge.
HYPERTENSION: Initially, the patient's blood pressures were in the hypotensive range and all blood pressure medications were held.
As she stabilized by hospital day [**3-24**] she was gradually restarted on low dose Lisinopril and Toprol XL was added given her low EF and cardiomyopathy.
GLAUCOMA : While an inpatient in the CCU the patient was continued on her usual eye drops that she takes for her Glaucoma.
PROPHYLAXIS / CODE STATUS : Anticoagulation was held in the setting of a new acute bleed.
Pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis and physical therapy was called by hospital day two to help the patient ambulate better.
She was given Protonix for GI  prophylaxis in the setting of her intubation and she was given a bowel regimen of Senna and Colace to maintain regularity.
