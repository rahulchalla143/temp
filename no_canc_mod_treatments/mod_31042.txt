Admission Date:  [**2176-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-7-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-6-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Tetracycline / Darvon  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: melena  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  History of Present Illness: This is a 55 y/o F with a PMHx of MS, CAD s/p MI/LAD stent in [**10/2174**], FVL def and Prot S deficiency on coumadin, presented to an OSH with N/V/coffee ground emesis x1 week, and melena x 3 days.
An NG tube at the OSH showed coffee ground emesis, and she was placed on Protonix gtt and taken to their GI suite where an an EGD performed that saw copious blood in stomach on EGD, ?
At that time, due to her coagulopathy, no intervention was performed.
Pt was transferred to to [**Hospital1 18**] post-EGD where she received a 2nd unit of pRBC en route.
Pt had 2 large bore IV's in place at all times and was placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Her ASA, Plavix and coumadin were held.
Past Medical History: h/o GIB likely from duodenal AVMs as seen on prior capsule endoscopy Multiple Sclerosis IBS with frequent constipation CAD (MI in [**2174**]), s/p LAD stent [**10/2174**] +Factor V Leiden (requiring coumadin) Protein S deficiency h/o DVT/PE PTSD L knee arthroscopy Degenerative disc disease treated with steroid injections Asthma Chronic pelvic pain d/t post-herpetic neuralgia  Social History: Lives alone, not currently working, on disability.
<1mm depression in V4-V6, no prior to compare.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 55 y/o F with a PMHx of MS, CAD s/p MI/LAD stent in [**10/2174**], FVL def and Prot S deficiency on coumadin, presented to an OSH with melena and found to have an INR of 10. .
Pt is s/p FFP, Vit K at OSH, INR 2.7 at time of admission.
Pt had 2 large bore IV's in place at all times and was placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Her ASA, Plavix and coumadin were held.
She was maintained on PPI [**Hospital1 **].
She received Vit K at the OSH, and received 1mg Vit K IV as well as 3u FFP as above.
Her OSH hematologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding to restarting her anticoagulation in the setting of her GIB, given her hypercoagulable state of +factor V leiden and protein S deficiency.
Coumadin was resumed [**2176-6-28**] at 2mg/day, without lovenox bridge intitially.
However, INR continued to fall from 1.8 and her coumadin was increased slowly to 5 mg PO QD and lovenox bridge was started on [**2176-7-1**].
We would recommend holding the coumadin at 5mg and allowing the INR to increase slowly so as not to overshoot and precipitate a GI bleed.
Plan to continue lovenox until INR therapeutic.
# hx of CAD s/p LAD stent (last ECHO nromal w. EF 55%.
Her ASA, plavix were held, and her cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] due to the fact that patient had been on Plavix >18 months post-stent placement.
Her cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 121**], formerly at [**Last Name (un) 4068**]) agreed that Plavix was no longer needed, and to continue ASA once tolerating in regards to her GIB.
# Factor V Leiden & Protein S deficiencies Pt with a hypercoagulable state, currently on coumadin and Plavix for anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation was initially held in the setting of active GI bleed.
After discussion with her cardiologist, Plavix was discontniued indefinitely.
Since she has a stent she does require a full dose aspirin which was re-started immediately before discharge, and after consultation with the hematology service, coumadin  was restarted at a lower dose than previous.
Given the amount of vitamin K she recived at the OSH, it is likely that it will be quite some time before patient is therapeutic and her INR should be watched very closely as an outpatient to allow for the appropriate dose adjustments.
Nortriptiline was stopped and trazadone was increased to 500mg PO QHS and ambien continued at night.
# Mild asthma - cont albuterol .
# Ativan PRN - Started on klonopin during this admission.
# PPx - On lovenox, PPI [**Hospital1 **] .
