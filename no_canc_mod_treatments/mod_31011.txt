PA catheter secured in place for continued hemodynamic monitoring in the CCU.
The PA catheter balloon should not be inflated without  fluroscopic guidance as the catheter tip may migrate.
We held metoprolol given hypotension and lisinopril given [**Last Name (un) **].
Pt required inotropes on admission to maintain SBPs, weaned off.
In CCU we initiated diuresis which significantly decreased oxygen requirement back to baseline of room air.
CHF team consulted and recommended Swan Ganz with Milrinone trial, which was done and showed significant improvement (Decreased RA, RV, PA pressures, Increased CO/CI) with Milrinone.
Swan removed, PICC placed and plan is for patient to have Milrinone pump as an outpatient to provide better cardiac output.
On D/C pt was on 0.25 mcg/kg/min of Milrinone via PICC and ethacrynic acid 75mg qdaily.
In addition, we recommended pt have supplemental oxygen during long plane ride to [**State 2690**].
Pre-Milrinone Hemodynamic Measurements: RA: 9 RV: 65/11 PA: 65/31/42 PCWP: 30 CO: 3.15 CI: 1.62  Hemodynamic Measurements with Milrinone at 0.25mcg/kg/min: CVP: 2 PAP: 34/10/18 CI: 2.6  .
Atrial lead was not properly sensing afib, so Pt was only being intermittently paced.
Given loading doses of amiodarone and digoxin which helped to control his tachycardia.
We continued both digoxin and amiodarone initially but stopped Amio on [**9-2**].
Pt was initially on heparin gtt without problems, then switched to home regimen of Warfarin alone when INR > 2.
Cardioversion considered and TEE done which, unfortunately, showed a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was not pursued.
Discharged on Dig 0.125, Warfarin 2.5 mg, and milrinone as mentioned above.
#R ankle pain/erythema: Differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, gout, septic arthritis, DVT; much less likely septic arthritis given his ROM now without pain and per rheumatology and ortho will not pursue tap given low likelihood and also overlying cellulitis with fear for introducing infection from skin.
Less likely gout given he did not receive the steroids as rec?????
Given concern for possible cellulitis, we continued vancomycin day 1=[**8-26**], completed full 8 day course.
Holding colchicine for now given lower suspicion of gout and clinical improvement with abx.
On day of discharge the patient legs were significantly improved as compared to his admission.
Pt was discharged with instructions to use special support stockings.
DDx includes pre-renal azotemia in setting of sepsis, ATN secondary to hypotension, poor forward flow in setting of CHF, overdiuresis.
## TRANSITIONAL - Left Atrial Thrombus, continue Warfarin monitoring with goal INR [**1-13**] - Cont PICC Line Care and Milrinone monitoring - Lisinopril was held and not restarted during this admission due to [**Last Name (un) **] and softer [**Name (NI) 96683**] Pt needs to address with next provider whether to restart in order to optimize CHF regimen.
- Metoprolol also held during admission due to softer pressures- Pt is to readdress with next provider regarding when to restart to optimize CHF regimen  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

The right ankle pain was likely due an infection of the skin called cellulitis, which we treated with a full course of antibiotics.
The extra fluid was removed using diuretics (water pill).
Due to the progressive worsening of your congestive heart failure, you were started on a medication called Milrinone, which is given into your vein using your PICC Line.
