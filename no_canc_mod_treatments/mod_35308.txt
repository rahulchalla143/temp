Hypertensive Urgency - SBP 200 Initially treated with beta-blockers in the ED and it was unclear whether this precipitated wheezing in light of an unclear h/o asthma.
Upon arrival in the ICU, diltiazem 30 mg PO QID, followed by 60 mg PO QID was prescribed.
This led to better BP control with SBP <170.
Lisinopril was initially avoided because the patient reported that it made him sleepy.
Diltiazem was discontinued and captopril 25 mg PO TID was begun, to avoid masking any signs/symptoms of ETOH withdrawal with nodal agents.
This was switched to lisinopril 40mg daily and amlodipine 7.5mg daily was eventually added for better control.
Case management confirmed that his insurance will be able to cover these medications with minimal copays.
Pain was controlled with Tylenol and ice.
The patient was on a CIWA scale and received PO valium intermittently.
He did not require valium for CIWA>10 for at least 24 hours prior to discharge.
