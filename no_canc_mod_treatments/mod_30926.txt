The patient is on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a history of a myocardial infarction (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2185**]), congestive heart failure (systolic failure) with last ejection fraction of 40%, history of hypertension, and history of hypercholesterolemia.
The patient is very high on the list to receive a kidney and pancreas transplant.
He received one dose of levofloxacin 500 mg and Flagyl 500 mg.

Quinine 260 mg on hemodialysis days.
Creatine kinase and MB values, however, were negative times three sets over 24 hours.
Given his history of congestive heart failure and his need for kidney and pancreas transplant, an electrophysiology study was planned to evaluate whether or not he had any foci for ventricular tachycardia and whether or not he would need a defibrillator placed.
He was given dextrose and Glucagon and then juice, and his Accu-Chek increased to 211.
[**Last Name (un) **] consultation felt that because the patient had received Glucagon during this hypoglycemic episode and it did not increase his glucose levels, it was thought he was likely having episodes of hypoglycemia because of low glycogen source secondary to his poor oral intake.
This was thought to be an appropriate increase during a stressful period; however, a hemoglobin A1c level was also checked and was pending at the time of discharge.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's admission, the patient's glucose levels were within the normal range and frequently with levels of 200 to 300 given the aggressiveness with which we decreased his insulin doses to prevent hypoglycemia.
As the patient continued to eat more, his insulin was titrated up.
Therefore, infection was ruled out as a source of hypoglycemia.
They performed dialysis as needed.
The patient also had episodes of hyperkalemia for which he received Kayexalate which then caused vomiting and a questionable aspiration which caused his oxygen saturation to drop to 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula and then required a nonrebreather mask temporarily.
The patient was taken to dialysis as previously scheduled.
The patient had multiple fleeting episodes of chest pain that resolved with blood pressure management and sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient was given heparin for second rule out for myocardial infarction which was then stopped when his creatine kinase levels were negative.
From this point onward, the patient was cleared by cardiac standpoint for any future kidney and pancreas transplant.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient required oxygen for three days of his admission.
The patient was covered with levofloxacin and clindamycin for a 7-day course.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  For gastrointestinal issues, the patient was maintained on a by mouth diet.
His Lantus and sliding-scale insulin were titrated for optimal control throughout his admission.
PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was quite depressed, occasionally with poor mentation which was thought to be due to poor glucose levels and post dialysis effects.
His labetalol was increased to 300 mg by mouth twice per day, and he was frequently given hydralazine to keep his blood pressure in the range of 140 systolic.
His glucose was in the range of 150 to 200; to have his regimen titrated up by his [**Hospital **] Clinic physician as an outpatient.
He was breathing well on room air, eating and drinking, and continuing with Reglan to treat gastroparesis.
