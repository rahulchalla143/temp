EKG showed changes that were initially concerning for STEMI and pt started on heparin gtt because of this.
Cardiology reportedly saw pt & reviewed EKG in ED and felt that pt was not having ACS and that heparin was not indicated.
Additionaly, other changes, including ST depressions 1-2mm in I, V5, V6; TWI in I, aVL, biphasic T waves in V5-V6, were all unchanged from previous EKGs.)
Heart rate response was adequate, achieving 85% of maximum predicted heart rate and a rate-pressure product of [**Numeric Identifier **].
# DKA - DKA likely resulted from medication non-compliance.
The pt was treated with insulin drip and IVF.
She was transitioned to Humalog sliding scale and Lantus 30units QPM.
Because of this, she was started on a heparin gtt in the ED.
Her heparin was discontinued, as she was not felt to be having Acute Coronary Syndrome.
The pt was treated with b-blocker, lisinopril, & aspirin.
After being called out of the MICU, the floor team consulted cardiology regarding her enzyme elevation and need for further evaluation.
Based on these results, the pt was treated medically with B-blocker, ACEi and aspirin.
Cardiology recommended a statin as well.
This was not started as her PCP preferred to start it as an outpatient given concern that the discharging her with too many new medications might lead to non-compliance w/ them.
Thus, a statin will likely be started as an outpatient once the pt has complied with her insulin regimen, which is the most critical of her medications at present.
