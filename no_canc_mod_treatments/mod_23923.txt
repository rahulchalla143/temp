Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.
Got flagyl and levo at OSH, 1L IVfs.
These findings were most concerning for biliary enteric fistula vs. emphysematous cholecystitis, with emphysematous cholecystitis being less likely base on imaging.
After ERCP consult, it was recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].
Got lasix and nebs with some improvement.

OSH: blood cx [**10-22**]: 4 of 4 Klebsiella pneumonia Sensitive to all except ampicillin .
Followup of the patient after diuresis is recommended to evaluate the relationship between suspected infection and pulmonary edema changes.
emphysematous cholecystitis could also present with gb air, however there is no inflammatory changes/wall edema or gb distention.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
There was no post-obstructive dilation A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Multiple stone fragments were extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon.
The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure (sphincterotomy, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Note that there was no pus in the bile duct - it is not clear that biliary sepsis is the cause of his recurrent fevers - consider other causes .
His home medications reintroduced.
Given his bacteremia, plan for IV unasyn X14days total (until [**11-4**]) and RUE PICC was placed.
Of note, surgery did reccommend outpt cholecystectomy, esp since this appears to be his 2nd complication.
One other issue complicating hospital stay was that he initially recieved fluids given transient hypotension en route to [**Hospital1 18**] and ongoing fevers and concern for sepsis.
Was given IV lasix [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] with improvement in breathing, O2 sats.
Creat did remain stable with this (2.4 on admission, 1.8 after fluids, 2.0 after diuresis (baseline)).
They felt it may have been due to relative hypotension/hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and restarting lisinopril and lasix (got his home PO dose lisinopril 5mg and lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**] am before labs were drawn).
We held his lasix and lisinopril and allowed his BP to be a bit higher to maintain perfusion.
Given that his O2 sats were good, we did not resume his lasix on discharge and this can be done over the next few days per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] if his creat remains stable.
He does tend to have hypoK/Mag, even when he was not getting lasix and this can be monitored.
PCP updated as well and [**Hospital 33857**] transfer to [**Hospital6 **] for IV Abx and short rehab stay.
Was 2.4 at OSH, got fluids, improved to 1.8, then developed heart failure, got lasix 80mg IV [**10-24**] and [**10-25**], creat stabilized around 2.0-2.2.
Resumed on lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**], dose held [**10-27**].
-Holding lasix/lisinopril per renal as they think relative hypotension in setting of sepsis -creat improved 2.8-->1.9 with holding lasix and lisinopril, will continue to hold and can resume as outpt -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins .
Allergy to Midline: developed streaking along LUE midline so removed and PIV placed.
will treat for 14days for bacteremia -will continue unasyn per sensitivites.
