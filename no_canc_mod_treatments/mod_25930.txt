A complete infectious and autoimmune workup, as displayed above, showed only positivity for anti-Ro and anti-La but no other serologies.
Ultimately, a diagnosis of likely-autoimmune longitudinal myelitis was made and she was treated with intravenous steroids.
The patient continued high-dose IV steroid therapy, and was begun on a regimen of 5 rounds of plasmapheresis.
Cyclophosphamide therapy was considered, but a thorough review of the literature suggested that it would confer no benefit to her.

As extensive panel of infectious, autoimmune and viral tests were sent on your spinal fluid and did not provide a definite cause for your symptoms.
You were treated with steroids and plasmapheresis and your repeat spinal tap and blood markers showed less inflammation.
You will need to continue aggressive physical therapy at the [**Hospital 38**] Rehab facility and will need to continue oral steroids for the next 2-3 months to treat both your spinal cord process and your BOOP.
You will also need to continue linezolid for the next 10 days to treat your urinary tract infection.
