As per report, in subsequent images, biliary stent was successfully placed.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of biliary stent.
A biliary stent was then placed.
Brief Hospital Course: #Hypotension/Sepsis: On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis.
The underlying infection was treated with IV vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with appropriate coverage.
Zosyn was switched to Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash.
#Mechanical ventilation: Patient came to the ICU intubated s/p ERCP, on a propofol drip.
Initially he was hypotensive which was treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol, switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation.
He was given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial line placement and foley placement.
The initiation of hemodialysis effectively controlled his BP and fluid status, and on day 7, after his second ERCP, he was extubated and started on CPAP overnight.
His levels slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP, which continued to rise.
The stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and the patient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended.
# ESRD: Initially the nephrology service felt HD was not appropriate early during admission, in setting of patient becoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation for pancreatitis.
Beta-blockers were started however the patient did not respond and O2 sats started trending down with worsening acidemia and low PaO2.
The following day HD was initiated with good response in blood pressure.
The patient was weaned off his O2 requirement prior to discharge.
He will continue hydoxyzine, sarna and fluocinonide.
His aspirin and plavix were continued and the patient remained on telemetry for the duration of his stay.
Once patient was extubated he was started on CPAP overnight.
Hematocrit was trended and continued to improve with HD and management.
