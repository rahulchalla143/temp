NPH insulin with sliding scale insulin at meals.
Patient with known eosinophilic gastritis with a recent exacerbation and had been on steroids for approximately one day.
His GI bleed was thought to be most likely due to his combination of gastritis and steroids in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
He then underwent an upper GI with small bowel follow-through.
His aspirin and steroids were held given concerns that this could have contributed.
Eosinophilic gastritis:  Patient with history of eosinophilic gastritis with difficult to control symptoms over the previous year.
He had recently been started on steroids given his acute exacerbation of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the previous month.
Upon admission, steroids were held given concern for his GI bleed and he did have mild diarrhea.
The patient is to follow up with GI as an outpatient with possible consideration of the initiation of steroids for symptomatic relief should his symptoms otherwise remain stable.

His Coumadin was withheld, and his INR was reversed with multiple units of fresh frozen plasma.

Given the lack of any clear source of GI bleeding, Coumadin was held with a decision for him to follow up with his outpatient PCP to discuss restarting Coumadin.
Hematoma:  Patient with multiple central line placement attempts in the setting of an elevated INR.
His Coumadin was held and ________  antibody was done, which was negative.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with atrial fibrillation on amiodarone, beta-blocker, and Coumadin.
His Coumadin was held in the setting of GI bleed.
