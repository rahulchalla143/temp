The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating changes from median sternotomy and CABG.
Foal distal septal/apical septal hypokinesis is suggested with overall left ventricular ejection fraction preserved (LVEF>55%).
It was felt that block most likely occured [**1-14**] addition of verapamil to current regimen (although there was not evidence of CCB toxicity on admission.)
All AV nodal blocking agents were held, including verapamil and metoprolol.
They attributed the dissociation to his recently added verapamil and recommended this medication be discontinued.
# CAD:  Patient has known CAD with CABG x5 in [**11-18**].
He was continued on ASA 81mg daily.
# HTN: Patient's anti-hypertensive regimen consisted of metoprolol and lisinopril.
Lisinopril was recently discontinued for verapamil by patient PCP per patient.
All anti-hypertensive meds were intially held due to hypotension and AV block.
On discharge, he was advised to continue to hold lisinopril due to elevated K+ (5.2) and to follow up with his PCP regarding BP control and monitoring of electolytes.
Chronic Issues: # HLD: He was continued on home simvastatin 40mg.
# DM: He was continued on home insulin regimen (lantus, ISS).
# GERD: He was continued on home omeprazole.
Transitional Issues: -Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization -Avoid AV nodal blocking agents -Pt advised to hold lisinopril given elevated K+ (5.2) and f/u with PCP re BP control  Medications on Admission: 1.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath which was thought to be abnormal heart rhythm caused by a medication called VERAPAMIL that you started recently.
FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES WERE MADE TO YOUR MEDICATION REGIMEN STOP VERAPAMIL STOP METOPROLOL SUCCINATE 25 mg by mouth daily to prevent reoccurence of abnormal heart rhythm CONTINUE TO HOLD LISINOPRIL until you see your primary care physician as you have high potassium level which is likely a consequence of your chronic kidney disease and would benefit also from bicarbonate repletion  Followup Instructions: Please schedule an appointment with your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 7 days .
