Patient received IV NS @ 200cc/hr.
Hyperthermia/Heat stroke: Most likely patient had exertional heat stroke related to running on hot day in context of nortriptyline which can predispose toward heat stroke and may interfere w/ perspiration due to anticholinergic effects.
We held nortriptyline and gave the patient acetaminophen at less than the maximum dose .
Patient used incentive spirometry as instructed.
No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis or toxic or medication mediated injury.
Smear did not show schistocytes, however, and parameteres now steadily improving.
Was likely secondary to acute illness and mild DIC; possibly with an element of sequestration given likely acute hepatitis.
Pt was intially quite altered though improves as distance from sedation increases.
