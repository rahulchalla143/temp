Typhlitis should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**3-26**] CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-22**]:  Small region of heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality in the right lower lobe medial basal segment looks more like scarring than pneumonia but could be pneumonia.
Extensive calcified thrombus within the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava presumably from prior indwelling hemodialysis catheter.
Pericardial calcification  [**3-28**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size.
The background activity was mostly of high voltage and in the low theta and delta frequency ranges, seen either in a generalized distribution or more pronounced over the left hemisphere; sometimes similar lower voltage activity was seen.
The largest located within the left frontal lobe measures approximately 11 mm in size and demonstrates central hypointensity on FLAIR images.
However, the study is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Multiple white matter hypodensities are likely chronic but of uncertain etiology.

During that interval, psychiatry was consulted and recommended discontinuing her psychiatric medications.
The cause of her altered mental status is unclear, but is currently attributed to either her prior psychotropic medications and/or delirum from pneumonia.
Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and obstructive/restrictive lung disease.
Spiriva and Advair were continued.
