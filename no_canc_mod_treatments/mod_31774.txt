Admission Date:  [**2127-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-4-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Doxycycline Hyclate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: chest/lower abdominal quaking  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: peripheral dopamine infusion drip IV   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 88 y/o CF with a PMH of CHF with last EF >60%, AS with valve area 0.7 cm2 (peak 84, mean 45), Hypercholesterolemia, h/o Atrial fibrillation off coumadin since admission [**2127-2-21**] for lower GI bleed, stated that last night she developed the acute onset of a "quaking" pressure across her lower chest/upper abdominal area.
She was given ASA, 5mg IV lopressor, 25mg po lopressor X 2, 20IV lasix with no output, then 40IV lasix.
Had colonoscopy at that time showing Multiple severe non-bleeding diverticula with wide-mouth openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Coumadin stopped.
C-diff colitis in [**2123**].
Afib - dx'd about 4 years ago, stopped coumadin on last admission 11.
Hernia repair around age 55 13.
Colon surgery for bowel obstruction in her 60s 14.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression:  88 y/o woman with PMH significant for Atrial fibrillation (was not on BB at [**Hospital1 **]) off coumadin since [**2-21**] for LGIB, CHF with preserved EF, likely diastolic component, Severe Aortic stenosis, 2+ MR, who presents hypertensive urgency, volume overload, in congestive heart failure, Atrial fibrillation with Rate ~115, and with lateral ST depressions on EKG.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed with cardiology team that pt is poor anticoagulation candidate, given her prior history of large lower GI bleed in [**2-17**] with coumadin being stopped then.
It was decided among all team members that if the TEE demonstrated clot, no DC cardioversion would be performed.
It was felt that a negative TEE would minimize the risk somewhat of thrombus formation and subseuent embolus propagation.
The pt was explained, in detail, the risks and benefits of TEE/DC cardioversion and elected to proceed.
On the day of [**2127-4-22**], the day of TEE/cardioversion, the pt demonstrated ATN/shock liver [**1-16**] hypoperfusion from low flow state, poor cardiac outflow secondary to multiple factors including end stage diastolic dysfunction, critical aortic stenosis, dehydration and poor po intake and acute oliguric renal failure.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] discussed the options and risks at length, including the option for right heart cath vs. TEE/DC cardioversion.
The patient and daughter [**Name (NI) **] were informed of the risks of TEE/DC cardioversion, including stroke, and it was discussed with pt and daughter that this risk is high in a patient not on anticoagulation (b/c of prior large LGIB in [**2-17**] when coumadin was stopped).
Later in the evening of [**2127-4-22**], the pt started having left sided weakness/paralysis, and altered mental status.
Peripheral dopamine infusion was begun to bring up her blood pressure.
Also in the differential diagnosis is an embolus post DC cardioversion leading to basilar artery stroke.
We continued her beta blockers, statin and [**Last Name (un) **].
The pt received ASA in the ED, but was not given further ASA given her h/o prior upper GI bleed and gastric ulcer [**1-16**] aspirin use in the past.
Her UOP not responding to boluses and IVF hydration.
It was decided that she likely needed her atrial kick to increase her flow, and we proceeded with TEE/DC cardioversion to correct this.
Aortic Stenosis, severe, with valve area 0.7cm2, peak 89, mean 45.
It was established that she is a poor surgical candidate for valvular repair this admission.
ARF, oliguric- With Cr to 2.9 today, up from  Cr 1.5 post 40mg IV lasix on admission.
Suspect oliguric ARF [**1-16**] prerenal azotemia [**1-16**] poor forward flow (exacerbated by Atrial fibrillation, severe AS, dehydration, poor po intake).
She did not respond to IVF continuous and IVF boluses.
Renal was consulted, and felt that there was no need for emergent HD, and recommended to address cardiac issues for low flow state, which was leading to hypoperfusion and ATN.
It was thought that she may require higher pressures as she presented with bp 220/100, and within 48 hours, is 120s systolic.
Her post DC cardioversion course was complicated by severe hypotension requiring pressors.
