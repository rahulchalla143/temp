Cath showed LCX 70%, complete RCA occlusion with collaterals, right axillary 95%, right carotid 90%.
She states that she was refered for cardiac catheterization because she has had anginal sxs of chest pain to her left arm, particularly after an hour of working/sanding her deck this summer.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Diabetes on insulin, +Dyslipidemia,+ Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2133**]: s/p cardiac cath with PTCA of mid RCA and OM [**2134**] showed chronically occluded RCA [**2137**] & [**2139**] showed no significant change -- see above for today LHC) - PACING/ICD: 3.
Femoral artery catheter in place right groin.
Successful PTA alone of right axillary stenosis with 4.0x20mm NC balloon and then 5.0x15mm NC balloon with 10% residual stenosis and virtual elimination of gradient.
Successful hemostasis of right radial arteriotomy with TR band.
Successful PTA alone of right axillary artery with 5.0mm NC balloon.
The stenosis was predilated with a 2.5x20mm NC Quantum Apex MR balloon at 8 and 10 atms.
Nitroglycerin was started for hypertension.
The stent was then postdilated with a 4.5x20mm NC Quantum Apex MR balloon at 10 atms with 1 amp of atropine given immediately prior to post balloon inflation.
The patient's neurologic exam was unchanged and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
Stent postdilated with 4.5x20mm NC Quantum Apex balloon.
Transient hypertension and then hypotension treated with IVF and neosynephrine.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 73 y/o with a history of CAD, exertional angina, initially referred for cardiac catheterization done on [**9-19**] which showed LCX 40-60%, right axillary 95%, right carotid 90%, now s/p axillary ballooning [**9-20**] and carotid stenting [**9-21**].
S/P right carotid stenting: Patient with 90% right carotid stenosis s/p stent [**9-21**].
Her SBP were tightly controlled with phenylephrine and nitroglycerin intermittlently to a goal of 90-120s.
She was started on aspirin 325mg and plavix 75 mg daily.
These were similar to prior episodes of angina, but more intense than usual, and relieved by SL NTG x1 each time.
She was started on ASA and plavix as above.
Her Atenolol was held while in-house due to bradycardia secondary to vagal stimulation after carotid stenting.
# HTN: Her SBP goal was kept at 90-120 as above.
She was restarted on her Imdur before discharge, but her home Atenolol was held due to bradycardia.
She was continued on her home long acting insulin with sliding scale while in-house, and was restarted on her home metformin upon discharge.
# COPD: currently stable on RA, but was continued on her home Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250/50 IH [**Hospital1 **] and albuterol prn.
PCP can restart atenolol if bradycardia resolves.

This blockage was treated with catheterization and stent placement.
Please take all medications EXACTLY as prescribed, as failure to do so can cause acute stent blockage, which can be life threatening.
** CHANGE aspirin to 325mg by mouth once daily (up from 81mg).
** STOP taking atenolol until your primary care provider tells you to restart this medication  ** STOP taking omeprazole ** START taking pantoprazole 40mg by mouth once daily.
This is similar to omeprazole (for acid-reflux), but interacts with your heart medications less.
