He was diuresed with iv lasix.
He was given 100mg IV lasix and nitro gtt was started.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
has 2 adult children - Tobacco history: denies - ETOH: social, 1 alcoholic drink/ week - Illicit drugs: denies   Family History: Father: died of aortic aneursym at age 66, Brother s/p aortic aneursym repair, sister with HTN, grandfather with CVA  Physical Exam: GENERAL: NAD.
The patient had severe systemic hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 220/87 mmHg.
This improved with IV lasix and nitroglycerine bolus/gtt.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with a hypoplastic appearance to the right coronary cusp.
Aortic regurgitation cannot be assessed on non-ECG-gated CT images.
Echocardiography or MRI might be considered for further workup.
Pt was started on metoprolol 50mg TID to control heart rate and kept on home losartan for BP control.
Metoprolol was ultimately uptitrated to 200mg daily at time of discharge.
Severe elevation in LV pressure was somewhat more consistent with fairly acute regurgitation to which the heart had not yet had a chance to compensate vs fairly old AI with new cardiac decompensation and inability to maintain ventricular emptying in setting of AI.
Pt was initially given some IV lasix to help with volume overload and had good urine response.
Pt quickly stabilized and both BP and oxygenation normalilzed and decision was made to send home on low dose of PO lasix in order to help remove the small amount of extra fluid that was still on board.
When became apparent that pt had new PE, decision was made to start therapeutic anticoagulation and delay cardiac surgery for 3-6 months to allow clot a chance to disolve.
# CAD: Patient found 3 vessel disease and would likely benefit from CABG at time of aortic valve replacement.
His blood pressure was gradually lowered using a nitro drip and uptitrating metoprolol until reached acceptable levels.
Nitro drip was then titrated off and metoprolol increased to final dose of 200mg daily along with losartan 50mg daily.
He was continued on home simvastatin and discharged on home dose of this medication due to excellent lipid control at current dose.
