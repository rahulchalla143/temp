His defecits were nonfluent aphasia, dysarthria, right facial droop, right upper extremity plegia and able to pull up his right leg, but not lift it antigravity or dorsiflex at the ankle.
There was no occlusion on CTA, so no further intervention was undertaken.
After the initial 24 hours, he was restarted on his home Plavix and Aspirin was later added as he had the strokes on Plavix.
The Aspirin will serve as the bridge to a therapeutic INR.
For depression during hospitaliztion, he was started on Fluoxetine.

You received a medication called tPA because you were able to come to the hospital shortly after the onset of your symptoms.
For this reason and because you had the stroke despite being on Plavix, your medication was switched to Aspirin and you were also started on a medication called Coumadin.
For symptoms of depression, you were started on a medication called Fluoxetine.
