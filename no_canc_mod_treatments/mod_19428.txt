Unable to control pain with large doses of Dilaudid, fentanyl, methadone and Ketamine, so was intubated and sedated for pain control.
Anaesthesia was consulted and with lidocaine bolus, Ketamine drip, ketorolac iv, methadone iv, and dexmedetomidine was able to extubate the patient and achieve evidence of physiologic control of pain (improved NR, BP).
Patient then developed hallucinations that resolved with titration off of the Ketamine.
Once he was more than 7 days off Plavix he was transitioned from dexmedetomidine to epidural with bupivacaine with improvement in pain control.
He was continue on bupivacaine and methadone with prn Ativan and stable in terms of pain control for transfer to the floor.
Several other medical issues were addressed during his ICU course as follows: Hypotension attributed to blood loss with surgery and pain medications, initially given 1 LNS, then observed per surgery's order with UOP 15-20 ml/hr.
Anemia: marked HCT drip POD3 attributed to fluid mobilization, trended.
Diminished dorsalis pedis pulse left: [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery was consulted and felt no limb threatening ischemia, recommended non-invasives and no need for antibiotics.
His terazosin was stopped while a Foley is in place, he was continued on his home PPI, and CPAP.
Once the patient no longer required IV methadone he was transferred to the floor.
Plastic surgery opened his wound at bedside for foul smelling drainage initially thought to be fat necrosis however this eventually was found to have gross stool.
A wound vac was placed over this wound.
On [**6-8**] TPN was started as it was determined he would need to remain NPO for some time with this ostomy leak.
His TPN was weaned and then stopped.
His wound vac was removed with instructions to have VNA services to help replace the wound vac at home with his home wound vac.
