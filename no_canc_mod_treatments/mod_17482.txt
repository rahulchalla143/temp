Brief Hospital Course: This 45yo male with CHF, COPD, OSA, and ESRD on HD MWF, who presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia in the setting of recent cocaine use, with CXR demonstrating right sided effusion.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient's dyspnea was felt to be multifactorial in nature, secondary to volume overload in setting of CHF and missed HD sessions, right sided pleural effusion, and bilateral pneumonia.
The patient had HD the following morning, with removal of ~3.6L and continued improvement in dyspnea.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/levofloxacin given concern for multifocal pneumonia.
The patient was continued on BiPAP at night given history of OSA and chronic CO2 retention, and also continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed for dyspnea.
As above, possible that patient had CHF exacerbation from increased salt intake and missed HD sessions with volume overload.
Received kayexalate in ED, with subsequent normalization of K. He was monitored on telemetry, and continued on HD M/W/F.
He was continued on calcium acetate with meals.
Continued albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
