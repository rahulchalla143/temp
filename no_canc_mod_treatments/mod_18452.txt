The patient has a left nasogastric tube in place, with fluid seen within the nasopharynx.
The patient was initially given Ativan for his seizures, intubated for airway protection, and loaded with depakote (reportedly has a history of Dilantin allergy, although unclear what the reaction is).
The following morning, when further information was available, he was restarted on his home regimen of Keppra, Depakote and Tegretol (unfortunately it was not possible to add those levels on to his initial set of labs drawn in the ED).
The widespread faster rhythms are most suggestive of medication effect.
On admission, as the patient was altered and had an elevated INR, so could not immediately undergo a lumbar puncture, he was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir as prophylaxis.
After extubation his mental status had returned to baseline, with no meningismus, so all antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient reportedly has been on Coumadin in the past for a history of a DVT that occurred in the context of the hospitalization for his prior TBI.
This will need to be readdressed with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] it is not clear whether he needs to remain on anticoagulation at this time.
