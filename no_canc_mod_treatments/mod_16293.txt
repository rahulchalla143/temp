The procedure consisted of complex conversion of failed left dynamic hip compression screw to a cemented left hip hemiarthroplasty with strut allograft, cerclage, trephine, removal of failed deep hardware.
Products infused included Cellsaver 300cc, IVF 2000cc, 4u PRBC, and 3u FFP.
The patient tolerated the procedure well but was transferred intubated to the ICU secondary to blood loss and concern for coagulopathy.
After testing she was found not to have a coagulopathy and her blood volume began to normalize, but she required several transfusions to accomplish this.
Peri-operative antibiotics (both ancef and vancomycin) were given due to her history of staph aureus colonization (no MRSA documented).
Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis was used as a bridge to coumadin anticoagulation.
Coumadin was started on POD#3 in anticipation of at least 6 weeks of anticoagulation.
Pain was controlled initially with a PCA and then transitioned to oral pain meds on POD#2.
The foley was removed on POD#4 and the patient was voiding independently thereafter.
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and an incisional vac was placed.
The vac was removed on POD#4 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage.
At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a diabetic diet and feeling well.
On the day of discharge the patient's hematocrit was stable and her pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen.
Drain removed.
Dressing changed and incisional vac placed to  75mm Hg continuous suction.
Transfused an additional 2 units PRBC and gave 10mg IV lasix in between units.
