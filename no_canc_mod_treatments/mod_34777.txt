Admission Date:  [**2124-9-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-10-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-12-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: Seizure, brain mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, central line placement and removal, arterial line placement and removal, tracheostomy placement and removal, PEG placement, lumbar puncture x 2, PICC placement, Bronchoscopy x 2, Laryngoscopy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 60 year old female with auto-immune hepatitis who was found to be unresponsive by her family, and seizing after a fall.
She was started on immuran and prednisone on [**2124-6-21**] for presumed autoimmune hepatitis with plans to also undertake an MRCP to assess for sclerosing cholangitis.
She was scheduled to complete a prednisone taper starting at 30 mg and tapering over one month to 10 mg daily.
She was also started on ursodiol in late [**Month (only) 205**].
There are no additional laboratory values between then and her admission here on [**2124-9-14**] although per the patient's family she was under the care of a naturopath while in [**Location (un) 86**] in [**Month (only) 216**] who was administering a number of naturopathic supplements (including iron) to help with her liver disease, and laboratory work was taken.
She was taken to an outside hospital, where her seizure was broken with fosphenytoin and ativan.
Due to concerns over airway protection and unresponsiveness, she was intubated at that time.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room, she was given Vitamin K, 2 units of FFPs, and decadron 10 mg IV.
A-line in place over right radial.

The ET tube tip is 2.7 cm from the carina, would recommend pulling back approximately 1-2cms.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Suggest pulling back ET tube [**12-22**] cms as discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**9-14**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, with new mass, seizure, [**Month/Year (2) 4656**] for interval change and please compare with outside hospital CT.
Centrally, there are regions of blood products.
There is heterogeneous FLAIR signal intensity, which could suggest the presence of blood products.
Globes and orbits and extracranial soft tissues are unremarkable.
Large abnormality within the left frontal lobe characterized by peripheral enhancement, surrounding edema, blood products, and restricted diffusion.
ABNORMALITY #2: A slowed and disorganized background was seen both posteriorly and anteriorly.
The posterior rhythm was relatively low to moderate voltage and of a pseudoperiodic nature verging on a burst-voltage reduction pattern not as extreme as a burst suppression pattern.
Increased enhancement and mild increase in surrounding edema in the left frontal lesion, which now demonstrates intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess.
Diffuse in meningeal enhancement which could be due to meningeal inflammation.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted breath-hold independent imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet, including dynamic sequential images obtained prior to, during, and after the uneventful administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA.
Note is made of Tarlov cysts associated with several sacral nerve roots.
A single episode of frank aspiration, which was silent was demonstrated during straw sip administration of thin liquid barium consistency which appeared to improve with chin tuck maneuvers.

Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to steroid and azathioprine treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to infection.
Ampicillin and gentamicin were started on [**9-17**].
- Neurology service consulted for initial seizure presentation, recommend Levetiracetam 1500 [**Hospital1 **] indefinitely for seizure prevention.
#) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on [**2124-9-22**] due to persistent altered mental status.
Over her hospital course her mental status improved and she was able to be weaned off trach mask and supplemental oxygen.
Pt admitted on prednisone and imuran for autoimmunie hepatitis, initially immunosuppressants thought to be culprits, but were held throughout admission without resolution of pancytopenia; other possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process.
Throughout her stay, the patient's hematocrit was closely monitored, and she did require several blood transfusions.
Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
The patient was continued on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxsis given her increased coagulation studies, as well as the uncertainty regarding continued bleeding around her brain heparin SC was deferred.
There was concern that her autoimmune hepatitis could be returning, but the team was hesitant to start her on any immunosupressive therapies given the severe comorbid infection in this patient.
Hepatology also recommended starting ursodiol, but no Imuran or prednisone given her acute infection.
She should follow up with her liver team upon completion of antibiotics for consideration of restarting treatment for her autoimmune hepatitis.
As above pt tolerated vent and 02 weaning without addition of antibiotics.
A B-glucan test was positive and pt was transiently treated with amphotericin.
Our ID consultants recommend that this be repeated after completion of antibiotic treatment for confirmation of this.
Various causes were considered including medication effects from Gentamycin or Keppra.
She is at risk to develop renal failure due to cumulative gent dosing, her renal function should be monitored closely for this reason and to prevent developmement of hyperkalemia in face of aggressive repletion.
On discharge she was ordered for 60 mEq of potassium [**Hospital1 **] but this dose will likely need to be adjusted and would recommend [**Hospital1 **]-TID potassium monitoring.
#) ENT - ENT service was consulted when pt developed partial vocal cord paralysis after extubation and trach decannulation seen by laryngoscope.
#) FEN: When the patient was unresponsive, a PEG tube was placed, and she was receiving tube feeds on transfer to the floor.
At this time, she was cleared to take ground solids, and thin liquids with a chin tuck.
Her tube feeds were continued, as she was taking in only a relatively small amount PO.
Medications on Admission: Potassium, Imuran 50 mg daily, Ursodiol, Prednisone 10 mg (being tapered).

You were started on IV antibiotics, which have continued for several weeks.
You had a breathing tube, and also a tracheostomy placed to help you breathe.
You also were unable to eat, and had a tube placed into your stomach to give you food.
Take your medications as prescribed.
It is important that continue treatment with Ampicillin and Gentamicin as prescribed.
You will need to have an MRI of your brain performed prior to stopping antibiotics to ensure that your infection has been appropriately treated.
Whether or not to stop these antibiotics should be discussed with your new Infectious disease doctor once you have set up follow up.
You should discuss with your Primary doctor about having flow cytometry checked in [**12-22**] months if it is felt to be clinically indicated given your low blood counts.
This may also need to be discussed with a Hematologist.
