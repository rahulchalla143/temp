Sigmoid colectomy with [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch and end colostomy on [**2113-11-7**].
Swan-Ganz catheterization and arterial line monitoring during this hospital stay.
She had a pacemaker placed for atrial fibrillation on the [**11-10**] and on the 7th the patient was noted to have abdominal distention on KUB, which showed large bowel dilatation.
The patient was then treated with nasogastric tube, rectal tube decompression.
She is being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation with Coumadin and receiving Lovenox as well.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2109**], hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, hypothyroidism, gout and blindness.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  The patient was on Prevacid 30 q day, Timolol drops OU, Tolamide drops OU, topical Hydrocortisone, Ensure plus, Colchicine .6 q day, Levothyroxine .05 mg q day, Oxybutynin 2.5 b.i.d., Prednisone eye drops, Dulcolax prn, Digoxin .5 q day, Lopressor 50 t.i.d., Lovenox 30 subq b.i.d., magnesium oxide 400 b.i.d., Tequin 400 intravenous q day and Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
After transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] the patient was placed on aspirin 325 mg q day, Lopressor 5 intravenous q 6, Levaquin 250 q day, Vancomycin 500, morphine prn, Digoxin .125 intravenous q day, Flagyl 500 intravenous t.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, subq heparin, Diltiazem 10 mg intravenous times one, Protonix 40 q day intravenous, Levothyroxine 25 intravenous q day, Brimonidine eye drops and Latanoprost eye drops.
She is on normal saline at 75 cc an hour.
Lines include a left PICC line, left femoral triple lumen catheter, nasogastric tube, Foley and rectal tube.
In preparation for surgery the patient was given fresh frozen platelets and a left subclavian port was placed along with the Swan-Ganz catheter.
The patient's son was available for discussion about the patient's prognosis and they were made aware that the patient's chances of survival were slim even with surgery and they chose to proceed with surgery and informed consent was obtained from the family.
She was taken to the Operating Room and underwent exploratory laparotomy where a ischemic left colon was encountered.
She underwent a left hemicolectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch and colostomy, J tube placement and the splenic flexure was taken down.
She required 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets during the surgery.
Initially out of the Operating Room the patient was on an epinephrine drip, which was weaned off.
Additionally she was taken off her Amiodarone and a nitro drip was added initially for after load reduction.
She is also put on Dobutamine to increase her bowel function and remained antibiotic coverage of Flagyl, Levaquin and Vancomycin initially.
She is also on a beta blocker, Metoprolol 5 mg intravenous q 6 hours.
For deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis as well as coagulation given her atrial fibrillation she was placed on Lovenox 40 mg subQ q day.
She remained on her Levothyroxine, digoxin and aspirin.
She did require fluid boluses aggressively throughout postoperative day one to support her urine output.
Postoperative day two the patient remained on a Dobutamine drip of 5 micrograms per kilogram per minute and nitro .5 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
The plan for the day was to slow down the patient's hydration and to continue broad antibiotic coverage.
By postoperative day three the patient's Dobutamine had been weaned to 2 micrograms per kilogram per minute and she remained on nitro and trophic tube feeds were started.
By postoperative day five the patient's Dobutamine drip was off and her nitro drip was off.
Due to hypoglycemia following the institution of total parenteral nutrition an insulin drip was started.
Enalapril was attempted, however, blood pressure dropped so this was discontinued.
She was restarted on Lopresor 5 mg intravenous q 6 once the Dobutamine was weaned off and began on gentle diuresis with prn loop diuretics.
Due to her thrombocytopenia her Lovenox was dropped and all heparin was eliminated on her carrier fluids.
The concern was that the patient could possibly be embolizing from atrial clot given her atrial fibrillation and stopping of her anticoagulation.
On postoperative day six the patient had been restarted on Dobutamine due to low cardiac index and also begun on a Lasix drip for diuresis.
She was on Vancomycin at this time.
She began showing output from her ostomy with stool mixed with liquid.
Her cardiac index continued to be very marginal alone with marginal urine output.
By postoperative day seven the patient was febrile to 101.8 so she was begun on Zosyn prophylactically.
Additionally she grew out yeast from her urine culture and was started on Fluconazole.
Additionally, she was started on a neo drip to support her blood pressure, which had been trending down.
The patient was also started on oral Flagyl for empiric treatment of possible C-diff colitis, however, these were not confirmed on her laboratory tests.
On postoperative day eight the patient is on Levophed, Milrinone, Vasopressor had been started at .8 units per minute and she was still given a Lepirudin drip for anticoagulation.
The family had previously been asked regarding post mortem and declined.
DIAGNOSIS AT THE TIME OF EXPIRATION: Immediate cause of death is cardiac arrest and secondary to cardiogenic shock, status post exploratory laparotomy, left hemicolectomy and end colostomy.
