Given his acute coronary syndrome, he initially remained on Integrilin.
Heparin was not continued as his prothrombin time remained supratherapeutic.
For several days, he remained pain free on medical therapy and cardiac enzymes continued to trend down.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted.
He was deemed a surgical candidate but surgical intervention was initially delayed given his supratherapeutic prothrombin time and recent Plavix and Integrilin.
He was maintained on Heparin and Nitro.
His chest pain improved but due to his instability, he underwent surgical revascularization surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**1-28**].
He was started on Amiodarone and required multiple defibrillations.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
He tolerated medical therapy which included Amiodarone, Digoxin, and beta blockade.
