HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2162-1-4**] a pericardial drain was placed to treated the pericardial effusion.
This drained approximately 1 liter in the immediate period and she therefore underwent a pericardial window procedure on [**2162-1-8**] for persistent fluid reaccumulation.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit postoperatively for close observation.
She was extubated on postoperative day one with two chest tubes in place and was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] floor on postoperative day two in stable condition.
This was treated without intervention and subsequently resolved.
This was treated with intravenous Vancomycin.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done to evaluate the heart valve given the recent procedure and persistent bacteremia.
Per their recommendations, the patient was treated with Levofloxacin for gram negative coverage along with Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and presumed endocarditis.
Per their recommendations given that the patient was already on steroids they felt that it would be unuseful to treat her with additional steroid medications as it might potentiate her dependence on steroids.
The patient was therefore treated with aggressive physical therapy and was seen by the acute pain service.
She was treated with Tylenol #3 with Percocet for breakthrough pain and is scheduled to see the pain service as an outpatient.
After remaining afebrile for greater then 48 hours the patient was discharged to rehab for physical therapy and intravenous antibiotics.
