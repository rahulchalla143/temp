STROKE RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT: [**2174-3-20**] 06:30AM BLOOD %HbA1c-8.0* eAG-183* [**2174-3-18**] 12:34AM BLOOD Triglyc-218* HDL-25 CHOL/HD-5.9 LDLcalc-78 .
TECHNIQUE: CTA of the head and neck with perfusion was performed with and without intravenous contrast according to department protocol.
Perfusion mismatch with increased mean transit time and decreased blood flow but normal blood volume throughout the right cerebral hemisphere concerning for a large area of penumbra.
Repeat CTA head and neck/CTP brain: Final Report INDICATION: 47-year-old male with right internal carotid artery dissection and concern for evolving CVA now with complete left hemiplegia, here to evaluate for interval changes.
TECHNIQUE: CTA of the head and neck with perfusion was performed with and without intravenous contrast according to department protocol.
The patient's blood pressure was maintained above SBP 140 with IVF to avoid hypoperfusoin, at times the patient had SBP>180 so he was given hydralazine 10mg IV PRN and responded well to this.
He was eventually started on lisinopril 10mg (which is half dose of his home 20mg).
The patient was placed on a heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-70, and was eventually started on coumadin with goal INR [**12-31**].
He is currently undergoing bridging therapy for his anticoagulation.
The heparin should be continued until the INR has been at goal for 24 hours.
Patient was placed on an ISS with good blood sugar control while in the hospital.
The metformin was also restarted prior to discharge.
The patient was monitored on continous telemtry throughout his stay without any clearly contributable cardiac arrhythmias.
He was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy who has recommended continued therapy, and therefore the patient will be discharged to a rehabiliation facility.
#HTN: Patient is on home lisinopril 20mg, he was restarted on half dose 10mg lisniopril with good effect.
#DM2: The patient was placed on an RISS while inpatient with good blood sugar control.
Of note his Hba1c was 8.0, and the patient's home regimen is metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
We have continued him on a RISS and restarted metformin prior to discharge.
#Nutrition: Initially patient was seen by speech and swallow evaluation and was cleared for ground dysphagia diet and thin liquids.
On repeat evaluation the patient was cleared for regular solids and thin liquids (cardiac/diabetic diet).
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Restart full dose lisinopril 20mg QD when able 2) Patient will need uptitration of his metformin as he was on 500mg [**Hospital1 **]) and his HBa1c was at 8 (this will need to be discussed with PCP) 3) Continued bridging with heparin gtt and Coumadin.
