Glans penis, biopsy (A):  Spongiotic epidermal hyperplasia with confluent parakeratosis and neutrophilic exocytosis (see note).
Brief Hospital Course: He was found to be hypotensive (79/57) and bradycardic (46) on initial evaluation, but responded well to fluid resuscitation in the ED and was admitted to MICU for further evaluation.
He also had metabolic derangements including hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia in the setting of a stenosed AV fistula.
The patient had been off his coumadin for the past four days prior to admission with the intention of having a fistula revision.
A tunneled line was subsequently placed for HD access and dialysis was restarted successsfully.
Other possibilities could have included digoxin toxicity although the level was 1.0 on admission.
As the patient no longer needed to be off anticoagulation for a revision of his fistula, heparin gtt was started as a bridge to coumadin.
The bridge was continued >24 hours after being therapeutic on coumadin in the setting of known protein C deficiency.

You were found to have low blood pressure when you came to the hospital and required fluids to bring your blood pressure back up to normal.
We instead inserted a dialyis catheter in order to dialyze you without your fistula.
This improved after we held your beta blocker and digoxin.
After a few days, your heart rate improved and we gradually restarted your medications while keeping your heart rate at a normal level.
Because of your history of protein C deficiency, we needed to keep you here on a heparin drip to keep you anticoagulated until your warfarin reached a safe level.
You were seen by Dermatology during your admission for a lesion on your penis for which you had previously taken antibiotics.
No medications were changed during this hospitalization.
