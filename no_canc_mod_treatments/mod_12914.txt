He was initiated on high dosed steroids (prednisone 60 mg po q day) with subsequent reduction in his total serum bilirubin from 18 to 11.
A urinalysis demonstrated 3+ bilirubin and 3+ blood.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2135-3-18**]; the results demonstrated an acute hepatitis consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction, although autoimmune hepatitis could not be excluded.
Given his coagulopathy, the patient was administered fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K with a subsequent decrease in his INR to 1.55.
He was also restarted on steroids, utilizing dexamethasone 3.75 mg IV q8h.
He was transfused packed red blood cells in order to maintain his hematocrit, and EGD was done the following day.
Dexamethasone 3.75 mg IV q8h.
Lactulose 20 mL po qid.
Phytonadione 10 mg subQ q day.
Morphine sulfate 1-2 mg IV q4h prn pain.
Promethazine 25 mg IV q6h prn nausea.
The patient was not on any medications prior to his admission to the outside hospital.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On initial review of systems, the patient complained of fatigue, weakness, abdominal distention, and shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the patient's temperature was 97.8, heart rate 97, blood pressure 146/67, respiratory rate 29, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 107, creatinine 6.8, glucose of 121, calcium 8.8, magnesium 2.6, and phosphate of 5.9.
Gastrointestinal:  As noted above, the liver biopsy done at the outside hospital was more consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction than with autoimmune hepatitis.
Because of his marked uremia, the patient was started on hemodialysis soon after his hospitalization began.
He received several courses of hemodialysis as needed for uremia; the last time he received hemodialysis was on [**3-26**].
It transiently increased again following the administration of intravenous contrast dye prior to an abdominal CT scan that was done on [**3-29**].
Following this additional insult, the patient's serum creatinine was again elevated.
He also developed hyponatremia that was attributed to volume depletion that resulted from his persistent diarrhea (The patient was receiving high doses of lactulose in order to prevent hepatic encephalopathy), and intermittent nausea and vomiting.
He received hypertonic saline for one day with an increase in his serum sodium.
Please note that during the time of his severe acute renal failure, the patient was started on Sevelamer as well as epoetin.
However, given the persistent recovery of his renal function prior to discharge, both of these medications were discontinued at the time of discharge.
His intravenous fluids were then adjusted as necessary based upon his serum sodium and serum bicarbonate levels throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
Once aggressive intravenous fluid volume resuscitation was reinstituted, the patient's serum creatinine began to steadily improve.
On [**3-23**], a blood culture that was drawn on [**3-21**] began growing a gram-positive cocci and the patient was empirically started on Vancomycin.
The patient was therefore started on a 10 day course of metronidazole for empiric coverage of Clostridium difficile.
He was intubated and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
He was initially administered phytonadione orally without subsequent improvement in his coagulopathy.
Following this medication administration, it was thought that during the time of this medication administration, the patient may not have had adequate intestinal absorption of medications.
He was therefore started on subQ phytonadione for the two days prior to discharge.
Ursodiol 300 mg po tid.
Pantoprazole 40 mg po q day.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to take all medications as prescribed.
He was given a prescription for this appointment.
