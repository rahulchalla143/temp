She was then changed to pressure control secondary to high airway pressures and a rapid respiratory rate which she appeared to tolerate more.
With a dressing placed externally the tracheotomy was in improved position, however, there was a persistent cuff leak around the tracheotomy.
Secondary to the patient's severe interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, she remained on a good deal of ventilatory support.
She was switched on [**3-31**] from pressure control to assist control and appeared to tolerate it better, however, it was unclear at the time of this discharge summary if the patient would ever be able to be weaned from the ventilator.
The patient was also tried on a Passy-Muir valve to see if she was able to speak with her family as the thought was that she was not improving; however, this failed.
The patient did not acutely wake up after the procedure secondary to anesthesia.
The patient was continued on her aspirin and Plavix.
The plan was for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] of Neurosurgery to stent this but after communicating with the family that the patient was not likely to improve and further procedure might set her back even more, it was decided that any new interventions that required major procedures would be cancelled in favor of preserving the patient's comfort and dignity.
Initially this was sensitive to Cefepime and Meropenem and she was double covered with these antibiotics.
This was determined on the 9th and at that time the patient was started on Imipenem and it was sensitive.
The patient did continue to grow these Gram negative rods in her sputum after the antibiotics were discontinued.
All antibiotics were discontinued after her tracheotomy procedure on [**3-21**]; no further antibiotics were used to treat the slight intermittent low grade temperatures.
The Infectious Disease Service recommended getting imaging of her right hip where she had had a recent open reduction and internal fixation but secondary to the hardware, an MRI was not going to be useful.
These both grew from her A-line and this was subsequently discontinued, however, they were thought to be a contaminant.
Takayasu's arteritis:  The patient was continued on her Prednisone and CellCept during this hospital course.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was continued on her Synthroid for her hypothyroidism and her insulin and Glargine for diabetes mellitus.
The patient received a few transfusions, mostly after the procedures which she underwent, including the tracheotomy and interventional procedure.
HIP FRACTURE:  The patient has never gotten out of bed after her open reduction and internal fixation but secondary to her debilitated state, was unable to undergo Physical Therapy.
She was continued on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and will need Physical Therapy in the future.
The patient's Dilaudid interval was decreased to q. four hours and the patient was started on a long acting benzodiazepine, Valium, as opposed to her ativan.
While the patient was previously full code, she was made "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" in the last week of this hospital period and plan was to pursue comfort and dignity as opposed to aggressive work-up and treatment of her medical problems; however, COMFORT MEASURES ONLY status had not been confirmed by the family and Medical Intensive Care Unit team.
