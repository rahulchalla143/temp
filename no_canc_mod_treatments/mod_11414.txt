He presents electively for a gastric bypass procedure.
Previous weight loss efforts included Neutra System, Slim-Fast, and three months of [**Doctor Last Name 1729**] diet which had limited effectiveness.
He has also tried medication therapy without significant results.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medication regimen included Soma for back pain and glucosamine for joints.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2173-10-8**] for a planned open gastric bypass.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by poor urine output requiring multiple boluses of fluid as well as poor pain control.
The patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2173-10-11**] for exploratory laparotomy, [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain placement, revision of his gastrojejunostomy, and gastrostomy tube placement.
He was maintained in the Postanesthesia Care Unit on ventilation and extubated in the morning after surgery (on [**2173-10-12**].)
He was taken for a CT to evaluate his gastric remnant with the intention being to utilize his gastrostomy tube for feeds.
As the collection was solid clot, the drain was not left as it would not remain patent or drain the collection.
The patient was started on gastrostomy tube feeds then; receiving the normal four ounces three times per day of a Carnation Instant Breakfast that he would be receiving with his stage III gastric bypass diet.
He was also given fluid boluses for a total fluid intake of around 1600 cc per day.
He was also to continue Levaquin and Flagyl times 14 days.
The patient had had continued spiking temperatures; however, it was felt by the surgical team to be most likely due to an abscess discovered by CT in his left upper quadrant; probably secondary to extravasation of gastric contents.
The patient was comfortable both with performing his gastrostomy tube feeds as well as administrating his medications per gastrostomy tube, as well as emptying and recording the volumes on his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
Roxicet 5 cc to 10 cc per gastrojejunostomy tube q.4-6h.
Levaquin 500 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
Flagyl 250 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube t.i.d.
Zantac elixir 150 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.
Vitamin B12 1000 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
Actigall 300 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.
He was placed on tube feeds which consisted of 120 cc of Carnation Instant Breakfast mix given at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[**Hospital6 407**] was scheduled once daily to assist with drain maintenance, to record output, to assist with g-tube medication delivery, to continue patient training on g-tube maintenance as well as [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain maintenance; in addition to forming every day dressing changes.
The patient was to continue being nothing by mouth until indicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that it was appropriate to initiate oral feeds once again.
