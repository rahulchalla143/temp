She was also recently seen in [**Company 191**] from [**Month (only) **] to [**2116-6-4**] for episodes of hypotension assoicated with LH/dizziness, and her BP meds were down-titrated to Lisinopril 40 mg PO daily and metoprolol 25 XL PO daily.

DDx included hypoglycemia, medication effect (recent history of hypotension as an outpatient with decrease in blood pressure medications).
Patient also with history of syncope in the past with negative outpatient work-up in the past including TTE, autonomic testing, stress test, and EEG.
DDx also includes possible vagal episode from pain, infection was also on the differential so she was initially broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn, especially in the setting of fat stranding and mesesnteric LAD seen on CT A/P.
Overnight she again became hypotensive, requiring placement of a CVL and arterial line.
She remained on antibiotics until her cultures were negative for 48 hours, and then remained afebrile off antibiotics.
