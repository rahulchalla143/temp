Note is made of somewhat dilated large bowel filled with air and fluid, down to the rectum.
Rectum measures 5.5 cm.
The patient is status post fixation of the left femur fracture, which is only partially visualized.
Status post left femur fracture repair, only partially visualized.
TECHNIQUE: 2D grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed on bilateral lower extremity veins.
FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited secondary to patient's recent surgeries and surgical staples obscuring the ultrasound field.
Right open knee dislocation.
Right open knee dislocation.
Irrigation and debridement right knee down to bone     through the open wound.
INDICATION:  This is a staged procedure for Mr. [**Known lastname **] who presented after sustaining a fall from height with an open right knee dislocation and a femur fracture.
Initially he was managed with external fixation and damage control setting in order to allow for quick revascularization of his right lower extremity.
He now presents for staged procedure, involving removal of the left external fixator and replacement with intramedullary nailing and staged debridement of his open wound.
The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner and an external fixator was removed.
The piriformis entry fossa was located through a small incision with a K-wire.
A guidewire with a Beaver tip was inserted and the fracture was reduced over the guidewire and then over reamed to a 12.5 mm size in order to accept an 11 mm x 420 mm nail.
It was placed using freehand technique with 3 transverse screws.
The final contour was found to be satisfactory in range of motion, stability and ligaments as well as rotation alignment.
The wounds were copiously irrigated and closed in layers with Vicryl suture and staples.
At this point, attention was then directed to his right lower extremity which was redraped and prepped and the existing suture line on the popliteal wound which was adjacent to the others, 12 to 15 cm was removed.
The wound was then closed with isolated nylon stitches of the 2-0 variety.
PROCEDURE:  Closed reduction, left femoral comminuted fracture under traction and placement of external fixator, multiplane.
He also has a right open knee dislocation.
The treatment of the right knee dislocation and debridement will be dictated under separate note.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the operating room after proper general surgery stabilization.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] assisted me during this procedure and subsequently placed an external fixator with 4 bar linkages.
The vascular surgery service proceeded after the orthopedic intervention to perform an exploration and revascularization of the right lower extremity.
He was taken to the operating room for repair of his orthopedic injuries (see operative notes).
Vascular surgery was consulted for absence of pulses RLE; he underwent angiography placement of IVC filter; this was placed on [**2145-6-10**] without any complication.
Also, pt developed an ~7cm hematoma at his proximal medial L thigh which was evacuated, packed with W->D dressings [**Hospital1 **], and allowed to heal by secondary intention.
An appropriate regimen of medications was prescribed and the patient's pain improved significantly.
