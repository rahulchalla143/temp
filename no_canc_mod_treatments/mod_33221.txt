# IVC thrombus: During pt's workup for abdominal pain, she was noted to have worsening peripheral edema.
Pt then underwent MRI which confirmed large IVC filter clot extending to bilateral iliacs.
Pt was started on heparin drip and after premedication underwent attempted IR thrombolysis.
[**Name (NI) 79481**] pt suffered from respiratory distress peri-procedure concerning for anaphylaxis (although received prophylactic solumedrol, benadryl) vs showering of emboli (although filter in place).
Once pt stabilized, IR determined no need for inpt reattempt, and pt was started on PO warfarin.
This was initially dosed at 3mg (for interaction with concurrent flagyl), increased to 5mg when switched to PO vanco, and increased to 7.5mg daily for several days at discharge.
Blood pressure eventually provided room for diuresis, which was done with daily Lasix 20mg IV.
She remained comfortable at her baseline throughout the admission with the exception of during her attempted thrombolysis and for several days afterwards.
Pt showed no signs of infections on CXR or symptomatically thus was only treated with antibiotics very shortly.
However, due to pt's large IVC filter clot, she was started on heparin drip, and ultimately on warfarin.
# Anemia: Pt was known to be anemic on admission, with prior requirement for transfusion.
Etiology of iron deficiency remained unclear, and pt was recommended to under go an outpatient colonoscopy once able to tolerate bowel prep.
Pt required pRBC transfusion for several episodes of Hct drop <21, which she tolerated well.
She was also treated with IV ferrlicit x3, and PO iron.
# Diarrhea: Over pt's long course, she was exposed to broad spectrum antibiotics in the ICU for concern of pneumonia.
Pt then developed diarrhea, was found to be positive for C diff, and broad antibiotics were stopped.
She was treated initially with flagyl, and then due to worsened nausea and vomiting was switched to PO vancomycin to complete the 14 day course.
She was also put on the BRAT diet and ordered TID yogurt for probiotics, Pt remained afebrile, without leukocytosis and with benign abdomen throughout the course of the C diff infection.
# Guaic positive stools: Pt was noted to have guaiac positive stools in setting of epistaxis, c diff, gastritis and iron repletion.
Pt was treated and discharged on a proton pump inhibitor.
Pt was continued on her statin, and BP meds restarted as blood pressure allowed.
# DM1: Pt's type 1 diabetes was monitored with QID finger sticks and treated with escalating doses of lantus and sliding scale to parallel her increasing PO intake.

You will need to continue your coumadin and follow up in the coumadin clinic at [**Hospital3 **] to manage your doses.
Although we repleted your iron, you will need to continue iron at home, and follow up with gastroenterology to have a colonoscopy in the near future.
We made multiple changes to your medications as listed below.
