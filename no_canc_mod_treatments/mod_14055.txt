The patient was felt to be stable neurologically and was transferred to Medicine Service for care of ongoing medical problems.
At the time of initial presentation the patient was on supplemental oxygen, had a neck brace, and was being closely monitored.
INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE ISSUES:  The patient did not receive any intervention for intracranial hemorrhage throughout her hospital stay.
Neurosurgery had been following the patient and felt that the patient's intracranial hemorrhage was stable, and no further intervention was needed.
Physical Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy were consulted to work with the patient.
At that time, she had been placed on Levaquin and Flagyl for this aspiration pneumonia.
After receiving approximately 18 days of levofloxacin and Flagyl, they were discontinued for a finished course of pneumonia.
A follow-up culture of the line tip as well as [**3-1**] blood cultures showed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus which was sensitive to vancomycin.
At that time, vancomycin was added to her regimen.
She had a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed to finish a 14-day course of vancomycin for line sepsis.
The patient continued to remain afebrile.
The patient continued her seven days of vancomycin for her line sepsis and was to have follow-up laboratories drawn as an outpatient.
Her metoprolol was increased up to 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
After increasing her metoprolol dose we then added diltiazem 60 mg by mouth four times per day with much improved decrease in her heart rates.
Because the patient had normal cardiac function from a previous echocardiogram, no further management was indicated at that time.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient had initially been placed on tube feeds in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit.
It was felt that her medications could be taken orally and crushed.
The patient tolerated an oral diet well.
It was felt that the [**Hospital 228**] medical problems had stabilized and her care could be continued at outpatient rehabilitation with proper physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.
