CXR [**2111-6-12**]: ET tube tip is 2.9 cm top of the carina.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Admission labs were also notable for multiple electrolyte derangements, including ARF, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.
Prior discharge summary invoked possible h/o alcohol abuse, and serum ethanol level were negative at time of admission, supporting possible delirium tremens, although patient denied EtOH use on both occasions consistently.
Benzo withdrawl was also considered as patient reports taking Lorazapam but urine tox negative.
Upon arrival to the ED, the neurology team was consulted and recommended that the patient be loaded with IV Keppra.
CSF gram stain and preliminary culture was negative so the vancomycin and ceftriaxone were not continued.
CSF cytology and HSV PCR were sent and the patient continued on IV acyclovir for empiric treatment of HSV encephalitis.
She was also started on MVI, folic acid, and thiamine.
LFTs remained abnormal as well as thyroid function tests which are both further areas of exploration for inciting event for new seizures.
She was treated with IVFs as this was felt to be due to possible rhabdomyolysis, and creatinine now improved to 0.9. .
Also, ferritin was found to be persistently elevated at >[**2103**], so hemochromatosis should also be excluded as an outpatient.
She was started on po B12 supplementation, but will require close monitoring to determine if replacement is adequate.
She required recurrent repletement of potassium, which was maintained at >4, and magnesium, which was maintained at >2, given her seizures.
