History of Present Illness: The patient is 78 year old man with history of CAD, dementia who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-11-20**] following treatment for pneumonia in the LLL.
He was discharged to complete a course of levofloxacin which ended today.
At that time it was felt that his mental status was the most limiting with regard to his ability to safely take oral nutrition and was recommended to remain completely NPO.
He had a chest xray that was concerning for a LLL infiltrate and he received 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for HAP.
His intial HR of 140s decreased with tylenol and IVF.
Past Medical History: - s/p [**2139**] (admitted [**Date range (1) 33661**]) with diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus, also Grade III AC joint separation with distal clavicle fracture  on the left - Dementia: Alzheimers vs vascular - Question of [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body dementia - CAD s/p CABG x3, 17 yrs ago - SVT - HTN - hypothyroidism - Anemia of chronic disease (baseline Hct 29-36%) - BPH s/p TURP - Multilevel cervical spondylosis - s/p PEG placed for poor PO intake  Social History: The patient is married to his wife of 44 years.
He has lived at a rehab facility since his fall and SAH, prior to that he was at home with wife.
His pre-fall baseline including walking unassisted.
Abd: G-tube in good repair.
IMAGING: CXR ([**2139-11-22**]) - The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy wires are intact.
Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are present, with configuration favoring atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Tip of right PICC line terminates in upper right atrium, approximately 2 cm from cavoatrial junction.
He was stabilized in the MICU with IV fluid resuscitation and empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.
Fevers - The patient presented from rehab with worsening fevers while on levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia.
He was started on empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) while in the MICU, with a contaminated sputum culture and blood and urine cultures showing no growth to date.
The patient became afebrile and his leukocytosis normalized, with improvement in his mental status, while on the Vancomycin and Zosyn.
A PICC line was placed with a plan for long-term IV antibiotics while at rehab.
The patient has received 4 days of antibiotics at this point, and will need a total of 14 days of antibiotics.
His last date of antibiotics should be Sunday, [**2139-12-6**].
This resolved with IV fluid resuscitation and Tylenol.
He was maintained on a beta-blocker for rate control.
The Neurology consult team felt that NPH was unlikely but difficult to assess at this time, and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6817**] in [**1-10**] months for reassessment at that time.
The patient's prophylactic phenytoin was discontinued per Neurosurgery recommendations, given that the SAH and intraventricular blood were resolved on the repeat non-contrast head CT. .
This was likely due to delirium from his infection superimposed on his multi-factorial dementia (Alzheimer's, vascular, [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body), as well as the confounding effect of the sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus noted above.
His Zyprexa was discontinued per Neurology recommendations, and he responded well to Tylenol for agitation.
There was felt to be no indication for straight catheterization or placement of a Foley catheter.
He had been discharged from the hospital about 1 month prior on an increased dose of levothyroxine at 50mcg daily.
He had no evidence of active ischemia on this admission, so he was continued on his aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
