She was found to have a right lower lobe pneumonia on her chest x-ray, and was given two days of levofloxacin.
In the Emergency Room, she was noted to be febrile to 103, sating 98% on a nonrebreather mask.
Effexor XR 150 mg a day.
Lasix 20 mg po q day.
Glyburide 5 mg po q am and 2.5 mg po q pm.
Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
Bupropion 150 mg po bid.
Metformin 500 mg po bid.
Tylenol prn.
Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x2 days.
Albuterol nebulizers prn.
Respiratory rate of 24, and O2 saturation is 98% on a nonrebreather mask.
The patient's levofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover for atypicals and fluoroquinolone resistant bacteria.
She was also noted to have an effusion on the chest x-ray and remained in respiratory distress without needing intubation initially.
Thoracentesis was performed on the day following admission of which 5 cc of purulent pleural fluid was removed and the fluid was sent for culture eventually growing out MRSA.
Because of the frank pus in the pleural space, the right chest tube was placed on the right side posteriorly.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and they recommended and placed one additional chest tube for further drainage.
After the first chest tube was placed, the patient was noted to be going into hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
Following the first chest tube placement, microbiology grew out, and the patient's antibiotics were changed to Unasyn and Vancomycin for Gram negative anaerobe coverage as well as MRSA.
She was kept on supportive care and IV antibiotics for her sepsis that developed.
She was then taken to VATS on [**5-22**] for which she underwent decortication as well as an additional chest tube placement as such that she had now a total of two apical chest tubes as well as a basilar chest tube on the right.
Because of concern of tension pneumothorax, chest tube was placed on the left, but there was no air noted to be rushing out.
It was felt that due to the ET tube and the O2 saturation monitor, the patient's O2 saturations was not indicative of a true hypoxia while in the operating room.
After decortication in VATS, the patient returned to the MICU, and was continued on her Vancomycin.
She was fluid resuscitated and was given dose of ceftazidime to cover for more Gram negatives.
Because of her hypotension, she was started on dopamine briefly, and then changed to Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
She continued to be septic and was kept on Vancomycin, and ceftazidime, and given supportive care and fluid resuscitation.
She was given Levophed for additional pressor support, and eventually started on Vasopressin.
Additional anaerobic coverage was added after she became hypotensive the second time with a consideration of a Clostridium difficile infection which was not borne out by microbiology specimens.
Her ceftazidime was discontinued on the [**4-28**] since we had no evidence of organisms that would benefit from ceftazidime and gentamicin for double gram-negative coverage.
She had also undergone two bronchoscopies, one immediately post VATS decortication to clear out secretions and one on the [**4-29**] to clear her secretions and to prepare her for extubation as she became less vent dependent and was able to tolerate pressure support generating spontaneous breaths as well as low respi's indicating that she would be okay to extubate.
Also on the day she was extubated, she had two right chest tubes removed.
Her last two chest tubes including the last chest tube was removed on [**Month (only) **] the 5th.
She was administered 6 mg of IV adenosine after a 12 lead electrocardiogram was performed to confirm evidence of supraventricular tachycardia.
Given the DNR/DNI order, she was not administered any further medications, and expired 11:08 am.
At one point, it was thought that her central line might have been too distal, and it was pulled back and further episodes of tachyarrhythmias did not occur for one week's duration until the expiration.
