He was aggressively diuresed with HD and oxygenation improved.
He responded well to CPAP and BP improved with nitro gtt.
He underwent HD with 3.5 kg fluid removal and sats improved to 90's on RA.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis started [**2-/2184**] TuThSa 3.
History of clot in AV fistula clot on coumadin - [**Month (only) 958**]/[**Month (only) 205**] of [**2185**] s/p multiple attempts to remove clot 9.
A dual-channel right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the mid and low SVC.
IR PICC placement [**2187-1-10**]: Successful placement of 36-cm total length single-lumen PICC via right basilic vein access with tip in the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory Distress: Two days prior to admission, the patient was discharged s/p anterior STEMI complicated by severe pulmonary edema and hypoxia, treated in the MICU with aggressive hemodialysis which improved oxygenation.
He responded well to CPAP, nitro GTT and hemodialysis.
In the ICU, nitro GTT was used to provide aggressive BP control.
HTN during these episodes responded well to pain control and, if necessary, nitropaste.
In addition, blood pressures drop to the 110's systolic after hemodialysis; the patient's antihypertensive regimen was held as needed post dialysis.
He was maintained on ASA, [**Date Range 4532**], ACEI and statin, as well as aggressive BP control .
He was also made NPO except meds with his diet advanced as tolerated.
The patient has a long history of developing bactermia after completion of an extended course of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia.
The patient was therefore started on empiric vacomycin.
Blood culture drawn from HD catheter on [**1-8**] grew out vancomycin sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
Subsequent surveillance blood cultures from HD and PICC were NGTD until discharge, though final reports were pending.
The patient was continued on vancomycin with HD dosing and goal level 15-20 until discharge.
Of note, on review of MIC data from prior CN-SA infections in the past year, there is a possible trend towards higher vancomycin MIC's, though the organism causing this bacteremia did not continue this trend.
# End-stage renal disease: The patient was maintained on his outpatient HD regiman with additional sessions to control fluid overload.
# Diabetes: the patient was maintained on lantus and sliding scale insulin for blood sugar control with most FSG < 200. .
The patient was given EPO during HD per renal.
# F/E/N: The paitient was not given IVF on the floor.
# PPx: The patient was maintained on a bowel regimen supplemented with metoclopramide and erythromycin ethysuccinate.
Subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were severely short of breath and pulmonary edema, likely the result of multiple factors including fluid overload.
You were treated with emergent dialysis and stabilized in the medical intensive care unit.
You were treated with vancomycin and removed your femoral ("groin") intravenous line.
We placed a PICC line for intravenous access until you are discharged.
During your hospitalization, you were also treated for your other medical conditions including renal failure, hypertension, diabetes, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, history of heart attack, and severe abdominal pain.
