He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 54870**] with severe PCP pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.
He reports that he was compliant with his medications and did not have trouble with obtaining the meds.
Otherwise, he denies myalgias, headache, congestion, sore throat, neck stiffness, pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, N/V/D, dysuria, genital sores, rash, or joint pain.
He received solumedrol 125mg, vancomycin, cefepime, levaquin, and bactrim.
Microbiology:  [**Month/Year (2) **] Cx [**12-15**]: Negative Influenza DFA [**12-15**] neg Legionella Urine Ag [**12-16**] neg Cryptococcal Ag [**12-16**] neg CMV viral load [**12-16**] pend Urine Cx [**12-16**] neg Induced Sputum [**12-16**] neg Respiratory culture [**12-18**]: POSITIVE RSV Brochoalveolar lavage [**12-18**]: Negative GS, legionella, fungus, PCP.
He initially received empiric treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin), and repeat full does Bactrim and prednisone for presumed relapsed PCP.
His first BAL from his last admission was positive for CMV-like particles but his serum CMV viral load was negative at that time.
He was not treated for CMV pneumonitis during his first hospitalization (controversial in HIV/AIDS patients).
Influenza DFA, cryptococcal antigen, and legionella urine antigen were also negative.
The BAL, however, was positive for RSV and he was placed on respiratory precautions (no specific treatment available).
Therefore, he was placed on Ganciclovir to treat presumed CMV pneumonitis ( again its controversial whether he has CMV pneumonitis or its a clinically insignificant finding as clinical CMV in AIDS patients is less defined than transplant patients).
His full dose Bactrim and steroids were discontinued and was placed on prophylactic dose of Bactrim.
He was placed on fluid restriction and his sodium normalized.
He was advised to have biweekly CHEM 7 and CBC while on anti CMV treatment and fax the results to the [**Hospital **] clinic.
The duration of anti-CMV treatment is controversial and the ID doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] decide based on his symptoms during follow up.
He should have fluid restriction of 750cc-1000cc daily until his SIADH improves.
