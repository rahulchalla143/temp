for HCV cirrhosis, complicated by h/o variceal bleed, diuretic-resistant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy with suicidal and homicidal ideations who presented to OSH with complaints of dizziness and home BP [**Location (un) 1131**] of 70/30.
He states that he has been dizzy for the past month, but notably worse since having 9L taken off in a paracentesis on [**4-25**] (he did receive albumin).
Nephrology was consulted, and pt was given 25 g of IV albumin, started on D5-1/2NS at 100cc/hr and started on a lasix gtt.
The patient did have a paracentesis at the OSH with 200WBC.
Sigmoidoscopy initially showed clotted blood; follow up colonoscopy the next day showed ulceration, friability and abnormal vascularity in the proximal ascending colon compatible with ischemic bowel.
The pt was treated with ceftriaxone empirically for SBP (a paracentesis was not performed) and discharged on cipro for ppx.
His cirrhosis has been complicated by variceal bleed ([**2138**]) and banding last in [**11-24**], ascites on diuretics, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy.
He was previously listed for [**Date Range **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] but was removed after psychiatric hospitalization for SI/HI.

He had a paracentesis tap performed, was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Hepatology, nephrology, infectious disease,and [**Year/Month/Day **] surgery were following.
His condition deteriorated there requiring pressors and the working diagnosis was not a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis but an intra-abdominal cause for his peritonitis.
At surgery, it looked like there was a colon perforation from the peritoneal tap requiring a right colectomy, end ileostomy and a [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] procedure and complicated by significant blood loss.
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] species continued to grow from peritoneal fluid drawn from his abdominal drain placed during the surgery.
He was maintained on TPN for nutrition.
His antibiotics were changed empirically to daptomycin and meropenem for 48 hours and then he finished a course of vancomycin and meropenem.
His lines were all changed and appropriate resuscitation was performed.
Over the course of the hospitalization, he received multiple blood transfusions for the slow GI bleed, multiple units of platelets to correct his thrombocytopenia, and multiple units of FFP in an attempt to correct his coagulopathy.
The outputs from his drains were repleted appropriately with crystalloid and this effectively served as peritoneal dialysis.
He was on neosynephrine at baseline from this point on to maintain his pressures while attempting a mild diuresis.
He was also on an octreotide drip in an effort to decrease his GI outputs.
A few days later a bedside procedure was done to close to the fascia, and a regular vac was replaced over the wound.
Early on [**5-25**] the patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and vasopressin was added for worsening hypotension.
His peritoneal fluid grew out coag negative staph and he was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics for a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He required 12 units of packed red blood cells, 3 units of platelets, and 8 units of FFP for resuscitation.
The following day the pt was made comfort measures only.
His pressors were stopped, he was started on a morphine drip, and he expired shortly thereafter.
