Admission Date:  [**2192-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-10-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-1-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: pt admitted for TIPS procedure, complication of TIPS; concern for puncture of liver capsule  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS)  History of Present Illness: 43 yo M with HCV cirrhosis and refractory ascites, on transplant list, who underwent TIPS procedure for refractory ascites that was apparently complicated by puncture of liver capsule.
During the procedure, paracentesis for 3L of ascites was performed.
First bottle was collected prior to the TIPS procedure and was pink in color.
During and after the procedure, the patient remained HD stable.
His Hct was 32 prior to procedure and 28 after the procedure but this is also in the setting of receiving 2 units FFP, one bag of platelets and 2 liters LR.
In the ED paracentesis was performed and 5.3 L were drained with peri-procedural albumin.
Two units of fresh-frozen plasma were given prior to the procedure.
Investigation of transfusion rxn [**2192-10-10**]: This patient has experienced a self-limited (transient, cutaneously-restricted) urticarial transfusion reaction within 45 minutes of his first transfusion with pRBC.
(He has, however, been pre-medicated with Benadryl by the medical service as a precautionary measure.)
Urticarial transfusion reactions represent the most minor of allergic transfusion reactions on a spectrum, and are typically due to donor-specific allergens to which the patient has previously been sensitized, rather than universally-present plasma proteins to which the patient would be destined to consistently react with.
As such, there is not yet a need to be vigilant with pre-transfusion antihistamine prophylaxis after such a first, singular, minor urticarial episode.
