He was noted to desat and was placed on a non-rebreather.

An enteric tube traverses through the stomach.
Endotracheal tube appears in the lower trachea near the carina.
Patient received one dose of ativan 4mg IV for agitation while still intubated in MICU; after extubation he did not require more ativan over next few hours.
Patient was continued on CIWA with ativan (can switch to Valium on floor given normal liver synthetic function and fatty liver but no obvious cirrhosis on RUQ ultrasound).
He did not require any benzodiazepines on HD2 and he was discharged home.
Patient received banana bag in ICU, to be followed by PO folate/MV and 3 days of thiamine 500mg IV BID (given altered mental status which could represent Wernicke's encephalopathy).
He was discharged on HD with oral thiamine replacement.
In the MICU his home ASA, lisinopril, crestor and metoprolol were continued.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has arranged for cardiac cath in the following 2 weeks.
At this time, he was not a candidate for PCI give concern that he would not be faithful to plavix and aspirin.
# Airway Protection: Intubated for airway protection in setting of post-ictal combativeness.
In the MICU he received ativan for agitation due to EtOH withdrawal, and was then extubated to room air without further issues, good oxygen sats.
Continued home lisinopril and amlodipine.
Continued home trazodone and sertraline.

You were mechanically ventilated (a breathing tube was placed) for your own protection.
This breathing tube was removed several hours later.
Your withdrawal symptoms were treated with benzodiazepines and your condition improved.
It is important that you in the future have a cardiac catheterization - a procedure that looks at the vessels supply blood to your heart muscles - to evaluate your heart function.
In the setting of a recent seizure and active alcohol withdrawal, it was not considered safe to proceed with an invasive procedure during this admission.
It has considerable negative health effects on your heart.
