Admission Date:  [**2114-3-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2114-3-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-1-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU/Medicine Acove Team  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia, status post pulmonary vein atrial fibrillation, isolation procedure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old gentleman with multiple medical problems, namely paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which he is status post pulmonary vein ablation procedure at [**Hospital6 256**] on [**2114-3-21**] followed by a Prednisone taper started by the electrophysiology team as a standard practice for prophylaxis against pulmonary vein stenosis.
The patient notes being in his usual state of health post ablation in normal sinus rhythm until [**3-20**], at noon when he noted the onset of acute shortness of breath, wheezing and marked dyspnea on exertion while visiting his family in [**Hospital1 **] [**State 350**].
The patient was given intravenous fluids, given history of chronic renal insufficiency and chest x-ray demonstrating bilateral infiltrates thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on Rocephin, Azithromycin and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for further management.
Of note, the patient has a history of a C5-C7 vertebral injury, status post cervical fusion with incomplete repair and he was wearing a soft collar for this.
Thus, if he were intubated he would require fiberoptic intubation.
He was 97% on a nonrebreather facemask.
Clindamycin was added to his regimen initially given his bilateral infiltrates and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for management of aspiration pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal for the past 15 to 20 years with persistent atrial fibrillation for the past seven months, status post failed cardioversion, now status post pulmonary vein ablation on [**2114-3-19**] at [**Hospital6 256**].
C5-C7 bilateral facet fracture, status post cervical fusion in [**2112-4-23**].
Gastrointestinal bleed, in [**2105**] with black stools, decreased hematocrit, likely secondary to increased use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for back pain.
Status post left inguinal hernia repair.
Status post bilateral shoulder surgery, type and details unknown.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
q.d., Oxycontin 20 mg b.i.d., Cartia XL 180 mg b.i.d., Lopid 600 mg b.i.d., Allopurinol 300 mg q.d., Valium 10 mg q.
AM, half of a pill q. PM, Prednisone taper as dictated by the Electrophysiology Service.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5, heart rate 80 and regular, blood pressure 139/77, respirations 25, oxygenation 93% on a nonrebreather facemask.
The initial blood gas on nonrebreather facemask was 7.37/40/126.
He was placed on a regimen of Clindamycin, Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for coverage of anaerobes as well as community-acquired pathogens.
Other possibilities in the differential diagnosis would include congestive heart failure, given the patient's known 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation and the incidence of approximately 3% of congestive heart failure post pulmonary vein atrial fibrillation ablation, it was felt the patient may have been in congestive heart failure.
He was aggressively diuresed on the floor with 40 to 80 mg of Lasix b.i.d.
He was not placed on steroid taper, in fact, the previous steroids were held given that he had only received one dose.
The next possibility would include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, given wheezing on examination and emphysema by chest x-ray.
He was placed on nebulizers which seemed to have minimal effect throughout his hospital course.
He was continued on 81 mg of Aspirin, Gemfibrozil and Valsartan.
Beta blocker was not an issue at the time of dictation.
Hypertension, the patient was continued on Valsartan as well as Hydralazine in order to decrease the afterload with arterial dilators.
He was maintained on Telemetry and remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of dictation.
He remained on Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 2.5 as well as Amiodarone with good effect on both rhythm and rate.
His afterload was reduced with Valsartan and Hydralazine and he was preload reduced with the help of Lasix, both standing and prn.
Neck fracture, status post failed cervical fusion, according to the orthopedics recommendation from Intensive Care Unit he should retain a hard collar while ambulatory, but a soft collar while in bed.
He was continued on Valium for muscle spasm and it should be noted that he will need a fiberoptic intubation if he is to be intubated.
The patient was maintained on a cardiac/congestive heart failure diet.
