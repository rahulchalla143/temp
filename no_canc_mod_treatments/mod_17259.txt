Successful sphincterotomy and stone extraction was performed.
He returned to the [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital where his course was marked by the development of pancreatitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, and progressive abdominal distention.
He was intubated, received aggressive fluid resuscitation, and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as total parenteral nutrition.
Imipenem 500 mg intravenously q 6 h. 2.
Levothyroxine 0.0625 mg q 24 h intravenously.

The ventilator was set to volume supported assist control with fractional inspired oxygen of 0.7, tidal volume 700 cu cm, respiratory rate 14, SPO2 97%.
A nasogastric tube and an endotracheal tube were in place.
Arterial blood gas - pH 7.37, PCO2 35, PO2 114, SAO2 97% on volume supported assist control with an FIO2 of 0.5, tidal volume 700, rate 14.
For the first 4 days, adequate urine output, oxygenation and ventilation were maintained.
