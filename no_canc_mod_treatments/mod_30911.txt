She was treated with appropriate antibiotics and steroid course.
She was intubated initially and had difficulty weaning from the vent and thus underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement.
This was controlled with beta blockade.
Her amiodarone was discontinued as it caused hyperthyroidism.
Additionally, digoxin at that time led to bradycardia.
Endocrinology followed Ms. [**Known lastname 95596**] for her amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and a slow prednisone taper was planned.
Cultures from [**2160-4-3**] show >100,000 Vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecolis (sensitive to Linezolid) and >100,000 Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) (sensitive to linezolid).
Also with sputum from [**2160-4-3**] growing pseudomonas aeruginosa (sensitive to zosyn MIC 64, and gentamicin MIC 4).
She received IV metoprolol 5 mg x 4 without effect.
She also received 6 mg of adenosine x1 and then 12 mg of adenosine, and broke into sinus tachycardia briefly.

[**2160-4-5**]- blood culture x 2- pending [**2160-4-4**]- c diff negative  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 82 yo female with atrial fibrillation, HTN, amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism, s/p trach/peg and chronically vented, who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation with SOB, fever, and tachycardia.
Sputum from [**Hospital1 **] grew out pseudomonas, sensitive to gentamycin (MIC 4) and Zosyn (MIC 64) only.
We started patient on gentamycin and zosyn for a planned 14 day course (to end on [**4-17**]).
Pt was able to be changed to pressure support on HD1 and tolerated that for a few hours.
HD 2, pt had tachypnea after a few minutes on pressure support.
On hospital day 3 changed to pressure support and then tolerated trach mask with out need for vent.
Would consider adding inhaled tobramycin once IV antibiotics are complete for ten more days until she is decannulated.
Will treat pseudomonal infection as above and UTI with linezolid x 14 days (last dose 5/31).
Her fever resolved with antibiotics and her leukocytosis slowly trended down.
Initial component of tachycardia was secondary to hypovolemia which was corrected with IVF on admission.
Given guaiac positive stools and anemia, pt's outpatient cardiologist was emailed who is conteplating the necessity of anticoagulation for the paf.
Coumadin was restarted at time of discharge.
Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism-on prednisone 5 mg po qday as outpatient.
The steroids were increased to hydrocortisone 50 mg q6 hours initially and changed back to rehab dose steroids on HD 3.
Anxiety- alprazolam prn and Quetiapine qhs were continued.
Neurology saw patient for LLE pain/weakness and thought that her exam was most likely consistent with a mypoathy, likely from both steroids and deconditioning.
Please continue fish oil, calcium carbonate, and probiotics.
She was maintained on a PPI for GI prophylaxis, and her coumadin was restarted for DVT prophylaxis.
