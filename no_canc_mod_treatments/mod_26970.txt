He has a chronic indwelling foley and was recently admitted for klebsiella urosepsis.
He was given meropenem and flagyl.
He states that he has had his urinary catheter in for "a long time" but is unable to be more specific.

CV: irreg irreg, no murmrs LUNGS: CTA b/l ABD: soft, non tender, non distended GU: foley in place EXT: no edema  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T 98.0 144/78 HR 76 RR 20 SaO2 96% on RA Afebrile since [**10-3**] General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.
Given previous multi-drug resistent UTIs, was given IV meropenem and he improved.
Was set to be discharged on [**9-30**] but had a previously-scheduled outpatient urological procedure (stent exchange and lithotripsy), so we decided to allow for this while in house.
Unfortunately, he became septic in the PACU following the procedure and had rapid ventricular response to his atrial fibrillation requiring a two day stay in the ICU which was complicated by acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, and cardiac demand ischemia.
Upon returning to the floor, he was treated with IV antibiotics for urosepsis and PO antibiotics for c. diff colitis and he improved, with details as below.
Although no blood or urine cultures grew definitive pathogens, treated for presumptive bacteremia, given previous MDR UTIs, indwelling foley, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome following urological instrumentation, a transient bacteremia was suspected.
#) CATHETER-ASSOCIATED URINARY TRACT INFECTION: No urinary pathogen isolated on this admission (cultures grew > 3, suggestive of contamination)  Given recent history of previous admission for multi drug resistant klebsiella UTI resulting in urosepsis, we treated him empirically with meropenem.
Cultures growing mixed flora from [**Hospital1 1501**] and [**Hospital1 18**] could possibly be true results rather than contamination given chronic indwelling foley.
Reported diarrhea at [**Hospital1 1501**], but this has much improved over the course of his hospitalization.
Given PO metronidazole but switched to PO vancomycin at the suggestion of ID.
Continued on digoxin while here.
Not on coumadin due to fall risk per Atrius records.
("Risk of Falls and Major Bleeds in Patients on Oral Anticoagulation Therapy."
#) DIABETES MELLITUS: Glipizide and metformin held in setting of sepsis.
Started on insulin drip [**10-1**] for elevated blood sugars with an anion gap and ketonuria concerning for DKA.
Anion gap closed and patient was transitioned over to an insulin sliding scale.
Upon return to the floor, was restarted on PO meds and insluin was discontinued with good response in blood sugars.
