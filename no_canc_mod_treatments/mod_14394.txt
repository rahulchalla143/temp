Respiratory distress secondary to surfactant deficiency status post surfactant therapy times two.
Rule out sepsis in progress being treated with Ampicillin, Ceftazidime and Tobramycin.
She completed a course of betamethasone prior to deliver and the mother was treated with antibiotics for approximately one week subsequent to her admission to [**Hospital1 188**], but had not been treated for antibiotics for approximately one week prior to delivery.
The mother underwent cesarean section on [**2196-5-18**] secondary to the development of a maternal fever at 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
The presence of the fever therefore prompted a cesarean section in the setting of prolonged premature rupture of membranes.
He developed increased work of breathing and grunting shortly after birth and was placed on CPAP without significant improvement.
He was thus admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further management of prematurity, respiratory distress as well as evaluation for possible infection and rule out sepsis.
Retractions and expiratory grunting prior to intubation.
Cardiovascular:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] had blood pressures, which were initially notable for means below 40 and he was treated with one normal saline infusion at 10 cc per kilogram.
Status post his normal saline infusion his mean blood pressures were greater then 40 and he has had no further episodes of cardiovascular instability including tachycardia, bradycardia or dysrhythmias.
Respiratory:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] was initially trialed on nasal CPAP at 6 cm of water.
He continued to have respiratory distress and a large oxygen requirement and as such he was intubated with a [**2-24**] endotracheal tube and was given 2 doses of surfactant overnight from [**5-18**] through [**2196-5-19**].
His initial ventilator settings were approximately a PIP of 24, PEEP of 6 with a respiratory rate in the 20s, however, by the morning of [**2196-5-19**] his ventilator settings were 18/50 and a rate of 18 with an FIO2 of room air essentially throughout the evening.
He was weaned from CPAP on [**5-23**].
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially baby boy [**Name (NI) **] was made NPO and was placed on intravenous fluids of D10W at 60 cc per kilogram per day, however, subsequent to extubation he is to have his fluids increased to 80 cc per kilo per day.
Hematologic/infectious diseases:  Secondary to his respiratory distress, prematurity, and mother's unknown GBS status as well as the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa either in her amniotic fluid or in the vaginal canal baby [**Name (NI) 1692**] was treated with 7 days of AMpicillin/Gentamicin and Cefatazidime.
