He was diursesed gently with 20mgIV lasix for 2 days, and afterwards his diuresis was stopped.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted who recommended replacement of his biprosthetic valve.
His surgery was performed.
# COPD: Patient was diagnosed with exacerbation at OSH, and he reported wheezing on admission to OSH.
He was started on Azithromycin, Cefppodoxime, and Solumderol at the OSH for 4 days which was stopped on admission due to his clear lung exam and the thought that his DOE was likely due to his severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was continued on his home Advair, Spiriva, and given Ipratropium and Albuterol PRN for control of COPD.
# HISTORY OF AFIB: AFib s/p MAZE procedure.
His home dose of Verapmil 240mg was split into 80mg Q8hrs due to the severe MR and concern for decompensation.
He was continued on his ASA 81 qdaily, and also continued on his home dose of lovastatin 40mg.
Patient asymptomatic, afebrile, admission WBC of 12 with neutrophilia (pt was on steroids previously).
# INSOMNIA: Patient was on melatonin at home.
He was given standing trazodone QHS 25mg to help with insominia.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He underwent bronchoscopy- which did not reveal mucous plugging.
He eventually was weaned from the vent and was extubated on POD 3.
Vasopressor support was weaned and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
ACE Inhibitor was not resumed, as blood pressure would not tolerate it.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
