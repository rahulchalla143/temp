Her INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K and she was transfused 4U pRBC.
She was discharged off coumadin with close follow up to determine if the morbidity of anticoagulation outweighs the risks given this is her second GI bleed since her PE and there is little evidence that a single PE merits AC for >6 months.
# Coagulopathy: On review of OMR, it appears that the patient has had a number of elevated PTTs since starting ciprofloxacin for SBP PPx in addition to warfarin.
During her last admission in [**Month (only) 956**], warfarin was repeatedly held for elevated INRs.
Now s/p 2U FFP and 10mg vitamin K IV.
Received additional dose of vitamin K for rising INR prior to discharge.
# Cirrhosis: Thought to be secondary to etOH, though patient does have a questionable history of hemachromatosis and had undergone serial phlebotomy in the past with minimal improvement.
Continued Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO Q24H for SBP PPx in the context of IgA deficiency.
Continued Furosemide 20 mg PO DAILY and Spironolactone 50 mg PO DAILY once volume status improved.
Had been on warfarin for the last year now with her second GI bleed.
Discontinued warfarfin as above.
