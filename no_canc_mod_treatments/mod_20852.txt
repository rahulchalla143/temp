Right jugular line can be traced as far as the upper right atrium but the tip is indistinct.
Initial extubation was not tolerated by the patient with increased respiratory distress, requiring reintubation and eventual tracheostomy with prolonged weaning course likely.

The patient spiked a temp to 101 several days after completing this course and given that there was a witnessed aspiration when he self d'c'd his NGT, he was restarted on Vanc and Aztreonam for a 7 day course.
