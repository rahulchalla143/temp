The most notable finding on his catheterization was that his coronaries appeared to be diffusely spastic and could be dilated with the administration of IV nitro.
He was on a nitro gtt on arrival to the CCU, but was able to be weaned to PO meds shortly thereafter.
He was started on aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for his acute coronary syndrome, an ACE-inhibitor for aid in cardiac remodeling, and diltiazem and isosorbide mononitrate for relief of coronary vasospasm.
Given his pulmonary disease, no beta-blocker was given.
He tolerated these medications well, with no side effects.
# Pump: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had markedly elevated filling pressures by R heart catheterization and received IV lasix during the procedure.
Prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an episode of hypotension after getting his PO lasix dose.
He was given additional PO fluids and his BP responded well, so his PO lasix was discontinued since it was felt that he was euvolemic, perhaps even hypovolemic, and his ECHO appeared to have a preserved EF (though likely has diastolic dysfunction).
# Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was monitored on telemetry and remained in NSR through the majority of his stay.
# COPD: At the OSH, he was given IV steroids, ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a COPD flare.
However, on admission to the CCU, he had no evidence of a COPD exacerbation (no wheezing, his O2 sats were stable on his home O2 requirement, and had no dyspnea), so he was not continued on steroids or antibiotics.
He was continued on his home COPD regimen (inhaled steroids, long acting anticholinergic, and albuterol).
# FEN: He was put on a low sodium, heart healthy diet.
He was not given any additional IVF after his post-cath hydration.
# PPX: He received SC heparin for DVT ppx, protonix for GI ppx, and colace/senna for a bowel regimen.
