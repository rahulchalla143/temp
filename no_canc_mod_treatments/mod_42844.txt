Admission Date:  [**2110-5-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-5-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-12-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1190**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, hyponatremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 52 year old woman with history of asthma/COPD, HTN, CHF, mental retardation, among other medical problems who presents with complaints of cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing.
This has been felt to be due to SIADH and successfully treated with fluid restriction.
In the ED, the patient was given albuterol and atrovent nebs, methylprednisolone 125mg, and azithromycin 250mg.
(She also received hydration with normal saline.)
She felt much improved after receiving these medications and currently feels comfortable.
NC O2 in place.
She was transferred to the MICU w/concern for need of bipap given ongoing hypercarbia.
However, she did well and did not require emergent bipap.
She likely has a component of obstructive sleep apnea, and would benefit from bipap at night.
While in the MICU she was tried on bipap at 10/5 and did well, so if she has more problems with OSA, would recommend this regimen at night.
She also was kept on solumedrol for a presumed COPD exacerbation and given levofloxacin for a LLL pna.
She was discharged on a prednisone taper, and her outpatient dose of lasix 80 mg po bid.
Hyponatremia:  This was felt to be due to polydypsia as well as hydrochlorothiazide usage.
It resolved with fluid restriction of 1500 cc/day, and holding hctz.
Type II DM: She was kept on an insulin sliding scale, and her glyburide was initially held while NPO.
She should be continued on lantus and a regular insulin sliding scale on d/c, and when her renal function improves, her glyburide can be restarted.
