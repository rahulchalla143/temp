Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation x 2  History of Present Illness: This is a pleasant 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, parox afib, hip fracture 4 years ago and s/p b/l mastectomy for breast cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 12594**] after fracturing her left humerus on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF, anemia-guiaic positive requiring transfusion-neg egd-(esophagitis and gastroparesis), no colonoscopy done due to instability, with d/c to rehab on [**10-3**], then re-admitted [**10-4**] with resp distress, initially thought [**3-6**] pneumonia, placed on broad spectrum abx, spiked fever on [**10-5**], ICU stay without intubation, but [**3-6**] high o2 requirement serial CT's done and revealed interstitial fibrosis and b/l ground glass opacities.
Has been afebrile since [**10-5**], on zosyn/vanc until [**10-11**], switched to levoquin at that time.
Because of CT findings, diff expanded to possible amio toxicity (for afib on for years w/o previous problems), pulm fibrosis, alv proteionisis, fat embolism and steroids were started.
Patient primarily transferred for further management of shoulder.
.. She feels comfortable, has some pain in left arm which is better after iv pain meds.
Past Medical History: hypertension hypothyroidism paf ?ischemic coronary disease by records (only 1 note--no details) hip fracture 4 years ago s/p b/l mastectomy for breast cancer, on tamoxifen.
depr/anxiety   Social History: Former smoker-quit >20 years ago, says about [**2-4**] pack per day for approx 20 years, very infr.
Diffuse ground glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis consistent with the diagnosis of ARDS, with associated organizing fibrosis.
Although the etiology of ARDS is uncertain, hyperdensity of the liver raises the concern for drug reaction from amiodarone toxicity as a potential cause of ARDS.
Increased CT attenuation of the liver could be due to amiodarone toxicity given that the patient had been on amiodarone.
CXR [**2120-11-12**]: Tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.
MICROBIOLOGY: c diff neg x 3, toxin B: pending VRE UTI by cx [**2120-11-7**] [**2120-11-2**]: mod MRSA in sputum pl fld [**2120-10-26**]: rare MRSA BAL [**10-14**] and [**2120-10-25**]: HSV 1, 10-100K MRSA   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is an 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, paf who suffered humeral fracture on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF at [**Hospital6 19155**] which failed.
She suffered progressive respiratory failure and was eventually made CMO and passed.
- started acyclovir 400mg tid on [**2120-10-19**] for HSV 1 cultured from lungs.
Pt was intubated [**10-14**] for bronch and kept intubated for ARDS.
Pt placed on ARDSnet settings then entered in ARDS study.
Per path, hemosiderin and fat laden macrophages have ddx = alveolar hemorrhage; Wegeners; GBM, also can be fat emboli.
- s/p bronch [**10-14**] with BAL to r/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**] PNA.
[**2-4**] has HSV=I  - Tapered steroids that were started at OSH for ?eosinopholic pna, off after [**10-21**].
steroids (methylpred 40qd) restarted [**10-22**] given decompensation.
- extubated [**10-21**] but not doing well on 100% face mask, decompensation due to derecruitment.
Chest tube placed 9/23-4 overnight for pneumo post bronch or due to coughing against tube.
- PTX resolved and CT d/c - subsequent sputum cx grew out MRSA, patient tx w/ course of vancomycin and was again ready for extubation - d/w patient and family led to decision to change code status to DNR/DNI - following extubation, patient again began to fail, presumably due to CHF and likely aspiration - d/w family and patient led to decision to change plan of care to CMO - patient started on morphine gtt and was stable o/n off lasix gtt w/ permissive po's - in the AM, family requested d/c 100% NRB and patient expired w/in approximately 15 minutes from respiratory arrest .
# Humeral fracture: Humeral head shattered, rods floating freely in rotator cuff.
Plan was for OR repair [**2-4**] weeks following pulmonary recovery.
Toxin B pending.
On aspirin 81mg, will continue this / hold beta-blocker given relative bradycardia.
c) rhythm: h/o paroxysmal AF, not currenly on anti-coag given recent guiac positive stools with HCT drop at OSH.
# Anemia: - OSH EGD [**10-1**] showed esophagitis - PPI increased to [**Hospital1 **] when patient developed black stools - colonoscopy deferred given respiratory status and relatively stable hct - patient continued to have guiac positive and occasionally black stools and was supported w/ transfusions until made CMO .
# depression/anxiety: continue paxil (dose decreased while on linezolid to decrease r/o serotonin syndrome) # h/o breast cancer: continue tamoxifen # hypothyrodism: continue synthroid.
# Thrombotic prophylaxis: Patient should be on coumadin for afib, lovenox for fracture but given concern for GI bleeding, unstable crits at OSH, thus, these medications were held.
SQ heparin was administered.
# Code:full  -> DNR/DNI -> CMO # Access: right subclavian TLC ([**10-18**]), right DP a-line ([**2033-10-16**]), right fem a-line [**10-25**] (could not place in either arm or left foot) .
