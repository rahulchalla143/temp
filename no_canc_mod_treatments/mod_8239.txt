HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35119**] is a 66-year-old male with a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, portal vein thrombosis, with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presents following cardiac catheterization suggesting the need for revascularization.
Catheterization at that time demonstrated that he required a stent in his right coronary artery.
He had further interventions involving stents to both the proximal and the middle left circumflex artery.
Since that time, he has been relatively asymptomatic; however, he had a positive stress test in [**2195-4-15**] in which he had anterolateral electrocardiogram changes and reversible ischemia involving the inferior wall, anterolateral wall, and apex on nuclear imaging and was referred for catheterization.
Coronary artery disease (as described above) with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2194-6-15**] with right coronary artery stent and stent placement in [**2194-7-16**] to the middle and distal circumflex artery.
Status post left carotid endarterectomy.
Lisinopril 80 mg p.o.
Atenolol 100 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Prilosec 40 mg p.o.
Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o.
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
He had a catheterization that revealed 50% left main disease, 80% in-stent restenosis of the left circumflex, and 90% focal restenosis of the right coronary artery, with a 50% distal lesion.
The patient was referred to Cardiac Surgery for intervention.
On [**2195-5-26**], the patient was taken to the operating room where he had a coronary artery bypass graft times three.
His grafts were left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to PL.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 76 minutes with a cross-point time of 63 minutes.
The following day, his chest tubes were discontinued, and he was stable enough to be transferred to the floor.
Upon arrival on the floor, his Foley catheter was discontinued.
For this reason, he was started on amiodarone, and his Lopressor was progressively increased.
However, by this time, he did become mildly bradycardic, and his amiodarone dose was decreased.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Prilosec 40 mg p.o.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
