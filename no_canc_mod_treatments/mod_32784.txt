Right retroperitoneal, perivesicular and right inguinal hematoma without evidence for active extravasation.
His parafalcine subdural hematoma was managed non operatively; serial head CT scan and neurologic checks were performed and remained stable.
He was taken to the operating room on [**6-14**] by Orthopedics for open reduction, internal fixation of anterior ring with double plating; open reduction, internal fixation of posterior ring with right sacroiliac screw; examination under anesthesia with stress of pelvic fractures for pelvis stability; open reduction, internal fixation right distal humerus fracture; open reduction, internal fixation humeral shaft fracture extension; neuroplasty of radial nerve and radial nerve exploration (spin-off injury).
He did require transfusion with packed red cells for a hematocrit drop to 22; his hematocrit at discharge was 26.
Because he was a high risk for DVT given his orthopedic injuries and his non weigh bearing status for at least 12 weeks he was started on Lovenox injections [**Hospital1 **].
His pain was initially controlled with a PCA; he was later changed to IV narcotics and then transitioned to oral Dilaudid with adequate pain control.
He was also placed on a bowel regimen.
His home medications were restarted and he was tolerating a regular diet.
He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended home with services.
