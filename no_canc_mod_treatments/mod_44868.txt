Her respiratory rate was 19, and her O2 saturation was 100% prior to intubation on room air.
In general, she was intubated and sedated having just received Versed.
On neurologic examination, her mental status:  She was intubated and sedated.
This [**Name2 (NI) 19843**] was D/C'd on [**3-3**], and CSF cultures withdrawn from the [**Month (only) 19843**] prior to removal were negative for any infection.
Because of the level of consciousness, she remained intubated and the family decided for a trial of extubation and to see if she would be successfully extubated.
On [**3-10**], she was extubated and given steroids prior to extubation to prevent laryngeal edema, but she began to have stridor, and a few hours later, the family requested that she be reintubated and this was done.
With regards to the right arm shaking, this was not thought to be a seizure, but she was given Dilantin prophylactically in the Emergency Room until it could be straightened out.
Ventilator dependence:  The patient's original reason for intubation was depressed level of consciousness.
She, as mentioned, remained intubated and plans were made for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
Currently she was weaned off of the ventilator to just a trach mask at 40% FIO2 and has been oxygenating well.
These were initially treated with levofloxacin for presumed aspiration and vancomycin was later added in the case of a nosocomially acquired MRSA infection.
There were a couple of sputum samples showing gram-positive cocci in pairs, and on [**3-10**], the report on the Gram stain gram-negative rods and gram-positive rods 2+ and 3+, but the respiratory culture shows only sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
Nevertheless, her levofloxacin was continued for a total of 11 days given the recent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.
She has been afebrile now for three days, and will not require any further antibiotic treatment at this point.
Therefore, the plan is to send her to a facility that accepts tracheostomy tube care.
