At [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was treated with epinephrine, Benadryl 50 IV, SoluMedrol 125 mg IV, pepcid 20 mg IV, racemic epi, and a 500 cc NS bolus.
ENT evaluated her for a possible surgical airway; laryngoscopy was consistent with angioedema.
ENT recommended observation, d/c'ing lisinopril permanently, and decadron 12 mg Q8H.
In the ED, she received 2 albuterol nebs and was admitted to MICU for close observation.
There, she was treated overnight with Decadron 12 q8h, Benadryl 25 once, and Nebs q6h.

Her care was continued on the floor, where a taper of her steroids was begun.
She was also treated with famotidine and diphenhydramine.
On discharge, she was given a prescription for a 7-day steroid taper and was instructed to follow up with an allergist, whose name and number were provided, as well as her PCP.
