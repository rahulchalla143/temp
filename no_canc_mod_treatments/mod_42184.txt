She was admitted at [**Hospital6 **] from [**7-29**] to intravenous heroin until [**7-28**] when she voluntarily entered detoxification program and was started on methadone.
She was initially treated with Vitamin K, methadone and Phenergan, and on [**8-8**] was begun on lamivudine for hepatitis B treatment after her hepatitis panel came back positive for a hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody.
The patient's INR rose to 3.3 and she was transfused with two units of fresh frozen plasma during the course of her admission.
She was treated with Vitamin K and lactulose.
At [**Hospital6 **], she was treated with lactulose, Vitamin K, lamivudine and her mental status was noted to be significantly depressed compared to her discharge the day prior and she was reported to have been intermittently responsive with nonsensible speech and unable to follow verbal commands.
She was treated with increasing doses of lactulose without significant improvement in her mental status.
Regarding her risk for cerebral edema and increase in intracranial pressure, the decision was made to perform neurologic checks every two hours and to address the issue of ICP monitoring if she did develop signs of intracranial pressure, and if the decision was made to place the monitor, we would then further consider possible mannitol and intubation with hyperventilation.
However, we did initially send off transplant laboratories with the possibility of her qualifying for a transplantation.
She was continued on Vitamin K and the decision was made to transfuse her with fresh frozen plasma if she developed any evidence of active bleeding or if the decision was made to transfuse her prior to procedures.
We continued to treat her aggressively from a medical standpoint once it was determined that she would not qualify for a liver transplantation based on her drug use history.
Per Liver Service, our medical management included lactulose, enemas and oral preparations through her nasogastric tube.
She continued on her lamivudine throughout the course of her hospitalization.
The patient's ceruloplasmin did come back as lower than normal limits.
At that point, the decision was made to consult Ophthalmology for the possibility of Kayser-Fleischer rings and to check a serum and urine copper.
Given the finding on physical exam, on [**8-23**], the patient was started on penicillamine and pyridoxine for possible Wilson's disease.
The Hematology consults felt that the patient's thrombocytopenia might be secondary to low thrombopoietin production given her liver dysfunction and also felt that there might be some underlying low grade DIC also involved, however, they agreed with our decision to not transfuse the patient with any blood products in the absence of active bleeding.
Despite aggressive medical management with lactulose, neomycin, lamivudine, total parental nutrition, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate.
On [**8-28**], the decision was made during rounds that the patient had essentially exhausted medical management and further treatment would be medically futile.
Later that afternoon, all medications were discontinued.
The patient's TPN was discontinued and intravenous fluids were discontinued.
