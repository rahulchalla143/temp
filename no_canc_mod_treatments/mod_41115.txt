Admission Date:  [**2180-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-1-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Ascending cholangitis ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP [**2180-7-28**]  History of Present Illness: 82 yo w/ hx of afib (on coumadin, which is currently on hold), COPD, s/p ORIF of left femur fracture and reccent IVF filter placement for a rectus sheath hematoma who is admitted from [**Hospital3 4107**] for urgent ERCP in the setting of septic shock.
During this hospitalization she was found to have a RML and LLL infiltrates on CXR and was treated for a COPD exacerbation initially with IV solumedrol and levaquin though this was transitioned to PO prednisone and Cefazolin after sputum culture grew E coli resistant to levaquin.
Culture also grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and she was treated with diflucan/cefzolin for a total 5 day course which ended on [**7-25**].
This finding lead to the discontinuation of her coumadin, the starting of lovenox and the placement of an IVC filter on [**7-19**].
She was discharged on [**7-25**] back to rehab in no respiratory distress and on 2L NC and was immediately readmitted for complaints of transient unresponsiveness, shortness of breath hypoxia.
She was given one 125 mg of IV Solu-Medrol in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and placed on BiPAP.
It is not clear from the medical record what her presenting vital signs were, but by reprot she was found to have a normal WBC (6.2) with a 36% bandemia and required pressor support with levophed and was started on vancomycin/imipenem/cilastatin.
Troponins were initially elevated at 0.16 (subsequently trended down) with a non-ischemic appearing EKG by report.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 98.2, 81, 140/78, 93% NR   Past Medical History: - H/o PE/DVT in [**2173**], previously on coumadin until recent femur fracture) and hematoma s/p IVC filter [**2180-7-19**] - History of recent L femur fracture s/p ORIF (admitted [**2180-6-25**] for SOB and mechanical fall, surgery on [**2180-6-29**] @ [**Hospital1 34**], course complicated by bleeding requiring transfusion, COPD exacerbation and PNA) - COPD (on home O2, 2 L baseline) - Restrictive lung disease - Aflutter/Afib (RV dilation with EF 50-55%) - dCHF - HTN - osteoporosis - anemia of chronic disease - PMR - Hypothyroidism - Depression - Hypertension - Restless legs syndrome - Glaucoma - Recent GI bleed [**3-/2180**] (EGD showed non-bleeding antral ulcers)  Social History: - Married, lives with husband until recent hospitalization, was recently discharged on [**7-25**] to rehab and immediated readmitted now transferred here.

-[**7-28**] CXR line placement: ET tube tip is 4.1 cm above the carina.
-[**7-29**] CXR RIJ Line Placement: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right IJ catheter, the tip of which is difficult to see but appears to extend to the lower SVC.
PROCEDURES: - ERCP [**2180-7-28**] --Medications: total time 4.2 minutes; glucagon 0.4 mg; 24.662 Gycm2, 296.16mGy; General Anesthesia --Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
----Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
----Procedures: Given cholangitis and dilated biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Pus and sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon.
--Impression: A single periampullary diverticulum with large opening was found at the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
iven cholangitis and dilated biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Pus and sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F with complicated medical history, including COPD and restrictive lung disease requiring 2 L O2 supplement at home, diastolic CHF, history of PE and DVT, recent fall c/b left femur fracture requiring ORIF, subsequent COPD exacerbation and E. coli pneumonia, rectus sheath hematoma leading to discontinuation of warfarin and IVC filter placement, and septic shock transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP given concern for ascending cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia.
While patient was at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **], she was weaned off levophed and treated with imipenem/cilastatin for E. coli bactermia/ascending cholangitis.
Patient underwent ERCP with general anesthesia with sphincterotomy and evacuation of pus.
She received a dose of meropenem and cefepime then was switched to ceftriaxone based on the E. coli sensitivity in blood culture from [**Hospital3 **].
# Acute respiratory distress, most likely [**12-30**] acute on chronic diastolic heart failure in the setting of underlying COPD and restrictive lung disease, recent COPD exacerbation, and recent PNA.
Patient was noted to be on NR on initial presentation, crackles on exam, and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.
While in [**Hospital1 18**], she received IV lasix and responded well to 20 mg lasix.
Given the low suspicion for ongoing COPD exacerbation, decision was made to taper her prednisone starting at 40mg and decreasing 10mg per day until she reaches her home dose for her PMR, especially in the setting of E. coli bacteremia/ascending cholangitis.
Patient was placed on nebulizer with ipratropium and albuterol, inhaler tiotropium and fluticasone.
Evident on exam, likely result of recent hospitalizations during which she received multiple blood products and likely IVF for the septic shock.
Patient was diuresed with IV lasix.
She was restarted on oral digoxin, diltiazem, metoprolol, lisinopril after extubation.
Admission weight 110kg, 101kg at transfer after several days diuresis with IV lasix.
She was kept on oral digoxin and diltiazem and metoprolol.
Aspirin was held given the ERCP.
Patient was kept on digoxin, diltiazem, atorvastatin after extubation.
Metoprolol was re-introduced.
Aspirin was held because of the ERCP.
Hgb and Hct at transfer noted to be 7.2 and 22.1, somewhat decreased from prior values, but VSS and no signs of bleeding on exam.
Previously on warfarin until the discovery of the abdominal rectus sheath hematoma.
The initial plan from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] was to hold off warfarin for 1 week from [**7-25**], but now that patient has had ERCP, she should be off antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**]/anticoagulation/NSAIDs for 5 days, so that the earliest day when she can restart would be [**2180-8-2**].
Warfarin has been held since the discovery of the hematoma at [**Hospital3 **], and aspirin was held for ERCP (with the plan to hold for at least 5 days).
Steroid taper as above.
Patient will continue to require physical therapy with touchdown weight bearing as previously recommended.
No acute indication for anticoagulation given chronic appearance, risk of bleeding from recent ERCP with sphincterotomy.
Patient was continued on home dose levothyroxine 25 mcg daily.
Medication changes: -Continue ceftriaxone for 2 weeks, to be completed on [**2180-8-11**] -Re-evaluate whether to restart coumadin -Continue prednisone at tapered dose of 10mg on [**8-1**].
Patient should then continue on her home dose for her polymyalgia rheumatica (please confirm prior dosing).
