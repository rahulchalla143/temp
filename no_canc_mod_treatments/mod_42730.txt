Nasogastric tube extends to the proximal to mid portion of the stomach.
Limited study due to lack of iv contrast.
The orogastric tube is coiled within the pharynx, although subsequently passes into the esophagus.
The circumflex artery gives off a large first obtuse marginal that contains an 80% stenosis.
Bypass graft angiography demonstrates a patent vein graft to PDA and patent LIMA.
CXR [**2194-5-4**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-2**], there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach.
Monitoring and support devices remain in good position.

Interventional pulmonary as well as Cardiology were consulted, and pulmonary deferred any procedure until NSTEMI was taken care of.
The patient was treated with CTX x 2 during his hospitalization.
As such his NGT that was previously used for TF was discontinued.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM # Coronary artery disease/NSTEMI: EKG changes/enzyme elevations concerning for ischemia versus strain.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended [**Name13 (STitle) **], echo, atorvastatin and hep gtt.
Beta blocker held given long QT.
After transfer to the medical floor, his captopril was converted to Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth daily and his metoprolol was further titrated up.
We discharged him with [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**]/[**First Name3 (LF) **], and the previously mentioned medications with f/u with cardiology.
He did not receive a trach and was extubated on [**2194-4-30**].
Notably, it is unclear as to the cause of his upper airway abnormality, and would wonder if PNA from klebsiella was the cause vs. an allergic reaction to bactrim as previously documented in OSH notes.
Tolerating vent well and was on pressure support for majority of ICU stay.
Diureses was initiated with improvement of pulmonary edema.
He completed an 8 day course of ceftrixone x 1 in the ICU.
We held off on further diuresis as the patient seemed to be euvolemic and he was discharged without diuretics.
# Delirium: Neuro c/s is currently following, and most likely cause is delirium in the setting of prolonged hospitalization with multiple interventions.
He was started on a nitroglycerin drip and weaned off.
He was started on metoprolol and uptitrated to HR and BP goals.
Ultimately, the patient was started on metoprolol and captopril, both of which had to be uptitrated after extubation for hypertensive.
Amlodipine 10 mg by mouth daily was added as well.
Given the patient's persistent leukocytosis (see below), the patient was treated with a 2nd course of CTX, also given the klebsiella on sputum Cx.
Also thought about possible allergic rxn to medications, and nonessential meds were d/c'ed (most notably pantoprazole).
Diureses with lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] was initiated to help with vent weaning which showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
We did a thorough w/u of further infection, and the patient was treated with another round of CTX x 8 days given UTI and persistent scant kleb on sputum cx.
As the patient had no localizing si/sx, we held off on further w/u, and trended down to 12.9 at time of discharge.
# Hyperlipidemia: started atorvastatin given concern for ACS.
# Intertrigo: Pt started on miconazole powder here prn for the intertrigo.
# FEN: started on tube feeds.
Speech and swallow saw the patient and cleared him for a pureed solid, thin liquid diet.
# Communication: -Wife [**Name (NI) 8214**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103809**].
# FOLLOW UP ISSUES - Will defer decision to restart diuretics to the outpatient setting - Further titration of BP medication (increase in metop if necessary, or switch to labetalol, or perhaps start of other medication) - Would consider further w/u of persistent leukocytosis and eosinophilia - Patient will need encouragement for PO intake to improve hydration and volume status.
