Continued CIWA scale in MICU Q1 hour with valium 10-20mg Q1 initially, now at Q2-4hours.
Floor team was made aware that mental status changes may not be secondary to just ETOH withdrawal, but may also have componenet of benzo/ETOH intoxication considering the large amount of valium he had received in the MICU (>130mg).
He was given zofran for nausea (amylase/lipase normal).
Continued low-dose home amlodipine and atenolol, as well as PRN hydralazine for SBP>180's, while recognizing this could mask symptoms of withdrawal.
Maintained on venlafaxine given interaction of EtOH w depression in this pt.
On the floor patient's benzo requirment decreased until benzos were no needed and pt requested to leave.
Continued effexor at home dose given that he has been stable on this, may need dose reduction if liver impairment increases.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Likely due to starvation ketoacidosis, alcohol, ARF.
Also with baseline hypertension.
Continued on home atenolol and amlodipine with PRN hydralazine as above.

On admission you had signs of withdrawal and were admitted to the intensive care unit because you required high doses of benzodiazepines (a medication which prevents alcohol withdrawal).
Eventually you no longer needed these medication to prevent withdrawal symptoms and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought it was okay for you to leave given your great desire to do so.
You will need to enter a rehabilitation program as discussed with our addictions social worker Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 2412**].
