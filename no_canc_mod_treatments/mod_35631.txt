Four days prior to admission, he began having intermittent left-sided chest "twinging" without associated nausea, vomitting, or diaphoresis.
He then underwent a stress echo showing reportedly ischemic EKG changes as well as septal hypokinesis.
He was taken to cardiac catheterization where he was found to have 3VD including proximal LAD and LCX lesions.
After the procedure his pain continued.
He received nitro SL x 2, morphine 2 mg x 2.
Heparin gtt was started.
Several hours later patient awoke with 3/10 chest pain.
Nitro gtt was started at a low dose with minimal relief.
Shortly after arrival to the CCU the patient went to the cath lab for aortic baloon pump which was placed without complication.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

At that time, the patient had received an intra-aortic balloon pump device apparently in preparation for emergent bypass surgery.
Now the patient demonstrates the presence of bypass surgery including sternotomy wires and multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinum consistent with the procedure.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern5) 3250**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 3251**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2172-8-6**] 5:55 PM    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with unstable angina and a catheterization showing 3-vessel-disease including proximal LAD lesion.
Balloon pump was placed resulting in cessation of chest pain.
He was taken to the operating room on [**7-31**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to ramus/OM/PDA) performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.
He had intermittant atrial fibrillation and was treated with lopressor, amiodarone and was started on coumadin.
He received solumedrol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Vancomycin for a presumed pneumonia by chest radiograph.
Bactrim was started for an erythematous sternal incision.
His chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the surgical step down floor.
His epicardial wires were removed.
Aggressive diuresis and pulmonary toilet was undertaken and Mr. [**Known lastname 14301**] pulmonary status improved with this regimen.
By post-operative day seven he was ready for discharge to rehab with continued aggressive pulmonary toilet and conditioning.
