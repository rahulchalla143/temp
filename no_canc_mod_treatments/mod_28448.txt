Brief Hospital Course: On [**2110-7-21**], the patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
That night she underwent attempted exploratory laparotomy for intra-abdominal abscess from anastomotic leak.
On [**2110-7-22**], she underwent CT-guided drainage of this abscess.
Drain produced succus.
She remained NPO with TPN for most of hospital course.
Cardiology consult was obtained and tachycardia was attributed to infection, hypovolemia, and anemia.
She was hypotensive and initially required neosynephrine gtt, which was weaned.
Infectious work-up found enterobacter pneumonia on broncheoalveolar lavage on [**2110-8-5**], and this was treated with a two-week course of meropenem.
She required intermittent hemodialysis as well as CVVH while hypotensive and requiring vasopressors in the SICU.
Intravenous fluids were given as needed for maintenance and for hypovolemia.
CVVH was switched to intermittent hemodialysis when she was off pressor support.
Post-operative course was complicated by Candidemia found on blood cultures on [**2110-7-28**], which was treated with Ambisome ([**8-2**] thru [**8-15**])then Micafungin [**8-15**] thru [**8-24**]).
Central venous access was necessary at all times, with temporary HD catheter and triple-lumen central venous line, as it was not possible to establish peripheral IV access.
R Temporary HD line was removed on [**9-2**] when she had head/neck and bilateral arm edema.
She was started on a Heparin drip.
Coumadin was initiated on [**9-6**].
Heparin was stopped once INR was therapeutic.
Abdominal CT with po contrast was done on [**9-8**] showing decreased size of LUQ collection with extravasated enteric contrast with pigtail catheter positioned appropriately.
Foci of gas at the base of a vacuum drainage apparatus in the anterior abdominal wall was noted.
The abdominal drain was injected and abdomen scanned on [**9-16**].
The pigtail catheter was seen with tip coiled in the left paracolic gutter, just inferior to the spleen.
Post CT, she spike to 103.6 and was hypotensive to 70s necessitating transfer to SICU for IV fluid bolus and IV Neo.
She was pan-cultured and started on Linezolid which continued until [**9-18**] when blood cultures from [**9-16**] isolated pan-sensitive Staph coag positive.
Linezolid was switched to Nafcillin on [**9-18**] per ID recommendations.
Nafcillin was switched to Cefazolin on [**9-26**].
Left IJ CVL and R tunnelled groin HD line, were changed to L temporary femoral HD line [**9-16**].
R groin line was removed and a left arm picc was placed.
The left groin HD line was changed to a tunnelled line in IR on [**9-24**].
The left picc line was placed on [**9-23**] then needed repositioning on [**9-24**].
Blue prolene sutures were visible in wound bed.
Coumadin was started on [**9-6**] for SVC thrombus then held for supratherapeutic INR from [**9-15**] thru [**9-22**].
Coumadin was resumed on [**9-23**] at 2mg.
