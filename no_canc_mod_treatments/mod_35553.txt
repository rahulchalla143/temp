emergency department.
He received ceftriaxone 2 grams, ampicillin 2 grams, acyclovir 900 mg, one liter normal saline and tylenol.
He was now called out of the ICU for further management.
On the floor, patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir as culture data was difficult to inerpret as patient was on empiric antibiotics for about 48 hours prior to LP.
With regard to his hypertension, patient's blood pressure continued to remain elevated despite treatment with amlodipine 5mg, lisinopril 40mg, and metoprolol 75mg TID.
His amlodopine was increased to 10mg QD.
Pt was continued on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin to cover for possible bacterial meningitis for full two week course (last day of treatment will be [**2184-4-30**]).
Pt was strated on Glargine and insulin sliding scale.
On presentation, pt's EKG demosntrated deep ST wave depressions and T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.
He had been on digoxin on presentation but his digoxin level was found to be 1.5 and he initially had bradycardia so his digoxin was held.
Pt was treated with aspirin 325mg QD, metorpolol.
A lipid panel was checked to determine need for statin therapy.
He was started on lipitor.
As his INR was reversed with FFP in the unit, pt was tritrated back to therapeutic INR with lovenox bridge.
Patient's digoxin was held during this admission due to mild bradycardia.
His heartrate remained in a good range without the digoxin, therefore the medication was not continued in patient's discharge medication.
This returned to baseline with improvement of mental status and IV hydration.
The ulcer was treated with daily wet to dry dressing changes performed by the wound care team.

You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir.
You lab work demonstrated no HSV infection therefore you are leaving only with antibiotics and no longer on the acyclovir.
We had to reverse your coumadin in order preform a lumbar puncture and obtain a CSF sample.
You were also noted to have elevated blood sugars and started on an insulin sliding scale and glargine.
You blood pressures were also elevated during your hospital admission so we started you on a new blood pressure medication - amlodipine 10mg by mouth once per day.
We also found a small ulcer on your right heel and left fore arm that we are treating with daily wet-to-dry dressing changes Medication changes include: * We started amlodipine, glargine, antibiotics (ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone), lovenox until you are therapeutic on your coumadin, and lipitor * We increased your Aspirin to 325mg per day * We changed your Metoprolol to 75 PO three times per day * Your heart rate was slightly low when you were admitted therefore we did not give you your digoxin.
