CT surgery was consulted following cardiac catheterization.
The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.
In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM and a saphenous vein graft to the distal RCA.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
Following his, his anesthesia was reversed and he was weaned from the ventilator, at which point he was successfully extubated.
He was transferred from the cardiac surgery recovery unit to Far Six for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
At that time, he was started on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia.
Further chest x-ray was done and his antibiotic coverage was expanded to include levofloxacin as well as ceftriaxone.
Following amiodarone load, the patient was cardioverted back to a normal sinus rhythm.
Over the next several days, the patient was maintained on a ventilator.
On postoperative day 20, he was chemically paralyzed and changed to pressure control ventilation.
Sputum cultures from that time showed gram positive cocci as well as yeast for which the patient was started on appropriate antibiotics.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit chemically paralyzed and on pressure control ventilation throughout that period of time.
In addition to his ARDS, the patient also experienced recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation on more than on one occasion requiring electrical cardioversion.
At that time, he underwent an open tracheostomy at the bedside.
He remained on pressure control ventilation, however his respiratory rate and driving pressures were slowly turned down.
Sputum with Enterobacter was treated with appropriate antibiotics and sinusitis for his OG an nasogastric tubes were removed.
The patient responded well to these therapies.
He continued to show slow pulmonary progress and on postoperative day 41 he was switched from pressure control ventilation to intermittent mandatory ventilation which he tolerated well.
Also, on postoperative day 41 a PEG tube was placed.
He currently is on continuous positive airway pressure with pressure support of 25 and PEEP of 5, 40% FIO2.
