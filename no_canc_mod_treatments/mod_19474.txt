POST-BYPASS (on milrinone): Mild LV global dysfunction.
Mitral valve prosthesis appears similar to prebypass.
A bileaflet aortic prosthesis visualized,well seated and no periprosthetic leaks seen.
She remained on Heparin with no clinical signs of active GI bleed.
She was started on Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
Given her recent history of massive GI bleed and known AV malformations, the GI service was consulted to evaluate for any potential sources of bleeding prior to heparinization with cardiopulmonary bypass.
She was eventually cleared by the GI service to proceed with cardiac surgical intervention.
On [**11-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed redo sternotomy with single vessel CABG and aortic valve replacement.
She gradually weaned from Neosynephrine and Milrinone.
Heparin was resumed for a subtherapeutic prothrombin time while Warfarin anticoagulation was restarted.
White count gradually improved and no additional antibiotics were given.
A bedside swallow examination was performed on postoperative five for a coughing episode following thin liquids.
A thin liquid/soft solid diet was recommended along with close supervision.
