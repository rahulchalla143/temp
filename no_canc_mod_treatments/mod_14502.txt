Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old female with HTN, hypercholesterolemia, bilateral carotid stenosis s/p bilateral CEA in the past, here s/p L carotid stenting after small CVA in L posterior corona radiata with 85-90% re-stenosis of L carotid artery by ultrasound.
1) Carotid stenosis:  The patient was admitted to the CCU s/p successful stenting of her re-stenosed L carotid artery, which was without complication.
She was continued on her plavix 75 mg daily.
Her aspirin was increased to 325 mg daily.
We continued her lipitor 10 mg daily, and recommend that she have an outpatient lipid panel done to assure that she doesn't need a higher dose of her relatively low dose lipitor.
2) HTN:  She arrived in the CCU on a nitroprusside drip for aggressive blood pressure control.
The nitroprusside drip was able to be weaned off over the course of four hours, with blood pressures < 140 (goal).
To achieve this goal of < 140 we increased her metoprolol to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] (from 75 [**Hospital1 **]), continued her lisinopril at 40 mg daily, and added amlodipine 5 mg daily, which she was discharged on.
5) GERD:  We gave her protonix (no nexium in house).
