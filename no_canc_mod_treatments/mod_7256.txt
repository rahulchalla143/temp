Admission Date:  [**2111-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-8-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: E-Mycin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain accompanied by Nausea and vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Dental Abscess Debridement Tooth Extraction Procedure Central line placement due to poor peripheral access.
IR-guided PICC line placement in R arm   History of Present Illness: HPI: 28 year old type I and type II diabetic with right mandibular abscess recently treated with 14-day course of clindamycin, presents claiming to be in DKA, with blood sugars at home [**Location (un) 1131**] greater than 600 mg/dL.
Pt was started on insulin gtt at 10 U/hr and admitted to the MICU.
In the MICU, insulin regimen was closely monitored by [**Last Name (un) **] staff, and anion gap was closed.
Pt was seen by oral surgeons, and abscess was debrided and cultured on [**2111-1-24**], growing out GPC, GPR, and GNR.
Pt started on clindamycin and levofloxacin.
Pt had very poor peripheral access, and after much discussion with patient and psychiatry consult, pt agreed to have central line access for blood draws and medications.
Central line was successfully placed in R IJ and placement confirmed in SVC by CXR.
On morning of transfer at 8AM, pt was given full dose of insulin although pt was not taking PO due to pain/nausea.
Insulin gtt was stopped and all further insulin doses have been held.
DKA: Patient was started on insulin gtt and IV fluids and monitored in the ICU until her DKA had resolved.
A central line was placed in the MICU due to poor peripheral access, and the central line was discontinued 4 days later after an IR-guided PICC line was placed.
At that point, she was transferred to the medical floor on her home regimen of NPH insulin [**Hospital1 **] and humalog SS.
The patient was unable to eat very much, and was also refusing to have an NG tube placed or parenteral nutrition.
Her insulin regimen was continuously adjusted to avoid large fluctuations in her sugars.
Her diabetic control was also complicated by the patient's inability to sense episodes of hypoglycemia.
On discharge, the patient's sugars were maintained in the 100's-200's on 45 units of NPH qAM and 50 units of NPH qPM, with a Humalog sliding scale.
The patient was discharged on this regimen, and will followup with the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center on Tuesday, [**2-10**], for further management.
Mandibular Dental abscess: Her R mandibular dental abscess was debrided on [**2111-1-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] from Oral Maxillofacial Surgery.
The patient was treated with IV antibiotics during her admission, and the ID service was consulted.
The patient continued to have significant jaw pain unrelieved by high doses of morphine and tramadol, and the pain clinic was also consulted for her management.
The patient was discharged with a PICC line in place for IV clindamycin at home, as well as po levafloxacin and fluconazole, for 5 weeks for presumptive osteomyelitis.
Although ID felt that po clindamycin would likely be sufficient, the patient was extremely anxious about going home without IV treatent, as she had had poor response to oral antibiotic therapy in the past.
The patient was also discharged on MSContin and morphine sulfate IR as needed, along with neurontin for neuropathic pain, per the pain clinic evaluation.
In addition, the efficacy of her antibiotic treatment will be evaluated by ID in 3 weeks.
Urinary Retention: During her admission, the patient also was complaining of very low urine output despite adequate fluid intake, and difficulty voiding.
However, the patient refused any catheter intervention, and preferred to continue to attempt to void on her own.
She attributed it initially to being put on amoxacillin-sulbactam, as she claims to have had this reaction to ampicillin in the past.
Her wheezing was relieved by albuterol nebs.
The patient was discharged on low-dose Advair diskus in addition to her albuterol, and was encouraged to followup with her PCP should her symptoms continue.
The patient had refused all subcutaneous heparin DVT prophylaxis.
ENT recommended follow-up for long-term management as outpatient after resolution of current infection.
The patient eventually complied with most issues surrounding her treatment, although she remained resistant to certain interventions as well as attempts to increase her po nutrition intake.
Her nortryptiline was increased to 75mg qhs during admission, and benzodiazepines were used as needed for anxiety.
The patient was transitioned back to her home dose of nortryptiline prior to discharge.
She was maintained on po iron supplementation, and discharged on daily ferrous sulfate.
GI: Patient refused bowel regimen despite ongoing constipation.
Protonix was continued prophylactically throughout admission.
