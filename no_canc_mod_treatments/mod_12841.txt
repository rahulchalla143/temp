HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old man with a severe three-vessel coronary artery disease based on a [**11-19**] catheterization, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, status post kidney-pancreas transplant in [**2107**] with a recent admission for cholangeitis, who reported mild exertional angina which was relieved by Nitroglycerin.
Status post pancreas transplant in [**2107**].
Cadaveric renal transplant times two in [**2107**] and [**2114**].
Status post right retinal detachment and right eye blindness.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 twice a day, Aspirin 325 mg once a day, Prednisone 5 mg once a day, CellCept [**Pager number **] mg twice a day, Prograf 5 mg twice a day, TUMS, Colace, Oxycodone p.r.n., Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA:  [**11-19**] catheterization showed two-vessel disease status post systolic and diastolic dysfunction, ejection fraction of 50%, apical and hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Once the patient was consented, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in good condition on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol drips.
Both of these drips were discontinued on the night of surgery.
The patient's pain was controlled well with Oxycodone; however, the patient did begin complaining of some hallucinations on postoperative day #8, which seemed to improve once the patient was taken off Oxycodone and other opiates.
A psychiatric consult was obtained, and they diagnosed the patient with improving postoperative delirium, as well as schizo-type/paranoid personality disorder; however, no pharmacologic interventions were recommended.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with coronary artery disease, and he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.
The patient continued on Amiodarone and should continue this as an outpatient.
The patient was given boluses to resuscitate him which allowed his renal numbers to improve.
Endocrine:  The patient did have an increased Insulin requirement after surgery and actually required baseline Insulin dosing prior to discharge, which was recommended to be continued after surgery.
The patient was started on Synthroid and will be followed as an outpatient.
His Foley catheter was discontinued, and he was started on Levaquin which was continued through the rest of his admission for a total of 14 days.
Transplant:  Due to the dose of the Amiodarone and Levofloxacin, the patient's Prograf requirement decreased, and his outgoing dose of Prograf was 4 mg twice a day rather than the 5 mg twice a day on admission.
In addition with respect to his pancreas, he did an increasing Insulin requirement.
Moreover, the renal transplant ultrasound on [**12-4**] did not show any abnormalities.
On [**12-6**], the patient was discharged home with VNA care to assist with ADLs, medication administration, evaluation for home health aide, assist with blood glucose monitoring and wound care and inspection.
Status post left upper extremity AV fistula, now with pseudoaneurysm.
