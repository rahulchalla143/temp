HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old female with breast cancer, status post lumpectomy/radiation therapy/Tamoxifen ([**2155**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, multiple urinary tract infections who presents with a four day prodrome of dry cough, rhinorrhea, coryza, malaise, chills, headache, decreased p.o.
Her usual is systolic blood pressure in the 120s, this was despite two liters of intravenous fluids and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring for possible early sepsis.
The Intensive Care Unit course was notable for initially receiving broad spectrum antibiotics as well as a white blood cell count of 11.0 with 15 bands.
She was ultimately changed to Levaquin for a possible early pneumonia pending cultures.
The Intensive Care Unit course was also notable for negative chest x-ray, two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24.0 with appropriate bump in her hematocrit and no evidence of bleeding, stable blood pressure despite a net fluid balance of negative 2.5 liters.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Breast cancer diagnosed in [**2154**], Stage I, status post left lumpectomy, on [**2156-4-20**], and repeat surgery with sentinel node dissection on [**2156-5-18**].
Invasive mucinous carcinoma with estrogen receptor positivity and HER2/NEU negative.
Evista 60 mg p.o.
Tamoxifen 20 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Triamterene/Hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg p.o.
Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Meclizine 25 mg q8hours p.r.n.
Synthroid 125 mcg daily.
This was not significantly changed from comparison with [**2160-2-28**].
[**Last Name **] problem list is as follows:  Hypotension - This was likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of a diarrheal and viral respiratory syndrome.
She did receive two units of packed red blood cells.
The initial bandemia would not have been consistent with a typical influenza presentation, so she was continued on a fourteen day course of Levaquin to eliminate any possibility of a bacterial superinfection or early pneumonia.
She was reinstated on iron at discharge and her hematocrit was stable.
Hypothyroid - She was continued on her Synthroid.
