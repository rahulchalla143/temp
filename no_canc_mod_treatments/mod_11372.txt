Unit No: [**Unit Number 41750**] Admission Date: [**2186-6-11**] Discharge Date: [**2186-7-20**] Sex:  Male Service:  General Surgery   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old Caucasian male who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2186-6-10**], with the following diagnoses of fatigue, dehydration, status post resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumor in [**2185-12-26**].
The patient is an 80 year old male patient with a past medical history of Crohn's and had just had tumor resected by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metastases of the chest, status post Gleevec tumor therapy.
He was seen to have a perforation at the distal transverse colon on the proximal sigmoid and he was having a transverse left end sigmoid colectomy, colostomy, Hartmann's pouch with placement of a gastrostomy tube, jejunostomy tube and take-down of the splenic flexure.
The patient received blood transfusions, as well as aggressive Intensive Care Unit care.
The patient was eventually weaned off the vasopressin for support and was started on TPN for nutritional support due to his prolonged Intensive Care Unit admission.
The patient in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] continued to have hemodynamic instability and despite noninvasive imaging immediate source was not obtained.
The patient was given fluid and Levophed and packed red blood cells in hopes to increase blood pressure and hemodynamic stability and was thought origin might be due to intra-abdominal sepsis and was reintubated for airway protection.
On [**2186-6-29**], thoracic surgery was consulted and chest tube was placed and 750 cc of serous fluid was obtained in the pleurovac.
Over the next few days, the patient continued to have massive drainage from the chest tube and was eventually stabilized.
An infectious disease consultation was obtained for management of his intermittent fevers and for further investigation of his intra-abdominal sepsis.
General surgery consultation was appreciated and continued to follow closely in conjunction with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
The patient continued to have hemodynamic instability despite numerous attempts to wean the patient from ventilatory support secondary to hemodynamic instability, hypovolemia and intra-abdominal sepsis.
The patient was restarted on nutritional support via TPN and stopped on tube feeds.
Chest tubes continued to drain considerable amount of serosanguineous fluid with the drainage from his gastrostomy tube continuing.
Fluid boluses provided only transient effect.
Initial Lopressor given provided no effect.
The patient was cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm and improved with two additional fluid boluses.
The patient was monitored closely for additional cardiac events.
The patient was tried on continuous positive airway pressure and eventually was weaned after an extended period of time and was extubated on the morning of [**2186-7-11**], and he appeared to be clinically improving for a few days, however, began to have some mental confusion the day after extubation on [**2186-7-12**].
The patient was decided to become DNI on approximately [**2186-7-16**], after requiring multiple fluid boluses and restarted on Levophed overnight due to additional hemodynamic instability.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hemodynamic instability requiring multiple fluid boluses and pressors.
