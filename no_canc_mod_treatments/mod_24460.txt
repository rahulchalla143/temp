He was intubated and a head CT there showed, per report, a large IVH with blood in the 3rd and 4th ventricles possibly coming from the right caudate head, temporal horns mildly enlarged with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was hypertensive on arrival with BP 180s, intubated and sedated on propofol.
Physical Exam: On admission: O: T:  BP: 180/120  HR: 74  AC 1.0/14/500/5 Gen: Intubated and sedated on propofol HEENT: Pupils: Nonreactive but on propofol.

Bilateral transfrontal ventriculostomy catheters are once again noted, unchanged in position from most recent prior.
Bilateral transfrontal ventriculostomy catheters are once again noted, unchanged in position from the most recent prior.
Limited study due to the patient's body habitus and portable technique.
EEG [**2170-12-6**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the widespread uniform alpha to beta frequency patterns.
RUE u/s [**2170-12-6**]: Small amount of non-occlusive thrombus around the right PIC catheter in the cephalic vein.
Unchanged opacification of the right maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses as well as the right nasal cavity.
Head CT [**2170-12-11**]: Unchanged intraventricular hemorrhage status post removal of ventriculostomy catheters with unchanged dilation of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle, comapred to the most recent CT study.
Neurosurgical team performed bilateral placement of external ventricular drains (EVDs).
His phenytoin level was therapeutic; however, phenytoin was switched to levetiracetam.
Hypertension: His BP required multiple agents to be well-controlled.
He was initially on clonidine, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
The clonidine was gradually weaned off as metoprolol was titrated up.
But his SBP went back up to the 180s, and clonidine was re-started.
Hydralazine and amlodipine were added and metoprolol was changed to labetolol.
The presumed diagnosis was ventriculitis, and patient was treated empirically with a 12-day course of vancomycin and ceftazidime.
He  was transferred from the neurosurgical service to the medical service and a heparin drip was also started.
He was transitioned to Coumadin without complication and has a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5 due to his risk of repeat ICH.
He needs Coumadin treatment for three months.
It was felt that his renal failure may be related to AIN given peripheral eosinophilia and recent antibiotic administration.
His antibiotics were stopped and his renal failure remained stable.
His renal failure was not responsive to IV fluids and was felt to less likely be prerenal.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral Intraventricular Hemorrhage Entrapment of Lateral Ventricle Hydrocephalus Uncontrolled Hypertension Ventilator-associated pneumonia Ventriculitis/Meningitis DVT/PE   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had a bleed in your head.
The bleed in your brain affected your breathing and we had to help you breathe with a breathing machine (ventilator), but you subsequently became able to breathe by yourself again and the ventilator was no longer needed.
You had two serious infections while you were in the hospital: a pneumonia and an infection in the ventricles of your brain (where the drains were), for both you were treated with antibiotics through your IV.
For that, you were treated with blood thinners that you will need to continue for 3 months.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
?Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
You also had high blood pressure during your admission and your medications were adjusted.
You also had an acute kidney injury that was thought to be due to the antibiotics you had been receiving.
You should have your creatinine checked weekly.
