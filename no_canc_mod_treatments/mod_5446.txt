Physical Exam: Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: No(t) Systolic, No(t) Diastolic) Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Not assessed), (Left radial pulse: Not assessed), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: (Breath Sounds: Clear : , No(t) Crackles : , Wheezes : ) Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, ostomy with green liquid stool output Extremities: Right: 3+, Left: 3+ Skin:  Warm, Erythemous lesions on LE Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Not assessed, Oriented (to): x3, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: Bicarb  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output and some worsening of renal failure.
INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT - consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare to have enteritis without colon.
- Continue IV flagyl for now  - Check stool culture and c.diff (2nd today).
Baseline B12 deficiency (repleted), MDS, CKD.
- check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past per notes from several years ago) -  T&S, would not transfuse unless <21 -  Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
- Treatment of acidosis as above  &#9658; CELLULITIS.
- Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, would continue given her improvement.
Add on vanco level today - Continue topical antifungal powder - Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections - done, negative for collections.
Culture not sent at the time of UA - check culture - continue cipro x ~7 day course.
will check into  GERD  - continue protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (on at home)  MICU Course: Patient noted to have shortness of breath in setting of low bicarb and ongoing diarrhea.
Patient initially treated with IV bicarb, but as bicarb corrected, this was stopped.
Noted to have elevated WBC so treated with vanco for cellulitis (b/l thigh cellulitis clinically improving on vanco), cipro for positive ua (UCx not sent), and flagyl for increased ostomy output (though patient is s/p colectomy for UC which has improved with flagyl).
At that time, please discuss HD axis options and ask him if he would like you to continue your Na Bicarb medication.
