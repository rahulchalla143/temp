HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair on [**8-28**], who began to experience chest pain at 10 p.m. on the night prior to his admission.
At that time the right coronary artery received angioplasty and stent with good results.
No balloon pump was placed secondary to his recent aortic graft, and he was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for monitoring.
Diabetes mellitus times one year, treated with oral hypoglycemics.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair two weeks prior to current admission.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's medications prior to admission included atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Glucophage 1 g p.o.
Sodium 137, potassium of 4.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19, creatinine 1.3, glucose 158.
Creatine phosphokinases 513, with MB of 98, troponin greater than 50.
In summary, the catheterization showed a proximal 90% left anterior descending artery lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion, and a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which received angioplasty and stent.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued monitoring.
Post cardiac catheterization, Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.
The patient was accepted and scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft; however, post catheterization, his creatinine bumped from 1.2 to 1.4, and therefore he was delayed pending the resolution of this creatinine bump.
The patient was started on intravenous nitroglycerin and treated with intravenous morphine with resolution of the pain.
Following this episode of pain, discussion revolved around whether or not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump; however, the fact that the pain had resolved, balloon pump was delayed and the patient was brought that morning to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four.
In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, vein graft to the obtuse marginal, a vein graft to the posterior descending artery, and a left radial graft to the diagonal.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient had an arterial line, a Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes, and a left pleural chest tube.
He was transferred on nitroglycerin at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, Milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine at 0.06 mcg/kg/min, propofol infusion.
He remained intubated overnight.
On the morning on postoperative day one, the patient was weaned off of his epinephrine.
However, he required Milrinone to maintain a sufficient cardiac output.
He was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on the morning of postoperative day one, and he tolerated this well.
He was therefore weaned from his Milrinone on that day.
After his Milrinone was weaned to off, the patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was removed.
He was therefore started on amiodarone.
Following placement of his Swan-Ganz catheter the patient was started on dobutamine to support his cardiac output.
Every attempt to wean his dobutamine met with failure, and therefore he remained on dobutamine through postoperative day eight.
On postoperative day 11, the patient was again noted to have a large left pleural effusion that was tapped by Interventional Radiology for 1.5 liters of pleural fluid.
He remained stable, and on postoperative day 16 was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
