[**2195-2-8**]:  CTA: Intramural hematoma is seen within the mid thoracic aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending inferiorly to the level of the aortic hiatus ([**Location (un) 11916**] type B).
Note is made of an LAD stent.
INDICATION: 87-year-old with intramural hematoma, status post endovascular aortic graft.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of 100 cc of IV Optiray contrast.
The true lumen feeds the major abdominal aortic vessels, including the celiac axis, SMA and renal arteries arise.
There are atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications and a stent within the LAD.
Mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications are noted.
Central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC.
Foley catheter and air are seen within the bladder.
Status post thoracic aortic stent placement with unchanged foci of contrast in the intramural hematoma.
New right femoral pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck, which is amenable to percutaneous thrombin treatment.
