HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 55901**] is an 81-year-old man on Coumadin for a history of DVT and PE who ambulated to [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital early in the day on [**2188-6-12**] for medication refills.
The patient rapidly deteriorated at [**Hospital3 417**] with posturing on examination and he was immediately intubated to maintain airway support and sent via [**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room.
Additionally, the patient was on Coumadin for DVT and PE and was found to have an INR of 2.4 on admission.
The decision after discussion with the chief resident and attending was to take the patient immediately to the Operating Room for decompression of the cerebellar bleed and he was started on an A-line, transfused FFP to reduce his INR and he was given factor VII preoperatively for stabilization of his anticoagulative state.
The patient went to the Operating Room where he received an occipital craniotomy for decompression and removal of the left cerebellar bleed.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the ICU and remained on ventilator support.
After returning to the ICU, a ventricular drain was placed to prevent any hydrocephalus, and the drain was initially set at 18 cm.
The patient was continued on Oxacillin for his ventricular drain.
He was continued on Dilantin and Mannitol as well as Decadron.
He was continued on Dilantin and restarted on phenobarbital for seizure prophylaxis at this time.
He was given Narcan without any success and he was sent for a stat head CT which showed no interval change in the size of his cerebellar hemorrhage.
His medical management was optimized and he was given FFP as necessary to keep his INR less than 1.3, his crit was maintained above 30 and his platelets were maintained above 100.
The patient continued to be ventilator-dependent and was continued on assist control ventilator support.
His Mannitol and Decadron doses were decreased at this time.
There was a concern that the patient may have aspirated while undergoing the MRI and he was initially started on Flagyl and Zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.
On postoperative day number six, the discussion between the neurosurgical team and ICU Team was that the patient for further care would need a tracheostomy tube as he was completely ventilator dependent and that he would also need a feeding tube for enteral nutrition.
At the family meeting, the family reiterated that the patient's desire was not to be held on a ventilator and that he would not want a tracheostomy, PEG, or continued life support or long-term care in a rehabilitation or a nursing home.
