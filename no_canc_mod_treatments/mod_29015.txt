The pregnancy was notable for di-di twin gestation and placement of cerclage at 14 weeks gestation.
The pregnancy was complicated by an onset of preterm contractions with cervical effacement at approximately 23 weeks gestation, prompting a maternal admission on [**2141-11-28**].
Extensive discussion was held with the family regarding extreme prematurity at 23 weeks gestation with the family expressing desire for continuing care and full intervention for the fetuses.
Mother was treated with magnesium sulfate with some improvement in the contractions and was given betamethasone from [**2141-11-30**], to [**2141-12-1**], and ampicillin.
She then progressed to spontaneous rupture of membranes of this twin, Twin A, on [**11-29**] at 7 p.m., at which time magnesium was discontinued and the cerclage was removed.
Gentamicin and clindamycin were added.
The initial resuscitation was with positive-pressure ventilation, and the heart rate was initially 60-80.
The infant responded to positive-pressure ventilation with improvement in color, tone and heart rate.
Infant was intubated at approximately 5 minutes of age for poor respiratory effort and then brought to the NICU.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: The infant was admitted and placed on high-frequency ventilation.
She received 2 doses of surfactant and weaned to low- ventilation settings.
She was transferred to conventional ventilation on day of life 2 and remained on low-ventilation settings until day of life 9 when she started to have increasing ventilator settings.
Her maximum ventilator support thus far has been high frequency ventilation on day of life 16 with MAP of 10, amplitude of 20 and 70% FIO2.
Caffeine citrate was started on day of life 3, which was [**2141-12-5**].
She has received vitamin A prophylaxis for premature lungs.
At this present point in time, she is on high-frequency ventilation with a delta P of 13, mean airway pressure of 10 in approximately 50-70% FIO2 with stable blood gases, the most recent being 7.28, 53, 57, 26, -2 by ABG.
Prior to transfer to the OR, she was transitioned to the convential ventilator and is currently on 26/6 x 30, 80-100% FiO2.
She was placed on dopamine shortly after birth and required maximum dopamine support of 10 mcg/kg per day.
She weaned off the dopamine by day of life 5, and she has remained off dopamine since that time.
A 1st course of Indocin was given at that time.
She became symptomatic of PDA again with increasing ventilator setting.
She received a 2nd course of Indocin at that time.
A 3rd course of Indocin was given at that time.
Cardiology was consulted at that time, and a plan for PDA ligation was made.
Precordium is mildly active, and she is still requiring significant ventilator support at this time.
Her maximum fluids were at 180 mL/kg per day, and that is up until day of life 4 when she weaned back down.
IV PN was started on the newborn day, and PN continues at this time.
PICC line was placed on day of life #8, which was [**2141-12-10**].
The UAC was discontinued on [**2141-12-7**], day of life 5.
Enteral feedings were attempted on day of life 9, which was [**2141-12-11**], and she got to a maximum of 40 mL/kg per day of breast milk but was made NPO on [**2141-12-15**], day of life 13, for treatment of the patent ductus arteriosus.
The 2nd dose of Indocin was given at that time.
She is NPO.We are basing her TF on 550g with TF at 130cc/kg/d.
She does have some edema, so we are basing her total fluids on a weight of 555  GI: Phototherapy was started on the newborn day.
She has had a total of 5 transfusions of packed red blood cells, and her most recent hematocrit is 32.3%, drawn on [**2141-12-21**].
Infant received PRBC transfusion last night.
Ampicillin and gentamicin were initiated at that time.
She will complete the 21-day course of ampicillin and gentamicin on [**2141-12-22**], for treatment of meningitis.
She was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and the gentamicin was changed to cefotaxime on day 10 due to an inadvertent extra dose of gentamicin being administered at that time.
A random level done at that time showed gentamicin to be 8.3.
So, on [**2141-12-22**], she will complete a 21- day course of antibiotics for meningitis.
Neurology: She is presently on a fentanyl drip at 3 mcg/kg per hour for comfort and to receive one dose of pavulon due to high oxygen requirement.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  This infant remains unstable with patent ductus arteriosus in need of ligation at [**Hospital3 18242**] in [**Location (un) 86**].
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Infant will be discharged to [**Hospital3 1810**] for surgical procedure of a PDA ligation.
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Continue NPO for surgical procedure.
The only medications that she is on at this time is the fentanyl drip at 2 mcg/kg per hour and completed a course of antibiotics on the day of transfer.
She is no longer on caffeine citrate, which was discontinued on [**2141-12-16**].
