A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis.
The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.
She underwent the usual cardiac surgery workup including dental exam, carotid US and cardiac catheterization.
She was then brought to the operating [**2121-2-18**] for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting, please see operative report for details.
Urgent aortic valve replacement with size 21 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease tissue valve.
Coronary artery bypass graft x1 with saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal-2 artery.
She tolerated the operation well and post-procedure was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on Epinephrine and Neosynephrine infusions.
Additionally the Epinephrine and Neosynephrine infusion was weaned to off.
On POD2 she had episodes of atrial fibrillation that were treeated with BBlockers and amiodarone, following which she converted to sinus rhythm at times requiring atrial pacing to support her hemodynamically.
She remained hemodynamically stable over the next 48 hours and on POD4 was transferred to the cardiac stepdown floor for continued post-operative recovery.
All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
She was seen by physical therapy to help with coordination and strengthening.
On POD6 she developed an elevated white blood cell count, a urine culture revealed enterococcus and she was started on Augmentin.
Her urine was resistant to Vancomycin and as discussed with ID, Linezolid was started and Augmentin discontinued.
Here creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.7 with abaseline of 1.3- the lasix was discontinued.
On post-op day #15 she was transferred to rehabilitation at Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **].
