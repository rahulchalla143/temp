From [**8-13**] - [**2158-8-16**] he was hospitalized for presyncope, weakness, and hyponatremia (long standing); he was discharged to rehab and returned home on [**2158-8-30**] where on [**2158-8-31**] he again experienced presyncope, feeling lightheaded, fell (without loss of consciousness), and went to [**Hospital6 33**].
Despite reprogramming and magnet placement he still experienced shocks and was ultimately started on amiodarone with prompt suppression of the recurrent VT.
Here the [**Hospital3 9642**] device was again interrogated/reprogramed and amiodarone continued.

The patient was started on toprol 25 once a day and then advanced to toprol 75 at discharge.
A trial dose of captopril 6.25 mg was attempted because the patient described his altace allergy as consisting of a headache.
He was instructed to follow up on this dose of ACE inhibitor at his next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
He was subsequently discontinued from his amiodarone before the procedure and demonstrated several more episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On [**9-4**], the patient successfully underwent ablation therapy without complication.
His outpatient dose of toprol was increased to 50 mg, and has continued on lovastatin 20 mg and aspirin 325 mg.   2) HTN: The patient's hypertension improved with addition of an ACE inhibitor, especially as it was titrated upward near discharge.
It was not felt necessary to increase his beta-blocker, but it insofar as his heart rate allows, perhaps this should be considered in the future.
Piperacillin was temporarily started per ID, but due to lack of white cells on the urinalysis, it was subsequently felt this was a long term colonization issue rather than an acute infection with the risk of bacteremia.
4) FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac healthy, low sodium diet.
Potassium was kept greater than 4 and Magnesium was kept greater than 2.
6) PHYSICAL THERAPY: Due to the patient's multiple recent hospitalizations, physical therapy was consulted.
Their evaluation was that the patient required short term rehabilitation due to hospital aquired deconditioning.
