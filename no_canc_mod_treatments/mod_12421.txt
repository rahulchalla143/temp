As compared with prior tracing of [**2180-10-19**] right bundle-branch block is now evident.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
A surgical staple line is seen in the region of the sigmoid colon, suggesting prior surgery in this region, although a radiopaque anastomotic suture line is not identified.
