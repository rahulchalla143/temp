Demyelinating process such as ADEM is felt less likely given the lack of improvement despite reported treatment with steroids.
Neoplastic and vasculitic etiologies are unlikely given appearance and distribution.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 31 year old male with no significant PMHx who presented to OSH with complaints of weakness developing acute respiratory failure found to have a saddle PE started on heparin gtt trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with MRI findings suggestive of ADEM treated with IV steroids/IVIG, whose mental status and neurological function improved.
Patient underwent trach and PEG placement in light of prolonged intubation.
Improving currently, he is tolerating trach collar at times up to 30 minutes.
He was treated with 5 days of IV steroids and five more days of IVIG.
The patient's exam improved along with repeat MRI imaging showed progression of the lesions, but this was in the context of improved exam clinically, and no further interventions were done.
Patient was evaluated for thrombectomy at OSH and it was felt that pulmonary embolectomy would be counter productive.
Patient was initially continued on heparin gtt, at one point being transitioned Lovenox /coumadin which he currently is on with INR of 1.8 on [**2110-9-4**], 1.8 [**9-3**], [**9-2**] 1.7.
Coumadin was uptitrated to 12.5 mg from 10 mg daily on [**9-2**].
If INR < 2.0 on [**2110-9-5**], please consider increasing coumadin to 15 mg daily.
