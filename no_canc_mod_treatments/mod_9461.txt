Unfortunately due to a very fragile and heavily calcified aorta along with adherent scar tissue, aortic valve replacement could not be performed.
Mitral valve replacement was performed along with an unplanned replacement of her ascending aorta and total arch with reimplantation of the head vessels which required circulatory arrest for 24 minutes.
For additional surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
After declaration of brain death, a family meeting was held, and the patient was withdrawn from ventilatory support.
The medical examiner was notified, and post mortem was refused.
