----- MRI head with and without contrast/MRA [**2191-4-19**]: There is a large amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, as described on previous imaging.
Given the hemorrhage, she initially maintained on a Labetalol drip to keep systolic blood pressure <160.
The need for Labetalol was transient and she has since been normotensive on her outpatient regimen of Lisinopril.
Therefore, she was started on anticoagulation with heparin with a goal PTT of 40-60 to prevent clot proliferation.
Several days later, coumadin was started with goal INR [**3-10**].
This was switched to Keppra given the interactions between Dilantin and Coumadin.
She should continue on Keppra until her follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Neurology.
Prior to starting anticoagulation, hypercoagulability labs were sent.
Lipitor was continued for cholesterol control.
Blood pressure was well controlled on her home regimen of Lisinopril.
Pulmonary: Patient was intubated prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
Hematology: Hypercoagulability labs demonstrated a low level of antithrombin III.
Given nature of venous clot and infarction, anticoagulation was initiated with heparin goal of PTT 40-60 and coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**].
Heparin should be continued until INR is therapeutic on coumadin.
