After her tracheal stents were put in by interventional pulmonology, patient continued to have greatly increased secretions which she was unable to clear.
She needed consistent, intensive pulmonary toilet and respiratory therapy with suctioning and nebulizers.
Stent removal was postponed due to GI problems as summarized below.
An NG tube was placed as well as a rectal tube and she was followed by surgery and GI and treated conservatively.
Serial KUBs demonstrated no significant change in colonic distension over the forthcoming days and colonoscopy/colonic decompression was performed.
After colonic decompression, a decompression tube was placed and patient was started on clear liquids.
The NG tube was removed and the rectal tube was removed.
It is unclear how much of what is seen currently on the KUB is acute and how much is chronic, but as long as patient is asymptomatic, passing gas and having bowel movements and has no nausea, vomiting, we will treat this as chronic and no further GI intervention will be done.
She required approximately three units of blood over the past two weeks.
Other than that she has also had bleeding sources from hemoptysis and a vaginal bleed.
It is felt that patient had anemia of chronic disease with depressed marrow due to her comorbidities and that her blood loss is due to phlebotomy and small volume blood loss from hemoptysis, lower GI bleeding and past vaginal bleeding.
The patient will have stents removed today.
Dictation will be appended with discharge medications when patient is planned to be discharged.
