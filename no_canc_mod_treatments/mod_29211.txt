He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**2138-5-18**] for COPD exacerbation and treated with azithro, steroids, nebs and discharged to [**Hospital1 **] pulmonary rehab.
He was placed on BiPAP [**1-14**] for 4h and given solumedrol 125mg x2, lasix 20 x1,levaquin 500 IV.
He was given additional Levofloxacin 250mg.
He was placed on CPAP without improvement.
Pt was also noted to be hypotensive to the 70s and started on a neo gtt peripherally.
Pt was persistently hypotensive on double pressors and given Tn [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was concerned about PE.
CXR2: distal tip of the catheter in the mid superior vena cava, nearly 9 cm proximal to the cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 64 yo male with PMH severe COPD (FEV1 0.68, 20% predicted) on chronic steroids, HTN, recent vertebral fractures presents with respiratory failure and shock.
[**Name (NI) **] was placed on IV solumedrol, standing nebulizers, as well as antibiotics (vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl).
He was llater transitioned to vancomycin/aztreonam to cover any resistant gram negative organisms and also had a 5 day course of azithromycin for atypical pathogens during his stay.
He had a significant degree of "auto-PEEP" devoloping while on the ventilator, and failed attempts to transition from assist control to pressure support settings due to PEEP buildup leading to hypotension.
He underwent reintubation and subsequent attempts were made to adjust ventilator settings to increase his pCO2 so that he might be able to maintain adequate ventilation after extubation.
He was maintained on steroids and antibiotics during this time.
He initially required two pressors but through gradual adjustments of ventilator settings to reduce PEEP, antibiotic treatment, fluids as tolerated, and adjustments in his sedation regimen from fentanyl/versed to propofol, his hypotension resolved and he was weaned off pressors.
Nutrition:: The patient's nutrition was maintained with tube feeding .
