In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to be in pulm edema and rapid afib.
Given her rapid afib, the patient was started on sotalol on [**8-4**], where she converted to sinus rythm on [**8-5**].
Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest at about 2:30PM on [**8-10**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4, atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1, Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm.
She was intubated during this event and started on dopamine/neo for sbps in the 80s.
In the ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and PCWP 40 with CO 1.4.
A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp pacing wire for bradycardia.
The patient was then switched to nitro/levophed and given lasix 100mg IV x1.
ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02 and PEEP 5.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated with possible responsiveness.
The patient also underwent R heart cath confirming pulm hypertension(RVEDP = 20 mm Hg, mean PCWP 11 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg).
She was also maintained on cytoxan for her renal transplant.
Past Medical History: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF: Echo [**2149-6-13**]: EF >55%, 1+ MR, severe pulm HTN, RV dilation c/w overload - Pulmonary HTN: R heart cath on [**6-19**] with pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg.
- IPF/UIP--likely from aspiration pneumonitis-Patient has documented room air saturation of 85%.
On coumadin, recently started on sotalol - ESRD secondary to chronic pyelonephritis, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant on [**2143-11-12**] - Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Anemia-multifactorial, ACD, ESRD on EPO, Baseline hct 28-35 h/o rhabdomyolysis - Gout - Hypothyroidism  Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension   Cardiac History: CABG: N/A  Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2140-10-21**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrate mildly elevated right heart filling pressures.
Position of the PICC line and Swan-Ganz catheter have been communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20858**] by telephone on [**2149-8-10**]  [**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter projects distal to the right hilar contour, likely within a proximal segmental vessel of the right middle or lower lobe.
Endotracheal tube tip is not well demonstrated, but has been better visualized on the subsequent radiograph performed 2215 (dictated under clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 21971**]).
Temporary pacing lead terminates in right ventricle and nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm to terminate in the distal stomach near the junction with the duodenum.
Position of lines and tubes was discussed by telephone on the morning of [**2149-8-11**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21972**].
Brief Hospital Course: 54 F with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, PAF, severe pulm HTN and R heart failure, DM2, HTN, s/p renal xplant in [**2143**] presents from OSH after episode of CP/SOB and cardiac arrest on day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
She was coded with CPR, multiple doses of epinephrine, atropine, CaCl, vasporession, bicarb, and dopamine at the outside hopsital.
Pressor support with levophed and nitro on transfer.
Neosynephrine and levophed were continued for pressor support.
Patient had episodes of maintaining blood pressure after epinephrine but then would become hypotensive and return to PEA when placed on ventilator.
IV lasix 300mg and bumex x2 failed to create urine output.
