Hypotension: The patient was found to be hypotensive on presentation and required aggressive fluid infusion and pressors while monitored in the ICU.
On initial presentation the patient was noted to have a warm, tender erythematous area of skin just below his right antecubital fossa.
He was discharged on a 4 week course of nafcillin to be followed by a home-infusion team.
The patient was started on vitamin D 800 u per day and calcium 500 mg TID on discharge.
He was discharged on percocet and a limited amount of oral dilaudid for control of the back pain, with instructions to call his physician if his pain was escalating.
Hypertension: The patient's outpatient hypertensive medications were held on admission due to hypotension.
He was discharged on atenolol 50 mg once a day (equal to his previous dose) and lisinopril 40 mg (up from previous dose of 20 mg).
He was continued on a 4 week course after discharge of oral vancomycin with input from infectious disease service.
The decision to continue oral vancomycin was made in part because he is scheduled for long course of nafcillin, potentially reexposing him to c.diff infection.
Prior to his platelets dropping below 100, his subcutaneous heparin and his central line heparin flushes were discontinued.
Heparin antibodies were negative.
The patient did NOT meet diagnostic criteria for HIT on this admission.
He was discharged with a glucometer and instructions on use and this will hopefully facilitate further management with his primary care physician.
Prophylaxis: Given his chronic steroid use, the patient was dosed with protonix.
