Cerebral aneurysm coiling  History of Present Illness: 76yo RHF fell/found down in her kitchen, no apparent traumatic injuries, taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED where NCHCT revealed Grade V SAH.
Pt  reportedly developed pupillary assymetry with dimished reactivity and decerebrate posturing thus was intubated, administered 25g IV mannitol and PHT load, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On arrival to ED, patient still with intermittent decerebrate posturing and pupillary assymetry.

The left external carotid artery and its branches fill well.
The left internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring approximately 7 x 5 mm with what appears to be a daughter sac which seems to be at the fundus of the aneurysm.
The right internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
Angio([**2124-3-3**]): IMPRESSION: Successful cerebral angiogram performed on Ms. [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 77254**].
Chest XR([**2124-3-14**]) Compared with [**2124-3-14**], the ET tube, NG tube, and right subclavian line have been removed.
A tracheostomy tube is now present.
Given extent of SAH and declining neurological status, EVD placed in ED without complication.
Post procedure pt admitted to Neuro ICU with Nimodipine, daily ASA, Dilantin 100mg IV q8h, let BP autoregulate for now with SBP goal <160, EVD@10cm, open.
On POD#2 pt developed hyponatremia to Na=129, this was likely from cerebral salt wasting and pt was treated with normal saline IVF.
[**3-1**] the angiogram was repeated and demonstrated less vasospasm, she also received papaverine, and the nimodipine was decreased.
[**3-3**], angiogram was again repeated showing no new spasm.
[**3-14**] she underwent trach and peg.
[**3-16**] she was able to be taken off the ventilator to breath on her own.
[**3-17**], her central line was removed and transferred to stepdown.
Nimodipine was discontinued on day 21.
She was then started on cipro for treatment of this.
She completed a course of Diflucan for vaginal candidiasis.
