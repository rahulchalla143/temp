He was started on a propofol drip on [**12-27**], which was continued until [**12-29**], and was then weaned down so that we could obtain a better neurological evaluation.
Post-tracheostomy placement on [**1-3**], the sedation was gradually weaned, and the patient was changed over to a fentanyl drip, and this was gradually weaned as well.
Cardiovascular:  From a coronary standpoint, the patient continued to require pressors, with Levophed being used from [**12-27**] until cardiac catheterization on [**2151-12-29**], at which point the patient underwent cardiac catheterization with intervention of the left anterior descending, D1 lesion as well as stenting of the left anterior descending.
He was then continued on aspirin and Plavix, Integrilin post-procedure, and changed over to a dopamine drip for pressor support.
From a pump standpoint, the patient was initially significantly volume overloaded as well as having elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and we were able to diurese only on significant amount of pressor support with dopamine and low cardiac output and index.
Over the next week, he was diuresed nearly 5 liters, with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures being brought below 20.
The PA catheter was then removed, with monitoring only of the CVP.
After this point, the CVPs continued to range below 10, and diuresis was slowed, with a goal of net fluid balance, with stable CVPs.
Amiodarone was used for possible pharmacological cardioversion,  however, this was not successful.
An attempt was made at electrical cardioversion on [**1-9**], however, this was also unsuccessful, with return to atrial fibrillation within several seconds.
The decision was made to rate control with metoprolol and Digoxin, and discontinue the amiodarone, as the patient seemed to be tolerating atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response.
Anticoagulation was started with heparin, which is being changed over to Coumadin.
Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to be difficult to wean from the ventilator on pressor support, as a decreased in sedation made it difficult for him to breathe on the ventilator.
Post-tracheostomy placement, he was changed over to pressor support with minimal sedation being given.
This was well tolerated, and the pressor support was gradually weaned down until, on [**1-10**], a trial of tracheal mask was well tolerated and, throughout the day on [**1-12**], was placed on tracheal mask with adequate oxygenation as well as ventilation.
Overnight, he was put back on pressor support due to hypoxia.
The tracheostomy course was complicated by bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
Heparin was discontinued briefly, and lidocaine and epinephrine were injected into the tracheal site, and the bleeding stopped.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2152-1-10**], by Interventional Pulmonology, which showed no evidence of active bleeding around the tracheostomy site, however, there was some mucosal irritation that was likely unmasked with heparin, and after the heparin was held for one day, it was restarted and there was no further evidence of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, and no bleeding from endotracheal suctioning.
Infectious Disease:  Initially it was unclear if the patient had septic physiology that was contributing to the low arterial pressures, and was empirically treated with levofloxacin, Flagyl, and vancomycin.
The concern was for ventilator-associated pneumonia with empiric coverage for pseudomonas with Zosyn, which was started on [**12-29**] and was treated with a two week course of Zosyn.
White blood count was stable, and antibiotics were discontinued on [**2152-1-12**].
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially started on tube feeds, which were continued throughout his hospital stay, and were continued through an orogastric tube.
On [**2152-1-14**], the Gastroenterology service was able to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube without complications, and tube feeds were then switched over to being given through the gastrostomy tube.
Potassium was repleted as needed for hypokalemia, likely due to lasix dosing.
Prophylaxis:  The patient has been on intravenous heparin, which will be changed over to Coumadin, and is on a proton pump inhibitor as well as tube feed diet.
Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending, D1 left circumflex and obtuse marginal lesions 4.
Status post tracheostomy 6.
Ventilator-associated pneumonia, treated with intravenous antibiotics 7.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement 8.
The patient is now tolerating tube feeds through the gastrostomy tube.
He is now on tracheostomy mask for several days, not requiring return to the ventilator.
Due to significant deconditioning from the cardiogenic shock as well as hypoxic respiratory failure and possible anoxic brain injury, will require a stay in rehabilitation for improvement of deconditioning.
