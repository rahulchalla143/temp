Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on Propofol and Neo Synephrine drips in stable condition for recovery.
On POD 1 the patient was extubated and weaned from vasopressor support.

A tunnelled dialysis catheter was eventually placed in the left internal jugular vein after a new right subclavian line was placed.
He developed herpetic stomatitis and was treated with IV Acyclovir.
He did not tolerated tube feeds as he had melena whenever tube feeds were increased.
