Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo woman w/ h/o HCV cirrhosis, right sided HF, recently d/c after treatment of orthostatic hypotension, now a/w  worsening LE edema and cough.
This has been difficult to control given her concurrent cirrhosis w/ low albumin.
We transitioned her to PO lasix with success.
There are few remaining options for treatment in this pt.
She will continue the lactulose TID for [**2-14**] BM q day.
DM: Her DM was controlled with NPH and regular insulin SS.
This was very difficult to assess because even when she was felt to be cleared, she would continually incoorperative with interviews and exams.
Though it is very difficult for the patient to have multiple BM/day, she will need to continue lactulose daily.
She was asked about sexual contacts but would not coorperate with interviews.
She was treated with Flagyl 500 PO BID fo 2 days and will continue this fo 5 days as an outpatient.
