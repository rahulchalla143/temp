This regimen was [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] (net output 200-300cc/day) given the patient's history of renal failure and hypotension with aggressive diuresis.
Upon obtaining a cardiac intensive care unit bed on [**2190-12-12**], a swan was placed and the pt was started on milrinone with a goal CI of 2.5 and SVR < 1000.
The natrecor was stopped due to decreased UOP and BP.
Bumex was continued and zaroxylin was added causing the patient diurese 2L.
Zaroxyln and hydralazine were stopped on [**12-18**] and milrinone was restarted with the patient remaining euvolemic.
He began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of volume overload including wet crackles and increased oxygen demand.
Further diuresis was initiallyl held given his poor renal function and the renal team closely followed with the prospect of HD.
However, pt began to make urine again and his creatinine began to trend down.
He was once again started on diuresis with milrinone.
During admission, he underwent a persantine MIBI as part of the work up prior to intervention on his PVD and debridement by [**Month/Year (2) **] of his toe.
The pt was continued on low dose ASA, plavix, beta blocker, and statin.
3) Atrial fibrillation - The patient has baseline afib on procainamide and metoprolol with a BiV pacer.
His coumadin was stopped and a heparin drip was started.
His heparin drip was stopped prior to the [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery and was not immediately restarted [**2-2**] bleeding.
However, when this had stabalized, the pt was placed back on coumadin and heparin as a bridge to a therapeutic INR.
The pt was therapeutic on [**2191-1-2**] and the heparin drip was discontinued.
He was admitted with a creatinine in the mid 3's which remained stable until late in his time in the unit after aggressive diuresis with a peak of 4.2.
The pt was started on broad spectum antibiotics including levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin at that time.
The risks and benefits of this procedure was thoroughly explained to the patient given the possibel exacerbation of his renal failure.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have severe right EIA and run-off disease, stenting of the right EIA, and atherectomy of the right AT with much improved flow to the foot.
This was complicated by a small amount of bleeding from the foot on the day following surgery which then stabalized.
He will complete a four week course of vancomycin which has been renally dosed by level while in the hospital.
He was found to have an elevated CRP and ESR- although these were possibly due to his osteomyelitis.
Rheumatology was consulted and the patient received a steroid injection to his shoulder with improvement in the pain.
His pain was then controlled with vicodin and morphine.
7) Hypothyroidism - Levothyroxine was continued throughout the admission.
8) Type 2 DM - Continued home insulin ([**1-2**] when NPO) plus RISS which was increased as needed depending on blood sugar levels.
9) Psych - Pt was continued on ambien for sleep and citalopram.
