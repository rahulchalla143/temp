The patient had a PA catheter placed which was significant for an elevated cardiac output and a decreased systemic vascular resistant which was consistent with a septic picture rather than cardiogenic shock.
At that point, the patient was transferred to the MICU for treatment of a right lower lobe pneumonia and effusions.
The patient had thoracentesis to drain his pleural effusions and it was found they were consistent with a transudative pattern likely thought secondary to congestive heart failure.
The patient was initially covered with Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
Throughout his MICU course, the patient had difficulty being weaned from his ventilator.
Initially, he was maintained on pressures, but eventually was able to be weaned off.
The patient was given Dopamine to help increase cardiac output and help increase his blood pressure, however he developed a second troponin leak and lateral ischemic changes so Dopamine was discontinued.
The patient was continued for treatment of his pneumonia and was started on Lasix in hope of mobilizing his third space fluid and increasing his cardiac output.
At the time of his transfer to the Medical Floor, the patient's main issues included continued diuresis for his persistent right sided transudative pleural effusion and continued mobilization of third space fluid in general.
Right leg deep venous thrombosis now on Coumadin.
Pantoprazole 40 mg via NG q.
Nystatin 5 mg p.o.
Albuterol q. six hours p.r.n.
Ipratropium six puffs inhaled q.i.d.
Aspirin 300 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
NPH insulin 11 in the morning and 5 at night.
Chemistry showed a sodium of 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9 and glucose of 134.
There was initial resolution of his pneumonia with continued hypotension secondary to infection, hypoalbuminemia, grossly positive fluid balance with right sided transudative pleural effusion status post two thoracentesis procedures, status post extubation now transferred from the MICU on [**2146-11-27**] to the floor.
PULMONARY:  Patient was status post extubation and was intubated for respiratory failure.
Two thoracentesis revealed that this is transudative in nature and it was determined that continued thoracentesis would only result in reaccumulation of fluid.
The patient was continued on a regimen of mild diuresis with Lasix 20 mg p.o.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease, patient is status post two troponin leaks.
His second troponin leak was secondary to Dopamine to increase his cardiac output.
The patient had no symptoms of chest pain and was continued on aspirin therapy.
The patient was not placed on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor given that his blood pressure remained low in his hypoalbuminemic state.
There was no indication to monitor for a arrhythmia.
While in the hospital, he was not placed on Coumadin given his multiple procedures and was placed on a heparin drip.
His Coumadin dose might need to be adjusted according to his response and his heparin can be stopped once he is therapeutic.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for two pneumonias while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He completed a course of Levaquin and a 14 day course of Vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his catheter tip.
He also completed an 11 day course for Meropenem for Klebsiella urine infection.
ENDOCRINE:  Patient had history of diabetes now on NPH 11 and 5 while his p.o.
FEN:  Patient had a speak and swallow evaluation and a modified barium swallow which revealed he can tolerate ground solids as well as nectar thick consistency liquids.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on a heparin drip and was given Lansoprazole.
LINES:  Patient had a left PICC placed on [**2146-11-29**] given that he has poor access.
This will be available for blood draws for his INR checks and PTT checks while he is on heparin and Coumadin.
He also has a Foley which was changed on [**2146-11-26**].
Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
Lansoprazole oral solution 30 mg p.o.
Heparin flush through his PICC.
IV heparin drip.
NPH insulin 11 in the morning and 5 at night.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Aspirin 300 mg p.r.
Nystatin oral suspension 5 ml p.o.
Bisacodyl 10 mg p.r.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Ipratropium Bromide six puffs inhaled q.i.d.
Albuterol two to four puffs inhaled q. six hours p.r.n.
The patient will also be a candidate for a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor when his pressure improves.
Note to rehab facility, the patient will need his heparin drip and Coumadin titrated to maintain INR between 2.0 and 3.0 for treatment of his right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Patient can also receive Dextrose 50% solution if his glucose becomes low.
