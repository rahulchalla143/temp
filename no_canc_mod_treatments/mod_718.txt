The patient presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital within one half hour of the onset of the pain where he was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, oxygen, morphine, and heparin.
The patient was transported to [**Hospital1 188**] on the day of admission where he underwent stenting of the saphenous vein graft to diagonal and obtuse marginal with a PercuSurge distal protection device.
The patient experienced his typical anginal symptoms during the procedure and for approximately one hour status post procedure.
The patient denied a history of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or presyncope.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction    times two.
A right groin arterial sheath in situ with positive ecchymosis.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for stenting procedure.
At this time a thrombus was discovered at the site of intervention and distal stent was occluded.
Post procedure, the patient developed recurrent angina with more prominent ST depressions in V1 through V4, ST elevations in I and aVL, with a decrease in blood pressures to systolics in the 90s when the nitroglycerin drip was increased.
The patient was taken back to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a thrombus was found at the site of intervention, and the distal stent was occluded.
The patient underwent angioplasty with two stent placements distally and administration of Integrelin, clopidogrel, and intracoronary TPA.
An intraaortic balloon pump was placed to maximize coronary blood flow.
After this procedure the patient did well and was able to be weaned off the balloon pump.
Coronary artery disease; status post non-ST-elevation    myocardial infarction with subacute stent occlusion.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Nitroglycerin 0.3-mg sublingual tablets as needed.
Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Multivitamin by mouth every day.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
