In the future, Mr. [**Known lastname **] should receive E-antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.

In the ICU Lactulose and Rifaximin were started for likely hepatic encephalopathy.
Stool output began to pick up on lactulose regimen and mental status substantially improved.
Lactulose and rifaximin were continued with improvement of mental status back to baseline.
Lactulose was then stopped because of concern regarding his colonic pseudoobstruction and his continued diarrhea.
Additionally, he had received two doses of morphine for pain and appeared oversedated.
He received narcan IV x3, and became substantially more alert.
He was restarted on lactulose, and then stopped after stabilization of his mental status.
Lactulose was not restarted, given the patient's regular bowel movements.
He was continued on rifaximin through [**11-11**], when his code status had changed to Comfort Measures Only.
The patient's mental status also waxed and waned in the setting of receiving opioid analgesia.
He was eventually started on a morphine drip, scopalomine patch, and atropine sublingual drops, when he developed large amounts of oropharyngeal and nasal secretions.
On clinical exam the patient appeared itravascullary depleted supported by a lactate of 4.3 with decreased to 3.8 after initial fluid bolus.
Creatinine continued to trend down with fluids reaching at nadir at his baseline of 0.9 on [**9-26**].
However, renal function did not improve with several days of albumin administration, and it was felt to be due to hepatorenal syndrome.
All diuretics were stopped, and the patient was initiated on treatment for HRS including octreotide, midodrine and daily albumin.
The patient was not considered a candidate for hemodialysis, given the frequent episodes of bleeding that he had demonstrated with even minor interventions.
On [**11-11**], the patient was made CMO and all lab checks, including BUN and creatinine, were discontinued.
Flexiseal was discontinued with some improvement in diarrhea.
Diarrhea was felt to be multifactorial, due to a combination of lactulose and non-obstructing ileus.
CT A/P with megacolon (9cm) with repeat KUBs stable with possible 14cm loop of bowel.
Bowel rest and rectal tube decompression was also attempted, without success.
As his condition became increasingly terminal, he occasionally seemed to indicate abdominal discomfort, and was treated with increasingly aggressive comfort measures.
A foley catheter was placed, with trauma to the urethra because of difficulty advancing the catheter past the prostate.
Urology placed a coude catheter, with a plan to leave the foley in place for at least one week to tamponade bleeding.
Post procedure, the patient continued to bleed from the urethra, and required many units of PRBCs and FFP (see coagulopathy).
He occasionally passed clots through his Foley catheter, manipulation of the Foley was kept to a minimum, given the aforementioned bleeding complications.
His Foley was kept in place until he passed away.
# Coagulopathy: Multifactorial from lupus anticoagulant and liver dysfunction.
Also developed urethra bleed from traumatic foley placement (see above), as well as abdominal wall bleeding from para site which required several brief ICU stays for hemodynamic monitoring.
During ICU stay from [**10-19**]/-[**10-21**] received FFP, DDAVP, thrombin dressing to paracentesis site with continued oozing, which resolved after stitch and pressure dressing by surgery.
He received FFP, PRBCs, Cryo and vitamin K.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended continuing his Foley and correcting his coagulopathy.
Upon returning to the medicine floor, the patient continued to require daily transfusions of PRBCs and FFP.
On [**2149-11-2**] he was also given DDAVP to treat for uremic platelets and Factor 7.
With increasing focus on the patient's comfort, it was decided to not give further transfusions.
U/A from [**10-12**] now grew enterococcus and pt completed 7 day course of ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 1195**].
Presented with hepatic encephalopathy that improved with lactulose and rifaximin, and then declined again for unclear reasons; progression of liver disease versus infection versus stopping lactulose.
# Guaiac Positive Stools: Patient with history of Guaiac positive stools during prior hospitalization which was atributed to hemorrhoids.
Initial HCT of 26.5 in ED which appears to be at baseline with prior levels.
Pt placed on 5 day course of ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis in setting of GIB.
Serial hematocrits were followed with a tendency to drift down and require periodic transfusions.
