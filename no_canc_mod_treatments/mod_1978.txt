HD line was removed.
Plan not to discharge on ACE inhibitor given acute renal failure and readdress on follow up.
Patient as above appeared volume overloaded on exam to thought to be secondary to hypervolemic hyponatremia and improved with HD and improved cardiac function.
# Hypertension - patient maintained as outpatient on hydral, norvasc, imdur, as well as beta blocker.
Patient should be maintained on outpatient ACE inhibitor however did not start in house given renal failure.
Continued hydral and amlodipine for afterload reduction, however would consider discontinue of hydral when able to start ACEi.
Have not given additional blood since patient has completed dialysis.
