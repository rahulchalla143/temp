Brief Hospital Course: 55yo female w HCV cirrhosis, previously compensated with recent decompensation after [**12/2171**] cholecystectomy, being worked up for transplant, admitted with presumed SBP for antibiotic therapy.
Given the patient's clinical picture, she was started on empiric CTX for presumed SBP.
Given concern for possible GI source of infection, the patient was started on broad-spectrum coverage with Vancomycin/CTX/flagyl.
Given her improved clinical status, and negative ascites cultures, her vancomycin and cipro were discontinued on [**6-8**] and [**6-9**].
She remained on Zosyn to cover possible SBP as well as HCAP (see below).
On Day 3 of admission, the patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened to Vancomycin/zosyn/ciprofloxacin to provide better HCAP.
Her vancomycin and cipro were stopped as discussed above, and the patient was continued on pip-tazo to cover possible SBP as well as HCAP.
The patient completed an 8d course of antibiotics and was weaned off supplemental O2.
#HCV Cirrhosis: The patient was being worked up for a transplant prior to her admission.
The patient will follow up as an outpatient for mammogram, pap smear, and PFTs.
Dobhoff was pulled and NGtube was placed for gastric lavage, which did not demonstrate further signs of active bleeding.
A dobhoff tube was placed post-pylorically to reinitiate tube feeding.
As per nutrition consult, a Dobhoff tube was placed and tube feeds were initiated.
On discharge the patient was educated on usage and maintenance of the feeding pump and tube.

You received antibiotics for your infections, and your vital signs stabilized.
You were seen by our liver transplant surgeons and your transplant evaluation was started.
You had feeding tubes placed in your nose to help increase your nutrition, so that you will remain strong.
You will continue taking the tube feeds at home.
Please keep your appointments and take your medications as directed.
The following changes were made to your medications: -Increased furosmide to 60 mg daily -Increased spironolactone to 150 mg daily -Started omeprazole 20 mg daily.
You should continue taking this because there was chronic inflammation seen in your stomach, when you underwent upper endoscopy.
You were recorded as taking potassium supplements prior to coming to the hospital.
You have not been receiving daily potassium supplementation while in the hospital, and your levels have been generally normal.
You therefore do not need to take daily potassium tablets at this time but you should have your level checked by your physician at your next visit--furosemide and spironolactone can affect your potassium levels.
