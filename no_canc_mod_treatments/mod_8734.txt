The patient was admitted to an outside hospital for slurred speech and right sided weakness noted by a health aide following the patient's hemodialysis.
The patient was thus dosed with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and vancomycin in addition to receiving a one liter normal saline bolus.
The patient was thus started on Dopamine and given a 750 cc normal saline bolus.
He further required the addition of Neo-Synephrine to support his blood pressure.
His heart rate subsequently increased and his ST-T wave changes worsened, so his Dopamine was stopped and these changes resolved.

Hypotension:  The patient had an acute blood pressure drop following hemodialysis in the Emergency Room, requiring pressor support.
He was initially started on Neo-Synephrine and Dopamine.
The Dopamine was stopped for demand ischemia.
The patient was subsequently changed from Neo-Synephrine to Levophed and Vasopressin for suspected sepsis as the cause of his low blood pressure.
He was maintained on these medications until successfully weaned off on [**2107-7-4**].
The patient was maintained on aspirin and a statin, all chronotropic pressors were avoided following his diagnosis.
