# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema, possible PNA, restriction from abdominal distention.
Was intubated while receiving diuresis initially with lasix gtt and received 8 day course of vancomycin/zosyn for potential VAP.
Found to have one day of hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis of 3L in 24 hours; pressures stabilized with small fluid boluses and administration of albumin.
Respiratory status continued to improve with diuresis on floor, oxygen weaned, and repeat CXR showed improvement in pleural effusions and no new consolidation.
#  UGI BLEED:  Likely due to duodenal ulcer (injected with epi on [**12-7**]) and esophageal varicies (5 bands placed on [**12-10**]).
He was continued on pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **], sucralafate, and nadolol upon discharge.
His heart rate remained in the 70s, but nadolol could not be further uptitrated because of SBP 90-100.
# Alcoholic cirrhosis:  His hepatic vasculature was patent, he was started on lactulose, rifaximin, furosemide.
AFP 4.4, making hepatoma less likely, however MRI of liver should be completed as an outpatient.
Intermittently required haldol and seroquel for agitation.
