Expected post-surgical changes from left craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma.
Subfalcine and uncal herniation has resolved.
He was originally admitted to the neurosurgery service and had an evacuation of Subdural hemorrhage with a left sided craniotomy for bleed with hernation.
Respiratory Failure: intially intunated for neurosurgery evacuation [**9-19**], extubated [**9-20**].
ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
He was treated with ceftriaxone for the strep pneumonia and despite better volume status and treatment of PNA, he remained unresponsive on no sedation.
He failed several pressure support trials secondary to hyperventilation and low tidal volumes, he likely had neurogenic respiratory failure.
Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done emergently.
He was started and continued on dilantin prophylaxis.
Warfarin has been held since admission and Pt recieved 3 units FFP on admission.
When it fell below 2, coumadin 1mg was started.
Cardiology had been consulted by neurosurgery service, and the decision was made to start coumadin without bolus when IRN <2 given the SDH on admisision.
When phenytoin values normalized, INR also normalized.
Patient was on lasix drip for a day, on intermittent lasix until euvolemic.
Transaminitis: unlikely from propofol as trigylcerides are normal.
- Hydralazine titrated up to 37.5mg TID, Isosorbide mononitrate increased from 10 to 20 PO BID, metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
Atrial fibrillation: continue Amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 **]  Hypothyroidism: home dose of 75mcg PO levothyroxine  HYperlipidemia: continue statin  Hypernatremia: has been trending up, likely contributing to mental status - free water boluses from 200q6 to 300q4.
BPH: held tamsulosin and finastride, not crushable via PEG  ** Numerous family meeting were held, and given the lack of improvement in his mental status in the setting of the large subdural hematomas, the decision was made to transition the patients care to comform measures.
