History of Present Illness: Patient is a 57 year old female with past medical history of aortic valve replacement, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with dizziness and fall after taking all of her daily medications at one time on the evening of [**2203-8-7**].
Patient relates that she usually takes her medications for the day all at once (except a few evening medications) in the morning, including plavix, levoxyl, klonipin, lisinopril, triampterene/HCTZ, diovan, lopressor, imdur, lamictal, and possibly others.
She was given 2L IVF without improvement in her BPs, so dopamine was started.
She also received narcan w/out effect, glucagon, and charcoal, with emesis.
She was intubated for airway protection and a tiple lumen was placed.
She was transferred to the MICU where she ws kept on dopamine and propofol while intubated, for a day, and successfully extubated on [**8-8**] without difficulty.
Her BP meds were held, as were a number of her psychiatric medications, some of which were restarted prior to transfer to the floors.
She denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, or dizziness.
Past Medical History: -CAD with LVEF > 50%, s/p CABG in [**2195**] (LIMA>>LAD, SVG>>PDA and OMI), stent placement in [**2199**], cath demonstrated 2 VD -NonQ wave MI -Aortic Valve Replacement [**2195**], Mitral Valve ring-annuloplasty -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Hypothyroidism secondary to RAI for [**Doctor Last Name 933**] Disease -Depression with psychosis -Discoid Lupus -PTSD -Carcinoid s/p resection in [**2173**] -COPD -s/p TAH and b/l BOS -Hemolytic Anemia -Migraine -T9/T10 Disc Herniation  Social History: Lives at home with her son, daughter, granddaughters, nephew, [**Name2 (NI) 802**], and granddaughter's close friend.
There has een interval repositioning of the ET tube, with tip now approximately 3.8 cm proximal to the carina.
An NG tube extends below the diaphragm and beyond the film, with its side-hole in the region of the gastric body and the gaseous distention of the stomach has resolved.
The patient is status post median sternotomy with CABG and probable AVR, as before.
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
A well-seated annuloplasty ring is present.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 57 year old female with HTN, AVR, depression, and hypothyroidism presents with hypotension after taking all medications at one time, presents to floors after stay in MICU with intubation and pressors, now hemodynamically stable.
# Hypotension/Medication Ingestion: Given the acute onset of symptoms shortly after the patient reports she took "all of her pills," it is highly likely, as thought by the MICU and ED teams, that the patient suffered adverse consequences of taking too many blood pressure and sedating medications at once.
- Her blood cultures were all negative, with the [**2203-8-9**] culture still pending at time of discharge--it was felt that sepsis was very unlikely.
- BP has slowly rose while off BP medications, and a few of her medications were re-introduced.
Given her cardiac history, it was desirable to get her beta-[**Month/Day/Year 7005**] and [**Last Name (un) **] restarted, so she was titrated back up to 100mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], and 40 of valsartan, with blood pressures remaining in the 100-120 systolic range--she was switched to Toprol XL for easier dosing at discharge.
- A VNA was arranaged to assist with medication management and administration at home.
- Food preparation alternatives and low-salt diet was discussed at length with patient, as it was recognized that she ate a lot of salty food and her pressures would likely rise upon return to her home.
# Depression- There was concern over whether medication overdose was intended, however, as noted above psych evaluated patient and felts it was a mistake.
- Klonopin 1mg TID and Seroquel 150mg QHS were re-introduced and well tolerated.
- In coordination with her outpatient psychiatrist, Celexa 10mg was started in place of prozac, and her lamictal was held.
- A psychiatric VNA was arranged to assist with transition back home.
# Hypothyroidism- Per OMR notes, her dose was recently increased in [**Month (only) 205**], although patient states she never changed her dose and has continued to take 112mcg, and now her TSH is low at 0.041.
Patient did not appear hyperthyroid on exam and it was felt that an overdose of levothyroxine was unlikely to account for the low TSH.
# AVR: On coumadin for aortic valve replacement, INR Goal 2.5-3.5.
Coumadin restarted at home dosing.
# CAD: Restarted [**Month (only) **], plavix, as well as beta [**Month (only) 7005**] and [**Last Name (un) **].
# Safety/Discharge planning: - Physical therapy evaluated patient and felt she was safe to return home.

You spent time in the intensive care unit where a ventilator helped your breathing and medications helped support your blood pressure.
It was thought that the very low blood pressure was a result of taking too many medications at one time.
A few of your blood pressure medications were re-started, at lower doses.
You should take your medications exactly as prescribed, and follow up closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] to monitor your blood pressure and medications.
A visiting nurse will also assist with your medications and ensure you are doing well once you are discharged.
You will need to have your thyroid function studies repeated in a few weeks, and your coumadin level checked, in addition to your blood pressure.
