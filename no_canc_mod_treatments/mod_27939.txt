Heart failure service consulted, recommended diuresis pre-operatively.
He was subsequently started on a Lasix drip.
He otherwise remained stable on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
On [**7-17**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing the left internal mammary artery to the diagonal branch of left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the distal left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
Within 24 hours, chest tubes were removed and he was extubated.
He was slow to wean from inotropic support and initially required AV pacing for junctional rhythm.
The EP service was consulted to evaluate for permanent pacemaker plus/minus AICD(given his severely depressed LV function).
He was subsequently made NPO and started on tube feedings.
Epicardial wires were eventually removed without complication.
It was decided that a pacemaker was not indicated at this time but the need for an AICD will need to be assessed three months postoperatively.
He continued to require diuresis and remained stable from a cardiac and liver standpoint.
Beta blockade was not resumed.
Aspiration was however noted with thin liquids.
Videofluroscopic evaluation on [**7-24**] confirmed aspiration but functional swallow was achieved with pureed/ground solids and honey thick liquids.
Medications were subsequently crushed in puree and repeat videoswallow was recommended in one week to evaluate for diet advancement.
