The patient was given aspirin and nitroglycerin.
He was given IV fluids with his blood pressure recovering.
At one point, the patient's heart rate was noted to go from 20 down into the 20s and 30s; although, this was not recorded, and there was no evidence of pacer activations, so there was a suspicion of pacer failure/pacer capture.
Again, the patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip, but his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s, and nitroglycerin was discontinued.
The patient was started on heparin and Integrilin with an initial creatine kinase of 247, and a MB fraction of 30, and a MB index of 12%.
