HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old white male with a past medical history significant for previous myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2182**], who awoke on the day of admission with chest pressure and shortness of breath at 4:30 a.m., which was better with sitting up.
He was acutely dyspneic and thus intubated, given nitroglycerin paste, intravenous Lasix 200 mg, intravenous morphine 2 mg and Versed.
He was started on a Dopamine for maintenance of his blood pressure.
The maximum Dopamine dose was 4 mcg/kg/minute and he was weaned off gradually.
The patient was started on intravenous nitroglycerin and transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further evaluation.
Ventilator settings on transfer were an assist control of 700 by 14 with a PEEP of 5.
In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room, nitroglycerin was continued.
History of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction at age 50, again in [**2195-5-22**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2182**] with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery; most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2195-5-22**] showed 100% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, 50% mid- left anterior descending artery lesion, 70% first marginal lesion, 100% proximal right coronary artery lesion with collaterals coming from the circumflex to the right coronary artery, left ventricular ejection fraction 25% with mild mitral regurgitation; right heart catheterization showed elevated right sided pressures including a right atrial pressure of 24, right ventricular pressure 50, pulmonary artery pressure 52/20 and wedge of 33, cardiac output 6.05 and cardiac index 2.79.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral to anterior tibial bypass in [**2194-2-19**] with jump graft in [**2195-5-22**] and status post TPA several months later.
Status post AICD placement on [**2195-5-27**]; patient had been transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] to [**Hospital6 8866**] after developing chest pain and shortness of breath; he was found hypotensive and in respiratory failure, requiring intubation; he became tachycardiac and went into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and required shock; he ruled in at [**Hospital3 1280**] with a high CK and, at [**Hospital6 8866**] workup included cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram and exercise tolerance test; ICD placement was also at that time; the device is known to be a Guident device, the details of which will be included in a discharge addendum.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Zestril 20 mg p.o.q.d., Norvasc 5 mg p.o.q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o.q.d.
Cardiovascular/coronary artery disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was continued on aspirin, nitroglycerin drip and heparin as per myocardial infarction protocol.
Thus, it was considered that the patient had ruled out for a myocardial infarction and heparin was discontinued.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was restarted on beta blockage, in particular, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day which was gradually increased to 100 mg twice a day.
He was also started on Imdur for anti-anginal effects.
He was continued on Zestril after the day of admission, with good blood pressure effects.
He was continued on telemetry.
His symptoms will be continued on high dose Lopressor and amiodarone.
Vascular/hypertension:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was restarted on Norvasc 5 mg per day without event.
Coumadin was held secondary to possible invasive intervention such as cardiac catheterization, which would require an INR of less than 1.5.
On [**2195-11-3**], his INR was noted to be below 2 and a heparin drip was restarted.
Coumadin will be restarted on [**2195-11-4**].
A central line was deemed not to be necessary at the time of admission.
Prophylaxis:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on gastrointestinal prophylaxis with Protonix and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Zestril 20 mg p.o.q.d.
Norvasc 5 mg p.o.q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.d.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Imdur 30 mg p.o.q.d.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
