The infants were born by elective cesarean section due to increasing concerns for discordant growth.
After delivery and stabilization, she was transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] due to census issues at the [**Hospital1 69**] neonatal intensive care unit.
Her medical course at [**Hospital3 1810**] was significant for no cardiovascular or respiratory issues, initial maintenance on IVF with the gradual introduction of enteral feeds, which were well tolerated and reached full volume by DOL #7, and treatment with phototherapy from DOL #2 to DOL #4 for hyperbilirubinemia.
She received a 48 hour course of antibiotics over first two days of life as part of a sepsis evaluation; blood cultures were negative.
Mild hypercalcemia was also noted, with calcium rising to 11.3.
The hyperphosphatemia and mild hypercalcemia required alterations of her enteral feeds from breast milk with HMF to breast milk with similac powder.
She was started on amoxicillin urinary tract infection prophylaxis.
Several brief    bradycardic episodes associated with discoordinated feedings    were also noted, but none required stimulation and none were    noted for over 24 hours at the time of discharge.
She was noted to have an    elevated alkaline phosphatase, with a level of 752 on DOL #15    and 851 on DOL #25.
The elevated alk phos was thought to be    consistent with mild metabolic bone disease of prematurity,    complicated by renal insufficiency and lack of sufficient    supplemental calcium and phosphorous.
Feedings were changed on DOL #31 to breast    milk with neosure powder in anticipation of discharge, and at    discharge, she is taking breast milk with neosure powder to 26    cals per ounce.
She has been maintained on supplemental Vidaylin (which    contains vitamin D) throughout.
She will require follow-up with the renal service at    [**Hospital1 **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 50498**]) 4-6 weeks after    discharge, and a VCUG has been scheduled for [**2136-4-19**] at    [**Hospital3 1810**] at 9:30 am.
As previously noted, [**Known lastname **] is being    treated with amoxicillin for urinary tract infection    prophylaxis.
She should    remain on amoxicillin until results of VCUG are available.
Repeat ultrasounds on [**4-5**] and [**4-9**] were    basically unchanged, with the cyst measuring approximately 2.4    x 1.9 x 1.8 cm, and no change of the right subependymal    hemorrhage.
Of note, infant was noted to be mildly lethargic for 36 hours    after the MRI, but this was attributed to sedation given for    the study, and resolved without intervention.
Medications: Amoxicillin 40 mg p.o.
once daily, ferrous    sulfate 25 mg/ml 0.3 ml once daily, Vi-Daylin 1 ml p.o.
Immunizations received: Hepatitis B vaccine was given on    [**2136-3-31**].
Immunizations recommended:  Synergist RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria: 1).
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
