During cardiac catheterization, she clotted off her left circumflex artery and left anterior descending artery.
Patient required 7 defibrillations.An IABP was placed.
A temporary RV pacing wire was placed.
Cardiopulmonary support (ECMO)was initiated via CPS perfusion catheters placed in the RFA and RFV (the IABP and RV pacing wire were removed).
Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.She was successfully resuscitated using CPS with emergent deployment of drug eluting stents in LAD and LCx(Kissing stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX ).Patient had resumption of pulsatile central aortic pressure after stenting of the LAD and LCx.
An IABP was placed.PA cath c/w ischemic MR.  She has massive blood loss during the procedure and has recieved 5U PRBC and 1u platelet prior to transfer to CCU.
Given the ACT of >900, it was determined to be safer to have the ECMO catheters removed in OR.

During procedure, she clotted off her LCx and LAD.
She had 7 ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring ECMO being placed by surgery.
She had emergent placement of kissing stents to LAD and LCx.
Post procedure, she went to the OR to have ECMO catheters removed on the right groin, IABP and PA catheter placed on the left groin.
She recieved  a total of 6 units of blood during the procedure.
On arrival to the CCU, she was on pressors and intubated.
IABP and pressors were removed on [**2127-3-26**] with good hemodynamics.
However, she developed acute respiratory distress on the night of [**2127-3-26**] responsive to lasix, nitroglycerin drip and positive pressure ventilation with CPAP.
Her blood pressure dropped drastically requiring a brief period of pressure support with levophed, which was quickly weaned off.
SHe was also started on lisinopril and toprol.
SHe was started on daily lasix for heart failure.
Her blood pressure control is satisfactory with metoprolol, lisinopril and imdur.
Vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole was initially started for presumed aspiration penumonia given that she spiked temperature, had increased WBC and increasing sputum production.
She continued the course of levofloxacin and metronidazole for 7 days.
Vancomycin was discontinued since sputum culture did not grow any organism.
