Coli).
After fluid resucitation and initial antibiotic the patient's condition greatly improved as his MS returned to baseline, his HR and RR decreased to WNL, his lactate returned to [**Location 213**] levels and his temperature decreased to WNL.
He received additional hydration in the ICU, but did not require pressors.
He was stable on arrival to the floor and was maintained on IV zosyn.
A PICC line was placed on [**2181-7-24**], and he was discharged to a rehab facility where he can complete the course of IV zosyn.
We recommended he stop his prophylactic regimen of Methenamine Hippurate until completion of his zosyn course, at which point he can resume it.
PT saw him while on the floor and recommended further therapy at the rehabilitation center.
