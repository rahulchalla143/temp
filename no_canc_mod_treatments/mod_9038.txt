The patient preceeded to the local Emergency Room given the persistent and worsening pain at 10:30 a.m.  At the outside hospital Emergency Department the patient also complained of diaphoresis and now of [**9-28**] chest pain.
The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, Lopressor, aspirin and the pain decreased to [**5-29**], but never went away completely.
Catheterization revealed that right dominant system normal, normal LMCA, LCX with mild disease, right coronary artery with 40% mid and 50% posterior descending coronary artery stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery with 70% stenosis at the origin and 99% stenosis due to thrombotic occlusion distally with slow TIMI two flow.
An angiojet coronary thrombectomy was performed followed by stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin and distally.
LABORATORIES AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell 6.2, hematocrit 46.4, platelets 141, sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarb 21, BUN 16, creatinine .7, glucose 81, CK 130, and troponin less then 0.01.
After stent placement at [**Hospital1 69**] electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of78, normal intervals, normal axis, ST elevation in V2 through V4 is still present, but decreased and there is a Q wave in V3 of questionable significance and normal T waves.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 30%, apical akinesis, anteroseptal and free anterior wall hypokinesis.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Prozac, Protonix occasionally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year-old gentleman with no prior history of coronary artery disease who presented to an outside hospital with substernal chest pain and diaphoresis and anterior ST elevation on electrocardiogram consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for catheterization, which revealed left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis 70% at the origin and 99% mid distally, now status post stent of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin and distally.
Coronary artery disease, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post anterior myocardial infarction and stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery times two.
He received Integrilin for eighteen hours and then was started on aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg.  A lipid panel was drawn and LDL was found to be 142, which is significantly higher then the goal of 100 for him, therefore Atorvastatin 10 mg po q.d.
An ace inhibitor was started and titrated up.
The patient also was started on heparin for anticoagulation due to akinesis and decreased EF.
The anticoagulation was supposed to be performed with heparin for a few days until Coumadin was provided with a therapeutic INR, however, after only one hour of being on heparin the right groin hematoma enlarged and heparin was immediately discontinued and the patient was never started on Coumadin.
A beta blocker was started and titrated up as tolerated.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:  Atorvastatin 10 mg po q day, Toprol XL 50 mg po q day, Lisinopril 10 mg po q day, Plavix 75 mg po q day to continue for thirty days, aspirin 325 mg po q day.
