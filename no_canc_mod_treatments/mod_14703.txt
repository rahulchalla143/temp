HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male who developed chest pain and shortness of breath while he was shoveling snow [**2151-4-1**] for which he was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] and found to have an acute myocardial infarction status post unsuccessful thrombolytics and rescue PCI with an intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
He was in the CCU for eight days which was complicated by paracarditis, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and a right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis as well as pneumonia, status post a 10 day course of Levaquin.
He now presented for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Successful placement of a temporary pacing wire which was placed for Wenckebach and bradycardia.
Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch of the left circumflex on [**2151-5-6**] as well as paracardial patch of the inferior ventricular aneurysm.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time 89 minutes.
Patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in stable condition in normal sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute on Neo-Synephrine at 0.9, milrinone at 0.25, and propofol at 0.15.
The patient was extubated the same day of surgery around 4 o'clock in the afternoon without complication.
Postoperative day one, 24 hour events included increased chest tube output draining 1500 cc over the last 24 hours.
The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells as well as 4 units of fresh-frozen plasma and platelets.
The patient was still on a Neo-Synephrine drip of 0.75 and milrinone drip of 0.25.
Hemodynamically stable being A-paced, heart rate 90 with an index of 2.28 and a CPP of 18.
Postoperative day two, the patient's chest tube output decreasing with a 24 hour total of 1400 hematocrit stable at 33.
The patient went into atrial fibrillation overnight, and was administered Lopressor as well as an amiodarone drip, and because the patient's cardiac index continued to be on the low side at 1.96, the patient continued to receive milrinone at 0.25.
Postoperative day three, patient was administered a 150 mg IV bolus of IV milrinone for the atrial fibrillation with a rate of 90 to 100's.
Still with an index hovering around 2.0 on the milrinone drip at 0.125.
Patient continued to go in and out of atrial fibrillation for which she was administered amiodarone boluses as well as Lopressor with good effect, converted back to sinus with a good ventricular rate.
Postoperative day six, the patient with complaints of an anxiety attack, and patient was given 0.5 mg of Ativan with good affect.
Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm over the next few days still on an amiodarone drip at 400 with a good heart rate in the 60's.
Patient was administered Dulcolax suppository as well as a Fleets enema, and the patient was discharged later on that day, which was postoperative day 10 to home with visiting nurse services in good condition.
Lasix 20 mg po q day for seven days.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq po q day for seven days.
Coumadin 2.5 mg po q day.
Tylenol 3 prn pain.
Zantac [**Hospital1 **].
Colace [**Hospital1 **] prn.
Amiodarone 400 mg po q day.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3.
