She developed a multifocal PNA, fevers, and severe metabolic derangements.
Her course was complicated by ARDS and severe calcium, magnesium and phosphorous derangements requiring aggressive repletion (~20 grams of calcium gluconate in 24 hours).
She was treated initially with bowel rest and later with a nasojejunal tube for feeds and, when that clogged, two days of parenteral feeding before which she was started on a diet.
In 2 days, her ARDS improved briskly however intubation was deferred secondary to oversedation.
Her antibiosis was complicated by a maculopapular rash that later became confluent on the back and left forearm.
Bactrim was then d/c'd d/t concern of high fevers and worsened rash.
Pt was changed to levofloxacin with plans for total of 14 day course of appropriate coverage.
She will be supplemented with iron, thiamine and folate.
# Severe Malnutrition; Protein-Energy and complex mineral/vitamin deficiencies Hypocalcemia Hypophosphatemia Anemia with very wide RDW; presumed Folate and Iron Deficiency Thrombocytopoenia responsive to etoh abstinence EtOH abuse The patient had refractory hypocalcemia which was partly malnutritional and partly due to pancreatitis and severe refractory hypophosphatemia both which required aggressive repletion.
She had anemia with a normal MCV and RDW > 22 indicating two distinct populations of red cells, presumably related to etoh abuse, folate deficiency and iron deficiency.
She was given tube feeds and PPN while intubated and her diet was advanced after extubation.
Pt is at risk for other nutritional deficiencies as well, thus she was also treated with a multivitamin.
# Transaminitis with fatty infiltration on CT Likely Alcoholic Steatohepatis Transaminitis on admission: AST/ALT > 2 (50/22) with normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
This was presumed related to medications; her antibiotics were changed at that time, as she also had a rash (see below).
# Anxiety She was maintained on her home regimen of clonazepam and required large doses of versed while intubated.
Continued clonazepam and paxil.
Her Cefepime and cipro were exchanged for bactrim, however this was subsequently exchanged for levofloxacin after she developed a high fever and worsened rash after a dose of bactrim.
She tolerated the levofloxacin without difficulty, and her rash continued to improve.
