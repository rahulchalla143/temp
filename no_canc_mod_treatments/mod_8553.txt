She was taken to the operating room by Dr, [**Name (NI) **] and a right leg spahenectomy and sternotomy was performed.
The procedure was then cancelled due to findings of a severely calcified aorta extending to the arch.
She was on amiodarone, propofol and neosynephrine drips.
She was extubated on her operative day and her chest tubes were discontinued on post-operative day one.
She was seen by EP whom concluded that her pacemaker was functioning appropriately, that she was experiencing post-operative atrial fibrillation, and their recommendations included amiodarone and possible heparin with continued atrial fibrillation.
On post-operative day four she was diuresed with lasix due to fluid overload.
The diuresis left her with a relative hyponatremia corrected with fluid restriction and diuresis.
She did not continue in atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was continued but heparin was not started.
She received aggressive physical therapy throughout her hospital stay.
