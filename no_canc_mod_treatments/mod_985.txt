# Respiratory Failure: Pt with underlying end stage IPF on home oxygen admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
Pt developed worsening hypoxic resipratory distress, hemoptysis, requiring intubation on [**2137-6-21**].
She was put on broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids.
Pt gradually improved on pressure support ventilation and was extubated on [**2137-6-23**] after a successful spontaneous breathing trial on [**4-17**] and a RISP score 33.
She will need to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics with Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin (6 days post discharge).
She was continued on steroids 60 mg daily, subsequently decreased to 50 mg daily.

She was given diltiazem and digitalis and was rate controlled.
Anticoagulation was discontinued secondary to anemia and hemoptysis.
diltiazem and digitalis were discontinued and patient was then restarted on metoprolol, titrated to a heart rate <100 for rate control.
# NSTEMI Patient had ST depressions in anterior lateral leads and troponin spike to 7.56, likely NSTEMI.
Initially started on heparin and plavix but subsequently had hemoptysis.
Cardiology was consulted and did not catheterize given patient's instability and inability to go on anticoagulation due to hemoptysis and GI bleed.
Plan was to continue ASA, statins, hold anticoagulation.
Restarting plavix should be assessed as an outpatient.
Likely due to heparin anticoagultion.
