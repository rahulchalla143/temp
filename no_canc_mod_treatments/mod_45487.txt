He received two doses of surfactant for management of respiratory distress syndrome and extubated to continuous positive airway pressure on day of life two.
He remained on continuous positive airway pressure for a total of 24 hours and transitioned to room air where he stayed for a total of five days and then returned back to continuous positive airway pressure.
He continued on continuous positive airway pressure until day of life 24 and has remained on room air throughout his hospital course until [**5-15**] when he had the onset of increased oxygen requirement and occasional desaturations surrounding a difficult feeding.
[**Known lastname **] received methylxanthine therapy for management of apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.

He started on parenteral nutrition and initiated enteral feedings on day of life 11.
The infant had been attempting oral feeds until [**5-22**] when he was noted to have increased desaturations with feedings; likely aspirating during his oral enteral feedings.

GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient was treated with phototherapy for mild hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.
The patient has not received any blood transfusions during his hospital course.
Hematology has been consulted and requested to visualize the blood smear to see if there was any concerning findings, especially in light of the possibility of myelodysplasia associated with trisomy 21.

He presented on [**5-15**] with increasing desaturations in drifts, need for oxygen, and overall lethargy .
He was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.
He was restarted on ampicillin and gentamicin.
He is currently on ampicillin and gentamicin for a total of a 7-day course.
GENETIC ISSUES:  Physical examination on admission was consistent with an infant with trisomy 21.
