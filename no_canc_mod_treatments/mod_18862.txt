She was then referred for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On [**2112-1-12**], she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the ramus intermedius, and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
She also had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
The surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16398**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C as assistants.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 160 minutes, and a crossclamp time of 111 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm, and on Levophed and propofol drips, with two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires, and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
Also, in the overnight period she was noted to have a low cardiac output and mixed venous gas, and she was started on milrinone and given fluid boluses.
By the following morning, her milrinone was able to be weaned, and she was started on lasix for diuresis.
Her chest tubes did remain in for increased drainage.
On postoperative day #2, she had been weaned off of her milrinone, and remained hemodynamically stable.
Her chest tubes were DC'd on this day without incident, she did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24.2%.
Later on in this day, she was noted to have frequent PVCs and was eventually started on an amiodarone drip.
By postoperative day #3, her amio drip was DC'd, and she was changed to po amiodarone.
Throughout this time, she continued to remain in intensive care due to requirement of Neo-Synephrine drip.
She continued to be treated with amiodarone and was also given IV Lopressor to help control her rate.
She had her Lopressor increased and was to receive IV Lopressor should she have anymore bursts of atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day #7, she was started on anticoagulation for her intermittent bursts of atrial fibrillation.
Her echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55%, and the electrophysiology service felt that there would be no need for further treatment or EP studies to evaluate her nonsustained V. tach.
Therefore, she was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and continuing her heparin for anticoagulation of her atrial fibrillation.
She continued to receive Coumadin to achieve goal INR of 2 to 2.5, and she did continue to have intermittent, self-limited bursts of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate in the 110s-120s.
She was continued on Lopressor and amiodarone, and by [**1-27**] had achieved goal anticoagulation, and it was felt that since her bursts of atrial fibrillation were self-limited, and she remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, that it would be safe for her to be discharged to home with visiting nurse services.
