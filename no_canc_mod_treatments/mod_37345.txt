As per IP, it was recommended that the patient con't to uncap the trachestomy tube at night and place a trach mask with humidifier around that.
The patient was doing well on this regimen while in the unit and was called out to the floor.
She was placed on a ventilator on the first night as she appeared somnolent and monitored for another night using red cap during the day and passy muir valve at night without any oxygen desaturations.
Multiple attempts were made to re-address code status as pt periodically requested that she no longer be put on a ventilator.
Of note, the patient was also restarted on her Sildenafil for her pulmonary hypertension.
The patient was also continued on her ipratropium, albuterol, and fluticasone  On transfer back to the floor, the patient was doing well on 1.5L NC, maintaining O2 sats between 88-92%.
In the MICU, diuresis was initiated for her volume overload (lasix 80 mg IV BID) with good immediate response.
At night, we kept her on oximetry while using a Passy-Muir valve which was used for humidified air without any desaturation.
It was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, but once her creat was trending down, Lasix 40 mg daily was restarted.
Her lasix was stopped and medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxic agents were avoided.
Upon discharge, her creat was trending down, back to 1.3 and diuresis was restarted.
# RUE DVT: Otherwise, her anticoagulation for her upper extremity DVT was continued (lovenox) with coumadin being held given plan by IP to exchange out the tracheostomy tube in early [**Month (only) 116**].
After IP decided that they were going to hold off on this procedure, Lovenox was discontinued and the patient was restarted on coumadin with daily INRs being checked.
# E. coli UTI: The patient completed seven day course of ceftriaxone for her E.coli UTI.
The patient was initially volume overloaded and diuresed as described above.
She was discharged home on Lasix 40 mg daily.
