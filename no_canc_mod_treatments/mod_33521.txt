Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, new compared to [**2125-5-22**].
Focal aneurysmal dilation of right common femoral artery where in-situ saphenous bypass arises.
There is a moderate pneumothorax including a basal component and smaller component along the anterior junction line and the pleural catheter courses through the largest air pocket.
The fluid component is also moderate in size and is mostly unloculated, but the attenuation of the adjacent pleura is increased which can be seen in empyema.
An NG tube is located in the stomach.
Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC.
Continuous fluoroscopic observation was provided during administration of pudding and nectar-thick consistencies.
A mild-to-moderate residue was also again noted within the valleculae and piriform sinuses.

He completed a treatment course with Linezolid and Unasyn.
He was treated initially with Daptomycin, Ceftazidime, and Fluconazole; then Ceftriaxone alone from [**Date range (1) 78217**] then Meropenem started on [**8-31**] (due to MIC levels) for a planned 10 day course (last day planned as: [**9-6**]).
A R pigtail chest tube was placed for his pleural effusions.
He was treated with stress dose steroids.
TFT's consistant with hypothyroid-- endocrine was consulted and levothyroxine was started.
He was started on a heparin gtt on [**9-1**].
A L pigtail catheter attempted but not able to be placed [**9-4**]; the R pigtail was adjusted at that time.
He was started on a nonrebreather, given lasix/diamox and metoprolol.
IP was consulted and a pigtail was placed on the left side; the right pigtail continued to drain well.
Daptomycin was discontinued and he completed a course of Meropenem to cover for Klebsiella Ventilator Associated pneumonia.
He then developed another Klebsiella & Acinetobacter pneumonia, so was treated with Meropenem/Bactrim which was switched to Mereopenem/Cefepime when his acinetobacter was found to be resistant to Bactrim.
He was on stress dose steroids which were tapered and completed on [**11-13**].
He will continue cefepime and meropenem until ???
Cardiology saw patient and recommended stress test prior to surgery.
Plavix was held, but patient was started on pentoxyphyline and continued on aspirin.
3.Nutrition: The patient was on tube feeds throughout his hospital stay.
Prior to discharge, he had an IR guided PEG tube placed which is functioning well.
He had an ileus for approximately 5 days which prevented him from getting tube feeds.
He was started on an aggressive bowel regimen, opioids were minimized, and patient was started on standing reglan and hte ileus resolved.
He was treated with gabapentin, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch to achieve ideal pain control.
He developed an ileus so pain medications were weaned.
Tracheostomy was performed.
He was eventually weaned off the vent, with only intermittent support on trach mask.
This was treated with daptomycin and ciprofloxacin for a total of two weeks.
Daptomycin was chosen because the patient had a history of MRSA infection and he had an allergy to vancomycin.
His antibiotics were stopped on [**10-17**].
7.Mental Status: The patient went through several weeks of being quite sedated and unarousable.
This was evenually attributed to the combination of high doses of tramadol and gabapentin.
His gabpentin dosing was decreased and his tramadol was discontinued.
He had marginal blood pressures and so was placed on a lasix drip.
the patient diureses quite a bit, remaining on the lasix drip for two weeks.
He still remains fluid overloaded, but diuresis has not yet been initiated.
9.NSTEMI: The patient was treated with metoprolol, aspirin.
Plavix was held due to coffee ground emesis from NGT.
He was initially placed on heparin gtt, but this was discontinued as he began to bleed from a coccygeal ulcer.
Patient was initiated on lovenox when he was found to have a RLE DVT.
He underwent several thoracenteses during hospital stay.
