CXR ([**5-15**]): IMPRESSION: ET tube 4.6 cm above the carina.
MRI/MRA Brain ([**5-16**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive foci of acute infarction in posterior circulation distribution, involving bilateral thalami, occipital lobes, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.
Endotracheal tube has been advanced, tip now no less than 11 mm from the carina, 2 cm below optimal placement.
CXR ([**5-18**]): The ET tube tip is relatively low, approximately 3 cm above the carina, but the patient's neck is in mild flexion, thus the position of the ET tube is at the lower limits of accepted.
The Dobbhoff tube tip is in proximal stomach.
Expected evolution of multiple areas of infarction involving the bilateral occipital, cerebella, thalami, right pons, and midbrain.
MRI/MRA Brain ([**5-19**]): FINDINGS: There are multiple areas of slow diffusion which have increased in size within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, right medial temporal lobe, bilateral thalami, and pons.
IMPRESSION: Interval increased size of the infarctions involving the cerebellar hemispheres, occipital lobes, medial temporal lobe, thalami, and pons as described above.
