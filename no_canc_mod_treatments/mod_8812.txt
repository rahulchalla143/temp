On the day following admission [**2173-10-18**] the patient went to the Operating Room where he had a coronary artery bypass graft times four.
He had left internal mammary artery anastomosed to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
He was left intubated and was on Propofol drip on arrival to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
The night of operation he was extubated without incident and weaned off of Neosynephrine which he needed for blood pressure support.
His hematocrit was 19.5 and he was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
His repeat hematocrit after 2 units had gone from 19.5 to 23.7 and therefore he was given a third unit of packed red blood cells.
His sternal wires, chest tube and Foley catheter were all removed without incident.
Unfortunately upon removal of his Foley catheter the patient was unable to void and required to be straight cathed times one.
The catheter was removed and he was able to void several hours later spontaneously.
Pain was controlled on oral medications and he was voiding without problems.
