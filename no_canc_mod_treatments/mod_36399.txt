HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old white male with a past medical history of seizure disorder on Tegretol and mental retardation among others.
Left groin line was placed.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2094**].
Skin - multiple abrasions on bilateral lower extremities (DIP of all toes, lateral malleoli and dorsum of feet).
Right eye with subconjunctival hemorrhage superior to pupil.
Chem7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, bicarbonate 13, blood urea nitrogen 56, creatinine 4.2, glucose 100, anion gap 23.
Carbamazepine 33 ([**3-18**]).
Activated charcoal 30 grams were given at the time of arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and three hours afterwards and need for further doses was evaluated in the a.m. after admission.
The levels were reduced to therapeutic range with charcoal treatment and intravenous hydration.
Cardiology - The patient had a new widening of the QRS on initial electrocardiogram and this was likely related to sodium channel blocking activity of Tegretol.
One amp of bicarbonate was pushed and the electrocardiogram was rechecked.
He was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q.d.
and Clindamycin 300 mg t.i.d.
The Levofloxacin and Clindamycin were continued for a fourteen day course and discontinued starting on [**2100-11-17**].
This was most likely rhabdomyolysis and resolved with hydration and bicarbonate and eventually the CKs trended downward.
His decreased potassium was also suspected to be secondary to diarrhea, gastrointestinal losses.
Gastrointestinal - His recent gastrointestinal bleed at [**Hospital 14852**] secondary to erosive esophagitis prompted nasogastric tube lavage on admission in the Emergency Department which was clear.
He was treated with intravenous Protonix for the duration of his hospital course up until discharge.
Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for HSV and urine toxicology screens were negative, not consistent with these as possible etiologies of altered mental status.
The patient was also while intubated on Propofol and thus not allowing assessment of his current mental status.
Neurology recommendations included electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to further workup altered mental status.
Trauma - He was seen by trauma surgery to be evaluated for cervical spine instability; they recommended that he be kept in a cervical collar even though he had no fracture, since ligamentous injury was not ruled out at the time.
He will follow-up with neurosurgery a week or two after discharge when he will be reevaluated with flexion and extension films as well as a head CT to follow his subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood seen on CT of the head on [**2100-11-4**].
Dermatology - The patient was also seen by dermatology while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for his multiple abrasions on bilateral malleoli and forehead.
These abrasions were treated with Bacitracin Ointment and wound dressing changes b.i.d.
The hypothesis that was generated was that perhaps the patient had a seizure and overdosed with Tegretol during postictal confusion.
His issues of Tegretol overdose as well as rhabdomyolysis were resolved and levels of Tegretol as well as CKs were trending downward towards normal limits.
As aspiration pneumonia continued to be treated with Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for a fourteen day course.
Eventually as stated previously, his cervical collar was removed once he was clinically cleared with extension and flexion cervical spine films.
He was continued on Lopresor 100 mg b.i.d.
for his hypertension and was switched to Atenolol 100 mg q.d.
Nutrition - The patient had a nasogastric tube in since the Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and due to aspiration pneumonia history as well as neck instability, tube feeds were started on this patient two days after he reached the floor in efforts to give him nutrition.
For the first couple of days, he failed the swallow studies with signs and symptoms of aspiration upon taking thin liquids.
Eventually, he did better with liquids and was started on soft solids and thick liquids.
He remains on aspiration precautions.
His hematocrit remained stable during his hospital floor course and his abrasions on his extremities continued to be treated with Bacitracin Ointment application to the wounds with dressing changes twice a day.
He described the patient was slowly returning to his baseline and at baseline the patient talks and is fully functional, transports himself around the city, and is very meticulous about his medication regimen by taking the right amount at the right time, never over or under.
Tegretol 200 mg p.o.
Atenolol 100 mg p.o.
Bacitracin Ointment apply b.i.d.
