She was started empirically on Vanc/Zosyn for health-care associated pneumonia.
In addition, she was started on IV Solumedrol and standing nebs for presumptive COPD flare and given small boluses of IV Lasix (when blood pressure came up) for possible component of decompensated CHF.
She has completed a seven-day course of antibiotics at time of discharge; steroids were stopped prior to discharge and Lasix has been stopped due to concern of intravascular volume depletion based on labs.
Her electrolytes showed a mild hypernatremia, which corrected with IV D5W.
Her mental status gradually improved with treatment of infection and hypernatremia.
Given the hypotension at admission, there was concern that blood loss might be contributing.
Her hematocrit remained stable, and her blood pressure came up with treatment of infection.
This was likely prerenal ARF in the setting of infection and sepsis, and it resolved with intravenous fluids.
The lactic acidosis resolved with fluids and antibiotics.
