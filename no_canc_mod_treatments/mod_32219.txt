Treatment for HRS was initiated with ocreotide, midodrine and albumin.
Due to this decline, patient was initiated on hemodialysis.
She was evaluated for liver transplant and was accepted on the liver transplant list on [**2186-1-31**].
Cirrhosis and worsening liver function due to history ETOH and hep C cirrhosis.
She underwent several diagnostic and therapeutic paracenteses including 7L on [**1-28**], 3L on [**2-2**], [**1-11**] 5L, therapeutic on [**12-29**] 3L, dx/tx 4L on [**12-24**].
Bilirubin usually elevated after transfusions then nadired at 5-6, similar to previous episodes.
Hypotensive episodes were deemed to be due to simultaneous HD sessions and Large volume parecenteses as well as on one occasion GIB requiring temporary MICU admission for monitoring (SBPs < 84mmHg).
The source of fever could not be identified and patient was temporarily on IV Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for empiric SBP and broad spectrum coverage.
On [**2186-3-13**], the patient underwent combined liver and kidney transplant with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Each session was followed by IVIG (10 gms each) and she received ATG 100 mg x 6 doses ([**3-21**] - [**3-26**]) as well as a single dose of Rituximab on [**3-22**].
She was maintained on hemodialysis following the transplant as recommended by the renal team.
Her last day of dialysis was on [**2186-4-1**].
She was managed with daily IV lasix and this continues on discharge.
Her creatinine stabilized around 1.3 In the post op period, despite the fact that the liver synthetic function was improving daily, she was still having a large volume of ascites that required paracentesis.
Specimens were not taken at the time of the scope, so she was broadly covered with micafungin (14 days) and gancyclovir which was then converted back to valcyte after symptomatic improvement.
All lines were removed including the triple lumen and the dialysis line.
The dialysis catheter did not show any growth, but the blood cultures obtained at that same time were also positive for Staph coag nagative and she was started on Vancomycin which will be complete on [**2186-4-16**].
A post pyloric feeding tube was placed on [**4-10**] and tube feeds started and successfully advanced.
