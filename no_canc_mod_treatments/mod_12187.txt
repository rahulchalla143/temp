A subsequent catheter showed a systolic gradient of 130 after PVC and 96 after Valsalva.
Trial of medical management failed to relieve the patient's symptoms, as did a prior alcohol septal ablation in [**2156-12-11**].
In the catheter lab here, the patient's systolic gradient was noted to be absent, however it was seen to rise to 100 mmHg with dobutamine stress.
The initial septal artery was noted to be absent and the second septal artery which had two branches, both of which were injected with ethanol and that resulted in the complete resolution of the gradient even with dobutamine stress in the lab.
