CD19 and CD20 co-expressing B cells comprise approximately 18% of lymphoid-gated events, and do not express aberrant antigens (CD5 or CD10).
B-cell clonality could not be reliably assessed due to extremely dim expression of surface immunoglobulin light chain antibodies.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 65 year old female with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b ascites who presented with thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, melena, and BRBPR.
# Thrombocytopenia: Her thrombocytopenia may be due to liver disease, but the acute drop is more likely due to autoimmune causes, infection, or a medication effect.
She did not receive Heparin during her last admission per POE orders, and platelets as low as 11 are unlikely to be due to HIT.
Augmentin and Macrobid can cause thrombocytopenia, but the Macrobid was not started until after her platelets started to drop.
She was given multiple platelet transfusions while in the MICU with continued thrombocytopenia.
Further evaluation for HIT was not pursued.
Hematology consult was called and recommended IVIg, flow studies for immunophenotyping, and H pylori serology.
Her Plt count increased to the mid 60s after receiving IVIg, and had risen to the 70s by discharge.
She did not require additional platelets after receiving IVIg.
She was given an IV PPI, but Octreotide gtt and antibiotics were not given.
Her Hct slowly trended down in the MICU, requiring multiple RBC transfusions.
She was continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H.
On discharge, she was switched to Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID.
Amoxicillin was avoided given the possible relationship of Augmentin with her recent thrombocytopenia.
Lasix and Spironolactone were restarted on [**2120-9-6**] without significant electrolyte abnormalities.
She had a therapeutic tap for 4L on [**2120-9-9**] which had [**Numeric Identifier 54848**] RBCs, but only 250 WBCs and 48% polys.
Her diuretics were restarted on [**2120-9-6**] with Lasix 40 mg PO daily and Spironolactone 50 mg PO daily.
ENT was consulted and cauterized her left nostril with Surgicel placement.
Her Atenolol was held in the setting of her recent bleeding, but restarted at discharge.

You were initially sent to the Intensive Care Unit, where you were given transfusions of blood, platelets, and clotting factors.
You received additional platelet transfusions and evaluation of your liver disease.
You were also seen by the Hematology department to help determine why your platelets were low.
They recommended starting treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins.
After receiving this treatment, your platelet count started increasing, and you did not require any additional platelet transfusions.
Since your low platelets may have been caused by taking the antibiotic Augmentin, you should avoid taking this medication in the future unless absolutely necessary.
While on the Liver service, you had a therapeutic paracentesis to remove ascites fluid from your abdomen and help make you more comfortable.
Your medications were adjusted to slow the further accumulation of fluid in your abdomen.
You were started on medications to treat this infection and eradicate the bacteria.
START: Furosemide 40 mg by mouth daily START: Spironolactone 100 mg by mouth daily START: Omeprazole 20 mg by mouth twice daily START: Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 14 days START: Clarithromycin 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 14 days START: Lorazepam  0.5 mg by mouth at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
