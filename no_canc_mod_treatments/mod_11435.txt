The ER discussed with the cardiology fellow on call the slightly elevated troponin and given her age and h/o SAH / SDH she was thought not to be a candidate for anticoagulation but to use aspirin only.
Given she had wheezes, she was given atrovent nebs q6h, albuterol nebs q6h.

Given that patient has a history of proteus resistant to cipro (in [**2190**]), quinolone was changed to cefepime (for PNA as above).
