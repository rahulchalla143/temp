Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes of uncertain etiology, could be reactive in nature.
Borderline enlarged main pulmonary trunk measuring 3.3 cm, compatible with pulmonary hypertension.
A Lasix gtt was started and the patient's oxygenation improved.
The effusion was previously noted in an admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**12-26**] and it was treated with diuresis then.
The hypoxia is not responsive to oxygen therapy which raises the possibility of a R-->L cardiac shunt or an intrapulmonary shunt.
Patient was tried on BiPap but did not tolerate the mask due to skin breakdown on bridge of nose.
Concomitant face mask and nasal canula were used to maintain her saturation.
Because of continued episodes of desaturation, patient underwent thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion with improvement of oxygenation status, able to oxygenate well just on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
# UTI: Pt with grossly positive UA and mental status changes, so she was empirically started on Ceftriaxone.
Cultures revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella and pt completed 10 day course of ciprofloxacin with no growth seen on subsequent urine cultures.
She remained rate controlled on Metoprolol during admission.
She also takes Coumadin for anticoagulation.
Coumadin was stopped for thoracentesis.
INR at discharge was 1.2 and coumadin restarted with goal INR [**12-20**].
Will need regular labs drawn and coumadin dosages titrated at nursing home.
