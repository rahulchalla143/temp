Neurology was consulted to evaluate this weakness and neurology noted that after the patient's emergent exploratory laparotomy for perforated duodenal ulcer, the patient's postoperative course had been relatively stable, although he had been in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and had been in sinus rhythm over the past three days prior to neurology's visit.
ASSESSMENT:  At that time, assessment showed a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with various risk factors, including age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, now presenting with four to five hour history of sudden onset of left sided weakness, arm greater than leg.
The presentation was suspicious for stroke but many possible etiologies involving the face, arm and leg may indicate either occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, although there would be expected more signs, including field cut, neglect, etc.
From [**2-24**], postoperative day number 12, recommendations were to consider to start on Unasyn and Fluconazole for yeast coverage, from abscess swab from operating room culture which showed 3+ PMN's, sparse yeast and gamma strep.

The patient was intubated in the unit and neurology continued to follow and to continue heparin with PTT goal of 40 to 60 for anticoagulation for clinical stroke, regardless of negative imaging and the goal SPP was 110 to 120 to increase perfusion.

Pulmonary was consulted on [**2154-3-1**] and recommended aggressive diuresis.
Two doses of Lasix were given on postoperative night of day 16 and the patient also had previous pulmonary consult which, as said before, recommended aggressive diuresis and possibly right upper extremity duplex and questionable use of Bi-pap to decrease work of breathing and aide in decreased PC02.
On [**2154-3-8**], the patient and family had family meeting with attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**], and it was thought that the patient would be best managed under the aegis of Hospice at nursing home and was discharged on [**2154-3-9**] to Hospice.
