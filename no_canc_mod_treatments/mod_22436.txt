Specifically, the patient was admitted to the CT Surgery service for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction surgery.
While on the CT Surgery service, the patient was evaluated by multiple services, including Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology, Pulmonary, Nutrition, and Physical Therapy.
The Pulmonary service recommended inhaled steroids as well as around-the-clock MDIs including Atrovent and albuterol for his pulmonary disease.
The patient subsequently had bilateral lower extremity angiograms on [**2167-2-27**], which revealed near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery and therefore, the patient underwent two stents by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] being placed in that artery.
These ulcers secondary to vasculitis on the patient's extremities grew out both MRSA and Enterococcus, therefore the patient was placed on linezolid and ciprofloxacin to cover these organisms.
The reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000 while on the CT Surgery service team.
It was felt that because of the patient's multiple comorbidities including malnutrition and this vasculitis, he was not currently a candidate for lung volume reduction surgery.
An A-line was placed in the patient's right arm immediately.
Therefore, Anesthesia was called for an elective intubation.
The patient was sedated with Fentanyl, Versed, was intubated and placed on assist control 550/16 100 FIO2.
Repeat blood gas immediately after intubation was 7.23, pCO2 of 70, and pO2 of 367.
A chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Of note the patient had recently been hospitalized in [**Month (only) 404**] for a pneumonia and a COPD flare requiring BiPAP use.
Prior to this hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], however, the patient had never required intubation.
prednisone for COPD flare.

In general, the patient prior to intubation appeared very labored from a breathing perspective.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with severe COPD initially admitted to the CT Surgery service on [**2167-2-22**] for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction surgery.
The patient had an episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure and therefore was transferred to the MICU for further care and was intubated.
While a central line was being placed in the right internal jugular vein, the patient became severely bradycardic and eventually asystolic.
A cardiac arrest code was called, and the patient went from asystole to a PEA arrest requiring Epinephrine and atropine dosing.
A needle decompression was performed and a chest tube was immediately placed by the Surgery service.
Based on the above description, it was felt that the patient's hypotension post BiPAP and intubation likely reflected the beginnings of a pneumothorax and that with subsequent PEEP as well as auto PEEP, this developed into a tension pneumothorax leading to a PEA arrest.
The patient's pneumothorax resolved with needle decompression and placement of a chest tube.
He was intubated and weaned until [**2167-3-12**] at which time the patient was extubated.
However, over the next 24 hours, the patient began more and more hypercapnic and required reintubation on [**2167-3-13**].
As the patient was becoming difficult to wean, it was decided that it would be in the patient's best interest to have a tracheostomy placed for further weaning and for patient's safety.
Therefore, a tracheostomy was placed on Tuesday, [**2167-3-17**].
These are both done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the patient's consent and the family were also very involved in the decision and agreed with these procedures.
The patient tolerated the tracheostomy without complications.
He was able to be weaned to CPAP with pressure support and on the day of discharge to the pulmonary rehab facility, he was requiring 0 PEEP and a pressure support of 8 with excellent oxygenation and no signs of hypercapnia.
The patient was continued on intravenous Solu-Medrol that was eventually tapered.
The day of discharge he was to be discharged to prednisone 12.5 mg p.o.
The patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as well.
Furthermore, the patient was fitted with a Passy-Muir valve on two days prior to discharge and was able to use this without any respiratory difficulty.
Cardiovascular:  As noted above, the patient was hypotensive immediately post BiPAP and post intubation likely secondary to the tension pneumothorax on the right side.
Levophed pressor was required to maintain adequate blood pressure during the patient's first 24 hours within the MICU, but then this was quickly weaned with decompression at the right pneumothorax.
After the patient's cardiac arrest, which as stated above included asystole, then PEA, then ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, he was placed on an amiodarone drip for 24 hours.
He was noted at times to have some hypertension once he was weaned off the pressors.
Therefore, he was placed on Lopressor for a short period of time.
The patient had been receiving subq Heparin since admission to [**Hospital1 69**].
At the outside hospital, he had been on Lovenox for prophylaxis.
However, with the high clinical suspicion, the patient was kept off all Heparin products.
Therefore, once the patient's platelet count returned to within normal limits and showed upward trend, based on recommendations from the Hematology service, the patient was started on prophylaxis for further clots of Lovenox 30 subq b.i.d.
He tolerated this medication well and his platelets remained quite stable with a platelet count in he 300's upon discharge.
The patient was placed on Plavix while in the CT Surgery service after the two stents had been placed in the right ileac artery.
Even with the patient's thrombocytopenia, the Plavix was continued as the risk for instent thromboses quite high within the first month of stent placement.
His aspirin was held while he was severely thrombocytopenic, but then reinitiated when his platelet count returned to [**Location 213**].
FEN:  As stated above, the patient had a PEG tube placed on [**2167-3-17**] at the same time of tracheostomy placement.
He tolerated this well, and his tube feeds were at goal 24 hours post placement of the PEG.
The patient had fairly normal electrolytes and only required repletion of potassium and magnesium on an infrequent basis.
The patient was placed on linezolid and ciprofloxacin for these ulcers.
These medications were discontinued on the MICU service as the patient no longer had a white count, was afebrile, and his skin lesions were much improved.
The patient was empirically treated for Clostridium difficile for a 14-day course.
Three Clostridium difficile toxins were negative, however, with cessation of Flagyl on the CT Surgery service, the patient developed severe diarrhea and with reinitiation of Flagyl, this stopped.
It is recommended that the patient not receive amoxicillin or other penicillin products for this reason in the future.
Code:  The patient remained full code throughout his hospital course as this was his wish as communicated by the patient on numerous occasions and as affirmed by his family.
They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and narcotics as much as possible as they resulted in paradoxical reactions with the patient's mood.
Therefore, the psychiatrist recommended the use of Haldol or other antipsychotics on a prn basis.
The chest tube was kept on suction until [**2167-3-20**].
When the air leak subsided, chest tube was place to waterseal.
Chest tube was then pulled out on [**2167-3-23**].
