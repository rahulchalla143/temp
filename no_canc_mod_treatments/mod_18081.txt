#)Pituitary adenoma: s/p resection of microadenoma [**9-22**] with hypopituitarism after surgery.
Pt treated with fondaparinux for DVT/PT at OSH.
-neurosurgery recs - no plan for surgery/shunt placement in the near future, ok for anticoagulation by their standpoint.
Patient on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis upon arrival to floor from MICU.
Dilantin was subsequently changed to keppra due to a skin eruption consistent with drug hypersensitivity rash that presented on [**11-13**].
Fungal candidemia with possible eye involvement Patient on steroids since panhypopituitarism from adenoma resection.
?infected hematoma s/p surgery and urosepsis.
-Patient completed a 13 day course of PCN and fluconazole; termintated one day early for a skin eruption consistent with hypersensitivity that presented on [**11-13**].
-Patient received blood and urine cultures on [**10-24**], [**11-16**] for fevers spiking at night.
Patient started on Cipro on [**11-17**], however, subsequent sensitivities showed resistance so Meropenem started on [**11-19**] for a 14 day course.
-Central line was DC'd and patient received PICC on [**11-8**].
-patients steroid replacement followed and tapered as recommended by endocrine.
Patient started on lasix drip with 500 cc out but with high dose at 40 mg/hr with an increasing creatinine over the course of 2 days.
Lasix drip stopped on admission with improvement of urine output, may be secondary to post-ATN diuresis.
-D/C'd bicarb drip on admission, will follow HCO3 -Renal followed course on floor and patient's Cr subsequently normalized to 0.8.
-When patients Cr had reached 0.9, patient was diuresed with lasix to mobilize excess fluid.
Decent UOP response to diuresis and then patient's urine output increased and upon admission, appeared to be autodiuresing.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been due to sepsis, antibiotic suppression of marrow.
-platelet count improved -subsequently tolerated heparin  #Anemia: Hematocrit trended down by approx 2pts per day to a low of 23 without clear source of bleeding and hemolysis labs neg.
-s/p IVC filter placement, negative HIT panel, patient restarted and maintained on heparin IV until Hct stable and plt count improved and then switched to Lovenox.
-LUE ultrasound on [**11-17**] for LUE swelling ruled out LUE DVT.
Sodium tablets and demeclocyline given.
-D/C'd demeclocycline -Sodium supported with IV fluids as needed.
#)Hypertension: patient maintained on PO labetolol 200mg [**Hospital1 **] through course on floor.

levothyroxine 75mcg IV daily - will repeat TSH, free T4, T3 on [**12-8**] and follow up with endocrine on [**12-27**].
Nutrition: Patient received Dophoff tube for feeding while in MICU.
Dilantin then DC'd and switched to Keppra.
Recommended clobetasol cream which was applied.
#) Prophylaxis: PPI, anticoag, bowel regimen .
