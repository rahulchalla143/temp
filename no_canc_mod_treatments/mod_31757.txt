IR embolization s/p angioseal 2. ultrasound guided paracentesis x 2   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 62 y.o male with h.o ETOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, anemia (HCT 13, INR 3), HTN, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2149-8-1**] with c/o palpitations and dizziness, HCT found to be 12.9 and pt admitted.
At [**Hospital3 **] before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was given ~13 units of PRBCs and 5 units of FFP since admission.
-Alcohol abuse (quiescent x 6 months per pt with occ relapse) -Pancytopenia (admitted [**Month (only) **]-[**Month (only) **] to [**Hospital1 112**] with "severe anemia", given vit K, FFP, PRBCs.Saw GI, had EGD and colonoscopy that showed a few polyps) -HTN -ARF -GERD.
Worked with suicidal individuals.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The right hepatic lobe 1.4 cm hypoattenuating lesion is unchanged, and may represent a cyst.
Gelfoam embolization was performed from the midportion of the 9th right intercostal artery, with good angiographic results.
Angioseal device was used at the right femoral artery access site.
U/S guided paracentesis ([**2149-8-12**]): IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding 2.25 liters of clear, dark yellow fluid.
CTA was not diagnostic of source of bleed, so he underwent tagged RBC scan which implicated R T9 intercostal artery bleed, for which pt underwent IR cauterization/embolization on [**8-7**].
He recieved more blood products while here including prbc, ffp, cyro, amicar, Vit K. Liver and hematology were following closely.
Once hemodynamically stable, he was transfered back to floor once HCT stable, however had some bleeding from R groin site where IR threaded a catheter for the embolization procedure.
At this point, transplant was also consulted to consider liver transplant while here given it may be the only definitive option for his bleeding diathesis/coagulopathy.
In total, he recieved 18U prbc (total 31), 31U ffp (total 36), 3 cryo more while at [**Hospital1 18**], his last one [**8-28**].
The liver consult service saw the patient and recommended treatment of his hyperbilirubinemia with Ursodiol.
In terms of fluid balance, the patient was started on Aldactone 100 mg and Lasix 80 mg, which lessened his abdominal and peripheral edema.
He received two U/S guided abdominal taps removing 2.25 and 2.6 liters of dark yellow fluid.
The patient was prescribed lactulose for three bowel movements a day.
At times, the patient seemed to be slightly encephalopathic (slower thinking, agitation), however, it resolved with Lactulose use.
Social work met with the patient and provided him with resources to reduce his alcohol use.
He has an evaluation at [**Hospital3 2358**] for transplant on [**2149-9-30**].
He was given 2 trials of 3 days worth of vitamin K. During his acute bleeding episodes, the patient was given PO Amicar to promote hemostasis.
The patient's creatinine lowered to 0.6 and would raise higher with Lasix doses, likely due to volume depletion.
F/u appointments with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and liver transplant doctors.
