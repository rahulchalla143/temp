The other peripheral lesion within segment VI, abutting the hepatorenal space is also seen and hypoechoic in comparison to the surrounding parenchyma measuring 2.1 x 2.6 x 3.7 cm.
The segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and segment VI lesions are son[**Name (NI) 5326**] visible and could be attempted for percutaneous biopsy.
A moderate amount of ascites persists and a paracentesis would have to be done prior to the procedure to minimize any risk of capsular bleeding.
The smaller more posterior lesion is more concerning as it shows washout to surrounding liver on portal and delayed venous phases with a more vague larger anterior lesion of uncertain significance only seen on most delayed phase.
On admission, given reported episodes of fevers at home as well as abdominal pain, there was serious concern for SBP, and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics with ceftrixaone.
The patient completed a course of Ceftrixaone for presumed SBP, and subsequently started SBP prophylaxis with Cipro.
Prior to discharge, the patient received a therapeutic tap and was discharged on 20 mg of Furosemide as well as 50 mg Spironolactone.
The patient also received hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis with lactulose and rifaximin.
# HIV: The patient's HAART therapy was discontinued in house secondary to concerns for liver toxicity, specifically from abacavir.
HAART therapy was not restarted on discharge, and was deferred to the outpatient setting.
# HTN: The patient's amlodipine and lisinopril on hold given initially the concern for the patient's illness in the setting of presumed infection; he was not restarted on these medications upon discharge as he had been normotensive in house.
# Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine appeared to normalize over the course of his admission with albumin and IV fluid.
However, he does describe a long history of intermittent chest pressure with may require outpatient follow-up.
