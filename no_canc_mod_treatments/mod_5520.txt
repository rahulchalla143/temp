The right subclavian IV catheter terminates in the right atrium.
These foci could be definitively characterized with ultrasound if clinically indicated.
Right subclavian IV catheter tip overlies the SVC.
In the left kidney there are multiple subcentimeter simple cysts along with a large 3.5 x 3.7 x 4.2 cm simple cyst seen in the mid to lower pole.
The patient was initially managed in the MICU for 24 hrs with central line placement and IVF resuscitation.
Initially the patient was doing very well on the floor, sitting in chair [**Location (un) 1131**], heart rate well controlled on digoxin only (sotalol held in setting of relative hypotension on admission).
Blood cultures returned positive for gram negative rods resistant to quinolones and therefore his antibiotics were changed from Levofloxacin/Flagyl/Ampicillin antibiotics to Ceftriaxone mid afternoon.
Patient also noted to be intermittently wheezing, started on Albuterol/Atrovent nebs and given 2x 40 IV lasix for fluid overload on exam.
Overnight, patient spiked temp to 101.6 and went into rapid A. fib with rates in 140s, BP 100/67, given IV diltiazem 10 mg x 2 then 30 mg PO with persistent elevation in HR ranging 120-130s.
In the MICU, patient treated with Ceftriaxone initially.
Eventually antibiotics were tailored further and he was transferred to the medical floor once again, this time on IV Cefazolin (Ancef).
He required IV diltiazem in ED for rapid rate.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient was initially maintained on Digoxin w/out restarting sotalol for concerns of borderline low BP.
Patient later went into rapid afib the same evening in setting of fever spike requiring IV diltiazem.
He was started on IV diltiazem->PO with improvement in HR control while in the MICU.
Patient also restarted on sotalol which was eventually increased to 80 mg daily for optimal control.
His current regimen for HR control includes Sotalol 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Diltiazem 300 mg daily sustained release, Digoxin is discontinued.
Patient was also started on anticoagulation for A.fib with coumadin.
He is currently on 3 mg of coumadin daily.
Patient was initially treated with broad coverage with Ampicillin/Flagyl/Levofloxacin.
He was changed to IV Ceftriaxone and then Cefazolin once the sensitivities were available.
He should continue narrow spectrum antibiotic coverage with Cefazolin IV to complete a 14 day course.
Infectious disease felt that the patient should be treated with IV antibiotics for 14 days since PO antibiotics will likely not be adequate for this type of infection.
It was unclear whether this was a COPD flare vs. cardiac wheezing given that the patient required aggressive fluid hydration in the MICU.
The patient as treated with Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers with improvement.
He was also diuresed with IV lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and then put on lasix PO 80 QOD then daily.
He is discharged on 80 mg of lasix daily.
He diureses well with this dose.
Of note, the patient was also started on prednisone for presumed COPD and due to ongoing wheezing.
He is discharged on 20 mg of prednisone for COPD and concomitant gouty flare.
Steroids should be tapered over the next 12 days.
Patient also received a 5 day course of Azithromycin for presumed COPD exacerbation.
His medications were renally dosed throughout this admission.
Upon initial transfer to floor the patient appeared fluid overloaded s/p fluid resuscitation in MICU.
Patient required diuresis with IV lasix initially and is not maintained on PO lasix.
He was treated with Ibuprofen 600 mg x 2 intially and then placed on Indomethacin 25 mg TID with some relief.
His steroids were also increased to 20 mg daily.
He was not treated with Colchicine which he has taken in the past due to one episode of diarrhea and the potential to cause stomach upset with this medication.
This medication can be restarted in the future as per the PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should also be on prophylaxis with Allopurinol in the future once he is over this acute flare.
Diabetes: Patient is usually managed on oral medication as an outpatient.
He requires coverage with regular insulin sliding scale while on steroids.
The regular insulin sliding scale can be discontinued once he is off steroids.
He is also discharged on Glipizide which he was taking prior to admission.
This medication was discontinued while in hospital and he was maintained on a sliding scale regimen with good control.
