She was discharged home, taken off of her Coumadin, and had been managed with Lovenox, and she was to be admitted with her date of admission on [**2179-11-22**] for a repeat cardiac catheterization with mitral valve surgery to follow the next day.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had drug allergies to ACCUPRIL and an ANGIOTENSIN MEDICATION (the exact medication unknown).
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (The patient's medications on admission were) 1.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Hydralazine 10 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Isordil 10 mg p.o.
Lovenox 60 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   She underwent a mitral valve replacement with a 31-mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve as well as left atrial atherectomy and atrial septal defect closure with left-sided maze procedure on [**2179-11-23**].
The total cardiopulmonary bypass time for this procedure was 124 minutes, and the total cross-clamp time was 92 minutes.
The patient was transferred in stable condition, being arteriovenous paced at 80 beats per minute, to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on Neo-Synephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute and propofol at 25 mcg/kg per minute.
The patient was afebrile, being arteriovenous paced at 80 beats per minute.
Her vital signs were stable, and a junctional rhythm at 68, saturating at 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Physical examination was unremarkable with a plan to begin Lasix and to transfer to the floor.
Cardiology/Electrophysiology Service was consulted for the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation at which time they recommended to continue with beta blocker for now and Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
The plan was to consult with Cardiology regarding Coumadin and amiodarone use.
Cardiology consulted with the patient again at that time; at which time they suggested intravenous heparin until her INR was greater than 2 with a goal of 2 to 3, to utilize a low-dose Lopressor for high heart rates (for example, greater than 80 to 90), and to maintain it for 24 hours if the beta blocker was started for bradycardia, and if the patient required beta blocker and became bradycardic the patient may need a pacemaker.
The plan was to discharge the patient when her INR was greater than 2, and to administer 5 mg of Coumadin today and then 2.5 mg of Coumadin.
The patient received a total of 7.5 mg of Coumadin the night prior, and the plan was to continue to monitor the patient's INR with a plan for discharge when INR was greater than 2.
Coumadin 3 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.
Status post mitral valve replacement, atrial septal defect closure, and left-sided maze procedure.
