At that time, labs were obtained and heparin was held.
Lasix was also increased to 40 mg IV BID.
CXR showed worsening bilateral infiltrates by report; she had a CT scan of the chest which showed At midnight, she was seen by the ICU resident that she had been treated with 2 U FFP and 5 mg vitamin K. ABG at that time demonstrated pH 7.46 / pCO2 59 / pO2 77.

[**2197-12-5**] 9:57 pm CATHETER TIP-IV      Source: R arm PICC.
Migration of gastric tube into the rectus sheath.
Repositioning of tube is recommended.
Multiple incidental findings including right staghorn calculus, porcelain gallbladder, anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, and severe atherosclerotic disease.
Held aspirin and coumadin, reversed INR with FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV for refractory elevated INR.
Of note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high RISBIs  and acidemia.
The patient continued to be ventilator dependent at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes (down to 130?????
?s) which improved after pressure support was increased from 10 to 20.
?s air movement also did improve after albuterol nebulizer treatment as per nursing staff.
Lasix boluses initially attempted without much improvement in UOP and stopped because of rising Cr.
Ecoli also isolated for PEG site culture and Urine culture.
Her antibiotic regimen was adjusted.
Lasix drip was again attempted later in the hospital course with good response in urine output but not significant improvement in respiratory status.
Lasix converted to IV 60mg TID.
# Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.
On urine culture grew ceftriaxone-sensitive E.coli and antibiotic regimen was adjusted to cover.
Last day of ceftriaxone treatment should be [**2197-12-25**].
Urine has been progressively more clear and her urine output has improved on lasix drip.
With improved urine output, lasix drip was stopped and she was started on lasix PO 60mg tid.
Treatment with ceftriaxone as above.
# PEG complications:  Erythema/ Pus around peg likely combination of dermatitis/skin breakdown from pressure of PEG on skin w/some cellulitic component.
Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
Patient also with erosion of gastric wall around PEG site.
Tube feeds were restarted via PEG and well-tolerated.
# Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily.
CHADs-2 score by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
Aspirin and coumadin were held.
She has not been on anti-arrhythmic medications and maintained a good heart rate.
Futher anticoagulation should be avoided .
