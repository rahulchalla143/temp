HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 52 year old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, obesity and peripheral vascular disease on Coumadin who presents with bright red blood per rectum since about midnight on the day prior to admission.
The patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service from [**1-4**] until [**1-16**] with congestive heart failure and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and new onset of rapid atrial fibrillation where she was treated with a Diltiazem drip.
The patient was started on Coumadin at that time.
The patient had an elevated creatinine during that admission which was thought to be secondary to over diuresis, so her Lasix dose was decreased.
She denies a colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the past.
Right total knee replacement in [**2163**].
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Risperidone 2 mg p.o.
Zoloft 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 200 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
Doxepin 10 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Iron sulfate 225 mg p.o.
Sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed.
Lasix 80 mg p.o.
Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
Insulin 70/30, 70 units at breakfast and 25 units at night.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 52 year old female on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, who presents with bright red blood per rectum.
GASTROENTEROLOGY:  The patient originally had been admitted with bright red blood per rectum.
At that time, she was treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl empirically and was being followed both by the Gastrointestinal and Surgery Services.
There was one loop of distended small bowel without wall thickening and a loss of transverse colonic haustration, also without wall thickening, a nonspecific finding, and ischemia could not be excluded.
The patient's further gastrointestinal course was essentially that she was kept off Coumadin while she had been placed on a heparin drop for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
It was thought that this may be a secondary infiltrative process from her acute illness in the Intensive Care Unit and no further interventions were done.
She was started on an amiodarone drip, a Diltiazem drip and heparin drip at that time.
The patient's Diltiazem drip was weaned off and she was started on p.o.
Her amiodarone drip was also converted to 400 mg p.o.
Her heparin drip was discontinued as she was having difficulties with a gastrointestinal bleed, so she remained without anti-coagulation as this was the reason she was hospitalized and with anti-coagulation, she continued to bleed.
At the time of this dictation, she was in continued atrial fibrillation and was rate controlled on Amiodarone, Diltiazem and Lopressor.
The patient's outpatient Lopressor dose was 200 mg p.o.
twice a day and her medications are being titrated up as her blood pressure tolerates.
The first PEA arrest occurred during her CT scan when she was administered intravenous contrast.
There were no case studies showing any relation between receiving intravenous contrast and developing PEA arrest, however, it was also in the setting of the patient lying down flat.
She was resuscitated with two of epinephrine, two of Atropine and two of bicarbonate.
The second PEA arrest was two minutes and she was resuscitated and had subsequent hypotension requiring transient pressors.
The patient remained intubated for about three weeks and was finally weaned to CPAP overnight and nasal cannula during the day without effect.
The patient is also someone who benefits from CPAP at night to keep her alveoli open in the setting of having a large chest wall.
A full work-up was done to find the etiology of her sepsis, which had required pressors and she had a pan-CT of her body to look for any signs or symptoms of infection including pneumonia, abdominal abscess, colitis.
However, it was noted that the patient had increasing sputum so she was treated with a two week course of a treatment of Vancomycin for a ventilator acquired pneumonia.
She had a few episodes of acute on chronic renal insufficiency which subsided with treatment of her underlying sepsis and her underlying fluid status.
The patient had no further complications and tolerated increasing levels of diuresis with Lasix.
She required occasional transfusions with goal transfusion of hematocrit of greater than 27.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and she was kept on an insulin drip for most of her hospital stay given that the goal fingersticks were between 80 and 120 in the acute care setting.
She was finally transitioned over to her 70/30 insulin dose that she takes at home without any further problems.
Neurology was consulted and felt that she had a critical care myopathy and neuropathy, which should be resolved when treatment of her underlying medical condition was also treated.
No further intervention was done.
Rheumatology was consulted and they felt it was unlikely to be a rheumatological process and suggested to keep the patient off steroids as the risks of steroids were greater than any benefit and to keep the patient off steroids empirically if no clear reasons for steroids was identified.
ACCESS:  At the time of this dictation, the patient had a PICC line placed at the bedside by Interventional Radiology.
The PICC line had been placed with some difficulty, however, it is a working PICC that can withdraw blood and can have medication administered.
She was seen by Ophthalmology who felt that she had an exposure keratopathy as well as a corneal abrasion and she was treated with Ciprofloxacin and Erythromycin Ointments to help prevent any further infection.
The remainder of the Discharge Summary will include the patient's discharge medications and complete list of her discharge diagnoses.
