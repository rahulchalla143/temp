He was initally felt to have pulmonary edema and given 60mg Lasix IV prior to arrival and placed on a nitro drip for 1 hour which was stopped after his pressure decreased.
The patient was placed on Bipap 3 hours after arrival however still had a PaO2 of 50.
He was then intubated for continued hypoxima.

He was also gien 2 mg Ativan, 100mcg of Fentanyl, and Solumedrol 80mg.
Recent hospitalization at the VA for pneumonia with intubation for H. flu pneumonia (grew in sputum culture) treated with Ceftazidime, Flagyl and Vancomycin 2.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.
Numerous diverticula are seen scattered throughout the colon without evidence of diverticulitis.

Please note that the patient received IV contrast prior to the examination for performance of additional CT.
Note is made of cavum septum pellucidum et vergae.
IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to the patient motion and previous administration of IV contrast.
Please r/o PE REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o PE and f/u ulcerated aortic arch thrombosis CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

SUN DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 24357**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24358**]  Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with past medical history significant for lung cancer, COPD, recent H. Flu pneumonia, and recent new-onset atrial fibrillation now admitted with mental status changes, respiratory failure, and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone was not recommended  due to beta blockade effect given significant COPD history.
Patient was continued on aspirin.
Cardioversion was also not indicated since thromboembolic risk was too high.
Patient was extubated on [**2194-2-21**] and post extubation developed atrial fibrillation again.
Patient initially required fluid blouses and levophed for blood pressure support.
Peri-extubation, levophed was weaned off and prednisone was tapered.
The treatment goal was to rate control and then diurese(massive edema with albumin of 3)  From the respiratory failure standpoint, he had thoracentesiss in [**Month (only) **], cytology:atypical and reactive cells, no CA.
He was continued on levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
On the night of [**2194-2-22**], he became increasingly tachypneic and agressive suctioning by respiratory therapy did not bring up significant mucus plug.
Patient was put on BiPAP but was showing increasing respiratory effort.
