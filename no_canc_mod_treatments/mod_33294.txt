Thecal sac contents are not adequately assessed on the present study.
The ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the region of the third ventricle remains present.
Further evolution of bifrontal hypoattenuation, which may represent infarcts rather than non-hemorrhagic contusion, given the progression.
ET tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carina.
Left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach, the sidehole slightly below the gastroesophageal junction.
INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.
FINDINGS: Feeding tube tip is directed cephalad in region of gastroduodenal junction.
FINDINGS: There is a tract of hypodensity extending along the course of the prior right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter (2:13).
Post-right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter removal without evidence for hemorrhage.
She was loaded with dilantin, and started on nimodipine, and emergent bedside external ventricular drain was placed.
She also had a cardiac echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed significantly depressed cardic function.
On [**6-5**](overnight) she had a ICP elevation to 50 and the drain was promplty dropped to 10cm, and ICP normalized.
She again returned to angio on [**6-6**] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new CT finding.The patient was febrile with a Tmax 101.6 and was pan cultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were both neagtive.
On [**6-6**] The Dobutamine intravenous drip was off, vasopressors Levophed and neo cont.
A head CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for increased ICPs.
On [**6-9**], The patient required 3 doses of mannitol for sustained ICP levels of 23.
There were no changes in the patients mental status with these ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and tracked with her eyes.
On [**6-12**], The patient was bolused with dilantin 300mg for a 7.9 level.
The patient was extubated and stopped nimodpine for systolic blood pressure in 60's.The goal MAP > 100 and dobutamine was restarted.
A stroke neurology consult was obtained and they agreed with our continued HHH management and requested starting a Statin.
CVL access was changed and catheter tip sent.
Positive blood cx from arterial line and appearance of axillary A line, concerned for line infection and she was treated for line associated bacteremia for 7 day course.
