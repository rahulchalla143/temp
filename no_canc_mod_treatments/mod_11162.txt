REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for a history.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 66 year old female with a past medical history for diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease status post left below the knee amputation and right above the knee amputation in [**2173**], chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, status status post stent, and gout.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.
Evidently, in [**2190**], the patient was evaluated for coronary artery bypass graft but it was not done because of being a poor surgical candidate with co-morbidities.
Lopressor 100 twice a day.
Imdur 60 mg q. day.
Insulin 70/30, 56 units twice a day.
Lasix 40 mg q. day.
Aspirin 81 mg q. day.
Allopurinol 100 mg q. day.
Pravachol 40 mg q. day.
Integrilin drip.
Heart rate 95 to 100; right arm blood pressure 80, left arm blood pressure 120; 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Venous groin sheath in place.
Q's in II and F.  On [**3-4**], status post catheterization, sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, LAD, PR interval 166, QRS interval 106, ST depression in I, AVL and V5 through V6 with 1 millimeter Q's in III and F.  No real change from previous pre-catheterization EKG.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  66 year old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus with vascular complications including coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency and renal artery stenosis, status post catheterization with extensive coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease:  Continue Integrilin, restart heparin without bolus.
Cardiothoracic Surgery will be consulted.
CT surgery is not an option.
Interventional could consider stenting right coronary artery, consider functionality of this.
Continue aspirin and beta blocker; oral nitrates, consider changing them to three times a day for titration.
Use Hydralazine with Nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus:  Continue NPH and sliding scale insulin.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  Hold on Lasix for now.
Baseline creatinine 29.6, microcytic.
The decision was made that no catheterization intervention was needed as well and right coronary artery stent was not placed.
The patient was continued on her current medications as well as the patient's Amiodarone was decreased from 400 twice a day to 400 q. day; Isordil was added.
The patient put on Hydralazine titrated up to 40 four times a day.
The patient received blood transfusion for a hematocrit as low as 27.8.
The patient's hematocrit has successfully stabilized status post thrombin injection of the pseudo-aneurysm.
The result was a percutaneous cholecystomy tube under ultrasound guidance; 400 cc.
The patient has been on Levofloxacin since the gallbladder drainage was placed.
The patient was started on Vancomycin 750 mg q.
The patient was also put on Metronidazole (Flagyl), 500 mg three times a day, for further coverage.
Due to the patient's retroperitoneal bleed, the patient's Plavix and heparin has not been restarted.
The patient does have a right subclavian line as well as a right PICC line for long-term antibiotic use.
Since the patient has left the Coronary Care Unit she has been stable, but the right subclavian line is still in place on [**2196-3-13**], which will be pulled, and the PICC line will be left in place.
The patient's INR is elevated at 1.9, therefore, Vitamin K 5 mg subcutaneously was given.
INR will be rechecked before subclavian line is pulled.
The patient will have gallbladder drainage left in place for approximately up to six weeks while the gallbladder has a chance to quiesce.
Once the gallbladder inflammation has resolved, the drain will removed per Surgery.
The patient now has restarted p.o./oral medications and eating.
The patient is going well with regards to intake.
DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to a Rehabilitation Center for further intravenous antibiotics and rehabilitation status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient's plan will be to return to home, not yet with Hospice Care but with continued plan that she will be titrated up on her medicines for blood pressure and heart rate control as well as anginal control, and that she will at some point require Hospice Care for her failing condition that is not amenable to surgery.
The patient's blood pressure medications will be titrated as tolerated.
The patient will follow-up with Surgery regarding drainage of gallbladder tube and removal of gallbladder tube.
The patient will need to be restarted on her anti-coagulation, heparin and Coumadin, once it is deemed safe status post her retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient will need her subclavian line pulled once INR is stable.
The patient will be continued on her Procrit and her creatinine has been trending down.
The patient will need continued Vancomycin until [**2196-3-16**].
The patient will need Levaquin and Flagyl for a Klebsiella, Gram negative in her bile which is sensitive to Levaquin and will be continued to be deemed the course via Infectious Disease input.
The patient will be screened for rehabilitation and sent to rehabilitation as soon as she is clinically stable.
Atrovent nebulizers for wheeze.
Hydralazine 40 mg p.o.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.
Insulin sliding scale.
