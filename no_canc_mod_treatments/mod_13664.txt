She was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for RV outflow repair and evaluation of her pulmonic valve.
Her previous tetralogy of Fallot repair dilated the ascending aorta 4.3 cm and RV dilatation.
She had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2182-3-28**], which showed normal coronary arteries, and was referred for RV outflow tract reconstruction and pulmonic valve replacement versus repair.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Repair of tetralogy of Fallot in [**2126**] and corrective repair again in [**2142**], and tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in [**2132**] and [**2139**].
ALT 15, AST 19, alkaline phosphatase 60, total bilirubin 0.9, total protein 7.1, albumin 4.4, globulin 2.7.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient obtained dental clearance prior to operation and was readmitted to our service on [**4-23**], the evening before her corrective repair.
On the following morning, on [**4-24**], the patient underwent repair of a right ventricular outflow tract with reconstruction and pulmonic valve replacement with a 25 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna ThermaFix pericardial valve.
In addition, the patient also underwent right ventriculorrhaphy by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 61313**] of [**Hospital3 1810**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital3 1810**].

On the day of operation, the patient had been extubated by 6:30 in the evening, and was awake and alert on a nitroglycerin drip.
Gentle diuresis was begun.
On postoperative day 1, the patient remained on nitroglycerin drip at 1.25 mcg/kg/min.
Beta blockade was increased to metoprolol 50 b.i.d.
Percocet for pain management, and was satting 98% on room air, in sinus rhythm at 77, maintaining good blood pressure of 132/83.
The patient continued to receive diuresis for a weight of 87.6 kg.
Lopressor was increased to 75 b.i.d.
Foley was removed later in the day.
Pacing wires were removed on postoperative day 3.
K was repleted at 3.8, and Lopressor was increased the following morning operating table 100 mg p.o.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Aspirin, enteric-coated, 81 mg p.o.
Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tablets p.o.
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.

Status post tetralogy of Fallot with repair in [**2126**] and    corrective repair again in [**2142**].
