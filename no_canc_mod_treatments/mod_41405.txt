Attention on followup with ultrasound within six months is suggested to confirm that this is merely sludge rather than a solid polyp; this is seen in the context of more extensive solid-like sludge within the gallbladder, however.
[**2149-7-26**] CT Chest:  Right upper lobe nodule on chest radiograph corresponds to a right upper lobe cavitary lesion with slightly spiculated borders.
Pathology: [**2149-7-29**] Sputum Cytology: Rare atypical squamous metaplastic cells; squamous cells, pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and many neutrophils.
In light of poor prognosis and non-candidacy for transplant, patient decided to withdraw aggressive treatment and was discharged to hospice.
Dobhoff feeding tube in place and enteral feeding initiated, stopped when transitioned to CMO.
No improvement of INR with IV vitamin K and high AST:platelet ratio, physcial exam findings consistent with long standing cirrhosis.
- Hepatic encephalopathy: Discharged on lactulose and rifaximin to maintain clear mental state.
If unable to obtain rifaximin, increase lacutlose as needed for confusion - SBP: Patient had SBP this admission, as above, discharged on cipro ppx to prevent SBP per discussion with family - Varices:  has not had EGD, no known GIB - Ascites: diuretic refractory, s/p several large volume paracenteses this admission  # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hypernatremia in setting of alcoholic hepatitis with new onset ascites with intake of free water in excess of sodium.
Sodium was gradually increased on 3% hypertonic saline and fluid restriction.
On [**7-29**] hypertonic saline was stopped and he was continued just on fluid restriction and daily lasix, and Na increased to the low 130s.
CT with contrast did not show evidence of perforation, though one CT abdomen showed small amount of free air thought to be consistent with recent paracentesis, and had resolved on subsequent CT abdomen.
Patient was treated with Fluconazole, vancomycin and zosyn, ID was consulted.
-Dischaged on cipro only as above  # Cavitary Pneumonia: Noted to have cavitary lung lesions on admission, pulmonary was consulted, BAL cytology negative for malignancy, ruled out for TB early on.
Initial plan was to treat with clindamycin for 4 weeks then re-image, with CT guided biopsy when Tbili <6.
Also considered other causes of cavitary lung lesions including klebsiella, staph, fungal, etc, but sputum cultures were unrevealing.
- Patient treated with vancomycin and zosyn to cover pneumonia and peritonitis.
- F/u quantiferon, HIV, fungal markers pending at discharge - Discharged off of antibiotics except SBP prophylaxis as discussed above  # Septic shock: [**1-11**] SIRS criteria + lactic acidosis and elevated creatinine, hypotension with multiple potential sources, including cavitary HCAP and peritonitis as discussed below.
Had brief MICU admission for stabilization, did not require pressors or intubation.
Given 500mg IV thiamine x3 days and then started on PO thiamine.
Started on tube feeds while in hospital following nutrition consult, but this was discontinued when patient decided to stop aggressive treatment.
Last drink 1 month ago so he did not require a CIWA.
Patient not candidate for transplant as actively drinking up until this acute illness.
#HTN: Home metoprolol was held for low blood pressures.
# COPD: Continued on spiriva # Tobacco abuse: nicotine patch  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ====================== Unlikely to affect future management, but of note: - Liver hypodensity on CT not further characterized on MRI with gado as renal function not stable, but AFP and CA [**55**]-9 were normal - Fungal markers, Tb quantiferon pending at discharge, will not need to be follow up as patient transitioned to CMO - Final cultures from peritoneal fluid were pending at time of discharge   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were also malnourished, and your diet was supported by tube feeds through your nose.
You were given aggressive treatment for these problems, but did not improve significantly.
You were not a candidate for liver transplant because of your recent alcohol use, and would have to be involved in relapse recovery for a while before being considered for transplant.
