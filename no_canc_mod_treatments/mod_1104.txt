HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 36 year old male with a past medical history of endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug abuse resulting in tricuspid valve replacement that needed to be removed for infection.
The patient then had complete heart block requiring a pacemaker that was removed secondary to pocket infection.
Last used intravenous drugs in [**2138-11-28**], nasal heroin.
Past cardiac history:  In [**2132-5-28**], Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia endocarditis, in [**2132-9-27**], tricuspid valve vegetation, Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia; in [**2132-9-27**], septic emboli to the lungs, tricuspid valve resection, patent foramen ovale, tricuspid valve replacement, foramen ovale closure, third degree atrioventricular block, status post permanent pacemaker in [**2133-8-28**]; atrial lead placement, pacer reprogramming in [**2133-10-28**]; Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in [**2133-12-28**]; tricuspid valve prosthesis removed, atrial septal defect graft revision, epicardial pacemaker implanted; in [**2134-11-28**], pacemaker pocket was infected again; in [**2135-1-29**] heroin overdose, pacemaker removed; in [**2135-1-29**], cardia pacemaker wires were infected, removed through sternotomy.
Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Methadone 40 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous q.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Has difficulty with short-term memory, however, answers appropriately to all questions.
LABORATORY:  Values initially showed a white blood cell count of 9.7, hematocrit of 33.2, magnesium 1.8, ALT 37, AST 41, alkaline phosphatase 296, total bilirubin 1.0.
Because the patient had the episode of torsade de pointes, the patient was given a transvenous pacer and was told to keep the pacemaker at a rate of 80.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient had episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia for which he was started on Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
The patient is to have repeat permanent pacemaker placed by the Electrophysiology Service once the course of antibiotics has continued and has finished and subsequent surveillance blood cultures have been negative by the Electrophysiology Service at [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was treated with Vancomycin for the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was also on Toprol XL 50 mg p.o.
The patient had negative blood cultures after the new pacer wire was placed.
The patient also received a PICC line on the day prior to discharge for long-term antibiotics.
Transvenous pacer wire infection.
Surveillance blood cultures need to be done after the Vancomycin course is completed.
Check white blood cell count as well as Vancomycin levels as well as BUN and creatinine while the patient is in rehabilitation to make sure the patient is not having any more myelosuppression or renal toxicity from the Vancomycin or is not getting prerenal.
The patient is to be switched to amiodarone 200 once a day on [**2140-5-18**], if the patient is still at rehabilitation at that point.
