Colace  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical service and scheduled for a cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac surgery was consulted at this point and decision was made to take her to the Operating Room.
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x3 on [**2115-6-6**] with left internal mammary artery to LAD, RSVG to OM to RAPD.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSR unit in intubated condition.
She was on pressors at this point.
Over the next few days it was noted she had a marginal urine output and she was started on a dopamine infusion.
On [**2115-6-10**], she was noted to have a left pleural effusion and a left chest tube was placed.
They suspected renal hyperperfusion and ATN due to relative hypertension.
She was slowly weaned off of the dopamine.
She continued to be in flutter on postoperative day 7 and she was started on a heparin infusion.
She was hemodynamically stable, but still continued to have marginal urine output and therefore needed a Neo-Synephrine infusion to keep her blood pressure up so she could have a urine output.
She was slowly weaned off of pressors over the next three days.
Her urine output was maintained off pressors and diuretics.
She had some wound drainage at this point and required Betadine dressing changes.
She was started on blood transfusion and her heparin and Coumadin were discontinued.
She was started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and transfused packed red cells.
Her hematocrit stayed stable after this point and she was considered stable for transfer back to the regular floor on [**2115-6-22**].
