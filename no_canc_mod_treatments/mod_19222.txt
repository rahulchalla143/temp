Interpret IgM result with caution; liver disease, autoimmune and       lymphoproliferative diseases may cause false positive results.
Moderate diffuse lobular mixed inflammation composed of lymphocytes and neutrophils.
Cytomegalovirus hepatitis:  While in the MICU, the patient developed fulminant hepatic failure and was subsequently transferred to the surgical ICU and placed on the transplant list.
On biopsy, the patient was confirmed to have a CMV hepatitis and started on gancyclovir.
The patient was placed on Ursodiol for hyperbilirubinemia.
Her INR was elevated, so she was given vitamin K. On the gancyclovir treatment, the patient's liver enzymes steadily improved, however, they started to rise towards the end of her admission.
There was concern that the gancyclovir was possibly hepatotoxic and she was therefore changed to valgancyclovir for an induction period of one week post-discharge followed by a maintenence period.
Since she had liver damage, her home wellbutrin and testosterone will be held on dischare until her followup GI appointment.
The patient continued treatment with mesalamine and was not discharged on an immunomodulator.
There was concern for a transfusion related reaction (fever), so the patient was given leuko-reduced transfusions.
Nutrition: The patient was placed on TPN while in the SICU because she was intubated and had poor PO intake greater than 7 days.
On transfer to the floors, the patient was able to take POs, so TPN was discontinued.
