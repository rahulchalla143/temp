Admission Date:  [**2165-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-12-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-8-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zocor / Ciprofloxacin / Quinolones / Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors / Niacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with no stents on [**2165-12-24**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 72 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD s/p MI and CABG, DM, HTN, PVD, prostate CA, and pancytopenia currently being worked up, who was initially admitted to OSH on [**12-23**] with unstable angina.
The ostial LCx lesion was then ballooned using a 2.5mm balloon.
Of note, patient did not receive Plavix [**2-27**] pancytopenia.
Given concern for potential dissection vs. perforation, the patient did not receive heparin, and angiomax was stopped.
Plan is for overnight monitoring in the CCU with plan to return to cath lab in [**1-27**] days for PCI to ostial LCX +/- PCI to prox LAD (and relook at OM).
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: [**2149**] (RIMA- RCA, SVG- OM) - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: --> [**2154**] Stenting of PLV branch distal to RIMA touchdown --> [**2155**] Stenting of the prox/mid LAD w/ rescue of a jailed D1 branch --> [**2160**] Stenting of distal RCA after the anastamosis of a RIMA graft --> [**2163**] Stenting of origin LCX - PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: PAD Prostate ca s/p radiation Pancytopenia, bone marrow bx pending Dyslipidemia - unable to tolerate statins, not on any medicine at present GI bleed [**3-6**] r/t Plavix Kidney stones B knee replacement Rotator cuff repair Fusion of lumbar discs  Social History: Lives at home with wife.
PULSES: Right: DP 2+ Left: DP 2+  Discharge exam: Unchanged, except for as below Extremities: minimal bruising at right radial artery access site, no hematoma or bleeding  Pertinent Results: Labs: [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD WBC-2.6* RBC-3.66*# Hgb-12.2*# Hct-35.1* MCV-96 MCH-33.2* MCHC-34.7 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-80* [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Glucose-149* UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.8 Cl-105 HCO3-29 AnGap-11 [**2165-12-24**] 10:45PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.0  Procedures: -Cardiac cath ([**2165-12-24**]) -  COMMENTS: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated native three-vessel coronary artery disease, with progressive coronary disease in two native vessels.
2) The RIMA-->RCA was subselectively engaged and had no angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
3) PTCA of OM1 branch and ostial LCX, complicated by dissection at position of balloon dilatation in the OM.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 154/76 mmHg.
5) A hemoband was applied to the right radial artery puncture site, with good hemostasis.
Procedure terminated with a view to likely further procedure to relook at OM branch and possible PCI of ostial LCX or mid LAD ISR.
Now, s/p PTCA of OM and ostial LCx lesions, complicated by concern for coronary dissection vs. performation, admitted to the CCU for monitoring.
During PTCA of the OM1 artery, there was concern for dissection vs perforation and the cath was terminated early.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge and will likely have a repeat cath with PCI of the above described lesions in approximately 4 weeks.
Aspirin was increased to 325mg daily.
He is not taking Plavix because of pancytopenia.
#RHYTHM - His home metoprolol was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily because of bradycardia to the 50s.
#Diabetes - On metformin at home, which was held during this admission in the setting of cardiac cath.
He was covered with an insulin sliding scale and blood sugar remained reasonably well controlled.
#HTN - Continued imdur at home dose.
Metprolol was decreased as above, amlodipine increased to 10mg for increased antianginal benefits.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  #Pancytopenia - Plavix and heparin were held given low patelets.
#H/o kidney stones - Continued home allopurinol  #Dyslipidemia - By report, he is unable to tolerate statins in the past, none were started this admission.
#Constipation - Continued home Amitiza, also ordered for senna/colace.
#Transitional issues -Metoprolol was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily, will need this reevaluated as an outpatient -Amlodipine increased to 10mg this admission, will need BP followed-up as an outpatient -Will likely need repeat cath for PCI as no stents were placed during cath this admission -Should continue to have pancytopenia followed-up as an outpatient  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg dialy Metformin 500 mg qHS Metoprolol 50 mg daily Imdur 60 mh qAM Norvasc 5 mg qPM Allopurinol 300 mg qAM Vesicare 10 mg qPM Amitiza 24 mcg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
