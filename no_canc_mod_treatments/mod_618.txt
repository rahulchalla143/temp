HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure with the last echocardiogram prior to examination revealing an ejection fraction of 75 percent with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation, and colon carcinoma status post colectomy presenting with congestive heart failure and anemia.
Pancytopenia, this is most likely secondary to mitral valve stenosis, but the patient has undergone a bone marrow biopsy.
He was started on Epogen on [**2160-3-4**].
Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
Quinidine 324 mg p.o.
Terazosin 5 mg p.o.
Lasix 60 mg p.o.
Timolol eyedrops one, left eye b.i.d.
Metolazone 50 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 95.5, blood pressure 184/94, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 20, 97 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Chemistries, sodium 177, potassium 5.4, chloride 92, bicarbonate 29, BUN 67, creatinine 2.9, glucose 97, creatinine kinase 154, CKMB 14, troponin-T of 0.04.
The patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix initially on admission.
Initially Foley catheter was placed to monitor ins and outs and creatinine was followed very closely.
At that time his Lasix was held as his pulmonary status was stable.
This was possibly secondary to urosepsis and required large fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was once again aggressively diuresed using Lasix and prn Metolazone.
The patient will be discharged on a standing Lasix dose.
The patient was continued on aspirin and beta blocker throughout her admission.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient is on Coumadin for anticoagulation at home and a beta blocker for rate control.
Therefore his Coumadin was held to allow the INR to trend down.
His Coumadin was then restarted with goal INR ranged between 2 and 3.
He continues on beta blocker with good rate control.
This was responsive to intravenous fluids.
The patient required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2160-3-26**] for blood pressure support and diuresis consistent with congestive heart failure.
Thereupon he was started on a course of Ciprofloxacin and will complete a ten day course for his urosepsis.
However, his Lasix was now trended down and he is tolerating daily diuresis with a creatinine below his baseline.
Myeloid dysplastic syndrome - The patient is pancytopenic at baseline thought to be secondary to myeloid dysplastic syndrome, although this has not been confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy.
On admission, he was transfused three units of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit has been followed closely with a goal transfusion for hematocrit less than or equal to 28.
Rehabilitation - Physical therapy has been working extensively with the patient.
Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.
Senna one tablet p.o.
