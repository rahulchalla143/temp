75 year old female with extensive past medical history, most recently complicated by incarceration of a bowel at stoma from prior colectomy for colon cancer.
Recent admission in [**2196-1-27**], with maroon stool and found to have the incarcerated parastomal hernia and status post colectomy and ileostomy.
The patient also had a recent admit on [**2196-2-27**], with urinary tract infection and was sent to rehabilitation and then readmitted in [**2196-3-26**], with decreased p.o.
She was at rehabilitation when she started feeling nauseous for a few days.
She soon recovered respiration and pulse but remained unresponsive and arrived at the [**Hospital6 1760**] EW without a pulse.
The patient was asystolic and CPR was initiated x one minute in which the patient received Epinephrine, an amp of Atropine, an amp of Calcium Chloride, 10 units of Insulin, D50 Bicarbonate then another amp of Epinephrine, another amp of Calcium Chloride and more Bicarbonate.
The patient was then intubated for airway protection.
The patient also became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 69 and she was given four to five liters of normal saline as a fluid rehydration.
Parastomal hernia, status post emergent colectomy for incarceration.
Breast cancer, status post left lumpectomy in XRT.
Metoprolol 25 b.i.d.
Tylenol 325 to 650 prn.
Paroxetine 30 q d. 4.
Colace 100 b.i.d.
Neurontin 200 q hs.
Wellbutrin 75 q d. 9.
Seroquel 12.5 t.i.d.
The patient had an otherwise unremarkable examination with cool extremities.
She was rehydrated aggressively with normal saline and her electrolytes abnormalities self-corrected as well as her renal failure.
The patient had had 2,026 of intravenous fluid in/2,020 of urine out and only 200 of ostomy out.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75 year old female with ileostomy and multiple abdominal surgeries, depression, who is admitted with acute renal failure leading to hyperkalemia and acidosis leading to cardiac arrest.
This was improved with intravenous fluids.
The renal failure rapidly corrected with intravenous hydration and was stable throughout the remainder of the admission.
After correction of her potassium and acidosis and intravenous hydration, the patient was revived and remained stable for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Electrophysiologic - The patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation, status post her cardiac arrest that was electrically cardioverted.
She did have a troponin of 5.9 status post cardioversion that was likely the result of shock.
Pump - The patient had some mild congestive heart failure after her PEA arrest that was likely due to pump dysfunction corrected status post resumed sinus rhythm.
Regarding the Troponin, this is most likely secondary to cardiac arrest and electrocardioversion and resolved after these interventions.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition - The patient, on admission, had severe hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure that was corrected upon admission with calcium, Insulin, intravenous fluid hydration and resolution of her acute renal failure.
She also had an anion gap acidosis likely also secondary to her acute renal function and also resolve after intravenous fluid hydration and bicarbonate issued during the code.
It is likely that at the current time she does not need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for nutrition, however, this may be considered if the patient cannot eat to keep up with ostomy output in the future.
She can be currently symptomatically managed with Loperamide prn for ostomy outputs greater than 500 or 1,000 per day.
The patient should follow up with Dermatology one week after discharge for re-evaluation and for the results of the biopsy.
Hematologic - The patient hematocrit went from 38 to 25 after a large volume fluid rehydration.
She was transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in her hematocrit and this has been stable throughout her hospitalization and is now at 33.4.
intake and output should be watched carefully and she should have her ostomy output recorded.
This may change with a change in her diet at the rehabilitation.
Loperamide prn ostomy output between 500 and 1,000 cc per day.
Neutra-Phos one packet t.i.d.
to open bullae on right arm with dry dressings.
Multi-vitamin 1 p.o.
Bupropion 150 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Paroxetine 30 mg p.o.
Magnesium Oxide 500 mg p.o.
The patient can be restarted on her Avandia 8 mg p.o.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with her Primary Care Doctor in one to two weeks and with Dermatology at [**Hospital6 1760**] within one week for removal of her stitches from her biopsy and follow up of her right arm ecchymotic and bullous areas.
