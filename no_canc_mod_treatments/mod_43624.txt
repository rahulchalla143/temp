Urology was consulted and recommended IR placement of L percutaneous nephrostomy tube, which was performed by IR on the night of admission without complications.
With placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tube and IV fluids, the patient's creatinine improved to 3.0 on discharge.
Nephrology was consulted for his RTA and recommended bicarb therapy which improved the patient's bicarb to 19 prior to discharge.
He was not restarted on an ACEi.
At approximately 11:10 AM, he complained of a constant, minute-long, non-radiating substernal chest pain but was unable to specify quality or severity.
One 81 mg chewable aspirin was given.
Ultimately, the patient received 2 g CaGlu, 10 u regular insulin x 2, 30 g of kayexalate x 2 and 40mg of Lasix IV with 1L NS.
THR [**1-/2098**], bilateral total hip replacements, the right in [**2071**] or [**2072**] at [**Hospital1 18**], the left in [**2080**] at [**Hospital1 18**].

There has been interval placement of a left-sided nephrostomy tube.
The urinary bladder is decompressed about a Foley catheter.
Interval placement of a left-sided nephrostomy tube with interval improvement in previously noted hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with a h/o nephrolithiasis, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, angina, and BPH p/w diaphoresis nausea and chest pain.
Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to atenolol toxicity and atenolol was held and his bradycardia improved to the 60s by discharge.
# Hyperkalemia: Initial hyperkalemia to 6.8 in ED in the setting of worsening renal function(creatinine 3.3 on admission) and was treated in the ED with 2 g CaGlu, 10 u regular insulin x 2, 30 g of kayexalate x 2 and 40mg of furosemide IV with 1L NS.
THis continued to be stable and was thought to have been a result of the combination of atenolol toxicity and renal failure.
ECG showed sinus bradycardia and this was felt to be atenolol toxicity and not due to hyperkalemia.
# Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname **] initially presented with vertigo, diaphoresis and chest pain in the context of bradycardia to 40-48 and was admitted to the MICU for management of hyperkalemia (which improved after treatment) and bradycardia which improved following stopping atenolol.
His initial ECGs showed appearances which appeared to alternate between what was thought to be a slow AF to what resembled a Mobitz 2 with 2:1 block and was latterly seen to be Sinus rhythm with bigeminal PACs and first degree AV block, PR interval= 230 ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] had a negative MI workup with negative cardiac enzymes x3.
Atenolol is a renally cleared beta blocker which was felt likely to have accumulated to high levels given the patient's poor renal clearance of the drug in the setting of acute kidney injury.
The plan was therefore to continue to hold all beta blockers for now and use non renally excreted beta blockers in the future such as metoprolol if clinically indicated.
# Renal Insufficiency: The patient has nephrolithiasis and is s/p left nephrostomy for hydronephrosis.
Creatinien was 3.3 on anmission and had hyperkalemia as described above with a K 6.8.
His medications were renally dosed and his creatinine improved following treatment of teh hyperkalemis and stoping atenolol.
His isosorbide mononitrate was held due to low BP and should be restarted in the community by his PCP.

You received treatment which successfully lowered your potassium level.
