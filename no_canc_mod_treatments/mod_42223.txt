The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2145**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to PDA, to PLV for a nonintervenable lesion of the PDA.
He was admitted for catheterization initially to the CMI Service.
He had CPR for two minutes and was started on dopamine transiently for low blood pressure and regained normal sinus rhythm.
He was given epinephrine and Atropine and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed temporarily and transvenous pacing wires were used temporarily and removed after catheterization.
Chemistries revealed a sodium of 145, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 100, INR 1.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent stenting of serial 80% lesions between the RPDA and RPL anastomoses.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for 24 hours.
During the catheterization, after the wire was passed over the 80% lesions in the RCA, the patient underwent asystolic arrest, had CPR initiated for two minutes, regained normal sinus rhythm after being given epinephrine and Atropine.
The patient had transvenous pacing wires placed which were removed after his catheterization.
His pain was controlled with a nitroglycerin drip and Dilaudid p.r.n.
He was continued on a beta blocker which was titrated up, aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization, and heparin until his sheath was pulled.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient was transiently hypotensive during catheterization and was placed on dopamine temporarily which was discontinued after the patient left the catheterization laboratory.
He had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed for 24 hours after catheterization to improve his coronary perfusion.
He was easily taken off the balloon pump the next day.
HEMATURIA:  The patient was with gross hematuria after catheterization, likely secondary to combination of Bivalirudin, Integrilin, Plavix, and aspirin during his catheterization.
Possible Foley trauma.
He was started on continuous bladder irrigation for 24 hours.
After his Integrilin was discontinued, his hematuria resolved over the next day and his catheter was pulled after his urine drained clear.
His Lopressor was titrated up and he will be discharged on 150 mg of Toprol XL a day.
He was not initiated on an ACE inhibitor but may benefit from treatment with Ramipril per his outpatient cardiologist.
SUPERFICIAL THROMBOPHLEBITIS:  On the patient's third hospital day, he was noted to have swelling and tenderness over his left dorsum of his hand associated with a peripheral IV site.
He was started on vancomycin for 24 hours which was then switched to oxacillin 2 grams IV q. eight hours for two days and he was discharged home on dicloxacillin for one week.
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA:  He was started on Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
He was maintained on a sliding scale insulin in the hospital and the patient's fingersticks were noted to be consistently in the 120-200 range and he will likely need additional treatment initiated as an outpatient.
GROIN RASH:  On the patient's fourth hospital day, he was noted to have an itchy erythematous groin rash in his intertriginous areas.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged home with home services for medication teaching.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one p.o.
Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
Clotrimazole 1% cream one application b.i.d.
Dicloxacillin 250 mg p.o.
Toprol XL 150 mg p.o.
