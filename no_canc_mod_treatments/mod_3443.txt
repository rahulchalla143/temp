Admission Date:  [**2148-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Talwin / Demerol / Valium / Aspirin / Oxycodone/Aspirin / Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Aortic valvuloplasty   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old woman with history of aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 in [**12-19**]), CHF (diastolic- EF 60%), AF on coumadin, COPD, and RA/SLE who presented to cardiology clinic today with progressive SOB.
She was hospitalized in [**2147-12-12**] and went to rehab, at which time she was put on home oxygen - 3L - and spiriva and advair were added to regimen.
Past Medical History: # Aortic stenosis - valve area area 0.8-1.0cm2 [**12-19**] # CHF (diastolic - EF of 60%) # Atrial fibrillation - on warfarin # Rheumatoid arthritis - on prednisone # s/p femur fx [**8-16**] # s/p femur nail [**12-19**] # s/p R hip replacement [**2142**] # s/p right shoulder replacement date unknown # s/p R BKA [**2144-10-28**] # RA/SLE/positive [**Doctor First Name **] antibody - on chronic prednisone # COPD # osteoporosis # venous stasis # peripheral neuropathy # h/o Clostridium difficile in the past # spinal stenosis # SBO # PVD s/p Left AT angioplasty [**4-18**]   Social History: Patient lives at home with 24 hr aide 5 days a week with children rotating over weekends.
Following three inflations of a 20 mm Tyshak baloon during rapid right ventricular pacing, the mean pressure gradient diminished to 25 mmHg with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.88 cm2.
# Leukocytosis/Pneumonia- Had baseline leukocytosis of 12 to 13 during hospitalization.
Vancomycin and Cefepime was renally dosed and in the absence of signs of significant infection and with a downtrending WBC count, she was changed to oral cefpodoxime and levofloxacin on [**2148-8-7**] to complete an 8 day course of antibiotics.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation- Patient has known history of diastolic CHF with EF of 60% on echo in [**Month (only) **] [**2147**].
She was initialy diuresed with IV furosemide and then a furosemide infusion and her volume status improved.
She was switched to PO lasix and maintained stable weights.
She was given a low salt diet and fluid restricted to 1500 mL, with strict monitoring of her weights and Is/Os.
Her home Toprol XL was converted to metoprolol tartrate and was uptitrated to 100 mg PO BID.
Following aortic valvuloplasty, she required further furosemide whilst her renal function was cautiously monitored.
She then showed signs of volume overload with worsening dyspnea and required gentle diuresis with lasix.
She was transitioned to her home dose of lasix (40 mg PO qAM; 80 mg PO qPM) and remained euvolemic.
Hypotension- Patient became hypotensive and oliguric with lasix diuresis and was transferred to the CCU.
She was felt to be overdiuresed and was bolused with fluid; beta blocker was held.
She was started on empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime and blood cultures were sent which ultimately returned negative.
She also received stress dose steroids as there was some thought that she might have adrenal insufficiency with her chronic steroids.
The stress dose steroids were discontinued and she was put back on her home regimen.
She under went aortic valvuloplasty with 3 balloon inflations and after the procedure her mean gradient had improved to 24.5 mmHg and her aortic valve was appx 0.88 cm2.
The procedure was without complications.
Patient was on coumadin for anticoagulation at home.
During hospitalization, coumadin was held and she was kept on heparin in anticipation of her cardiac catheterization.
She was restarted on coumadin on [**8-5**] on her home dose and became supratherapeutic.
Coumadin was held once more and was 2.4 on discharge.
She was discharged with instructions to stop taking her coumadin and take plavix 75 daily as she has an aspirin allergy until she follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
On day of discharge, her HR was in the 90s despite being on metoprolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]- this may be secondary to her use of albuterol nebulizer treatments.
We instructed the patient to limit her use of these treatments to 1-2 times per day.
We did not further uptitrate her beta blocker, but would consider perhaps adding on a calcium channel blocker in the outpatient setting should her pressures tolerate it.
COPD- Patient has a history of COPD and has been on 3L home oxygen and standing advair and spiriva since [**Month (only) 956**].
We therefore continued her home spiriva and in addition she received regular albuterol and ipratropium nebulisers at q4 intervals.
She was maintained on oxygen 3L via nasal cannulae, with goal sats in the mid 90s.
Following 2 days of stress dose methylprednisolone, she was continued on her home prednisone 10mg daily.
She was discharged with ipratroprium and albuterol nebulizer treatments and her home tiotroprium.
Leukocytosis/Pneumonia- Patient had baseline leukocytosis of 12 to 13 on admission which was attributed to her home steroid use.
CXR was concerning for a possible RLL pneumonia or atelectasis, she was commenced on IV cefepime and vancomycin on [**8-3**] as per the HAP policy.
She remained afebrile and antibiotics were changed to oral levofloxacin and cefpodoxime on [**8-7**] to complete an 8 day course.
Vancomycin was dropped as MRSA pneumonia was believed unlikely in the setting of her clinical presentation.
Continued on her home prednisone 10 mg daily with 2 days of stress dose IV methylprednisolone and was changed back to her home regimen on resolution of her hypotension.
Patient was continued on her home calcium and vitamin D. .
