INDICATION: Status post bypass surgery.
Status post sternotomy is noted and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the anterior left side of mediastinum is compatible with preceding bypass surgery.

He remained unstable following surgery and was kept sedated, the night of surgery he had a VT arrest and returned to NSR after defibrillation.
He was started on an amiodarone gtt.
He remained intubated with IABP in place, and he was started on milrinone.
His echo the following day was improved and his IABP was weaned and removed.
Chest tubes were removed on POD # 2 and pacing wires on POD #3.
