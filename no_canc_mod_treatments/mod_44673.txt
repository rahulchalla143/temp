He continued to get hemodialysis 3x a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He was continued on enalapril 10 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was additionally treated with amlodipine 5 mg po q day.
At the time of this dictation, his blood pressure is still slightly elevated and he may require additional enalapril and amlodipine doses.
The patient's hemodialysis is uneventful and he is tolerating the procedure reasonably well.
However, these crackles were inconsistent and would usually decrease after hemodialysis and thus were attributed to fluid overload.
Anemia:  The patient had iron studies in the MICU consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
They advised continuation of the ACE inhibitor with the hope for resolution of renal failure and possible discontinuation of dialysis at some point in the future.
His prednisone was eventually tapered off and discontinued on [**9-26**].
The data and the literature indicates that steroids could trigger renal crisis and potentially worsen this patient's renal failure.
Hypertension:  As mentioned above, the patient has some effect on enalapril and amlodipine, and the doses may be increased by the time the patient is discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
He was treated with Neurontin 300 mg po q4-8 and Capsaicin for the hyperesthesia that he feels on his right foot.
He also is treated with oxycodone 10 mg q4-6 hours for pain relief.
There was some suggestion that a nerve biopsy may be helpful in demonstrating whether this patient has vasculopathy, related neuropathy, and whether steroids would be indicated.
At this time the team has decided to avoid the steroids if at all possible and continue treatment with the Neurontin, Capsaicin, and oxycodone.
Thrombocytopenia:  This was due to exposure to Heparin and the patient was found to have positive Heparin platelet Factor IV antibodies.
He is no longer receiving any Heparin of any kind either on the floor or in dialysis.
A second rash was noted after taking captopril in the MICU and now a third rash has been noted after transfer to the floor.
He was placed on ampicillin for this treatment.
Various possibilities were put forth such as adrenal insufficiency, collagen vascular disease, hypersensitivity to medication and finally, but least likely a helminthic infection.
Endocrine:  The patient was discontinued off his prednisone on [**9-26**] and has been doing well.
