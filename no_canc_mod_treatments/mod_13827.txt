It was multifactorial from hypercarbia, recent increase in morphine SR dose to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] and increase in cymbalta dose by PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 58875**]/ARF, tylenol PM intake prior to admission.Advised to void non prescription sedating meds unless suggested by MD.
Morphine dose decreased as below.
Lasix and lisinopril were held.
Lisinopril restarted eventually.
Likely hypercarbic at baseline from COPD, severe pulm HTN: - continued spiriva, albuterol, advair, Outpt sleep / pulmonary follow-up is recommended - Pt may benefit from pulmonary rehab  # Constipation - resolved with aggressive bowel regimen.
# Hypertension: Amlodipine added; metoprolol continued.
# Anxiety/depression: cymbalta, trazodone continued - Discussed with daughter, patient was taking ativan but per PCP recommendations ativan was being weaned off.
Benzodiazepine withdrawal could be a potential reason for high BP.
Low dose ativan was suggested if BP is high and there is a concern of benzo withdrawal.
# Chronic pain: morphine SR at lower dose continued.
# Code status: discussed with pt, would like aggressive measures, but if not reversible, would like to have aggressive care removed; encouraged to discuss with daughter, [**Name (NI) 14880**]  # Contact: daughter [**Name (NI) 14880**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 58876**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 58877**]  Medications on Admission: Duloxetine 20mg b.i.d.
