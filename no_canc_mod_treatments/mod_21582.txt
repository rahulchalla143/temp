Follow-up study after clinical treatment is recommended to demonstrate complete resolution.
The plan initially was for large volume paracentesis, however he was found to be in acute renal failure as well (see below), therefore he was given albumin and a diagnostic paracentesis was performed instead.
His diuretics (lasix and aldactone) were held given his acute renal failure, and he unfortunately subsequently experienced steady accumulation of peripheral edema and ascites.
His renal failure persisted despite holding lasix, and he was eventually transferred to the SICU for initiation of CVVHD and removal of fluid with lasix drip under a more controlled setting.
In the SICU he had a therapeutic paracentesis and received CVVHD with massive improvement in his edema and ascites.
It was decided to try bumex rather than lasix, and continue aldactone.
We continued his lactulose and urosdiol.
He was discharged on 1 mg Bumex daily, and 50 mg spironolatone [**Hospital1 **], as well as cipro 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] for SBP prophylaxis, and lactulose.
Initially it was thought to be pre-renal from his liver disease and aggressive outpatient diuresis, however his creatinine did not improve with holding diuretics and giving albumin.
Given that hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however, he was started on midodrine and octreotide.
He was started on levaquin and flagyl, which were changed to vancomycin and zosyn on transfer to the SICU.
He completed 10 days of vanco/zosyn, as well as azithromycin for atypical coverage, and his oxygenation improved to baseline (98% on RA).
He was discharged on cefpodoxime for 3 days (to complete a total antibiotic course of 14 days).
He was maintained on a low Na diet.
