She had a Urinalysis that was positive for infection, so she was started on Cipro IV for a urinary tract infection and Flagyl IV for presumed CDiff.
She was also started on IV fluids at 100 cc/h, as she has a history of CHF with EF <35%.
Past Medical History:  CAD CHF (EF 35%) Pulmonary HTN Mitral regurgitation HTN CDiff DM2 Chronic LBP Hypothyroidism   Social History: The patient currently lives at [**Location (un) 25576**].
There are also inverted T waves in leads V2-V4 of uncertain significance.
RUE ultrasound: superficial phlebitis (per radiologist- report pending)    Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 85 yo woman with history of CHF, hypothyroidism, and DM2, who presented with Acute renal failure, digoxin toxicity, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute diarrhea.
She was given one dose of Digibind at the OSH (given hyperkalemia and bradycardia), and her Digoxin level upon arrival to our ED at [**Hospital1 18**] was 1.5.
She should likely continue to avoid this medication in the future.
Her creatinine improved to 0.6 after IV fluids.
She was started on Cipro for UTI.
Ms. [**Known lastname 10792**] was hospitalized approximately one month ago and was C Diff positive at that admission, so she was continued on po vanc and flagyl empirically.
Her vancomycin was eventually stopped and she was kept on PO flagyl.
Stool studdies for cyclospora, microsporidium, cryptosporidium, and giardia were all negative.
The etiology of the diarrhea is unclear, and could be viral or bacterial as well as medication side effects (the pt reportedly recently started levothyroxine and duloxetine), but since the pt was already taking ciprofloxacin for her pseudomonas UTI it was thought that she should have her course extended from 5 to 7 days to also treat bacterial gastroenteritis.
She initially had a flexiseal rectal tube in place, but this was taken out.
These medications were held in the setting of dig toxicity, hypotension, volume depletion, and acute kidney injury.
She was restarted on her metoprolol, but this medication can be switched to the equivalent dose of long acting metoprolol XL as this medication has been shown to be more effective in CHF patients than the short acting.
Her lisinopril was also restarted after her kidney function improved.
Her lasix can be restarted as an outpatient, but her volume status should be followed carefully if she develops recurrent diarrhea or other volume losses.
The original indication for the placement of her pacemaker is unknown.
This is not considered an upper extremity DVT and should be treated with warm compresses and elevation.
We would recommend not treating with NSAIDs at this time due to  her recent upset stomach, but this may be considered if the condition worsens.
# Nausea: The day of admission, Ms [**Known lastname 10792**] complained of nausea, which she had not complained about before.
# DM2: She has a history of DM2 and takes Glipizide and RISS at home.
