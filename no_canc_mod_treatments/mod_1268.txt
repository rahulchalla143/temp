She initially presented with complaints of headache, anorexia, shortness of breath, and fevers.
She was found to have adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring paralytics persistent hypotension requiring pressors on several occasions; reportedly responsive to steroids.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals and developed acute renal failure secondary to amphotericin.
She required an insulin drip for glucose control.
She was eventually weaned mostly from ventilator but did require a tracheostomy.
She had episodes of pulmonary edema but related to volume resuscitation and tachycardia.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy tube was placed for nutrition.
Intravenous phenylephrine was started at [**Last Name (un) 9301**] but apparently turned off for the ambulance ride.
Herpes simplex virus infection found on bronchoscopy on [**11-10**].

Leucovorin 10 mg once daily.
Ceftazidime 2 g once daily.
Amphotericin lipid complex 300 mg once daily.
Phenytoin 200 mg three times daily.
Pyrimethamine 50 mg once daily.
Levothyroxine 100 mg once daily.
Sertraline 75 mg once daily.
NPH insulin 30 units subcutaneously q.a.m.
Zolpidem 5 mg as needed.
Ativan as needed.
Morphine sulfate as needed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature was 101.1 axillary, heart rate was 115, blood pressure was 134/93 in intravenous phenylephrine drip, respiratory rate was 24 on pressor support ventilation 15 cm of water plus continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water, FIO2 of 1; oxygen saturation was 100% on these settings, intravenous pressure was 12.
Abdomen with a few bowel sounds, softly distended, tympanitic, jejunostomy tube in place with no apparent tenderness.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed increased air space disease with persistent interstitial disease, right internal jugular catheter and right peripherally inserted catheter in place.
Tracheostomy in good position.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at 27, with a long P-R interval.
She received supportive care with blood, urine, and [**Month (only) **] cultures.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued and stress-dose steroids were given for relative adrenal insufficiency.
Pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis history and [**Month (only) **] for her herpes simplex virus infection were continued.
Dilantin was reloaded for a low level.
Vancomycin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, and ampicillin were continued.
The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation easily and responded to furosemide for diuresis.
They agreed with workup in progress and recommended re-evaluating neurologic examination over several days to evaluate for prognosis.
While ventilation was easy, the patient required neuromuscular paralysis because she was continually biting her tongue.
After an oral airway was placed, it was possible to discontinue paralysis, and the patient remained comfortable on pressor support ventilation.
It was noted that lumbar puncture had been attempted the week prior with no success, and this procedure was not again repeated after this attempt.
Pressor support was decreased to a certain extent, but the patient was unable to become independent of the ventilator.
She continued to receive occasional lorazepam for increased agitation.
On [**11-28**], it was felt that the patient was likely to remain in a persistent vegetative state, and the possibility of withdrawal of life support was discussed with the family on [**11-29**].
Her husband was [**Name (NI) 653**] by the pulmonary fellow (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9303**]) and informed that the patient had a lethal blood infection which could only be treated by changing her central intravenous access.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family were continually informed that the medical team did not feel that further medical intervention would improve Ms. [**Known lastname 9302**] prognosis or comfort, but for several days the family remainder uncomfortable with withdrawing life support.
At this time, all parties agreed to respect [**Known firstname 9300**]'s prior wishes to not continue aggressive interventions.
On that day, [**Known firstname 9300**]'s care was changed to focus on comfort; however, the family felt that [**Known firstname 9300**] was comfortable on ventilator support and wished this to be continued.
All intravenous medications, fluids, and laboratory draws were otherwise discontinued; including intravenous phenylephrine.
Morphine was ordered to administered as needed for discomfort; however, the family did not want prophylactic continuous morphine infusion.
The patient was continued with ventilatory support and as needed morphine sulfate until [**12-5**].
