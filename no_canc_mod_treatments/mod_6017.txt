Multiple rib fractures and transverse processes fractures on the right as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 59 yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2161**], DM, htn, CRI with baseline scr in the 2's who was taken to [**Hospital1 5979**] Hosp [**4-21**] after he was involved in a MVA.
SOB: On [**4-24**] the pt became acutely SOB when returning from IR suite where he had a HD catheter place.
His symptoms improved s/p HD and diuresis (received lasix 20 mg, then 40 mg, in acute setting of SOB).
He had a trialysis catheter placed in R SC on [**4-24**] and HD was initiated after that.
He ended up needing 2 sessions of dilaysis for fluid overload after which his creatinine trended back to baseline.
CAD: s/p CABG in [**2161**]; His SOB was most likely [**1-1**] to volume overload but could also have been [**1-1**] to CAD and ACS.
Pt's cks were elevated early on and troponin continued to trend up during his stay with a peak of 1.28 on the day of discharge.
He had anterolateral ST depressions/TWI on his EKG at admission and a ?new anterior hypokinesis on echo.
He was medically managed with ASA, statin and a BB.
DM: Pt has type one DM and was on insulin pump at home.
He was monitored closely on an insulin gtt in the MICU.
He has an insulin pump at home, but this was not working properly, so he was given standing insulin and a humalog SS on the floor and followed by [**Last Name (un) **].
He was not well regulated with lantus/humalog and he was switched to U500 standing dose with humalog and his sugars became better controlled.
His wife obtained a new insulin pump and he was restarted on his home pump levels.
Hypercholesterolema: He was continued on a statin but his tricor was held [**1-1**] renal failure.
Cholesterol levels were checked and his statin was increased to 40mg.
His statin was decreased back to his home dose of 20mg.
He was on the trauma surgery service initially, but no surgery was done and he was transferred to the MICU after his SOB.
His pain was controlled with RTC tylenol and oxycodone.
He will follow up with trauma surgery as an outpatient.
