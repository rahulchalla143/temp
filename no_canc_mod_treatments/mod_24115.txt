- CXR ([**2171-6-13**]): Endotracheal tube has been removed.
Nasogastric tube remains in place, terminating below the diaphragm.
- Echocardiogram ([**2171-6-11**]): This is an echo contrast study.
The nasogastric tube terminates in theproximal stomach with side port located just proximal to the expected locationof the GE junction.
Infectious work up was unrevealing but she was initially placed on vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin and acyclovir given limited information and concern for sepsis from HCAP, atypical PNA, and meningitis/encephalitis.
She was subsequently switched to levofloxacin and Flagyl for Gram negatives/atypicals as well as possible aspiration PNA.
These antibiotics were discontinued after 4 days because of low likelihood of PNA in the absence of fever and leukocytosis.
Neurology service was involved throughout and recommended anticoagulation with Coumadin for 3-6 months for primary stroke prevention after danger period for hemorrhagic conversion passed (7-10 days).
Patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin was started on [**2171-6-20**].
She is on a heparin drip bridge to therapeutic coumadin.
INR should be rechecked daily and heparin can be disontinued when INR is [**1-31**].
Ongoing INR monitoring and coumadin dose changes will be required.
She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and treated with O2 supplement support through the ventilator.
As more data results returned, she was switched off of antibiotics and started on lasix gtt, which was transitioned to IV Lasix.
She was ultimately transitioned to standing oral lasix with good effect.
The patient was maintained on a heparin drip as described above.
She should continue on coumadin for a a minimum of [**3-3**] months.
The patient was started on optimal medical therapy with aspirin, beta-blocker, ACEi and statin therpay as well as standing lasix.
Depression/bipolar disorder: Outpatient regimen included Clozapine, Klonopin, Lamictal, Effexor, Paliperidone, and Propranolol.
At the recommendation of the psychiatry service, she was restarted on Lamictal 25 mg x 2 weeks.
Paliperidone was changed to risperidone as paliperidone could not be given through the PEG tube.
Clozaril was discontinued due to the high risk of severe side effects.
Leukocytosis: Persistent leukocytosis, initially thought to be most likely pulmonary infection and patient treated with levofloxacin for CAP.
CSF, blood, BAL, respiratory viral cultures, and C. diff toxin were all negative.
Moderate malnutrition- Patient failed speech and swallow on several occasions, and so, in discussion with her family, the decision was made to proceed with PEG placement.
She was started on tube feeds, which she tolerated well.
The patient has intermittent moderate agitation, pulling at tube and lines.
She pulled her PEG tube out multiple times.
With the use of a single mitt on the left hand, the PEG tube was kept safely in place.
She continues on her psych medications as described with a plan for uptitratitration.
