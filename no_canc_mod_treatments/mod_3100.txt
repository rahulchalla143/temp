Admission Date:  [**2146-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Lasix / Diltiazem / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: respiratory failure bradycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation, extubation Bronchoscopy, with Y-stent placement  History of Present Illness: This is an 83 yo female with a past medical history of COPD, HTN, CHF who p/w resp distress from home.
She responded promptly to SL nitroglycerin and BiPap and experienced no further dyspnea and was discharged to home on [**6-8**].
Her medications were adjusted during this admission to continue nifedipine, but to exchange diltiazem for verapamil, and per the patient's daughter, she obtained several doses of verapamil until she could fill the new prescriptions (she was NOT sent home with these doses, which was confirmed with the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 nursing staff).
The patient arrived home from the hospital after 6pm and received 3 medications she had at home, it is unclear if the diltiazem was one of these medications.
She was intubated for resp distress in the field and was given atropine for HR in 30s (unclear if for hypotension).
Upon reaching ED- SBP in 90s and she was satting well on the vent.
She received an additional dose of atropine for HR in the 20's prior to transfer to the MICU.
Asthma/COPD -  Recently admitted for a flare on [**2146-3-29**] and treated with nebulizers, steroids, and a course of azithromycin.
Paralyzed left hemidiaphragm s/p pericardial window procedure 3.
Although Ms. B is able to complete most of her ADL's, she relies on her daughter for shopping and cooking.
Her daughter had the flu prior to Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**]' hospitalization, and because of this, she was unable to pick up her medications on time.
CNII-XII in tact.
SKIN: Cool and dry.
Endotracheal tube malpositioned in the right mainstem bronchus.
The tube should be pulled back at least 2.5 cm for more optimal placement.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F with asthma, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath at home hours after discharge from hospital found to be in a junctional bradycardia and hypertensive.
She has a long history of COPD exacerbations and acute diastolic heart failure associated with refractory hypertension.
She was still on a prednisone taper from her recent admission.
Her presentation was not consistent with ARDS and her initial ABG on the ventilator shows mild compensated hypercapnea without hypoxia.
Her nodal agents were held, and she was treated with a nitro gtt for her HTN, as well as nebs and stress dose steroids, and she was extubated later on the first day of her hospital course.
Blood pressure medications, including clonidine, enalapril, and nifedipine were titrated.
Bronchoscopy on [**2146-6-17**] confirmed tracheobronchomalacia, which had been suspected, and a Y stent was placed.
Additional diuresis with lasix resulted in further improvement in respiratory function.
Pt is being discharged on a slow prednisone taper, and she should continue on prednisone 10mg until her pulmonary followup appointment on [**7-14**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].
She should also continue on her usual nebs and inhalers, and on guaifenesin for stent maintenance.
The most likely etiology of this rhythm was recieving her doses of verapamil during the day in the hospital and then taking verapamil and a dose of her diltiazem in error after arriving at home (a medication she was supposed to stop).
She received atropine x 2 (once in the field and once in the ED).
It was thought to be unusual, however, for CCB toxicity to result in HTN.
She received the appropriate treatment for CCB toxicity regardless, including calcium gluconate and glucagon in the ED.
All nodal agents were held and this rhythm resolved.
Based on [**Name (NI) **], pt baseline BP 170-190 (with goal of treatment in the past being SBP 160).
She is off CCB now given prior junctional bradycardia.
Currently she has had stable but suboptimally controlled BP on clonidine patches, ACE inhibitor, and nifedipine.
Later she tolerated lasix diuresis well and she is currently again well-compensated in terms of her CHF.
# Hyponatremia: Likely this was due to diuresis with Diuril.
However, since hyponatremia corrected when diuril was stopped, and since pt had been on Tegretol for some time prior for trigeminal neuralgia, Tegretol was resumed prior to discharge.
No BB (both due to COPD and with junctional rhythm as described above).
Continued iron supplement.
# Trigeminal Neuralgia:  Initially held Tegretol given concern for hyponatremia (see above), but this was resumed prior to discharge.
Suggested Debrox drops for a few days to soften, and irrigation can be attempted at that point if cerumen is still present.
