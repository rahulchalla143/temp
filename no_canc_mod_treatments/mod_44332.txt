She was continued on IV vancomycin for a total of 10 days.
The patient was discharged with dressing in place with plan for split thickness graft in likely four weeks.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of plastic surgery for this issue.
She continued to exhibit poor urine output, thus a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed.
Her urine output ultimately recovered and her hemodialysis catheter was accidentally self discontinued on [**2125-6-22**].
She required no further hemodialysis beyond that date and thus the dialysis catheter was not replaced.
She was, nevertheless, empirically treated on Flagyl and a C. diff toxin B was sent.
She continued to have diarrhea on Flagyl and this was converted to p.o.
The patient's diarrhea was significantly improved on a BRAT diet and she will follow up with her primary care physician to arrange gastrointestinal follow up for esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for celiac sprue.
Reactive airway disease: The patient was continued on her albuterol, Atrovent, Salmeterol and Flovent.
The patient was temporarily covered with levoflagyl empirically.
Her left subclavian was discontinued on [**2125-6-21**].
Her hemodialysis catheter as stated above was accidentally discontinued on [**2125-6-22**].
The dressing was removed and this was thought not to be a source of infection and an abdominal series was obtained and ruled out evidence of perforation or abscess and a CMV viral load was found to be negative.
All antibiotics were discontinued and the patient showed some improvement in her rash and she was thought to be stable for discharge on [**2125-6-25**] with close follow up by her primary care doctors.
