She was then taken to the operating room later that day by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] ___________________________ of Invasive Pulmonology and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy.
He evacuated the airways of 600 cc of blood and placed a bronchial blocker down the right main stem bronchus and inflated it.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] of Thoracic Surgery was then consulted.
We elected to temporize this situation by performing a medial sternotomy and placement of a mediastinal drainage adjacent to the tracheal tear and placing a double-lumen to isolate the right lung from the ________________ circuit.
This was successfully embolized due to desaturations and in the radiology suite she was placed on double lung ventilation and subsequently developed massive mediastinal air and high fevers.
She was therefore taken to the emergency department by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] to the operating room where she underwent a small right thoracotomy with repair of the tracheal tear.
After several days of intubation in the Intensive Care Unit she was finally extubated when her sepsis cleared and was eventually discharged in good condition on [**2146-6-7**].
