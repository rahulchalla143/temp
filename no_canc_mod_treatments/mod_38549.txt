At OSH, she was gently hydrated with normal saline and her diuretics were discontinued.
Her Rifaximin was initially discontinued given concern it was causing her pruritis but then resumed.
The patient was treated with Vitamin K subcutaneously without much improvement in her INR (1.9-2.5).
She was resumed on her spironolactone by time of discharge without drops in her serum sodium.
The patient was noted to have mild facial asymmetry on [**2151-4-11**] and then swallowing dyskinesia [**2151-4-13**].
Thus, the patient was made NPO except for medications in applesauce and started on maintainance fluids.
NGT was not placed given concern for esophageal varices.
ROS: Positive per HPI; patient unable to answer rest of ROS   Past Medical History: * Hypertension * Hyperlipidemia * Hypothyroidism * Anemia * GERD * Diastolic CHF * Depression/anxiety * Chronic kidney disease (baseline 1.5) * Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites/lower extremity edema and varices (diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**], no biopsy done, reportedly negative hepatitis serologies), has been on low protein/low sodium diet since [**2150**] and diuretics have been standing since then).
Independent in her ADLs, semi-independent in her IADLs.
Family History: Father with alcohol abuse/cirrhosis and died at an early age.
NGT in place, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR with II/VI systolic ejection murmur LUNGS: CTA b/l with no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.

Floor course: # Altered Mental Status: Originally the differential diagnosis included hepatic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis, CVA, hyponatremia, steroid induced psychosis, and hospital induced/ICU delirium.
Central pontine myelinolysis was initially thought to be a possibility given her peculiar tongue movements, but there was no clear evidence of rapid sodium rise and no evidence on head CT. MRI was limited by motion and neither ruled in or ruled out such a finding.
Lactulose was started at 30mL q2h with copious stool production (~10 BM/day) which did nothing to clear her mental status over her first 3 days of admission.
Has been on diuretics since ~1 year ago (presumably for ascites).
Upon the third day of her hospital stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **]' sodium was found to be 152 likely secondary to copious stool production in the setting of lactulose administration.
# Asthma: Ms. [**Known lastname **]' initial reason for admission to the OSH was shortness of breath which has been treated with steroids and albuterol.
She is currently without respiratory distress on room air, and no focal infiltrates on exam or CXR, until her fourth day of admission, when she became hypoxic with SpO2 85% on RA.
Due to concern for fluid overload and wet appearance on CXR, lasix was started.
ICU course: Patient was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring urgent intubation and mechanical ventillation.
There was concern that she developed septic shock initially thought to be due to a pneumonia and she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Urine output diminished and O2 saturation remained poor despite maximal ventillation settings.
Family expressed that patient would not want to undergo prolonged intubation and that continued invasive measures.
Patient remained intubated and on maximal support until all of her family could be at her bedside.
Medications on Admission: lactulose, atenolol, mvi, spironolactone, synthroid, rifampin, prilosec, vitamin d, lasix, albuterol, zofran  Discharge Medications: Based on recurring family meetings and once all family members were present, patient was made CMO and expired.
