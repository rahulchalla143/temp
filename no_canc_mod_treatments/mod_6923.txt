He also has 3+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation and had pacemaker placement in [**2101-12-7**] for marked AV conduction delay.
He has had several admissions for congestive heart failure between [**12/2101**] and [**6-6**] and did reasonably well for approximately 6-8 weeks in regimen of Hydralazine and diuretics.
He had a sleep study which revealed obstructive sleep apnea and therefore was started on C-PAP approximately two weeks prior to admission but did not tolerate it well.
The patient was started on Heparin and received one dose of Coumadin.
Now he has been transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for transesophageal echo and plan for cardioversion biventricular pacing.
In [**2101-10-7**] he had a DDD pacemaker placed for AV synchrony.
He had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2093**], history of anemia, combined iron deficiency and chronic disease and he is status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Reglan 10 mg q d, Heparin 1,000 units per hour, Iron Sulfate 325 mg q d, Ambien 5 mg q d, Probenecid 250 mg [**Hospital1 **], Vitamin E 400 IV q d, K-Dur 40 mEq q d, Spironolactone 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], Zaroxolyn 5 mg [**Hospital1 **], Hydralazine 50 mg tid, Imdur 60 mg q h.s., Digoxin 0.125 mg q d, Carvedilol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Colchicine 0.6 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lescol 30 mg q d, Protonix 20 mg q d and Mag Oxide 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He had a transesophageal echocardiogram and subsequent unsuccessful cardioversion, was started on Amiodarone with plan to reattempt cardioversion in [**5-12**] weeks.
The decision was made to delay biventricular pacing at that time given his atrial fibrillation and suboptimal hemodynamics.
Instead he was brought to the CCU for invasive hemodynamic monitoring with Milrinone therapy.
Throughout his hospital course, as far as his pump function was concerned, he was put on a Milrinone drip which was increased to 5 mcg/minute and successfully increased his cardiac output and cardiac index in the [**6-11**] and 2-3 range.
He was able to then be given Lasix intravenously and often Diuril followed by Lasix with successful diuresis and lost approximately 2 liters per day while he was on the Milrinone drip.
He was then switched to Captopril and his Coreg was started as well as low dose Digoxin.
His Captopril was increased to a max dose of 100 mg tid and then it was changed to Mavik 4 mg po for once a day dosing.
His cardiac function remained stable, however, he became dry last few days of admission with decreased po intake and continued po diuresis with Lasix and his Lasix dose was held on [**2102-9-19**] and po intake was encouraged to keep him euvolemic.
As far as his coronaries were concerned, he remained AV paced for most of his stay in CCU with his DDD pacemaker.
He was switched to Amiodarone po 400 mg q d and was given Heparin until the date of discharge at which point his Coumadin became therapeutic and that was stopped.
Pulmonary wise he had severe pulmonary edema on admission and had an oxygen requirement, however, this improved markedly with his diuresis and over the last few days of his hospital course he had no oxygen requirement whatsoever, was satting well on room air.
As far as his gout was concerned he was treated initially with Probenecid and Colchicine.
Colchicine was continued for treatment of his gout.
Other issues:  Insomnia, he was given Trazodone because Ambien was ineffective in inducing sleep in this patient.
The patient was started on Effexor because of depression and was seen by physical therapy and case management because of decreased strength compared to his baseline.
DISCHARGE PLAN:  Transfer to [**Hospital **] Rehab Facility on [**2102-9-30**] on the following medications:  Amiodarone 400 mg po q d, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Mag Oxide, Vitamin E, K-Dur, Iron Sulfate, Reglan, Coreg 3.125 mg po bid, Digoxin 0.0625 mg po q d, Lasix 80 mg po bid, Colchicine, Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg three times a week, Effexor, Metamucil, Mavik 4 mg po q d, and Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d.  His attending will be contact[**Name (NI) **] and he will have follow-up with him and his primary care physician.
