The patient has unfortunately experienced difficult to control myasthenia symptoms and has been tried on multiple treatment regimens including IVIG, plasmapheresis, high-dose steroids, and more recently cellcept and rituximab with very limited success.
The plan was to give her the 6th and last dose of the rituxan, arrange for ivig one week after this last dose, increase the mestanon to 120 mg 5x per day and continue her cellcept and prednisone at the current doses.
Her rapid rate broke after a couple rounds of adenosine and her blood pressure went up to the 130s systolic.

very lethargic, not following simple commands, eyes open with some spontaneous eye movements; blinks to threat b/l, corneal reflex intact, gag reflex intact; decrease gastroc.
The endotracheal tube tip is in satisfactory position in the mid trachea.
She has not been responding well to treatment so far (including IVIG, plasmapheresis, steroids, rituximab, mestinon).
She was slowly weaned off the ventilator once her muscle strength improved.
No complications occurred, but BiPAP was arranged for further support at night.
As she did not respond to this treatment and given the risks of this treatment peri-operatively (see below), it was decided to discontinue the prednisone.
The patient was continued on Cellcept and mestinon.
IVIG treatment (400mg/kg/day; 5 day course) was started [**9-18**].
She tolerated the treatment well without complications and her exam improved gradually, as measured by sustained upgaze, vital capacity, and ability to lift her arms and legs off the bed.
Thoracic surgery was consulted as to which procudure (VATS versus sternotomy) would be most appropriate and as what the best timing would be for the surgery.
Given the patient's recovery, it was decided to plan for surgery [**1-25**] months after discharge.
Cyclosporin may be added to this regimen after discharge.
From a surgical point of view, cyclosporin would pose no problems.
CV: The patient was continued on lisinopril for HTN.
Metoprolol was avoided to manage tachycardia as this aggravates MG. Diltiazem was used PRN.
Endo: She was maintained on a ISS and FSBS were checked while she was receiving steroids.
FEN: While intubated, the patient received tube feeds through an NGT.
Prophylaxis included PPI, heparin sc, VD boots, tylenol for fever.
The patient was followed by PT and discharged with home services.
