Hypothyroidism, Primary: patient was found to have TSH on admit of 9.0, repeat was still elevated at 7.3; T4 was low at 3.9, c/w primary hypothyroidism; pt was started on Synthroid 112mcg/day.
Cardiology evaluated while the patient was in the MICU, said that the patient did not require pacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure or symptoms, which patient did not have during his hospital stay; thought likely to resolve as Synthroid takes effect.
Patient currently receiving Epogen ?5000 or 20,000 units/week, received at the VA, but not followed by a Hematologist.
Heme also noted that his peripheral smear contained strange-looking cells suspicious for myelodysplastic process.
He has had no evid of bleeding but we are holding ASA given this significant risk (he has a h/o falls) .
Blood sugars: pt has h/o DM2, was started on RISS as glyburide was held, then patient became hyponatremic, possibly because of hypothyroidism; was on a D5W drip briefly, RISS adjusted to keep sugars in check; pt seems very sensative to insulin at bedtime when he is not eating, so this scale was decreased compared to his daytime dosing.
If patient needs to be started on a oral hypoglycemic, he should not be restarted on his glyburide as it is renally cleared.
Glipizide can be considered.
Constipation: possibly [**2-19**] hypothyroid, increased bowel regimen .
He should not be restarted on a beta blocker.
CHF: patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [**2-19**] his CXR and his clinical presentation; this was thought to be due to a combination of bradycardia, anemia and possible infection; TTE showed LVH but no evid of worsening heart function with LVEF>55%.
Pt was initially diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV as needed, then became overdry with bump in creatinine, was given some fluid back via NS boluses, and is being discharged euvolemic.
?LLL pna: thought to have evid of pna (?aspiration) on initial CXR, started Levaquin x 7days ( started on [**1-6**] to stop [**1-12**]).
