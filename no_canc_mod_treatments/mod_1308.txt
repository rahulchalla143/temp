Anticoagulation with heparin drip and Warfarin was started.
Anticoagulation was held for a biopsy on [**2163-2-22**].
Inferior vena cava placement filter was not done at that time and her anticoagulation was restarted on [**2-27**] and the patient was subsequently discontinued to home on [**2163-3-2**] with Lovenox and Coumadin.
On arrival to the Emergency Department the patient was obtunded and diaphoretic with oxygen saturations of 90% via nasal cannula on Dopamine drip.
The patient was started on Dopamine drip with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Atropine 1 mg intravenously times one, epinephrine 1 mg intravenously times one were both given.
Dopamine drip was started at 30 mcg/kg on transfer to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/17, right ventricular 49/15, wedge of approximately 28 and minimal flow to the left lower lobe with some filling in the left upper lobe.
Percutaneous embolectomy was also technically not feasible.
Thrombolytic treatment was ultimately started at 1325 PM, 100 mg intravenously to be dosed over two hours.
The patient was subsequently brought to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit with right femoral PLC and right femoral RV sheaths in place.
Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus in [**2155**] after one year of coumadin treatment; 2.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lovenox 100 mg, last dose [**3-6**] Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
Verapamil 300 mg p.o.
Moexipril 30 mg p.o.
Prazosin 5 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 100 mg p.o.
Wellbutrin 200 mg p.o.
q. PM Tentoprazole 40 mg p.o.
Extremities, cool, clammy in Emergency Department, improved on vital signs, no petechiae or ecchymosis.
AST 37, ALT 29, alkaline phosphatase 67, bilirubin .7, amylase 56, lipase 50, sodium 138, potassium 5.7, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5, glucose 117, homocysteine was 13.7, anticardiolipin IgM was 27, IgG 6.5, Factor V 105, no lupus anticoagulant tested.
Chest x-ray, endotracheal tube, approximate 5 cm above [**Last Name (un) 8164**], poor volumes, high vascularization, no effusions ?
Pulmonary - The patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
It was determined that the patient would not be on a sliding scale of heparin and that it would be monitored q.
Eventually the patient was in a therapeutic range and Coumadin was started at 5 mg q.h.s.
The patient was then anticoagulated on heparin and coumadin until [**3-20**], when the Heparin was discontinued.
The patient continued with coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
The patient was off of nasal cannula on the floor and his saturation was over 95% on room air.
The patient had an inferior vena cava filter placed on [**2163-3-8**] by IR.
On [**3-17**], the patient underwent cardioversion at which time the patient was taken off of his medications except for Amiodarone.
After cardioversion the patient was in normal sinus rhythm and was started back on Lopressor at a lower dose and his Amiodarone was decreased to 600 q.d.
On hospital day #13, the patient was started on Hydralazine and on Isosorbide Dinitrate to help with blood pressure control.
The patient will be a candidate for an ACE inhibitor and possibly diuretics but this was held until the creatinine started to go down to baseline.
The patient was placed on Protonix for prophylaxis.
