Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Coumadin was initiated for the mechanical valve.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Beta blocker was changed to Toprol for history of chronic systolic heart failure.
ACE Inhibitor should be considered when blood pressure tolerates.
Statin was not started due to idiopathic hyper-creatinine kinasemia.
Vancomycin was started for cellulitis of the right knee.
Prior to discharge, Vancomycin was transitioned to PO Bactrim.
By the time of discharge on postoperative day four, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
Given his mechanical aortic valve, Warfarin should be titrated for goal INR between 2.5 to 3.0.
