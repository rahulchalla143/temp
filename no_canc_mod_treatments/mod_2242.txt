At this time the patient was med flighted to [**Hospital1 188**] and no further intervention was performed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction, also with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the obtuse marginal one.
The patient also had a history of osteoarthritis status post left knee replacement.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Levoxyl 150 mcg po q.d., Protonix 40 mg po q day, Colace prn and she was also on an intravenous nitroglycerin drip and intravenous heparin drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs 95.0, 91, and blood pressure of 88/51 with an intraaortic balloon pump in place.
Cardiac catheterization showed elevated wedge pressure of 37 and otherwise findings of markedly increased filling pressures, left main with 30% diffuse disease.
Left anterior descending coronary artery with 90% proximal occlusion with TIMI two flow after the balloon was inserted, 3.8 by 8 mm hepacoach sent, ramus to intermedius had the ability to rescue it.
Therefore an intraaortic balloon pump was placed.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 15937**]ssment and recommendations from the cardiac catheterization included anterior myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, aspirin and Plavix for thirty days at least, ace inhibitor when the creatinine stabilized, heparin half dose while on Integrilin for 24 hours and an intraaortic balloon pump.
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of Cardiothoracic Surgery was also consulted.
Cardiac:  Pump, the patient was continued on an intravenous nitroglycerin drip.
She was maintained on an intraaortic balloon pump for a day.
She was prepared for a coronary artery bypass graft, however, this was not performed.
Subsequently she was diuresed with Lasix for presumed congestive heart failure.
She was started on ianatrops for one day, however, this was discontinued secondary to abnormal and occasional supraventricular tachycardias on telemetry.
For ischemia she was continued on Plavix, aspirin and her heparin drip.
The Integrilin drip was discontinued one day after catheterization.
Therefore she was maintained on an regular insulin sliding scale and continued on her Synthroid.
The patient was also continued on Protonix and her heparin drip.
The patient's Captopril dose was increased upwards.
She was started on Hydralazine and that was titrated upwards.
She was also put on Isordil and that was titrated upwards.
However, the patient continued to experience significant congestive heart failure and it was the families decision given the severity of her congestive heart failure and her frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and apnea that she be made comfort measures only.
Therefore the patient was maintained on morphine.
She was given multiple medications for her major complaint, which was cough and this very pleasant female died probably of supraventricular tachycardia on [**2133-10-29**] at 11:20 a.m.                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15176**], M.D.
