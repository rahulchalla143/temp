Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 52 year old man with multiple medical problems including type I diabetes, ESRD on a second transplant, and significant coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, who presented with weakness and found to have bradycardia and hyperkalemia.
He received successful treatment for hyperkalemia in the ED and was admitted to the ICU in NSR.
The patient was re-started on beta-[**Name (NI) 7005**] therapy after improvement in cardiac status for several days.
Of note, the patient did develop elevated cardiac enzymes (to peak Trop T 0.38, negative CK-MB) with non-diagnostic EKG changes.
He continues on a cardiac regimen of aspirin, statin, beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-acting nitrate, hydralazine and diuretics.
He was also noted to have mild transaminitis and Alk Phos elevation of unclear significance and trending towards normal on serial measurements.
He was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl.
The patient was discharged on a course of levofloxacin, metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia +/- colitis or other GI infection and fluconazole for yeast UTI.
He is discharged on rapamycin every other day dosing for the duration of fluconazole therapy to increase to daily dosing upon completion of this medication.
HCTZ was discontinued and torsemide was continued at a reduced dose at the time of discharge.
He was also started on calcitriol.
This was likely due to impaired clearance in the setting of multi-organ injury and significant infection.
He did receive vitamin K PO for reversal and was discharged on coumadin with therapeutic INR.
