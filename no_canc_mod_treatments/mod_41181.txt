========================================== MICROBIOLOGY [**2185-10-8**] Blood culture 1/2 bottles positive for coag negative staph [**2185-10-11**] Blood culture no growth to date  Brief Hospital Course: TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [] Blood pressure control, patient on multiple medications.
Would like to uptitrate lisinopril and wean off clonidine if possible [] Plan for renal biopsy, will likely need to be scheduled as outpatient ([**10-27**]) [] LUE PICC associated DVT, held off on systemic anticoagulation given recent intraparenchymal hemorrhages, but will need lovenox prophylaxis x2 weeks and may require follow up ultrasound in few weeks to re-evaluate.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 57yo RHW with PMH of HLD and borderline HTN who presented to OSH after her husband found her lying on the floor in their living room window and and CT scan there demonstrated a large R parietal/occipital IPH and R parietal SAH with posterior white matter changes, consistent with PRES.
Her hospital course complicated by difficult to control blood pressure and catheter associated LUE DVT.
# Neuro: Patient with initial left sided weakness, L visual field deficit and hemineglect as well.
She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, given that she was found down in house and it was unclear whether or not she had a seizure at home.
Her blood pressure goal was SBP 110-160, and she required nicardipine gtt in the ICU.
She was started on labetalol, amlodipine and clonidine and was able to be weaned off nicardipine.
After she was transferred to the floor, she required IV hydralazine 1-2 times daily due to elevated blood pressures.
Lisinopril was added for better blood pressure control and also for her nephrotic syndrome (as below).
Patient's hypertension was difficult to control and required multiple medications as above.
Patient did report that she had swelling in her legs and foamy urine for a few months, during this summer.
Her blood pressure was controlled with medications as above and her creatinine improved.
Renal was planning for kidney biopsy but it was deferred because of her labile blood pressure.
She did have positive coag neg staph in blood culture, and received vancomycin for a few days, but as it was only 1 out of 2 bottles, and subsequent BCx negative to date, it was thought to be due to contamination.
So her LUE PICC was discontinued and her DVT prophylaxis was changed to lovenox 30 [**Hospital1 **].
Further systemic anticoagulation was not started given her recent multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
