CXR ([**2102-9-28**]): ET tube tip is 3.2 cm above the carina.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
MRI brain was ordered with demonstated a possible pontine acute infarct and midbrain mass.
He then developed R sided progressive arm and leg numbness and weakness as well as confusion at home.
He was diagnosed with probable Lyme encephalitis and started on ceftriaxone.
Patient recieved a full 4 week course of ceftriaxone (28 days).
Patient had had some chronic narcotic use, and methadone was started by the SICU team for pain control.
He was also started on Seroquel for agitation which was noted to help.
Patient had hypernatremia on transfer to MICU service and was treated with free water boluses in his PEG feeds, which improved his hypernatremia.
It was noted that his mental status was much improved with improvement of his hypernatremia, and therefore his sodium was maintained as close to 140 as possible.
Patient had difficulty weaning off ventilator so had trach and PEG placed [**10-10**].
Once his mental status cleared and he was able to clear his secretions, he was placed on trach mask trial which he did well with and tolerated for a full 5 days prior to discharge.
Patient was treated throughout his hospitalization with inhaled medications for bronchospasm as there was thought to be a COPD component to his respiratory failure as he had a significant prior smoking history.
He had a PICC line in place at the time of the fever, which was discontinued, and nothing grew from the catheter tip.
He was maintained on a bowel regimen for stooling and his tube feeds were restarted without evidence of pain.
Hypernatremia thought to be likely iatrogenic as patient was not getting free water flushes with his tube feeds.

He was also given bacitracin ointment and artificial tears per ophthalmology, which should be continued until he is seen in 1 week by an outpatient ophthalmologist.
He was started on Metoprolol and there was no reoccurance of the accelerated idioventricular rhythm.
Hypotension: Patient had periods of hypotension, thought to be likely iatrogenic as patient had clonidine given for aggitation.
The clonidine was tapered off and this improved his hypotension.
His medications were also spaced out so that his lopressor was not given with his seroquel, which also resolved his hypotension.
He has had no periods of hypotension in the past 4 days since these medication changes were made.
