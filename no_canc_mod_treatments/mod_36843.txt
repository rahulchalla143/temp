Cardiology was also consulted for afib with RVR and recommended IV labetalol, which converted him back into SR in the 110s.
Lisinopril was initially held due to hyperkalemia setting but plan was to resume his oupatient dose once discharged.
Additional ESRD medications, cinacalcet and sevelamer were also continued for electrolyte/Phos level control.
The pain was reproducible on physical exam at the lower edge of xiphoid and epigastric region and responded to Maalox and it was felt that these complaints were large GI related vs. cardiac.
He continued to have chest pain while on the floor, and again it was relieved with tylenol and maalox, thought to be more GI related at that time.
He had three days left of treatment at the time of discharge.
The patient has a history of DM-2 and was initially placed on Humalog sliding scale after acute presentation.
He will continue his Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule as an outpatient.
