She had a glucose of 404 for which she received 4 units of insulin with no improvement and was brought to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for a concern of possible cerebrovascular accident.
The Coronary Care Unit Team was called to see her and she was brought to the Coronary Care Unit for urgent transvenous pacer placement with a [**Hospital1 1516**] pad placed prophylactically on her chest.
Status post hysterectomy 6.
History of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia/paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia for which she takes atenolol and digoxin.
Low back pain with spinal decompression in [**2128**] and epidural steroid injections.
The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate but other intervention including pressors are okay.
ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and codeine, unknown reactions.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
Zyprexa 15 mg q.h.s.
Glyburide 10 mg q.d.
TUMS 500 mg b.i.d.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Tylenol 650 mg b.i.d.
Neurontin 400 mg t.i.d.
Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
Effexor 37.5 mg q.d.
Multivitamin 13.
Zestril 20 mg q.d.
Could not assess jugulovenous distension secondary to pacer insertion.
Pulmonary, crackles at the bases, left greater than right.
The patient was status post transvenous pacemaker placement with no pneumothorax or complication.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiology, electricity, for the patient's initial intermittent sinus arrest with long pauses and unreliable junctional escape she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and had an urgent transvenous pacemaker placed [**7-12**] with recapture.
The next morning she was noticed to be intermittently pacer independent but still having long pauses at times requiring pacer function.
Further although her Digoxin and atenolol were held, since the pacemaker could have ceased functioning and her nodal blockers would have produced an intrinsic rate, she was going to need these for the history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, therefore permanent pacemaker was placed [**2133-7-14**] when her pneumonia was under good control.
This medication was reintroduced after the permanent pacemaker was in place.
She also needed further blood pressure control with systolic blood pressures in the 140s to 160s that day.
She currently remains on atenolol 50 and Zestril.
Atenolol rather than digoxin is being used for rate control.
The patient tolerated rehydration without desaturation.
Oxygen was weaned off with good saturations on room air and no shortness of breath, also with resolution of infiltrates, at least partially on post pacemaker films which may indicate a resolving pneumonitis rather than an actual pneumonia.
She is on an ACE inhibitor which will help control a decline in function of her diabetes mellitus.
Infectious disease - Given Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Room for aspiration pneumonia this was renally dosed and then doses were increased after her creatinine was normalized.
Flagyl was not continued because of the very low incidents of anaerobic infections and aspiration pneumonia and her good pulmonary function.
Levofloxacin was to be continued for two doses for a total of five day course given her good room air status, decrease in abnormal chest x-ray and lack of shortness of breath or fever at any point.
The patient was given a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
Glyburide was stopped given the long QT on her initial electrocardiogram.
Metformin may be initiated if replacement for Glyburide is required.
She required a sitter at points while she had the transvenous pacer and restraints to keep this device in but otherwise was cooperative.
Her multi-infarct dementia would best be preventively managed with aspirin if her presumed allergy is not significant and blood pressure and glucose control and an ACE inhibitor which she is already on.
Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
which may be increased for blood pressure control as well as control of her paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
Zyprexa 50 mg q.h.s.
TUMS 500 mg b.i.d.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Zestril 20 mg q.d.
which is to be increased if she is hypertensive on a good dose of Atenolol 7.
Effexor XR 37.5 mg q.d.
Neurontin 400 mg t.i.d.
Multivitamin q.d.
Milk of magnesia 30 cc q.
Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
Sliding scale insulin prn 13.
Vancomycin 1 gm 10 AM given on [**2133-7-16**] only to complete a perioperative course  FOLLOW UP:  Follow up is with the Device Clinic in one week, so the patient is to call for appointment and is given the number.
Status post DDD pacemaker for intermittent sinus arrest and bradycardia 2.
