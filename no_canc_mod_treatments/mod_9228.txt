Status post dilatation and evacuation of an intrauterine pregnancy at approximately six weeks gestation.
Right ovarian cystectomy in [**2187-2-8**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Tylenol and Percocet.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 6.6 with an unremarkable differential, hemoglobin 12.1, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 229,000, sodium 106, potassium 4.2, chloride 76, bicarbonate 24, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 109, calcium 8, magnesium 1.3 and phosphorous 2.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management and workup of her syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Her tachycardia suggested a hypovolemic picture, however, given the severity of the patient's pain, pain contributing to her syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone could not be ruled out.
The renal service was consulted and recommended fluid restriction to 800 cc of free water daily to increase her sodium at a maximum rate of 10 mEq per day.
The patient's water intake was liberalized to one liter then 1.2 liters daily and her sodium continued to rise appropriately to 130.
At that time, the decision was made to start the patient on oral salt tablets 3 grams daily.
Given these new complaints, a neurologic examination revealed decreased deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and Hematin was ordered from [**Company 36178**] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 18250**] as a precaution in case her porphyria acutely worsened.
Because of the patient's new neurologic findings were concerning for progressive porphyria as well as her unimproved abdominal examination, her inappropriately rising beta hCG and her desire, since prior to admission, to terminate the pregnancy, the decision was made in conjunction with the Ob/Gyn service (who had been following the patient in house) to proceed with offering early pregnancy termination.
Postoperatively, her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patch and Percocet.
Because the patient was asymptomatic with this heart rate and because of the concern that her porphyria was progressing, the decision was made to hold off administering blood products which may potentially further stress her system for the time being.
On hospital day number ten (postoperative day number three status post dilatation and evacuation), the patient underwent a blood transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient tolerated the blood transfusion well and a post transfusion hematocrit showed the appropriate rise.
A letter was given to the patient addressed to the INS to help her extend her visa stay in the United States so that she could continue receiving medical treatment for her presumptive porphyria.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36179**] [**Name (STitle) 36180**] of internal medicine and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2450**] of gynecology.
