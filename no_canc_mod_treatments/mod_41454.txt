HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the MICU her anion gap rapidly decreased on an insulin drip protocol.
She was given a bolus of Lispro insulin and started back on her insulin pump.
She had her insulin pump adjusted several times from 0.8 up to 1.0 units per hour expecting a high amount of insulin resistance given her probable infection.
The patient was not as insulin sensitive and had a hypoglycemia episode down to 52.
The patient did require constant monitoring of her pump and patient's blood sugars remained in good control.
The patient was finally controlled with a basal rate of 0.6 units per hour using her insulin to carbohydrate ration of 1:15 and sensitivity factor of 1:60 with good result.
Given the patient's DKA and high risk, the patient was started on Azithromycin 500 mg p.o.
HYPERTENSION:  The patient was initially started on Metoprolol 25 p.o.
Blood pressure medications were not started at this time.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Insulin pump with Humalog 0.5 units per hour times 24 hours.
Insulin to carbohydrate ration of 1:15, sensitivity factor of 1:50 and follow up at [**Last Name (un) **] for fine tuning.
