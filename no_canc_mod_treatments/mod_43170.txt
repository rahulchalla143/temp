CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the abdominal structures is again limited by the lack of intravenous contrast.
The patient remains status post splenectomy with a small amount of splenosis in the left upper quadrant, which remains unchanged.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2188-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Supplemental oxygen was used.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
No specimens were taken for pathology   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 84 yo man with history of chronic systolic CHF (last EF 40%), pulmonary HTN, severe TR, diabetes type 2 now controlled off meds, afib on warfarin and congestive cirrhosis, who presents with abdominal pain and hypotension, and found to have acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hyponatremia and alkalosis.
He was given one dose of Zosyn in the ED, though this was not continued on admission.
He was not continued on antibotics, and was given fluid resuscitation with IVF boluses.
His hypotension was felt most likely to overdiuresis, and thus his spironolactone and furosemide dosages were decreased as per medication reconcillation.
We also lowered his dose of Metoprolol given his borderline hypotension in house; this can be uptitrated in the future as needed.
Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: With volume status restored, patient had slight volume overload and diuretics were slowly re-introduced.
This was evidenced by right pleural effusion and increased requirement for oxygen at rest.
They recommend a diet of soft moist solids and thin liquids, as well as further evaluation by speech and swallow at his facility.
His coumadin was held for this procedure and re-started afterwards.
Iron supplements continued.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Likely pre-renal in setting of poor po intake, and diuresis as discussed above.
Post-obstructive etiologies much less likely on the differential.
Lytes were trended with correction of bicarb to 33 on day of discharge.
Held Toprol XL initially given hypotension.
Placed on heparin gtt briefly, but on discharge was therapeutic on Coumadin at 5.5 mg Daily at 2.1.
Metoprolol was re-started at 25mg PO daily before d/c.
Not currently on any medications for diabetes.
Suspect that he no longer requires meds given his weight loss.
Continued on methimazole 5mg daily.
