Multiple overlying EKG wires and external pacer wires are noted.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion compatible with congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 M with hx of CHF, atrial fibrillation, NIDDM and schizophrenia presents with SOB at rest.
# CHF, Predominantly Diastolic with mild systolic dysfunction: Patient's history of progressive DOE to SOB at rest in the absence of chest pressure/pain in the setting of severe dietary indiscretion and missed lasix [**Month/Day/Year 4319**] is strongly suspicious for CHF exacerbation.
Patient was given IV lasix 100mg x 1 on hospital day 1, to which patient diuresed beautifully.
He was discharged home with lasix PO 80mg [**Hospital1 **], Metoprolol 50 TID, and Lisinopril.
Patient on metroprolol at home, previously on digoxin.
Metoprolol was continued.
He was loaded with digoxin (0.5mg + 0.25mg q6 x 2 [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4319**]), then was started on digoxin 0.125mg daily.
On discussing with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appears that the reason he was not able to tolerate coumadin was due to over-sensitivity to coumadin and was supratherapeutic on coumadin.
This should not be a contraindication for coumadin discontinuation.
# HTN: Metoprolol was continued.
# T2DM: Metformin was held while the patient was in the hospital and restarted on discharge.
Patient was put on insulin sliding scale, and his glucose was well-controlled.
Patient may be candidate for iron replacement.
Has been tried on coumadin before and taken off.
2) Dietary Indiscretion - reinforce healthy diet, review low/high salt foods for repetition 3) Hypertension and Rate control - we made changes to these meds (metoprolol, lisinopril) and restarted digoxin.
