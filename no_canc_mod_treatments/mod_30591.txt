Brief Hospital Course: 88F h/o CHF, AFib, s/p AAA repair p/w RLL pneumonia.
Started on levoquin in ED for CAP, but given patient coming from recent rehab setting and multiple recent hospital admissions there was concern for hospital-acquired pathogens.
Thought to have possibly aspirated on HD#3 prior to MICU transfer but later passed Speech and Swallow evaluation; was transiently on flagyl but then discontinued after return to medical floor as aspiration thought not likely.
However, the patient is s/p XRT for breast CA and has evidence of post-XRT changes by chest CT as well as a proximal myopathy of unknown significance and borderline NIF (max effort -24), raising a question of neuropathic or muscular contribution for which Neurology was consulted (see below).
O2 requirement improved with antibiotics and cough improved.
Started on prednisone in MICU for wheezing on examination which has since resolved and will complete a short taper.
Plan to continue levofloxacin to complete 14 day course.
Statin was discontinued as could possibly be contributing but no evidence of myositis on labs.
Continued coumadin initially but then held while supratherapeutic (goal INR [**2-15**]).
Not on ASA at home.
Continued home dose beta blocker and lasix.
No ACEi given borderline low BPs, could consider starting as outpatient.
Received prednisone 60mg in ED x1 which was discontinued upon transfer to the medical floor.
# Coagulopathy: On coumadin at home.
Coumadin held, will need daily INR checks and await INR to trend down to < 3 before restarting at home dose.
Continued beta blocker.
