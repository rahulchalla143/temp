On admission, the patient was originally started on Ceftriaxone.
The patient's oxygen requirement continued to worsen with increase opacifications on chest x-ray.
Levofloxacin was substituted and steroids were added on [**2-3**].
The patient was transferred after intubation on assist control ventilation 750/14 with pressure support of 7, PEEP of 5 and 100% FIO2.
In addition, the patient was reported to have had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring diltiazem drip but the patient spontaneously cardioverted to sinus rhythm and arrived to the [**Hospital6 2018**] without a diltiazem drip.
Prostate cancer, status post XRT in [**2133**].
DRUGS ON TRANSFER:  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d., Solu-Medrol 60 mg intravenous q.
8 hours, digoxin 0.125 mg q.d., Zantac, aspirin 325 mg po q.d., metoprolol 75 mg po b.i.d., heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  None.
Oxygen saturation 88% on assist control ventilation 750/14, pressure support of 7, PEEP of 5 on 100% FIO2, PIP of 24 and a plateau 23.
OG tube was in place with no jugular venous distention.
COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and pressures with PEEP for presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.
He was treated with albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as necessary.
The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen saturations and minimize pressures.
Despite multiple attempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**].
Infectious Disease:  For the patient's pneumonia, he was begun on Ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.
The patient was continued on Levaquin as described above.
The patient was then resumed on vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.
He was given intravenous fluids as necessary for hypotension.
Eventually the patient required blood pressure support with pressors.
During the week of [**2145-2-21**], the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring large doses of Neo-Synephrine which were unable to be weaned previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement was intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and [**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses.
He did not respond to this and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure support from pressors.
He was then maintained on amiodarone po.
An amiodarone drip was started again and the patient was returned to amiodarone po.
He was also seen in consultation by the Cardiology Service who recommended amiodarone intravenous and po, as was executed.
He was maintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the course of the admission.
Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout the admission.
By [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the patient with Lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of atrial fibrillation as described above.
The patient's intravenous medications were double concentrated in order to minimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts to remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above.
Access:  The patient received central lines for administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines for hemodynamic monitoring.
On [**2145-2-19**], during a routine change of the patient's central line for question infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal jugular catheter placement.
Needle thoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's blood pressure returned.
A chest tube was placed thereafter.
Disposition:  During the week of [**2145-2-21**], it became apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that multiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support and pressors were unsuccessful.
The patient was extubated and pressors were turned off.
He was kept comfortable with morphine drip and bolus along with intravenous Ativan.
