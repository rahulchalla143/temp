She underwent a gastric bypass which resulted in substantial weight loss but she did develop a near critical condition with open abdomen and hernia.
A hernia repair was done in [**2127**] but still there was a significant area of herniation and she is here for hernia repair.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above plus hand surgery in [**2122**].
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin and Levoxyl, lisinopril and propranolol.
Ultimately she was then taken to the operating room where a hernia repair with component separation including the use of mesh was used.
The difficult decision as always when to restart anticoagulation on aortic valve and we initiated the anticoagulation approximately 8 hours or so after surgery.
She received multiple units of blood transfusion but actually tolerated all these procedures well.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as her admission medications and she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the associated physicians such as her cardiologist and her primary care physician.
