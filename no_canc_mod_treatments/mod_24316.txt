Admission Date:  [**2165-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-2-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: Coughing up blood  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2165-6-7**] - VATS for lung Bx [**2165-6-11**] - Renal Biopsy [**2165-6-29**] - L Renal Arteriogram  History of Present Illness: 66F with history of HTN, CAD s/p CABG and mechanical [**Hospital3 9642**] aortic valve 20 years ago on coumadin, recent +PANCA, presented for admission for reversal of INR and observation for upcoming lung biopsy for workup of potential Wegners diagnosis.
OMR notes reveal anemia over past month with recent transfusion on Thursday prior to admission.
Per OMR notes she was undergoing routine echo of the heart when an increased dilation of the aorta was noted.
She was seen by thoracic surgery for consideration of EBUS versus open lung biopsy one month ago.
Chest tube removed on [**6-8**] without complications.
Past Medical History: - Coronary Artery Disease with CABG in [**2143**] and additional placement of mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Gout  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 88713**] is originally from [**Country 1684**].
In the future, the patient should continue to receive [**Doctor Last Name **]-antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.
A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation are nonspecific.
Possible calcified right renal artery pseudoaneurysm, less likely calcified lymph node anterior to the right kidney.
The typical findings of Wegener's granulomatosis are not seen.
[**6-12**] Renal Biopsy: Necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis ,pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes (see note).
Albumin preparations are not contributory.
Borderline enlarged spleen measuring 12.3 cm.
Elevated resistive indices bilaterally, which may be related to baseline medical renal disease.
No evidence of active bleeding on left renal arteriogram including segmental selective injections to the interpolar branch and inferior polar branch.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, or free extravasation on left-sided lumbar arteriograms with selective injections of L2, L3 and L4 lumbar arteries.
Stable appearance of right perinephric and retroperitoneal hematoma without evidence of extension or new bleeding.
Brief Hospital Course: 66yo woman with a h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG and mechanical [**Hospital3 9642**] bileaflet aortic valve placed 20 years ago on coumadin, presented with hemoptysis, lung nodules, microscopic hematuria with positive P-ANCA, elevated ESR, CRP.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndrome.
[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by a post renal biopsy perinephric bleed and then a larger more expansive retroperitoneal bleed which ultimately self tamponaded with no need for open surgery or IR guided interventions.
Following discussions with renal, IP, thoracics, and rheumatology, it was decided to proceed with a biospy of the lung.
It was felt that given the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy for vasculitis, it would be best to confirm the diagnosis with biopsy.
In the meantime, she was started on prednisone 60 mg PO.
A complicating factor was her anticoagulation for her mechanical heart valve.
Her coumadin was held before lung biopsy and she was given vitamin K to speed INR reversal.
Her course was complicated by an initial perinephric hematoma with bleeding and later by an expanding retroperotineal bleed after being re-bridged back to oral coumadin over a week after her surgery.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis ,pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes.
Of note, after she was started on IV cytoxan the first week in [**Month (only) 205**], it was noted that just after one week there was noticeable improvement in renal function as well as decrease in active urinary sediments.
Thus, this confirmed most of her kidney dysfunction could be blamed on ANCA vasculitis.
# Perinephric and retroperitoneal bleeds: Two days after renal biopsy patient was started on heparin bridge to coumadin.
Her heparin and coumadin was discontinued.
She was hemodynamically stable and therefore did not require any procedures.
Three days after the bleed she was restarted on heparin bridge again.
Two days after being put on heparin she again developed worsening abdominal pain with hemodynamic instability and was found to have a worsened retroperitoneal bleed.
She was transferred to the ICU and received blood transfusions.
After her hematocrit was stable for several days, she was restarted on heparin on [**6-30**].
On [**7-2**] she was restarted on coumadin since her hematocrit had remained stable.
She has been on longstanding coumadin for her known mechanical valve.
As outlined above, she needed to interrupt her usual coumadin dosing to be briefly held and then re-bridged alongside heparin gtt.
After a brief ICU stay in late [**Month (only) 205**] with clear evidence of stable HCTs for several days and stable vital signs her Coumadin was restarted at a lower cautious dose on [**7-2**].
Heparin was briefly stopped given a small hematocrit drop on [**7-6**] while INR was 1.8, but soon thereafter it was restarted with Coumadin.
She was discharged on Coumadin dose of 4 mg/day and with an INR of 2.3.
Overall she received 18 units of pRBCs transfusion spaced out over the course of her hospitalization.
Her reticulocyte was 1.3 on [**6-19**] possibly from bone marrow suppresion most likely from new meds e.g Cytoxan and Bactrim.
After discontinuing Bactrim, her reticulocytes increased to around 5.
Patient's iron studies as well as B12, and folate as well as hemolysis labs were normal.
After discontinuing Bactrim patient's LFTs trended back to normal.
Most likely in the setting of Cytoxan related bone marrow suppression and immune suppression effects.
Briefly placed on neutropenic precautions during her WBC nadir, while slowly resolved.
# HTN: Blood pressure was initially on the low side and her captopril, lasix, spironolactone were held in the setting of low BP and RP/perinephric bleeding issues.
Several days after her active bleed seemed to have stabilized in the ICU she had blood pressures adjusted again to include labetolol, TID captopril and amlodipine in order to ensure elevated blood pressures did not set off additional bleeding.
Team tried to keep goal SBPs in the 120-140s range as much as possible, with several extra PRN IV hydralazine doses during her hospital stay.
By time of discharge patient had been put on a stable combination of labetalol, captopril and amlodipine.
Restarting of her Lasix or Spironolactone will be determined by her PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **] later date.
Aspirin was held in setting of numerous biopsies and then her bleeding complications.
She was continued on usual home statin medication.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable, patient continued on home pravastatin .
Patient will follow up with her nephrologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 118**] for her next planned  IV Cytoxan therapy over the next few weeks  Patient will have her INR monitored as outpatient by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 88713**],  It was an absolute pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 1225**] Medical Center.
After a multidisclplinary discussion between the renal, rheumatology, and medicine teams, you were started on cytoxan to treat your vasculitis.
Your red blood cell counts decreased briefly, but returned back to their baseline levels.
This bleeding was in your abdomen and pelvic area (retroperitoneal space) and it was monitored on both abdominal ultrasounds and CT scans.
Your anti-coagulation medication was stopped and later restarted once your bleeding appeared to have stopped.
You received several blood transfusions, but ultimately you were transferred to the ICU for further management on [**2165-6-29**].
We also set up an appointment with your cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4597**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5017**] for Wednesday, [**7-17**], who will be continuing to help manage your anti-coagulation therapy and INR test results now that you have a history of a significant bleed.
In addition, we changed your medications to allow for better control of your new ANCA-associated diagnosis and blood pressure.
Those changes are listed below:  We have made the following MEDICATION CHANGES: - STARTED Labetalol 200 MG twice a day - STARTED Amlodipine 10 MG once a day - STARTED Monthly IV Cytoxan - STARTED Prednisone 60 MG once a day - STARTED Atovaquone 1500 MG once a day - STARTED Calcium Carbonate 500 MG once a day - STARTED Vitamin D 400 Units once a day - STARTED Pantoprazole 40 MG once a day .
- CONTINUE Pravastatin 40 MG once a day - CONTINUE Warfarin 3 MG once a day .
- INCREASED Captopril to 75 MG three times a day .
- DECREASED Allopurinol to 150 MG once a day .
- STOPPED Lasix - STOPPED Spironolactone - STOPPED Codeine-Guaifenesin - STOPPED Atenolol .
