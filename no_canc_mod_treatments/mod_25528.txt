EMS was called and administered Narcan on arrival with with minimal improvement.
He was again given narcan without improvement so was intubated.
CXR with question of RML infiltrate, and as there was concern for meningitis given his AMS, he was given vancomycin 1gm, ceftriaxone 2gm.
He received a total of 4L NS IVF.
Noted to have melena; OG tube here without any hematemesis.
Patient was given tylenol 650mg pr and abx coverage broadened to metronidazole 500mg IV and cefepime for pseudomonal coverage.
He was started on pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **].

# Unresponsiveness, most likely from anoxic brain injury: The patient was found unresponsive, intubated at OSH ED for airway protection.
There was concern for intoxication given finding of needles but tox screens negative.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and cefepime for treatment of possible meningitis, though lumbar puncture was not indicative of a CNS infection.
Metabolic reasons for unresponsiveness included hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and low-grade uremia which were all treated.
B12, TSH and RPR were normal.
# Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation for inability to protect his airway secondary to his unresponsiveness.
He was continued on pressure support ventilation and was extubated without difficulty.
The patient was started on Keppra and uptitrated to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was also loaded with fosphenytoin per neurology recommendations.
He will continue on Keppra and has neurology followup.
# E. coli pneumonia: The patient presented with fever and was initially broadly covered with vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir and flagyl.
Sputum culture revealed E.coli and antibiotics were narrowed with a course of 7 days for IV cefepime.
# E. coli urinary tract infection: The patient was found to have a E. coli UTI which was treated with 7 days of IV cefepime.
He was initially started on PPI and octreotide drips.
He was continued on maintainence fluids of D5 [**12-9**] normal saline for poor PO intake.
His home glipizide was held and he was started on an insulin drip with tubefeeds due to hyperglycemia.
His insulin regimen was later switched to 18 units of humalog [**Hospital1 **] with a sliding scale.
He will likely need further titration based on nutritional requirements.
With IV hydration, improved renal function and treatment of underlying issues, his anion gap metabolic acidosis improved.
# Polysubstance abuse: The patient has a history of narcotics and alcohol abuse.
He received Vitamin K with improvement.
Will need a PICC line for access since IV nurse unable to find peripheral IV.
