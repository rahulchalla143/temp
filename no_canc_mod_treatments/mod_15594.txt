Admission Date:  [**2135-12-13**]     Discharge Date: [**2135-12-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-6-14**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old female wit peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, carotid disease (40 to 59% on the right and 40% on the left), subclavian stenosis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% status post ICD.
She was given heparin, Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, sublingual nitroglycerin and patch and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] at around 7:00 for further management.
Left circumflex was then treated with three serial pixel stents.
Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in [**5-7**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2129**] after acute myocardial infarction, left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, arteritic, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery occluded, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal two occluded.
Right subclavian stenosis (30%) with 15 mmHg gradient.
Zestril 10 mg b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg q day.
Isosorbide 30 mg q day.
Coreg 0.125 mg q day.
Left anterior descending coronary artery 40% with diffuse disease and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid vessel and distal luminal irregularities.
Intervention, left circumflex dissected and perforated and treated with three serial pixel stents.
Left anterior descending coronary artery, proximal calcifications 60% stenosis, serial 70 to 90% stenosis to distal vessel.
Hepacoat stent was to be put at mid vessel, cipher drug eluding stent was then deployed in the proximal overlapping fashion, Hepacoat stent was deployed in the distal vessels to cover residual disease, cipher stent was deployed in the ostium.
All stents overlapping from ostium to distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
This was treated with the three serial pixel stents and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for more closer monitoring.
The patient was started on aspirin, Plavix, statin and antihypertensives were held overnight.
The patient was given one sublingual nitroglycerin with complete relief of pain.
It was the decision then to take the patient back to the catheterization laboratory and reintervene on the other lesion.
The patient had two Hepacoat stents and two cipher stents placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient was subsequently started on low dose beta blocker and ace inhibitor and titrated up as tolerated.
It was then the decision of the team to place the patient on a long acting nitrates.
Hence, she was placed on Imdur 30 q day and was chest pain for the subsequent two days.
She was placed on 20 mg of Lasix q day on day prior to discharge.
The patient was continued on her outpatient medication of Digoxin 0.125 q day.
Hematology:  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for a drop in her hematocrit fro 33.1 to 27.3.
At that time she was complaining of some pleuritic chest pain with shortness of breath necessitating nasal cannula for 2 liters.
Chest x-ray was taken, which showed mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema, superimposed upon a more chronic interstitial pattern, which has been previously treated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
At this point it was decided to start the patient on Levaquin 500 mg q 24 hours for early developing pneumonia.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was placed on a cardiac diet, 2 gram sodium.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was placed on heparin subcutaneously.
