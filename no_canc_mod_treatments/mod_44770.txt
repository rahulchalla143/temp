MR could be considered for further evaluation.
[**4-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS:  The patient has received a right PICC line.
[**4-9**] CT head postop: Status post craniotomy and drainage of left parietal abscesses with small amount of post procedural intraparenchymal and extra-axial hemorrhage and unchanged vasogenic edema without evidence of significant mass effect.
[**4-10**] MR brain with & without Contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
This is decreased since the pre-operative study, with a few persistent blood products and possible purulent material.
A functional MRI was performed as this lesion is near her motor and speech centers of her brain because she is right-handed and left hemisphere dominate which was consistent with limited examination due to patient motion, functional MRI sequences of the brain were cancelled due to lack of patient cooperation.
On [**4-8**],Infectious Disease was consulted and recommendations were as follows:The failure to resolve her brain abscess after a long course of metronidazole and ceftriaxone suggests that either her infection was polymicrobial at the outset or she developed a superinfection, perhaps via an organism introduced at the time of her prior surgery.
Would cover gram positive organismsby adding vancomycin to her regimen, and  would monitor vancomycin levels and renal function.
For now would continue metronidazole and ceftriaxione, since she initially seemed to improve.
The patient went to the OR for a left craniotomy for evacuation and washout of the brain abscess.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and she was transferred intubated to the ICU.
She remained intubated until after a postoperative MRI could be obtained on [**4-10**].
Vancomycin dosing was increased to 1250 IV BID per ID recommendations and a trough was scheduled for prior to the 4th dose.
On [**4-13**], she was screened for rehab and ceftriaxone was changed to daily per ID.
On [**4-14**], ID changed flagyl to PO 500mg Q8H which patient could not tolerate due to nausea so it was made IV once again.
She continued to have nausea around the administration of Flagyl and thus was managed with oral and IV antiemetics.
She is sheduled for follow up with ID in two weeks with a plan to continue triple antibiotic therapy until then.
