Patient was treated with Heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lopressor and was transferred here for emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed an 80 percent stenosis of the mid RCA, 100 percent proximal LAD stenosis, 80 percent proximal left circumflex, and 99 percent stenosis of the OM-1.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: 1.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 p.o.
Heparin IV drip.
Meperidine 25 mg IV prn shivering.
Integrelin drip.
The patient had a stent placed in the    LAD, which was felt to be the culprit lesion.
Postcatheterization, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed, and was transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit for ICU monitoring.
The patient was continued on Heparin drip as well as Integrelin for 18 hours postcatheterization.
He was also continued on aspirin and Plavix.
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned slowly.
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2147-6-29**] with a stent to the RCA and the circumflex.
The patient tolerated this procedure well without any events.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] recommended that the patient have an echocardiogram as well as a Holter monitor prior to following up with her [**8-10**] at 12:30 p.m. to help discuss possible electrophysiology study and possible ICD placement if needed.
The patient was started on Lipitor 80 and Lopressor was titrated up daily for cardioprotective effects.
In addition, the patient was started on lisinopril.
In addition, the patient was started on Coumadin given that his post-ST elevation MI echocardiogram demonstrated the patient had a depressed ejection fraction of 25 percent with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis of the distal [**3-14**] of the heart with evidence of mild aneurysm of the apex.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician to check his INR and for Coumadin adjustment.
He was advised to take all medications as prescribed, and follow up with appointments listed above.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
Toprol XL 100 mg SR q.d.
Warfarin 5 mg p.o.
Lovenox 100 mg subQ b.i.d.
Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for followup of his INR and advice regarding cessation of the Lovenox injections and adjustment of Coumadin dosing.
