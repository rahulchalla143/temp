She also had central line that was placed and was subsequently removed because of the fever.
She only grew psuedomonas from her sputum, for which she was put on meropenem and levofloxacin.
She was sent to rehab to finish a course of meropenema nd levofloxacin.
Of note, she also had a complex PEG tube history.
Past Medical History: - severe mental retardation - CP - quadraplegia - Sz Dz (last 3 months ago) - chronic trach not vented; on 2.5 L trach mask - s/p PEG - scoliosis - chronic anemia - recent LLL PNA as above -J tube old site w/ chronic bilious drain + GJ tube to gravity  Social History: came from [**Hospital1 5595**], was living at home with mother, spanish speaking only.
GJ tube in place.
A tube is extending from patient's right with apparent tip overlying the right abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yof with cerebral palsy and h/o recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with tachypnea and increased wbc.
Initially held of on antimicrobials for PNA, however soon after admission she was noted to have increased productive secretions and continued elevated WBC she was started on aztreonam and tobramycin for aspiration pneumonia.
Pseudomonas from sputum culture was sensitive to tobramycin and aztreonam was discontinued.
She was also maintained on AC mechanical ventilation.
She was started on Vancomycin.
She was switched over to linezolid because the enteroccus was resistent to vancomycin.
#  J tube malfunction - Patient had a seperate J tube and a G tube, since her last admission she's had difficulty with drainage around the J tube site.
Surgery was consulted who replaced a 14F foley catheter in the Jtube site and sutured the tract close, however patient continued to have drainage from the site.
An ostomy bag was placed over the j tube for drainage collection.
Tube feeds were attempted however she had increased drainage and the plan is to maintain patient on TPN and let the tract close overtime.
.. #  h/o seizure disorder - Given malfunctional J tube she was switched to IV valium and phenobarb.
Keppra and Topamax were held.
.. #  h/o anemia - baseline anemia - had one hematocrit of 19 and she received one unit of prbc, thereafter hematocrit remained stable.
Per surgery TFs were slowly started however given increased ostomy output TFs were decreased to 10cc/hr.
She should be maintained on this, however if she has skin breakdown around the J tube stie TFs should be held and she should be continued on TPN only for nutritin.
