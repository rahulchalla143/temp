The patient was started on Aspirin/Heparin/beta blocker and plan was to transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization.
She received a total of four units of packed red blood cells with a rise in her hematocrit to 36.0 to 37.0.
The Heparin drip was stopped.
Her Heparin drip was restarted at that time.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix aggressively for congestive heart failure with creatinine rising to 2.3 from baseline of 1.6.
Given this rise and inadequate diuresis, the patient was started on Nesiritide.
On [**2103-5-13**], the patient complained of chest pain radiating to the back and had CTA which ruled out dissection and abdominal aortic aneurysm but showed bilateral lung effusions which were small.
On catheterization at outside hospital, she had three vessel disease reportedly left anterior descending 90%, left circumflex 80%, right coronary artery 90% stenoses and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for consideration for coronary artery bypass graft.
Status post appendectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.
Zocor 40 mg p.o.
Zoloft 100 mg p.o.
TUMS 600 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 2.5 mg p.o.
Diovan 160 mg p.o.
Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o.
Epogen 10k three times a week.
Heparin drip.
Nitroglycerin drip.
Coronary artery disease - Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient was evaluated by CT surgery here and catheterization films reviewed by cardiology and CT surgery staff.
She was deemed to be a poor surgical candidate and given discrete lesions on angiography it was determined to have her left anterior descending stented.
While awaiting to have her stent placed, secondary to elevated creatinine, and debates as to surgery versus PCI, the patient developed recurrent episodes of chest pain associated with 2.
The patient responded each time to aggressive blood pressure lowering with beta blockade, increasing Nitroglycerin drip, sublingual Nitroglycerin times three, Hydralazine and Magnesium Sulfate.
The patient had intra-aortic balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion given tight left anterior descending stenosis and recurrent chest pain and was started on Heparin and Integrilin.
On [**2103-5-23**], the patient had successful placement of 3.0 times 12 millimeter Taxus drug eluting stent in proximal left anterior descending.
She was relieved with Morphine and this pain did not recur.
On discharge, she will be medically managed with daily Aspirin, Plavix, and Toprol at low dose limited by bradycardia, statin and [**Last Name (un) **] added at low dose.
We started her on Coumadin given apical akinesis and the patient will follow-up with primary care physician for INR levels as an outpatient.
Hypertension - We initially increased Diovan to 240 mg a day for control of blood pressure as increase of beta blocker limited by bradycardia.
Thus, Diovan was stopped and Hydralazine and Norvasc initiated for blood pressure control as unclear if this may have contributed to recurrent demand ischemia and chest pain.
We will aim to stop Amlodipine as well.
She did receive several doses of Mucomyst periprocedure.
freely and maintain euvolemia on her own.
Creatinine should be monitored as an outpatient as [**Last Name (un) **] is being restarted.
Urinary tract infection - The patient was treated with Levofloxacin which was given daily though ordered to be q.o.d.
She thus received a shorter though likely supertherapeutic course given impaired creatinine clearance.
Hematology - The patient with thrombocytopenia noted after intra-aortic balloon pump placed, improving after removal.
Likely was secondary to destruction from intra-aortic balloon pump.
Vitamin B12.
Prophylaxis - Heparin drip, subcutaneous Heparin while on bedrest, with bowel regimen.
Allowed the patient to remain euvolemic.
Disposition - The patient worked with physical therapy who deemed her rehabilitation candidate.
