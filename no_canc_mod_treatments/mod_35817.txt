She developed fever and chest pain and was admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics and over the ensuing days developed a very large left pleural effusion.
This rapidly became loculated and she was therefore taken to the Operating Room and underwent a video assisted thoracoscopic decortication and removal of pleural fibrin.
She tolerated the procedure well and made a rapid recovery with removal of chest tubes and eventual discharge to home.
