This CT evidenced a LeFort 1 fracture of his facial bones and the patient was intubated and transferred as a trauma transfer to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further surgical management.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient was not taking any medications at the time of admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pursuant with management and plan the patient was admitted to the Trauma CICU where the oral maxillofacial surgery service was consulted for repair of this patient's fracture.
The OMFS Service saw the patient shortly after his admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] and their impression was that this 26 year-old patient should be started on intravenous Clindamycin at 600 mg q 8 hours.
Also he should be given Peridex 15 cc swish and spit b.i.d.
Pertaining to the operative management they suggested that the patient would require an open reduction and internal fixation of his LeFort 1 fracture.
On hospital day two the OMFS Service commented that per their operative plan the patient would be taken to the Operating Room on hospital day three for open reduction and internal fixation of his facial fracture.
While in the CICU the patient remained intubated in light of his impending procedure and for protection of his airway in light of his facial fracture.
The patient continued to be dosed with intravenous Clindamycin per the recommendation of the OMFS team and the patient continued to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
On hospital day three the patient was taken to the Operating Room by the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Service where an open reduction and internal fixation was performed on the patient's LeFort 1 fracture.
This procedure was performed without complications with an estimated blood loss of 200 cc and an intraoperative urine output of 900 cc.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
On postoperative day one as the patient continued to do well and his mental status had continued to be awake, alert and the patient was extubated, the patient was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his continuing complaints were mild swelling of his face bilaterally, which was being treated postoperatively with intravenous steroids.
On postoperative day three as the patient continued to do well and was cleared for discharge by the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Service the patient was discharged with prescriptions for Clindamycin to continue until follow up with OMFS as well as appropriate pain medication consisting of Roxicet elixir.
The patient's steroids were discontinued after discussion with the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Service as the patient's swelling had decreased significantly and the intravenous steroids were no longer necessary to control postoperative swelling.
