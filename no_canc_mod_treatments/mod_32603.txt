Admission Date:  [**2137-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Cefoxitin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: VF arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Cardiac catheterization revealing minimal coronary lesions -ICD placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year old female with history of seasonal allergies and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis who presented to the ED after an out of hospital VF cardiac arrest.
When EMS arrived the patient was in VF and required a total of four shocks before regaining pulse.
She was hypotensive in the field and so was started on dopamine.
Due to a difficult airway she could not be intubated in the field and was ventilated with bag valve mask until arrival at the ED.
In the ED the patient was intubated with etomidate/succinylcholine and after dopamine was stopped she received amiodarone, ASA PR, and NaHCO3.
Past Medical History: - sigmoid diverticulitis s/p sigmoidectomy - appendectomy - seasonal allergies  Social History: She does not drink or use alcohol.

Canulation of the RCA induced vasospasm which was only partially reversed by intracoronary nitroglycerin injection; mild ostial plaquing could not be differentiated from continued vasospasm under these circumstances.
The RCA gave off a tortuous RPDA with a large RPL-1 and modestly sized RPL2 and RPL3.
Coronary arteries were free of angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
Small right pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year old female with past medical history significant only for seasonal allergies and diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy presents after out of hospital witnessed VF arrest.
She was started on dopamine for hypotension in the field.
On arrival in the ED she was intubated and dopamine was stopped as her hypotension had resolved.
She also received amiodarone and aspirin before tranfer to the cath lab where cardiac catheterization revealed basically unremarkable coronary arteries.
After cath she was transferred to the CCU where she was started on an amiodarone drip as well as heparin drip due to concern about a new RBBB pattern with possible S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG raised concern for acute PE.
Thus pulmonary embolus was considered a much less likely etiology of arrest and heparin was stopped on the morning after admission.
Amiodarone was also eventually stopped as the patient remained without arrythmias on constant telemetry marking.
On presentation the patient had been started on a cooling protocol, which was stopped shortly after her arrival in the CCU as she had not reached goal temperature in the appropriate time window and was minimally sedated and quite active.
She received three days of antibiotic prophylaxis (one of vancomycin, two of levofloxacin) for this procedure.
She was put on low dose daily aspirin during this hospitalization for primary prevention of ACS given her  cardiomyopathy and the danger of further insults.
The patient never had a clear viral prodrome with fevers, chills, or sore throat, but at time of discharge the main differential for her depressed pump function was viral/idiopathic cardiomyopathy vs myocardial stunning from brief ischemia during her arrest.
The patient repeatedly denied any signs of cardiomyopathy prior to admission particularly denying decreased exercise tolerance, lower extremity edema, and dyspnea and she was never noted to have these symptoms in her hospital.
The patient was started on aspirin, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor prior to discharge for management of her cardiomyopathy; these were titrated to the maximal dose tolerated.
The patient will follow-up in cardiology for the results of her MRI as well as repeat echocardiograms and further management of her cardiac disease.
4) Neurological status: On presentation in the ED the patient was started on a cooling protocol for out of hospital cardiac arrest given her low GCS.
As she was quite agitated and pulling at her endotracheal tube; however, she received further sedation for her safety.
5) Gastrointestinal bleeding: On the morning after admission the patient had hemoccult positive emesis  in the setting of supratherapeutic heparin and heaving from the ETT.
She was placed on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI therapy and overnight on first night in the hospital her Hct dropped from 43 to 34, but this was also in the context of receiving a great deal of fluid.
Her heparin was discontinued as described above and her endotracheal tube removed.
She was empirically started on ciprofloxacin until repeat UA was benign and initial culture was negative.
The results of the first UA were attributed to trauma, antibiotics were discontinued, and there were no further renal issues during this hospitalization.
The patient was fed a cardiac/heart healthy diet after regaining consciousness and being extubated.
She was on PPI for GI prophylaxis.
She received heparin IV then subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis.

In the hospital you had a defibrillator placed to shock your heart back into a good rhythm if this should happen again.
You have also been started on medications to help protect your heart while it is in its weakened state.
Your new medications are- -Metoprolol Succinate: to slow your heart rate down so it can pump more blood -Lisinopril: to decrease your blood pressure and make it easier for your heart to pump.
-Your antihistamine (claritin or allergra) was discontinued due to possible arrhythmia inducing effects.
