The history of this admission goes back to a previous admission in [**2188-9-14**] when the patient was admitted for repair of an incarcerated paraileostomal hernia in the setting of a prior hernia repair.
Following that operation, the patient appeared to be doing well and was, however, readmitted to the hospital on [**2188-10-13**] until [**2188-10-21**] with what appeared to be left upper quadrant pain and a hematoma but there was nothing that appeared to warrant surgery.
PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post panproctocolectomy for Crohn's disease.
Abdomen:  Well-healed midline incision, an ostomy on the left lower quadrant and a drain site in the right upper quadrant.
He was, therefore, placed on intravenous elementation in the hopes that this fistula would either be controlled on its own or that his metabolic state would allow us to reenter his abdomen and try to address the situation.
Nothing further was done and he was, therefore, returned to the floor for further intravenous elementation, antibiotics, and all supportive care.
