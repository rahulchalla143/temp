The patient was transfered to the MICU on [**12-24**] after his post-op course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABG 7.09/94/91), thought to be secondary to obstruction vs. aspiration vs. sedation on meds.
He was started on Levo/Flagyl and intubated.

Pt currently off ACE and statin and this can be addressed with his PCP.
