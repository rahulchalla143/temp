He was started on IV Vanc, Zosyn as well as IVF for his renal insufficiency.
ID/SURGICAL: Pt was started on IV Vanc/Zosyn for his infected ax-fem bypass graft on admission.
Before removal, and ultrasound showed patent right ex-fem bypass graft with no evidence of stenosis.
He went to the OR on [**2137-5-8**] for removal of the graft.
He tolerated the procedure well, but due to the patient's ongoing need for resuscitation, we elected to not to extubate the patient in the operating room, and instead, sent him to the CV ICU for continuing intensive monitoring.
He was continued on Vanc and Zosyn post-op.
He was started on Ciprofloxacin.
Post-operatively, he coded in the ICU for asystole, which responded to chest compressions.
Following his second trip to the OR, he coded once again for asystole, which he quickly bounced back (evidenced by palpable femoral pulses) after chest compressions.
Pt was intubated intra-operatively and weaned slowly off the vent after his second surgery once his RISB scores were low and felt safe to do so.
He tolerated extubation without difficulty.
Post-operatively, he was started on tube feeds briefly while intubated through an NGT, though this was discontinued on extubation.
He was taking poor POs at this point, and a nutrition consult recommended placement of a Dobhoff tube and resuming tube feeds.
He was switched to HD and more fluid was taken off.
He went for multiple treatments on a T TH Sa schedule, though after discussing with the legal guardian and the patient himself, Mr. [**Known lastname **] decided he did not want further diaylsis and wanted his right IJ removed.
His pain was controlled throughout his course, he required IV fentanyl while in the ICU, though is now controlled on PO dilaudid 2-4mg Q3:PRN.
DISPO: After the discussion was made and the DNR/DNI status was re-instated, the patient decided he would prefer not to have further interventions performed.
