Patient denies chest pain, fevers, chills.
- Iron deficiency anemia - GERD - Basal cell carcinoma status post excision - Intrapyloric duodenal mass status post EUS and EGD with biopsy -[**2125-9-13**] liver transplant   Social History: Lives with her husband.
After the ARF resolved, she developed a LGIB related to hemorrhoids that required 8 pRBC and FFP as well as a surgical intervention in the MICU.
All potential offending medications were witheld, and an octreotide drip with midodrine were started.
Given the degree of bleeding, the patient was intubated for airway protection in setting of large volume resucscitation.
Surgery performed an anoscopy and sutured the hemorroids and then placed rectal packing.
In total she received 8 units of PRBCs and 9 units of FFP while in the MICU.
It took several days for her sedative medications (fentanyl and versed) to clear likely due to impaired hepatic metabolism, but she was ultimately extubated on [**2125-9-3**].
Patient developed a drug rash and low grade fever in setting of being started on Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis while in the MICU.
Drug rash, fever, and eosinophilia resolved with removal of ceftriaxone.
This was either related to the use of Vancomycin or the clearance of the steroids.
Derm was reconsulted, abx were switched to linezolid and triamcinolone creams used liberally.
Rash resolved after abx discontinuation and treatment (as per derm).
Her PICC was pulled and she was started on linezolid given her potential sensitivity to vanc.
Patient was taken to OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for liver transplant following visual and surgical inspection for gastric mass.
Based upon the patient's extensive portal hypertension and varices, performing a gastrotomy to try to visualize or to palpate a lesion that we could not palpate externally was not warranted and so that portion of the procedure was terminated and the liver transplant procedure moved forward.
She received 20 units of RBCs, 24 units FFP, 3 bags of platelets and received 3500 cc plasmalyte The patient tolerated the surgery and was transferred to the SICU where she received  and additional 2 units RBCs and 1 bag platelets.
She was restarted on tube feeds, which was eventually changed over to cycled tube feeds.
She was started on PO intake on POD 3 and the tube feeds were ramped up to goal.
She has some abdominal pain when the tube feeds were cut to 14 hour cycle and the time was lengthened and volume decreased to evaluate her tolerance, however by time of discharge she returned to continuous tube feeds and was changed to a renal formula due to hyperkalemia The drain behind the liver continued with very high ascitic fluid output, 2-3 Liters daily.
The output was replaced initially, and then nearing time of discharge, fluid boluses were given several days in a row as her creatinine rose to 1.4 from a nadir of 1.0.
The drain was pulled on the day of discharge and a suture placed with good effect.
She was having reservations about doing her own insulin injections.
