In the Emergency Department, the patient was started on ceftazidime for pseudomonal coverage, based on his past episode of urosepsis.
The patient was also started on intravenous normal saline, and his blood pressures hovered at around 100 systolic.
The patient was also given one unit of packed red blood cells for demand-related ischemia.
At this point, the patient was given 80 mg of intravenous lasix, was put on non-rebreather, and also given Solu-Medrol, Demerol, and albuterol.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2157**] 2.
Status post appendectomy 10.
Lasix 40 mg by mouth once daily 2.
Lopressor 50 mg by mouth every morning, 25 mg by mouth daily at bedtime 3.
Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day 4.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily 5.
Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once daily 6.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day 7.
Iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth three times a day  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
It was thought that this myocardial infarction was secondary to demand ischemia because of the patient's urosepsis and associated tachycardia.
The patient was continued on his aspirin.
His blood pressure medications were initially held secondary to hypotension.
However, as this was controlled, he was placed back on a low dose of Lopressor in order to decrease myocardial demand.
The patient was also initially started on weight-based protocol of heparin with bolus.
Eventually the patient was also restarted on a low dose of Captopril once his pressures were stabilized.
Given the patient's myocardial infarction, an ACE inhibitor was certainly indicated.
The patient received three consecutive doses of 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor.
Eventually the patient consented to DC cardioversion.
In addition, the patient was started on amiodarone.
He was given a loading dose with intravenous, and then started on 400 mg by mouth three times a day.
The patient was also continued on his heparin, now for anticoagulation secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Heparin was eventually stopped, and Lovenox was started at 80 mg subcutaneously twice a day.
At the same time, the patient was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg by mouth once daily.
At this point, he received one unit of packed red blood cells without receiving pre-medication with lasix.
The patient was given 40 mg of intravenous lasix, and restarted on a standing dose of lasix.
In order to quantify the patient's new cardiac status following his myocardial infarction, an echocardiogram was obtained.
The patient's blood pressure was well controlled at the end of the admission on his standing dose of lasix, 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day of Lopressor, and 6.25 mg by mouth three times a day of Captopril.
The patient was started initially on ceftazidime, but was then converted to ceftriaxone 1 gram every 24 hours after sensitivities were posted.
Blood cultures grew only one out of four bottles of proteus species.
For discharge, the patient was switched to cefpodoxime at a dose of 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours.
The patient is to take a total dose of antibiotics for 14 days.
It is unlikely, however, that these changes could account for the patient's rise in liver function tests, and then fall after the amiodarone was discontinued.
The patient got a total of two units of packed red blood cells.
Furosemide 40 mg by mouth once daily 2.
Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours 3.
Cefpodoxime 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours through [**8-7**] 4.
Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day 5.
Captopril 6.25 mg by mouth three times a day 6.
Calcium carbonate 500 mg by mouth three times a day 7.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily 8.
Coumadin 2.5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime 9.
Ambien 5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed for insomnia 10.
Senna one tablet by mouth twice a day as needed 11.
Simethicone 40 to 80 mg by mouth four times a day as needed for indigestion 12.
Normal regular insulin sliding scale 13.
Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth daily at bedtime 14.
Atrovent nebulizers, one nebulizer every four hours as needed for wheezing 15.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth every 24 hours 16.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day  as needed  FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will need to have his INR checked every other day until it is within therapeutic range between 2.5 and 3.0.
