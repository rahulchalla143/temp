She has multiple skin tears which occur with minimal mechanical trauma.
She has a history of an aortobifemoral stent which was placed endovascularly in [**2156-5-23**] for aortic thrombus as well as bilateral femoral artery cutdowns with thrombectomy for clot at the same time.
VASCULAR ROS: Other: As HPI, multiple BLE ulcers and skin tears .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: aortobifemoral stent placement, CHF (last EF <45%), PVD, HOLD, HTN, CKD, COPD, afib on coumadin, previous aortic clots  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: bilateral total hip replacement, bilateral total knee replacement, endovacular aortobifem stent, bilateral femoral artery cutdowns    Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: denies tob/etoh/illicits   Family History: non contrib  Pertinent Results: CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of [**2156-6-29**]  CT CHEST:  The thyroid gland appears heterogeneous, possibly containing subcentimeter hypodense lesions inferiorly (2, 12), which could be assessed by ultrasound if not already performed.
The heart demonstrates severe biatrial enlargement and multivessel coronary arterial calcifications as well as mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications.
The left kidney demonstrates delayed nephrogram and scattered areas of wedge-shaped transcortical hypoattenuation, consistent with renal infarction.
Patient is status post aortobiliac stent grafting.
Bilateral total knee arthroplasty generates considerable metal streak artifacts, limiting below assessment.
From the mid superficial femoral artery distally, there is complete non-opacification of distal arterial branches including trifurcation of anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, which is likely related to slow flow, though high grade  obstruction proximally is not excluded.
Patient is status post bilateral total hip arthroplasty and bilateral total knee arthroplasty with hardware grossly in expected locations.
[**2156-6-30**] arterial duplex  IMPRESSION:  Severely diminished flow in the left subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar arteries suggesting proximal left subclavian stenosis.
Right lower lobe ground-glass opacity with secretions at the right lower lobe bronchi, could represent a small amount of aspiration.
Rim enhancing fluid collection anterior to R iliacus reduced in size.
She was heparized and emergently taken to the OR for thrombectomy, [**Hospital1 **]-iliac stenting, resection of L CFA aneurysm with PTFE interposition grafts and b/l LE fasciotomies.
Nitropaste was applied without improvement, so on POD2 she underwent angioplasy and steting of her L subclavian artery with improvement in her blood flow.
She was started on plavix in addition to her heparin gtt.
She was continued on antibiotics and on POD6/4 she underwent debridement of her R leg and heel and was noted to have extensive necrotic/nonviable muscle.
She underwent an emergent pericardial window on POD 7/5/1/.
on POD 8/6/2/1 she underwent guillotine right AKA.
She was weaned off pressors, eventually extubated and started on tube feeds by NG tube, and was transferred to the VICU with VAC placement over her R AKA site.
During this time she underwent repeated speech and swallow evals without success, she was, however transitioned to coumadin and NG tube meds.
On that same day she suffered from recurrent episodes of VTach, and was transiently placed on a lidocaine gtt after consult with electrophysiology.
On POD 30/28/23/22/15 she underwent PEG placement by the ACS service.
The following day she had her staples removed from her initial operation and her antibiotics were stopped.
The following day she became hypotensive, transiently requiring pressors and a BAL was performed showing pseudomonas, and she was noted to have cellulitis of her LLE and she was restarted on antibiotics.
She improved and was transiently weaned to PSV, however due to concern over her multiple cardiac and respiratory arrests and her multiple intubations, she underwent tracheostomy placement by ACS on POD 39/37/32/31/24/9.
However, since her PEG tract was not matured she returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, closure gastrostomy, and placement of jejunal feeding tube.
The following day she had a PICC line placed and had her last central line removed.
