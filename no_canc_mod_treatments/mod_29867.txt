TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the brain without the administration of IV contrast.
Subsequently rapid axial imaging as performed through the brain after the administration of IV contrast.
Subsequently on a separate workstation, curved reformats, 3D volume-rendered images, and maximum intensity projection images were created and reviewed.
Redemonstration of the left occipital hypodense area representing recent infarction.
He was admitted to the Neuro ICU and kept NPO for angio.
He was on a heparin drip.
On [**1-19**] the heparin drip was stopped and SQH and ASA were started.
