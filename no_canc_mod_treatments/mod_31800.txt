CT shows no passage of contrast thru colon but free air within peritoneal cavity  Postop CXR: diffuse bilat infiltrates  Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 5261**] presented to the ED on [**5-10**] in need of an immediate surgical intervention.
After an extensive discussion with her & her daughter, [**Name (NI) **], she opted for an exploratory laparotomy, fully aware of the likelihood of a protracted hospital stay with placement of tracheostomy and feeding tubes.
There was a perforation near the splenic flexure with spilled stool, and a subtotal colectomy was performed with an end ileostomy, distal pouch & feeding tube placement.
Her pain was controlled with codeine & tylenol and ultimately with tylenol alone.
She was given trazodone QHS to help with sleep.
Hypertension treated with lopressor & hydralazine.
Despite being extubated on POD2, she required frequent chest PT, suctioning & neb treatments postop.
The first of these decompensations was due to pneumonia, and the second from volume overload/CHF, for which she was reintubated on [**5-21**].
She underwent an open tracheostomy on [**5-23**], and her dependence on mechanical ventilation was gradually weaned.
FEN: Ms [**Known lastname 5261**] takes lasix at home, but is not lasix dependent.
She was sustained perioperatively with TPN and eventually tolerated tube feeds via the J port of her [**Last Name (un) **] tube.
GI: Her colostomy was functional soon after surgery, and she was switched from TPN to tube feeds at that time.
She receives protonix for GI prophylaxis.
This was eventually treated with a VAC dressing (last changed [**5-29**]).
HEME: She required several RBC transfusions during her admission for iron deficiency anemia but also for blood loss anemia.
When she returned to the SICU with pneumonia, she was treated with a 10 day course of levaquin with improvement.
