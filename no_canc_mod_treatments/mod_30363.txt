Unsuccessful cervical MRA, due to apparent patient intolerance of gadolinium contrast material.
We started pt on 81 mg of aspirin on [**8-20**].
Patient will need anticoagulation for his afib to prevent further strokes.
Therefore it was determined, through planning with pt's PCP that he will be started on dabigatran rather than coumadin when he sees her on [**8-28**].
# CARDS: We initially put pt only on atenolol at 50mg (half of pt's home dose) and allowed BP to autoregulate, but pt's SBP's then regularly in the 160-180's.
On day prior to discharge we restarted pt on his home lisinopril 40mg QD, HCTZ 25mg QD and clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **].
In addition, we started pt on simvasatin 40mg QD for an LDL of 170.
Patient's TTE on [**8-20**] showed LV hypokinesis and LA enlargement, both of which puts pt at increased risk of clot, and therefore as above, decided to put pt on anticoagulation with dabigatran after discharge.
# ID: pt initially presented with a leukocytosis at 12, which increased to 18.8 after receving a dose of steroids when it was initially suspected that his PICA infarct was a mass (later proved false by further imaging).
# CODE: Full Code  PENDING RESULTS: None  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to be started on dabigatran when he sees his PCP on [**8-28**].
