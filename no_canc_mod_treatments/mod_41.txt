At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her on a one week course of levofloxacin.
She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the medicine service.
Antibiotics were not continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or leukocytosis.
Pulmonary HTN, on 2L/nc @ home, PDA per echo [**2120-11-5**] 3. h/o exudative pleural effusion, treated with talc for pleuredesis ([**2128-2-17**]) 4.
<b>PSHx:</b> - s/p IM nail right humerus ([**2134-3-2**]), secondary to fall - s/p Open posterior treatment of cervical fractures at C3, cervical laminectomy at C2-C4, posterior arthrodesis, C3-C4 ([**2134-3-2**]), seconadary to fall - s/p EGD([**2129**]) gastritis/duodenitis and HP, rx recommended but no documentation of eradication - s/p MVA ([**12/2127**]) - s/p Colonoscopy [**2124**] (two small adenomas) & [**8-28**] (2 sessile sigmoid polyps, path: mucosal prolapse) - s/p TAH for fibroids.
Three discrete new irregularly-shaped focal opacities demonstrated within the left upper lobe that, given multiplicity and configuration, are likely related to an active infectious or inflammatory proces, much less likely to be synchronous bronchogenic carcinoma.
#Hypoxia/Atypical Pneumonia/Pulmonary hypertension/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension from volume overload and atypical pneumonia.
She was diuresed and treated with azithromycin with improvement in her symptoms.
The patient did well and was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor and improved with antibiotics and further diuresis and was discharged on home oxygen of 2-3L NC.
Given that over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of 89-93%.
She was ruled out for TB with 3 negative sputa for AFB and patient received course of azithromycin.
#Acute on chronic diastolic Heart Failure: As above patient was admitted in volume overload.
Patient was ultimately discharged euvolemic on regimen of Lasix 80mg once daily to keep her euvolemic and TBB even.
#Acute on Chronic renal Failure: During diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis.
At this point diuresis was stopped, gentle fluids were given, and diuretics were stared when renal function had returned to [**Location 213**].
Lisinopril was held and should be started 3 days after discharge at 2.5mg po daily.
# Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home regimen.
Diltiazem was continued but Lisinopril was held during acute renal failure.
