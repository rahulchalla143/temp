____________________________________ [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39767**], M.S., CCC-SLP     Brief Hospital Course:    77F who was admitted on [**2139-8-31**] and had a right carotid endarterectomy with bovine pericardial patch angioplasty.
She was requiring a nitro gtt and intermittent hydralazine to keep her blood pressures in the desired range of 100-140.
Overnight she had some tachypnea and scattered wheezes, which improved after a nebulizer treatment and she maintained her sats on low nasal cannula.
Her neck incision did slowly ooze blood, requiring a few dressing changes but there was no airway compression or rapidly expanding hematoma.
On [**9-1**], POD #1, the patient continued to have some increased work of breathing,decreased urine output, CXR showed some fluid overload and she was given lasix 80mg IV and put out about 100 cc of urine hourly throughout the day.
At 9pm, her work of breathing continued to increase with RR 30-35, sats mid 90's, an additional 40mg of lasix was given, without much improvement in her respiratory status.
A nonrebreather was placed and the patient continued to breath 30-42 times a minute satting 90-98%.
The patient was transferred to the ICU and intubated for flash pulmonary edema.
BNP was increased to 13,000, she also had a troponin leak to peak of .72.
Her creatinine trended up to the 2.6-3.0 range with adequate urine output and nephrology was consulted.
She was extubated and required reintubation after 2 hours for tachypnea, hypertension, respiratory distress.
On [**9-4**], POD#4 it was decided to start a three day course of methylprednisolone for upper airway edema secondary to multiple attempts at intubation/extubation.
She rested on the ventilator over the weekend during this steroid course and we continued diuresis, monitoring her creatinine.
Her blood pressure throughout her hospital stay was difficult to control and she required standing metoprolol, hydralazine, addition of PO agents, and intermittent IV hydralazine/metoprolol at times.
The patient completed her steroid course and was extubated on [**9-7**], and there was a question of heme-tinged output from her OGT, protonix was added.
Diamox was used for ongoing diuresis, bicarb and creatinine were monitored with a goal of [**1-31**].5 L negative daily.
She was given one day of trophic TF through a dophoff tube and then passed a bedside swallow test on [**9-11**].
We felt as if she would benefit from home PT as she strengthens.
Her discharge plan involves BP monitoring on a new regimen, and close follow up to alter that regimen as necessary.
Additionally, she will finish her 2 week course of IV antibiotics for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
