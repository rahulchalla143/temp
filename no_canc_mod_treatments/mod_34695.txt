[**9-3**] c. cath 1.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal left circumflex with a bare metal stent.
She was quickly weaned off of the balloon pump but remained on pressors for several days for suspected concomitant septic shock.
Several days after her stent she was able to be weaned from pressors and then several days after that she was able to be weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
After extubation she actually became hypertensive and required antihypertensive medication.
Her pulmonary edema responded reliably and quickly to IV nitro drip and she continued to require diuresis for several days after extubation but her functional status improved daily w/ diuresis.
She was initially started on amiodarone but once she clinically improved and it was felt that she no longer had triggers for ectopy this was stopped.
Her septic shock initially prompted concern for abdominal source as she grimaced when pressure was applied to her RUQ and her labs were concerning for cholestasis.
We started her on her home Lasix dose and added hydrochlorthiazide to potentiate the loop diuretic.
Her current antihypertensive regimen includes lisinopril, hydrochlorthiazide, Lasix, and metoprolol.
# Diabetes: She currently has adequate glycemic control on regular insulin sliding scale and 22U glargine qhs.
