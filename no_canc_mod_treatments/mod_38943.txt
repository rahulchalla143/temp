In brief, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2149-5-23**], admitted on [**2149-5-21**] for failed osteomyelitis treatment on vanc and switched to daptomycin.
His bactrim PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] was also discontinued for concern of worseing CKD and after a 5 day gap was switched to dapsone on [**2149-5-27**].
The patient started noticing dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and increasing O2 requirement on [**2149-5-31**] up to 6LNC from his baseline of 1-2LNC.
Sent set of blood cx and gave him Duonebs and Solumedrol 125mg IV ONCE.
Pt then taken off NRB and satting 90-93% on 6LNC.
He was given gabapentin 400mg PO ONCE, vancomycin 1gm IV ONCE, cefepime 2mg IV ONCE, azithromycin 500mg IV ONCE.

Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old man with history of DMII, IPF on prednisone 20, chronic MRSA osteomyelitis since [**9-17**] after ankle fracture, PAF on coumadin presents to [**Hospital3 **] ED on [**2149-6-3**] after 3 days of worsening dyspnea.
# Hypoxia/respiratory failure: Patient on home 2L 02 and admitted with hypoxic respiratory distress and required full face bipap (failed nasal CPAP) for the first 24-36 hours.
He was treated with high dose IV steroids (125 q6 for 48 hours) for ?
IPF flare, Vanc/Cefepime/Levoflox for HAP and he was diuresed with IV lasix.
His prednisone was decreased to 60 then 50 then 40mg po.
His antbiotics were continued for an 8 day course.
He was continued on full face Bipap overnight rather than nasal Bipap.
Since then the patient's steroid requirement was as low as 10mg po daily but the he was hopsitalized in [**State **] last [**Month (only) 205**] with respiratory failure and since then has remained on 20mg prednisone and home 02.
Patient's CT scan here was not consistent with IPF and it is not the usual standard here to diagnose IPF on transbronchial biopsy (typically transthoracic).
Patient was continued on Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (concern at an earlier admission that he had renal failure from Bactrim).
Vitamin D, Calcium, and a PPI were initially for his steroid course.
After significant diuresis the kidney function improved to baseline at 1.6, likely poor forward flow from CHF.
Coumadin was increased to 7.5 mg to maintain goal INR [**3-13**].
Daptomycin was subsequently restarted after he completed 8 days of his HAP regimen.
# DM: Exacerbated by steroids at present.
He was maintained on Lantus 70 QAM, 60 QPM plus SSI.
Please check electrolytes and kidney function at the next visit and decide whether to decrease bumetamide to qdaily instead of [**Hospital1 **] based on volume status and kidney function.
Please check INR and adjust coumadin dose according.
Please check kidney function and ajdust Daptomycin dose frequency accordingly.
