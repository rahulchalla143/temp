A post-pyloric feeding tube was placed on HD 5 for nutritional support.
Transjugular bx on HD7 showed: 1) Moderate lobular predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate with numerous intracytoplasmic hyaline and mild fatty change; 2)Trichrome stain shows marked sinusoidal fibrosis with architectural distortion.
Prednisone 20mg PO daily started HD 12 (pt not responding to [**Name (NI) 57563**]).
However, due to increased ALT and AST on HD20, Prednisone 20mg was reinstituted.
Patient received vitamin K. Albumin was low, but was stable during hospitalization.
Furosemide and Spironolactone started on HD2.
Tx paracentesis on HD 10.
Tx paracentesis on HD16 (WBC 5).
Tx paracentesis on HD19 (WBC 6).
Encephalopathy: The patient had Grade I throughout most of the hospitalization (subtle asterixis, drowsiness, agitation, and mild confusion).
She was initially treated w/ Lactulose and Metronidazole.
On HD 18 lactulose was discontinued due to increasing abdominal distention with tympanitic bowel and diarrhea with > 5 BM per day.
Lactulose was re-considered HD20-22 due to improving diarrhea.
Patient developed increasing somnolence and confusion on HD 25.
Foley catheter placed to better monitor urine output.
Considered using Octreotide, Midodrine, and Albumin in MICU if urine output dropped lower.
Patient responded to fluid challege and diuretics; her urine output increased by HD14-15.
However, the patient continued to be hyponatremic, with a sodium that declined to 119, therefore diuretics were held on HD 19.
Patient was given fluid in the form of PRBC and 80 IV lasix, but did not respond.
They did not recommend hemodialysis due to the overall poor prognosis.
3) Hypoxemia On HD26 patient developed hypoxic respiratory distress with oxygen saturation that decreased to 86% off nasal cannula and increasing respiratory rate.
Oxygenation improved to 96% with 6L NC and 15 L shovel mask.
4) Pneumonia Presumed pneumonia on admission treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole.
Later in hospitalization, the patient was treated for a possible nosocomial pneumonia with 10 days of levofloxacin and zosyn.
As patient remained afebrile, antibiotics were discontinued at the end of this course on HD18.
She was started on Metronidazole for emipiric C diff treatment and stool cultures were obtained which came back positive for C diff.
CT scan was deferred as care was redirected to comfort measures only.
This was treated with holding the diuretics and fluid restriction.
In the MICU she was started on hypertonic saline which improved her serum sodium slightly.
A post pyloric feeding tube was placed on HD5 for aggressive tube feeds due to poor PO intake.
7) Prophylaxis: Pt did not receive DVT prophylaxis due to INR >2.0.
8) Code Status: On HD 26 patient was transferred to the intensive care unit due to respiratory distress and anuria.
The family was in favor of comfort measures as prognosis was grave and the patient had expressed discomfort, pain, and a wish to die.
The patient's care was then refocused on comfort measures.
