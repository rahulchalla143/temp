In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
If further characterization is needed, an MRI with contrast can be performed.
Two upper left neck drains end in the parapharyngeal space (medial to the carotid), lower neck drain ends between the left IJ and common carotid at the level of the lower pole of the thyroid gland.
Two upper left neck drains are again visualized, with the first drain slightly retracted with the tip now located anterior to the carotid and adjacent to the hyoid bone that was posteromedial to the carotid previously and the lower neck drain remaining in stable position between the left internal jugular and common carotid.
There is evidence of soft tissue edema surrounding the fluid collections on the left side of the neck, causing mass effect on the mid cervical segment of the internal jugular vein and slow flow with a possible adherent non-occlusive thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY PRIOR TO FLOOR TRANSFER PER MEDICINE TEAM (NO SUMMARY AVAILABLE FROM TICU): 29 yo F with PMH idiopathic neutropenia who presented with neck swelling and pain after sore throat and constitutional symptoms, found to have infection and fluid collections in deep neck spaces (retropharyngeal and carotid sheath spaces).
She was intubated for airway protection and taken to OR for debridement and drainage of dishwater-colored fluid which has grew GAS on culture.
Pt had 3 drains placed and 1 drain removed prior to transfer from TICU.
She had been on unasyn, vanc, and clinda consistently since admission for abx coverage at the time of transfer to floor.
repeat imaging the evening [**2124-2-28**] showed significant improvement in fluid collections and ENT thought pt could continue to be managed with drains and abx (no further OR) unless clinical picture changed.
There was some concern for mediastinitis due to rash on chest and edema seen on CT, but that improved by continuing antibiotics and did not recur.
Heme was consulted and placed pt on G-CSF for neutropenia.
[**Hospital 662**] HOSPITAL COURSE 29 yo F with PMH idiopathic neutropenia who presenting with deep neck space infection s/p debridement and drainage.
# neck space infection: culture growing GAS.
pt was s/p drainage by ENT with clinical improvement on abx.
2 drains still in place when pt called out to floor and pt was on vanc/unasyn/clinda.
Drains were removed by ENT and replaced with wicks.
She continued to improve clinically on abx and s/p drain removal.
ID suspected drug fever [**12-23**] unasyn because her LFTs bumped at the same time as well.
Also suspected immune reconstitution as ANC had increased significantly that day.
Unasyn was stopped and LFTs trended down.
# neutropenia: heme suspects this is WHIM syndrome, a gene mutation in CXCR4 that leads to sequestration of neutrophils in bone marrow.
Pt given GCSF until neutropenia resolved, then this was stopped.
improved to s/p vitamin K  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - follow up with [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 4898**] clinic and cont IV abx per their recs - follow up with heme/onc re: neutropenia - follow up with ENT  Medications on Admission: ranitidine  Discharge Medications: 1.

You were intubated to protect your airway and the area of infection was debrided and drains placed to help remove the fluid.
You were also started on antibiotics.
The drains were removed and you should continue applying and changing the wicks twice a day as instructed by the  ear nose and throat (ENT) doctors.
You will be continued on IV antibiotics (ertapenem) to treat any remaining infection.
At this time, it is thought that the risks of blood thinner medications are greater than the benefit.
