She is being admitted to the ICU for observation after undergoing replacement of her tracheostomy tube earlier today.
Sputum cultures at this time supposedly grew pseudomonas and she was treated with Aztreonam.
Her tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a longer one; no stent was placed at the time.
She was taken back to the OR for insertion of a Y stent across the area of tracheomalacia and her tracheostomy was replaced as well.
The patient presented to the [**Hospital **] clinic for routine follow-up for evaluation of her tracheostomy and Y stent.
She denies any fevers, chills, dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
On further examination, her tracheostomy tube was found to be displaced proximally.
As a result, she underwent change of her tube this afternoon.
