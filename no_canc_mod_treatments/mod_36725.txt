History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who was recently on a lowered Coumadin dose because of a UTI and antibiotics who presented with acute pain of her left lower extremity.
Of note, the patient in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year had a similar episode when she was subtherapeutic on Coumadin and required an embolectomy.
Today, the patient and her family decided that they wish to have another procedure in order to restore flow to her left leg.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PE: Afebrile A&Ox3, NAD.
R heel with beginning of pressure ulcer, skin intact.
Monitored anesthesia care was used and local anesthesia was given after a time-out was performed and vancomycin and gentamicin were given for preoperative antibiotics.
There was extensive scar in the common femoral artery area but ultimately the artery was encircled with vessel loops proximally and the SFA and profunda were encircled with vessel loops.
The area of the prior arteriotomy closure was seen to and, after the patient was given 4000 units of intravenous heparin, a transverse arteriotomy was performed.
A #3 embolectomy catheter was passed down the profunda and there was no evidence of clot.
A #4 [**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy catheter was passed down the SFA with multiple passes and ultimately a large amount of thrombus was pulled out of the SFA and there was finally good bleeding.
Heparinized saline was infused into the artery.
Hemostasis was obtained and the wound was closed in layers using 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl and staples for the skin.
The patient had been awake the whole time and tolerated the procedure well and was taken back to the intensive care unit in stable condition.
She required pressors in the ICU to maintain her blood pressure in the normal range and was soon weaned off POD 1.
She was maintained on a heparin drip while bridging to coumadin (her INR was 1.2).
On the day of discharge, she recieved 60 mg Lovenox and 2mg of Coumadin.
Because of her subtherapeutic INR, she will either need to be 1) placed on Lovenox lifetime without any need for warfarin or 2) Lovenox-Warfarin bridge until her INR is therapeutic.
