Admission Date:  [**2178-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: cough Reason for MICU transfer: septic shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Central Line Removal  History of Present Illness: 43 year old man who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2178-4-13**] with productive cough, fever and pleuritic chest pain.
Initially was noted to be in SVT, given adenosine with conversion to sinus.
He was intubated for respiratory failure and concern for ARDS.
Sedation was difficult and required fentanyl, ativan, propofol and vecuronium.
He was ventilated on pressure control.
He had hypotension requiring both norepinephrine and vasopressin for pressor support.
He was seen by nephrology at the OSH who suspected ATN and recommended continued IV hydration.
On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated, on pressure support ventilation, comfortable appearing.
Review of systems: unable to obtain due to sedation and intubation  Past Medical History: ruptured appendix and appendectomy   Social History: Works as a realtor, lives with a male partner.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: 98.7 92 109/68 on pressure control, changed to AC 26 450mL 100% FIO2 and PEEP 10 on arrival, sedated with fentanyl and propofol General: intubated, sedated, not responding to voice HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, right subclavian line c/d/i CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: rhonchi anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact .
The tip of the endotracheal tube is located directly at the carina.
The tube should be pulled back by 2 to 3 cm.
Three large thick-walled cavitary lesions likely represent a necrotizing pneumonia in this patient with prior streptococcal bacteremia.
Given the documented Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, this may represent infectious otomastoiditis, rather than simply effusions due recent intubation and prolonged supine positioning.
He was treated initially with ceftriaxone, later broadened to cefepime and ciprofloxacin due to lack of improvement on the ventilator.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**4-18**] to evaluate for additional pulmonary pathogens and was negative.
He was initially improving on the antibiotics but then spiked fevers on [**4-20**] and [**4-21**].
ID was consulted and he was treated empirically for VAP with linezolid, cefepime, tobramycin, and flagyl.
He continued to improve so antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone with transition to levofloxacin and flagyl and the patient will complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and flagyl which will end on [**2178-5-5**].
He was ventilated with ARDS net protocol although sedation was very difficult (likely due to underlying alcohol use of 4+ drinks daily).
He was initially sedated with propofol, fentanyl and versed.
Propofol was stopped on [**4-16**] once hypertriglyceridemia (TG 1000s) was noted.
He was extubated on [**4-24**], and was able to be weaned to room air on the floor with ambulatory O2 saturations >92% on room air.
# Agitation: Patient was extremely agitation while on the ventilator, rquiring large doses of fentanyl and versed.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended tapering the above medications over the next 4-5 days, starting from the day of MICU call-out ([**4-26**]).
He did not require haloperidol on the floor, and became progressively more oriented to the point at which upon discharge he was not disoriented at all and his attention had returned nearly to baseline.
