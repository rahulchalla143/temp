FINDINGS: Again demonstrated are multiple left-sided facial fractures including left zygomatic, left lateral orbital wall, left lateral maxillary sinus, anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus, orbital floor fracture, and fracture of the lateral wall of the left sphenoid sinus that is adjacent to, but not definitively involving the carotid artery course.
FOUR VIEWS, LEFT TIBIA/FIBULA: Two lag screws fixate a left medial malleolar fracture.
On further review of films it was decided to take him to the OR for ORIF of his left medial malleolus and placement of a rod in his left tibia.
For his facial fractures he was started on Clindamycin which continued for 5 days.
Ophthalmology evaluation revealed intact globes both eyes and a stable right posterior vitreous detachment; he was started on artifical tears per Opth recommendation.
He remained intubated secondary to poor respiratory effort felt related to pain.
Pain Service was consulted for epidural analgesia and patient was eventually weaned and extubated on POD 2 and was transferred from the Trauma ICU to the floor.
He was on PCA Dilaudid which was discontinued; Dilaudid subcutaneous injections for emergency breakthrough pain and Neurontin.
Fentanyl 50 mcg patch was added to his pain medication regimen.
Because of his multiple orthopedics injuries the pain medications will require further adjustment once he goes to rehab.
Psychiatry was consulted to rule out depression, felt symptoms more likely consistent with Adjustment Disorder and recommended Remeron 15 mg @ hs.
They have also recommended that patient receive Psychiatry consult once at rehab.
