[**2114-7-3**] MRI/MRA HEAD 1.
Acyclovir and levofloxacin, as well as sedatives she was given in the ICU may have contributed to her MS given her poor renal and hepatic clearance (propofol, d/c on [**7-4**]; morphine, dosed 2mg on [**7-6**], and ?amt on [**7-4**]).
Initially, following transfer from the ICU, her mental status improved and was thought to be secondary to medications over her stay .
Hepatic encephalopathy is still a possibility, with her elevated ammonia (84 umol/L), but was not encephalopathic during previous hospital stay and did not receive lactulose at that time; she received lactulose throughout this admission.
Delirium tremens was also considered, however her history and speaking with her family speaks against this.
The patient was diuresed and placed on BiPAP for one day.
Given her mental status changes, she was switched from levofloxacin to clindamycin for the final two days of her course.
The differential diagnosis considered in a patient with HIV, HepC, Cirrhosis and DM2 was broad and included hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, HIV-associated encephalopathy (20% of HIV encephalopathy is first presentation of symptomatic disease), toxins, withdrawal (given her polysubstance abuse), malignancy (lymphoma or primary or secondary tumor) vasculitidites (mixed cryos, microscopic polyarteritis, primary CNS vasculitis), hemmorhagic stroke, or OI with HIV (including toxo, crypto, TB, listeria, PML).
Per ID's recommendation, a unilateral hip x-ray was conducted on [**7-10**] and showed no evidence of osteomyeolitis.
Leukocytosis The patient was started on Levofloxacin/Flagyl on [**7-5**] for RLL infiltrate seen on CXR and increasing WBC (see above).
The Levofloxacin was switched to clindamycin [**7-10**] for the 2 remaining days of the course.
She maintained on metroprolol 37.5 mg PO TID, lisinopril 5mg PO daily, and restarted on her furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.
Hepatic encephalopathy may have been contributing to patient's change in mental status, however she was not receiving lactulose during her entire previous admission, and was NOT encephalopathic therefore unlikely casue of her delta ms. .
