Admission Date:  [**2171-4-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-1-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a complicated medical history who was admitted to [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital on [**2171-3-3**] for small-bowel obstruction, status post laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, who postoperatively, was found to have line sepsis with MRSA.
She was seen by the Department of Neurosurgery at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where the decision was made for long-term antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin and Rifampin.
The patient was very lethargic there and ABG showed a blood gas with pH of 7.39, carbon dioxide 39.6, and oxygen 79.
She was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and given hydrocortisone 200 mg since the patient is on chronic steroids.
Also, of note, the patient had been given Levaquin and Diflucan at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] in the urine.
Repeat ABG there showed a pH of 7.35, pO2 149, pCO2 40, on four liters by nasal cannula.
Per medical history, osteomyelitis of the vertebral bodies of L2 and L3, growing MRSA in blood cultures, diskitis at three sites including T4 to T5, T11 to T12, and L2 to L3; psoas abscess status post percutaneous drainage; polymyalgia rheumatica on steroids chronically; hypertension; rectovaginal fistula; parotid tumor status post right parotid gland resection; bladder spasms and incontinence; macular degeneration; depression/panic disorder, status post sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis; status post herniorrhaphy; status post hysterectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature was 98.0, blood pressure 117/38, heart rate 76, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on four liters by nasal cannula.
SKIN:  Maculopapular rash over chest, neck, back, and posterior thigh.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**4-4**], showed no retroperitoneal bleed and atelectasis of bilateral lungs.
MRI of the spine on [**4-8**], showed diskitis and osteomyelitis of T4-T5 and T11-T12 and L2-L3.
On [**4-8**], MR of the head showed old ischemic disease in the brain stem with a tiny lesion present advanced periventricular microvascular ischemic changes, left-sided mastoiditis of uncertain age and generalized atrophy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by system)  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially came in on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Aztreonam, Rifampin, and Fluconazole for treatment of her psoas abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis.
This was trimmed down to only Vancomycin on admission.
Vancomycin was also considered possibly, although remotely likely cause and this was discontinued and the patient was started on Linezolid.
The patient was continued on Linezolid for the enterococcus, as well as the MRSA, which had grown at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital from both blood cultures.
On [**2171-4-12**], the Vancomycin was discontinued and the patient was started on Linezolid.
Linezolid was then continued for a 28-day course, dating from the time of the surgery [**4-15**].
Urine culture subcutaneously grew Pseudomonas and the patient was started on Tobramycin on [**4-20**] for a seven-day course.
The patient will be continued for a full seven-day course of tobramycin for her Pseudomonas in the urine, as well as the full 28-day course of Linezolid.
Because the patient is already on Linezolid and Tobramycin, we will followup culture results and treat accordingly.
She was started on an Amiodarone drip as per the electrophysiology and cardiology fellow recommendations.
Amiodarone initially at 400 mg p.o.
CT surgery was consulted, who did not recommend surgery at this time because the patient had no evidence of ventricular failure and recommended ongoing medical therapy.
She was started on Lopressor and Hydralazine during her hospital stay to control her blood pressure.
DERMATOLOGY:  The Dermatology Service was consulted on [**4-10**] to evaluate the rash, which was thought most like to Cephalosporins or Lasix as the patient has a Sulfa allergy, more remotely Vancomycin was a possibility.
The patient was initially treated with Fexofenadine, which was discontinued on [**4-18**], Synalar and hydrated petroleum and Aveeno baths, the rash gradually improved and by the time of discharge it was almost completely resolved except for some light flaking of the skin mostly of the lower extremities.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient's TSH was checked and elevated at 22.
She was gradually weaned from high-dose steroids used during her initial days of hospitalization down to Prednisone 15 mg p.o.q.d.
The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood cells throughout her hospital stay.
This gradually improved with hydration and thought to be prerenal in etiology.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  This patient was started on TPN on [**2171-4-11**] and on tube feeds [**4-18**].
She was gradually taken off TPN on [**4-24**], when she was at goal with her tube feeds.
She was then started on a clear diet with the intention of transitioning her from tube feeds to a regular p.o.
The NG tube will likely be removed before discharge.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a small bowel obstruction at the outside hospital and had a laparotomy and lysis of adhesions there.
She continued with abdominal pain during her hospital stay here and she was treated with Tramadol and Neurontin.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
Prevacid suspension 30 mg per G-tube q.day.
This should be changed to Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d, once she is taking adequate POs.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.q.d.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Tylenol 650 mg p.o.q.4h.
Dulcolax 15 mg p.o./pr/prn.
Hydralazine 50 mg p.o.q.i.d.
Tobramycin 100 mg IV q.12h.
Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o.q.d.
Tramadol 50 mg p.o.q.i.d.p.r.n.
