Gangrenous cholecystitis cannot be excluded in this study.
After discussion with Surgery/I.R./ERCP attendings, it was determined that the risks of interventions outweighed the benefits.
She is a poor candidate for surgery given her age and comorbidities; there was no lumen to drain percutaneously by I.R.
She was managed conservatively with pain management (IV Dilaudid and TID Acetaminophen).
The patient and her family elected for DNR/DNI, CMO status and efforts were focused on pain control.
Though clinically and radiographically she does not appear to have cholangitis, she was kept on antibiotics to cover for any infection.
She has been on Zosyn, and was sent to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with a PICC line to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics (last day will be [**2142-8-10**]).
She had been off her home dose of Lasix since admission to OSH; she was started on a Lasix drip and was diuresed.
Efforts were still made to diurese the patient for her own comfort, and she is being discharged on diuretics (Lasix 60mg PO TID).
Her Coumadin was held during her stay because of supratherapeutic INR, and at the time of discharge her INR was 2.0, so the Coumadin was still held.
Patient was satting well, but on 4L NC with no O2 requirement at home.
Also, PNA was considered given her leukocytosis, but she had no cough.
DM2, diet-controlled: she was placed on diabetic diet and FS were checked qACHS - they ranged from 90-140 and she required no insulin coverage.
INR trended down while off Coumadin and at the time of discharge was 2.0 - her Coumadin was held at discharge.
Yeast UTI: here, as well as based on OSH cultures.
