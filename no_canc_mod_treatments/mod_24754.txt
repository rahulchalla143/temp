Anticoagulation was not recommended.
She went on to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone.
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm and transitioned to oral Amiodarone which will need to continue for three months postop.
She tolerated beta blockade which was slowly advanced as tolerated.
Acyclovir was eventually increased from her maintenance dose for a herpes zoster breakout on her right upper back.
In addition, she was empirically started on Flagyl for persistent diarrhea(despite negative C. diff cultures), however she developed an additional rash on her buttocks after the first dose of flagyl, so the flagyl was discontinued.
She developed a urinary tract infection for which she was started on Bactrim.
A foley catheter was inserted given her mutiple episodes of incontinence that were adding to skin irritation.
On insertion she was found to be retaining 1400 cc of urine, so the foley catheter was left in.
