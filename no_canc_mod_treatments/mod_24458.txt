CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
CXR [**4-26**] Frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in midline.
Left-sided catheter terminates at the brachiocephalic SVC junction.
CXR [**5-30**] As compared to the prior study, tracheostomy is in place, right PICC line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE [**Age over 90 **]yo M w anoxic brain injury, ventilator-dependent who presented initially with respiratory failure [**2-11**] bilateral pneumonia, status post 14-day antibiotics course with respiratory status at [**Month/Day (2) 5348**], course complicated by renal failure, with decreasing hematocrit likely secondary to chronic GI bleed and anemia of chronic disease, funguria status post foley change, with worsening uremia.
Of note, patient also grew multiple GNR bacteria out of later respiratory cultures, however, elected not to treat this given the fact that he was afebrile, and that his ventilator requirements and secretions were stable.
Pt was maintained on home ventilatory settings over the course of the entire hospitalization with stable oxygenation.
Per discussion with renal service, patient was not a candidate for HD given underlying severe medical comorbidities.
The family wanted to take the patient home, and agreed that if he was to start hemodialysis, he would require placement in a long-term care facility, which they did not want.
He was started on phosphate binders and his potassium began to rise slowly.
Despite fluid restriction, hyponatremia continued to worsen.
The pt's PICC line was removed on [**2189-6-16**], and a peripheral IV was placed.
His C. diff was found to be positive, and he was started on po vancomycin and IV flagyl.
There were never signs of acute bleeding and he remained hemodynamically stable on IV Pantoprazole.
IV PPI was transitioned to PO lansoprazole, however this was stopped due to concern for AIN with urine eosinophilia.
He was put on famotidine 20 mg daily.
His HCT trended down gradually over time probably from frequent phlebotomy and decreased production given worsened renal failure.
However, given transfusion would not reverse his grim prognosis in the setting of worsening renal failure, no transfusion was given.
# Diabetes Mellitus II: His home glipizide was stopped given renal failure initially.
He was continued on sliding scale humalog while and inpatient.
Glipizide was restarted when renal failure stabilized by family request at 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Insulin sliding scale was continued, but titration was limited as family requested his BS be in the 200s range.
Glipizide was stopped again at family's request after he developed anuria.
Responded well to nifedipine for BP control and rate control.
Pt had episodes of tachycardia which responded well to diltiazem which was eventually titrated to 45mg QID.
His diltiazem and prazosin were discontinued.
Urine cx and UA rechecked on [**5-24**] for concern for appearance of urine and mild leukocytosis, he was started on meropenem on [**5-25**] considering a urine cx concerning for ESBL earlier during admission.
Many yeast were noted on UA, so fluconazole was started at 100 mg Q48H for renal dosing.
Fungal cx grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10577**] so pt was continued on fluconazole for 14 day course.
Foley was changed by urology team given significant scrotal edema and difficult foley changes in the past on [**5-26**].
# Gastrostomy tube exchange: G tube found to be cracked at the tip on [**5-25**], GI team was consulted and tube was exchanged without complication.
# Tracheostomy tube.
However, was able to be adjusted by respiratory therapy and the leakage improved.
# Dispo: After lengthy discussions and arrangements, the plan was for pt to go home with supportive services including vent services and visiting nursing in late [**Month (only) 116**].
Family agreed to this, in addition to a plan for monthly trach review and foley changes by urology in the ICU given the challenges of these maintenance care procedures in the setting of the pt requiring continuous ventilation and the difficulty this would pose in the clinic and ED setting.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] that in the absence of a durable treatment for his renal insufficiency, aggressive life-sustaining efforts including CPR and defibrillation were not medically indicated.
