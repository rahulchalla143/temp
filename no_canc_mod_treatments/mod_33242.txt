1) Severe community-acquired pneumonia: Pt was initiated on levofloxacin for CAP, but continued to progress during hospital day #1 with worsening tachypnea, new O2 requirement, and splinting due to severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
She was transferred to the MICU where she required high-flow O2 and vancomycin was empirically added to her antibiotic regimen to cover a post-viral pneumonia.
Sputum samples with no definitive microbiology, but rather moderate oropharyngeal flora, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued.
Serial chest x-rays demonstrated rapid progression of right lower lobe consolidation from HD #1- HD #2, but no interval change following that time period.
Pt slowly improved clinically on antibiotics with morphine PRN for right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and was transferred to the medicine floor on 4L O2 on HD #3.
On [**4-8**] a right pigtail catheter was placed in an attempt to drain the large effusion, CT scan showed significant loculations as well as a thick pleural rind, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for a formal decortication and drainge.
On [**4-9**] the patient was taken to the operating room, a right pulmonary decortication, bronchoscopy with BAL, and drainage with placement of chest tubes x3 was performed.
Post-operatively the patient was admitted  to the floor on telemetry, antibiotics were continued pain was controlled with a PCA, all 3 chest tubes were left to sution.
CXR were checked daily to evaluate for recurrence of effusion, pneumothorax as well as appropriate chest tube position.
Diet and activity were advanced, although the patient did have difficulty with nausea and vomiting early in her post-operative course, this was managed with anti-emetics, and resolved.
Intra-operative cultures became positive for MRSA, Vancomycin and levaquin were continued as abx coverage.
Given the need for long term antibiotic therapy a PICC line was placed.
On POD 4 patient noted some swelling in her right arm a venous duplex was performed to evaluate for DVT given her PICC line, the study was negative for thrombosis.
The patient also began to have vision changes, opthamology was consulted, and commented this was likely secondary to the anti-cholinergic effects of her anti-emetics.
The anterior-apical tube was d/c'd, the post-apical and basilar tubes were both backed out 2cm and resecured.
On POD #8 the patient was deemed fit for discharge, with visiting nursing services for home Vancomycin therapy as well as monitoring of the wounds.
At the time of discharge, pt pain was controlled with PO meds, she was ambulating without assistance, her oxygen saturations were in the high 90's on room air, her WBC had normalized, and she was tolerating a regular diet.
Continued pt on fluticasone-salmeterol and albuterol nebulizers given difficulty of taking home inhalers with dyspnea.
3) Sinus tachycardia: Heart rate 110 bpm at admission; most likely secondary to fever and pleuritic chest pain, as well as s/p albuterol nebulizers, both of which can produce tachycardia.
Heart rate only mildly elevated at admission, and improved with defervescence and improved respiratory function.
