Heparin induced thrombocytopenia Invasive procedures relating to the problem: [**2144-7-31**] Thrombectomy of right iliofemoral artery.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia was recognized as the etiology of the patient's presenting problem of bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
She underwent the above listed interventions and was anticoagulated with Lepirudin, Plavix, and Aspirin.
This was continued until a recalcitrant bleeding duodenal ulcer developed after which she was maintained on aspirin only for the majority of her remaining hospital stay.
Duodenal ulcer, bleeding s/p endoscopic treatment with cautery and epinephrine injection x 3 After anticoagulation for the patient's HIT and bilateral lower extremity arterial thromboses, she developed significant UGI bleeding.
It was ultimately controlled with a combination of multiple upper endoscopies, and cessation of her lepirudin and plavix.
Prior to discharge, she was restarted on Coumadin 5 mg nightly and has tolerated resumption of the coumadin without evidence of recurrence of her bleeding.
Supraventricular tachycardia Throughout her hospital stay, the patient has had SVT on occasion but this has improved significantly with beta blockade, amiodarone, and diuresis.
She is being discharged with amiodarone but it may be possible to discontinue this after further resolution of her current illness.
No neurosurgical intervention was recommended.
Left pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis, ultimately requiring video assisted thoracoscopy with partial decortication and chest tube placement: [**2144-8-14**] Left thoracoscopy [**2144-9-9**] Left thoracoscopy with removal of pleural fibrin and evacuation of empyema cavity with placement of chest tubes  The patient had developed a chronic left thoracic pleural effusion following her CABG.
Chest tubes were left in place following the VATS procedure.
Summation: The patient has undergone a series of insults following her emergency CABG on [**2144-7-16**] beginning with bilateral lower extremity ischemia due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia, bleeding duodenal ulcer and bilateral subdural hematomas probably secondary to anticoagulation, and multiple foci of infection with the Left empyema representing the largest one.
Taken together these injuries have required a prolonged course accelerated to some extent by tracheostomy and gastrostomy.
