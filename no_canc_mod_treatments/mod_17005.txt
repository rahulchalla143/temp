As the propofol sedation was weaned off, the patient became increasingly agitated and self extubated herself.
However, this attempt was again unsuccessful and the procedure was aborted.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and the patient went to the OR on [**2177-12-25**] for a rigid and flexible esophagoscopy in an attempt to clear the food.
Post-operatively, the patient was placed on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics.
She was started on TPN for nutrition.
However, she required reintubation for repiratory decompensation and hypotension on post-op day 2.
The patient received frequent bronchoscopies to suction her copious airway secretions and was started on stress dose steroids for her hypotension.
The patient was started on a heparin drip for this.
On [**2177-12-30**], the patient was taken to the OR for a tracheostomy and G tube and J tube placement which she tolerated well.
The G tube was left to gravity and tube feeds via the J tube were slowly advanced to goal and the TPN was discontinued.
The patient was able to be weaned off the vent and was able to tolerating breathing via trach collar.
Frequent suctionings of the patient's tracheostomy were done to clear her airway secretions.
The patient finished a 2 week course of ceftriaxone for Klebsiella that grew from her sputum.
The patient also developed a MRSA pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin for this.
If there is improvement in the patient's decreased mental status, progression would likely be very slow and the hope is having the patient placed in a rehab facility would help with her mental status.
The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation was managed with beta blockers and anticoagulation.
She was transitioned to coumadin from her heparin drip and her INR was monitored closely.
From a fluid/electrolyte standpoint, the patient was diuresed aggressively for fluid overload and she developed hyponatremia.
Her tube feeds were switched to full strength and her sodium trended up into the normal range.
