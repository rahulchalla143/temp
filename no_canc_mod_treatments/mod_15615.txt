HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] was readmitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 188**] 2 days after discharge for choking and desaturations during feeding.
She had an initial 20 day course for management of prematurity with minor issues of ruling out sepsis and learning how to feed.
Mother reports that since home she has the occasional episodes that responded to her interventions except for the event as indicated above at the pediatrician's office.
Mother reports that her activity and urine and stool output remain as usual with no new concerns.
The decision was made to readmit her for several days of observation and assessment of her feeding skills.
The infant following admission, for two days required some supplemental oxygen, because of desating at times.
It was noted that the infant did have some greenish mucous, which had been suctioned from her nose and this continued for approximately 7 to 10 days of her hospital stay.
Currently she has no significant amount of mucous being suctioned from her nasal passages.
She had several episodes of choking followed by bradycardia and desaturations while in the hospital.
Parents understood that as the baby matured these episodes would become less in number, and had decreased in quantity and quality, not needing supplementary oxygen by discharge.
