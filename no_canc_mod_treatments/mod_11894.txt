The patient reported that in the past 5 days, he noticed increased lethargy and generalized weakness as well as presyncope with lightheadedness and dizziness but denies any syncope.
The patient had seen his PCP 2 weeks ago as part of a routine physical exam at which time his nifedipine was stopped secondary to noted hypotension.
In the ED, the patient was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 14.5, he was guaiac negative with a SBP initially 86 that then dropped to 60 with a HR in the 60s.
The patient had taken all of his BP meds on day of admission([**2106-5-17**]) including atenolol, lisinopril, and HCTZ.
2 large bore IVs were placed in the ED.
The patient believes he had a colonoscopy 10-15 years ago but records from the [**Hospital1 756**] need to be obtained to confirm.

The initial differential included idiopathic, medication-induced aplastic anemia (nifedipine, NSAIDs), viral-induced aplastic anemia (HIV, parvo B19), myelodysplastic syndrome (?lymphoma or other malignancy), TTP (without fever, acute renal dysfunction, with mental status changes, anemia, and thromboctopenia)or DIC with elevated INR.
The patient received 3 units PRBC in the ED and was transfered to the MICU for further monitorin of his hypotension.
He was given an additional 2 Units of PRBC in the MICU.
The obtained additional labs revealed a Vit B12 deficiency (75), Folate normal (6.2), elevated Iron (233) and Ferritin (624) and low TiBC (186).
He was started on Cyanocobalamin 1000mcg sc/im daily and Folate 5mg iv daily.
His hypotension was [**Month/Year (2) 2771**] to dehydration and his BP was successfully elevated by volume resuscitation (3l of IVF and 5 Units of PRBC) and d/c of home BP-meds.
His SBPs have remained stable over the rest of his hospital stay (SBP 110-130) and he was put back on Lisinopril 10mg po daily.
Before discharge patient's blood pressure improved and he was restarted on atenolol 25 with SBP 100-110 range.
Since the pt MS improved over the course of his hospital stay, and considering the facts presented above, Neuro did not think that a MRI of his head was indicated for further work-up.
Patient is likely to have baseline dementia (atrophy seen on initial CT) and (resolving) neurologic manifestation from Vit B12 deficiency.
# EKG changes The EKG drawn in the ED showed the following abnormalities: RBBB, ST-depressions and TWI in V1-V6, which were thought to be a result of demand ischemia.
EKG and Troponin were monitored closely over the following days and resolved after the pt was normotensive and had received PRBC.
He was started on Lipitor 10mg daily.
On admission he was on oral hypoglycemics, metformin and glyburide, but was changed to a ISS (Humalog).
Patient was subsequently restarted on his oral hypoglycemic before discharge with suplemental sliding scale.
