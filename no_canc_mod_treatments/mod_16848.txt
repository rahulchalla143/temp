This is repaired and he is taken to the Surgical ICU for further resuscitation.
He went to the Operating Room on [**12-23**] the day following his admission for repair of his bilateral tib fib fractures and a right lateral compartment fasciotomy for elevated compartment pressures.
He also underwent on [**12-23**] an anterior discectomy and partial corpectomy at C6-C7 with fusion and instrumentation.
He returned to the Operating room on [**12-25**] for posterior C6-C7 laminectomy with grafting.
As noted, he had a halo placed for his C2 fracture.
Four vessel carotid and vertebral angiogram on [**12-22**] showed no abnormality.
His current neurovascular status has been stable since after his initial exploratory laparotomy for bleeding.
[**Known firstname **] has received sedation on an as needed basis with Morphine and Ativan, however he is alert, able to answer questions and express his needs without difficulty at this time.
He was maintained on Solu-Medrol intermittent intravenous dosing for the first three days of his hospital stay.
Had no evidence of cardiovascular injury with his trauma and has had no active issues with his heart throughout his ICU stay.
He was initially intubated with an oral tracheal tube.
This is changed over to a percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2106-1-7**] with an #8 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex trach.
Sputum cultures were significant only for Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, however there is a high suspicion of gram negative co-infection and he has been on appropriate antibiotic coverage.
He has required significant respiratory support thought to be secondary to not having an intercostal contribution to inspiratory phase.
His current ventilator settings are pressure support ventilation of 10 with a PEEP of 13, 50% fio2.
We will continue to wean the PEEP over the next couple of days in anticipation of his transfer to [**Last Name (un) 40599**].
GASTROINTESTINAL:  After undergoing the initial exploratory laparotomy for mesenteric bleeding, we had maintained [**Known firstname **] initially on TPN and then on tube feeds.
He has not tolerated gastric tube feeds and has had a postpyloric placed and replaced a couple of times.
He tolerate postpyloric tube feeds without difficulty.
For a bowel regimen related to his spinal cord injury, he is on Reglan 10 mg IV q. six and Dulcolax 10 p.r.
When these medications are stopped, he does have trouble with gastric and intestinal ability.
GENITOURINARY: [**Known firstname **] was initially maintained with a Foley which has been changed over to q. six to eight straight catheter.
For DVT prophylaxis, he was initially maintained on pneumatic boots, however a temporary IVC filter was placed on [**12-28**] and then removed on [**1-8**].
He was initially not thought to be a candidate for subcutaneous heparin or Lovenox due to the question of an epidural hematoma along his cervical spinal cord, however in consultation with the Ortho Spine Service, he was started on subcutaneous heparin the week of [**1-4**] and then changed over to Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous q.
He has had two culture since that time that were negative.
From [**12-22**] to [**12-24**] he received Vancomycin and Gentamycin as prophylaxis.
After his second operation, he also received Vancomycin for another 48 hours.
He then received Vancomycin from [**12-31**] to [**1-4**] for Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and then was resumed on [**1-8**] after a fever spike.
He received Levofloxacin from [**12-31**] to [**1-8**] which was then changed to Cipro on [**1-8**] for empiric gram negative coverage for presumed gram negative pneumonia.
He was also resumed on Gentamycin for the same empiric gram negative coverage on [**1-8**].
Our plan is to continue Vancomycin, Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin until his white blood cell count normalized.
ENDOCRINE:  [**Known firstname **] has been maintained on sliding scale regular insulin.
TUBES, LINES AND DRAINS:  [**Known firstname **] currently has peripheral IVs, PICC placed in his left antecubital fossa on [**1-11**], post pyloric feeding tube confirmed on [**1-11**], tracheostomy placed on [**1-7**] with a #8 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex and a condom catheter with intermittent bladder catheterizations.
PROPHYLAXIS:  [**Known firstname **] currently receiving tube feeds via postpyloric tube.
He has pneumo-boots on bilateral lower extremities and Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous q.
