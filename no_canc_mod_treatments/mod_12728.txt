Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary artery bypass graft x 3 Mitral valve replacement   History of Present Illness: This is a 79 yo female patient admitted to OSH on [**9-23**] with complaints of chest pain radiating to arm and jaw with related weakness and numbness in left arm and leg.
Because of her low hematocrit and bleeding, she was medically managed and discharged home with plans made for CABG and MVR after recovery from MI and GIB.
Past Medical History: htn, anxiety, depression, cath approximately 20 years ago with some CAD, no PCI.
She underwent a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the RCA, and SVG to the OM and a mitral valve replacemnet with a 25mm C-E porcine valve.
Total cardio-puolmonary bypass time was 150 minutes and her total cross-clamp time was 118 minutes.
She was on milrinone, epinephrine, levophed, and propofol drips.
She had some trouble weaning from the ventilator immediately postoperatively.
Her hemodynamics were labile in her postoperative course requiring continuous pacing (for a couple [**Last Name (un) 32460**] only) and IV drip medications including nitroglycerine, neosynephrine, nipride, and levophed to keep systolic blood pressure stable.
By post-operative day three she was sustained on PO blood pressure medications with a nitroglycerine drip.
Her heart rhythm continued as a first degree block with multiple bursts of atrial fibrillation continuing until post-operative day 12 -- these bursts were rate controlled with IV lopressor.
She was put on coumadin for these continued bursts of atrial fibrillation.
She was treated with nebulized albuterol and NT suctioning.
An infectious disease consult was obtained on [**10-22**] with initial recs for continued Zosyn with flagyl.
Final recommendations on [**10-25**] were for continuation of flagyl with addition of levoquin for a total of 14 days.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] also experienced a significant degree of post-operative confusion and anxiety for which the neurology service was consulted on post-operative day two.
With discontinuation of these culpret medications, the initial confusion cleared and she is now (at time of discharge) alert and oriented.
