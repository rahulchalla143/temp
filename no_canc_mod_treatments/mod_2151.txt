Brief Hospital Course: A 44 year-old man with a history of paraplegia and ESRD with tunnelled HD line presents with fevers and positive blood cultures from HD.
The patient's HD line was removed on arrival to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was treated with vancomycin and initially cefepime.
He was on flagyl earlier in the admission which was discontinued on [**10-5**] as there was no clear indication.
Drainage of fluid collection around left acetabulum: Infectious disease was consulted and felt that the pt's collection in his left hip was increased from prior CT and recommended sampling and drainage as this was also another likely source of infection/bacteremia.
After he was stablized (see GI bleed section below) he went to OR w/ortho on [**10-11**] and is s/p washout and drain placement [**10-11**]).
At discharge site looked to be healing well with minimal tenderness, no drainage.
He was changed to pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] IV on [**10-8**].
Acute anemia in house secondary to GI bleed however patient with baseline normocytic anemia.
# SVC DVT: SVC clot was seen on a non-contrast CT on prelim read.
This was presumably caused by HD line which had come infected and was removed.
He was started on a heparin gtt.
Survellance blood cultures were taken to determine when it as safe for preminent line placement (temp line was placed for HD in the meantime).
A tunneled HD line was placed on [**10-8**].
Patient was started on coumadin on [**10-13**].
Patient started on coumadin 5mg daily.
Coumadin held on [**12-1**] due to supra-therapeutic INR.
Coumadin 5mg restarted on [**10-20**].
# ESRD: Apparently secondary to amyloidosis, on HD since [**09**]/[**2115**].
A tunneled line was placed on [**10-8**].
Sevelamer, calcium acetate, and nephrocaps were continued.
Will follow-up with outpatient nephrologist and continue HD as scheduled.

You were found to have a possible infection of your dialysis line and a clot in the blood vessel that was likely infected.
For your clot, you received heparin to help prevent the clot from increasing.
However while in the hospital you also had bleed in your gastrointestinal track which required blood transfusion and readmission to the ICU.
Prior to discharge your anticoagulation was transitioned from heparin to coumadin.
After your blood cultures remained negative for a number of days, it was determined safe to replace your dialysis line.
You will continue to received dialysis as scheduled as an outpatient.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Please continue to take IV Vancomycin and Ceftazidine for treatment of the infection that was found in your blood and your hip.
You will continue treatment for a total of 6weeks and follow-up with ID.
- Please START taking warfarin to continue the treatment of your clot; you will continue anti-coagulation for 6mths time.
- Please START taking Ziprasidone Hydrochloride 40 mg PO/NG QAM and Ziprasidone Hydrochloride 60 mg PO/NG QPM.
