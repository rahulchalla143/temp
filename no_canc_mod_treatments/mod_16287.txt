An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed emergently and the patient was also emergently taken to the operating room for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient was emergently intubated in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for oxygen saturation of about 60% with pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix, 100% oxygen and PEEP.
The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where the patient underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting x 2 with saphenous vein to the right posterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
He also had a mitral valve replacement with a #29 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve.
Postoperatively the patient was in profound hypoxic state and pulmonary edema on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, vasopressin and Levophed IV drips, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place.
His pressors were weaned somewhat but remained on Levophed and vasopressin at that time.
The patient remained on full ECMO support with ventilator and intra-aortic balloon pump in place.
The patient remained on full support throughout the course of that night and on the morning of [**2119-5-10**], remained on full ventilator support, full ECMO support with CVVH for fluid removal.
He remained on cisatracurium IV drip for paralysis, fentanyl and Ativan for sedation, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and Pitressin drips to maintain adequate blood pressure assistance.
The patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on [**2119-5-10**] as well.
On the evening of [**2119-5-10**] the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory due to continued hemodynamic instability, where he underwent an atrial septostomy to decompress the left atrium.
The patient was take to the operating room in the evening of [**2119-5-10**] where he underwent removal of the ECMO cannulas from the left, replacement of those cannulas into the right, repair of the common femoral artery with a graft on the right, repair of the left femoral artery, left fasciotomy as well.
After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] he concurred with the family's wishes and at 8:40 to 8:50 in the morning the patient's vasoactive drips as well as ECMO were weaned to off and the patient ceased spontaneous respirations as well as heart rhythm at 8:55 this morning and was pronounced dead.
