Per his caregiver, over the last two days he has become more weak (not using his walker but requiring a wheelchair to get around), coughing and sounded "congested."
He has been noted to have poor PO intake and coughing with all liquids and foods.
His HCP says that he had a speech and swallow in the past and they recommended crushing his medications in apple sauce and avoiding thin liquids.
The patient has recently refused this and has been taking thin liquids and coughing signficantly with them.
He was also given levofloxacin and clindamycin for pneumonia.
Neuro: CNIII-X and XII in tact except hearing- he reads lips.
Did not assess [**Doctor First Name 81**] given collar in place.
He received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED.
As sputum gram stain showed a mixture of different organisms, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.
It was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 2852**] was unlikely to recover from his pneumonia given his inability to wean off bipap and to cough to clear his own secretions.
As he was DNI status he could not be intubated to have secretions suctioned out.
In addition, the patient appeared visibly uncomfortable on BiPAP and quickly desaturated into the 70?????
Because the patient was given several liters of fluid for hyponatremia, there was the possibility that diuresis could improve his oxygenation enough to enable him to wean off the bipap, however, this did not prove to be the case.
Antibiotics and BiPAP were withdrawn and the patient died shortly thereafter.
He received 1000 ml NS boluses overnight with maintenance fluids.
#3 Hypertension: The patient's home regimen of atenolol was held given concern for possible sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.
Aspirin was continued.
Rate control with a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker was held due to concern for hypotension in the setting of an infection.
His collar was removed when he was made CMO.
#6 BPH with incontinence: The patient's home regimen of oxybutynin was continued.
B12 supplementation was continued.
# Osteoporosis: Calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax were continued.
