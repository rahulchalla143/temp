BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2181-2-27**] 12:52 PM BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins.
Agitated saline was injected at rest with no appearance of bubbles in the left atrium suggestive of the absence of a PFO or ASD.
M with h/o ESRD/HD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent LMCA stroke resulting in R hemiplegia, dysphagia, trach and PEG placement readmitted from rehab only 2 days after discharge [**3-3**] concern for increased lethargy.
1) Altered Mental Status - Poor baseline, difficult to assess since aphasic - On arrival he makes eye contact and tracks, which is apparently his new baseline since stroke, however over his stay he again lost this abaility and now will rarely open his eyes to command - This is most likely an overlying delerium rather than progression of the stroke  2) fever - Infectious work up included LP, blood cultures, urinalysis with culture, c.diff toxin, chest plain film, CT chest/abd/pelvis, Ct sinus, echocardiogram and U/S of AV fistula all without obvious source - He was treated with 10 days of IV vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed health care acquired pneumonia, however remained persitently febrile despite treatment and improvement in his CXR - He did have opacification of numerous sinus cavities on CT, however Zosyn should have treated this adequately - He had bilateral DVTs noted on BLE u/s in the posterial tibial veins, which may have contributed to his fevers - Given suspicion of drug fever in the setting of negative infectious workup, antibiotics were discontinued on [**2181-3-1**].
- On CXR this is a mild progression of his pleural effusions, which can be tapped possibly in an ICU setting, but is not safe in a floor setting - Tylenol was changed to standing, given persistant fevers  2) Diarrhea - c.diff hegative x 3 - Emperically treated with flagyl per tube while awaiting results, but discontinued with negative results - Banana flakes were added to tube feeds in hope to help with formed stools, but had to be stopped due to potassium content - Rectal tube was in place during hospitalization secondary to sacral breakdown  3) health care related pneumonia/COPD flare - He recently completed a course of vanco, cefepime, and flagyl while in house for RML PNA.
- For COPD flare, he was given steroids and has completed the taper prior to admission - He was continued on maintenance MDI treatment with albuterol, atrovent, beclomethasone - On hospital day 4, there was concern for possible interval development of a LLL PNA and he was placed back on vancomycin and zosyn for treatment of a HAP; however, the concerning infiltrate was no longer present on a CXR the following day.
Regardless, this was continued to treat possible PNA given his low BPs (see below) and continued low grade fevers.
- He has required frequent suctioning and his secretions have been worrisome, although have thinned in the last few days prior to transfer  4) bilateral DVTs - initiated on IV heparin gtt with bridging to coumadin with goal INR of [**3-4**], which was discussed with neurology - Anticoagulation discussed with neurology and the family given recent stroke and risk of hemmorhage, with recommendation to proceed given immobilization and risk for further venous thromboembolism.
5) s/p L MCA CVA - Head CT shows evolution of infarct without evidence of new infarcts - carotid duplex which did not show any significant stenosis of carotid or vertebral arteries - He was evaluated by neurology during this admission - He was continued on ASA 325mg daily until DVTs discovered, wherin ASA was discontinued and IV heparin/coumadin started - He is not on a statin [**3-3**] to CK elevation to 1000's after starting on last admission - Neurology was called for recommendations regarding anticoagulation in the setting of recent stroke, and they advised to go forward with anticoagulation.
7)ESRD on HD - He was continued on outpatient schedule for HD - The patient would intermittently have difficulty tolerating HD [**3-3**] low BPs, which was also the case during his prior ICU admission - cortsyntropin stim test post-steroid course for COPD exacerbation, which was within normal limits - A TTE/TEE performed recently during his prior hosptilization was signficant for severe AS and moderate MS, making the patient sensitive to any changes in preload.
However, he is not a surgical candidate for AVR and given his recent stroke would not be a good candidate for valvuloplasty either.
He was given boluses of IVFs intermittently to support his pressures through HD.
12)Stage II sacral decubitus - in setting of prolonged immobilization and diarrhea - He had wound care consult - placed on Kinair bed, and q1hour repositioning.
- Plastics consultation was obtained, who felt that debridement would worsen his condition  13)neck decubitus ulcer [**3-3**] trach - 1 cm area of breakdown inferior to trach collar, also followed by wound care.
