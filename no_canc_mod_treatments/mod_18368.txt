The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-4**] requesting detoxification as he started using IV drugs again.
He was found to have a subclavian DVT and a left brachial arterial aneurysm, which was thought to be secondary to injection of IV drugs.
He was placed on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.
He had an elevated WBC there and was febrile so he was started in azithromycin with improvement in both.
He reported using cocaine since his discharge and denied use of EtOH.
Patient was started on a heparin gtt for presumed embolic event.
Given the concern for meningitis, he was also treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamycin.
In addition, his respiratory status worsened requiring intubation on evening [**5-16**].
He continued on a heparin drip.
He was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-17**] for further w/u.
Patient was intubated and sedated.
Past Medical History: - Streptococcus salivarius mitral valve endocarditis [**9-1**] with course complicated by severe MR, multiple septic embolic to bilateral kidneys, spleen, L parietal hemorrhage with underlying mycotic aneurysm s/p onyx embolization s/p MVR [**2112-2-4**] - IVDU x 22 yrs (cocaine, oxycodone) - EtOH Abuse - hx inguinal hernia repair [**2105**] - HCV Ab + [**2108**], viral load negative - Hypertension - Depression, anxiety - Permanent pacemaker  Social History: The patient has a long history of IVDU with cocaine and oxycodone since the age of 21.

Nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.
Status post placement of right transfrontal ventricular shunt catheter, with the tip terminating in the floor of the third ventricle.
Unchanged left occipital lobe and right pontine hypodensities are concerning for evolving infarctions.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Stable ventriculomegaly with ventriculostomy catheter unchanged in position within the third ventricle.
Stable ventriculomegaly with right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter unchanged in position within the third ventricle.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Mild persistent narrowing of the distal basilar artery and its branches, status post balloon angioplasty, may also represent recurrent vasospasm.
Stable ventriculomegaly, with unchanged position of external ventricular drain in the third ventricle via right frontal burr hole.
Status post coiling of the left PCA aneurysm with intraventricular hemorrhage, unchanged from [**2113-5-22**].
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Nasogastric feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-6-8**] 3:41 AM FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, the tracheostomy tube and the other monitoring and support devices are constant.
Persistent ventriculomegaly after replacement of the EVD with a VP shunt along with transependymal CSF migration consistent with hydrocephalus.
Presumed shunt catheter traverses the right neck, chest and upper abdomen.
Tracheostomy tube and left internal jugular line, as well as transvenous right atrium and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.
A feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
[**2113-6-13**] PICC line placement - Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double lumen Preliminary ReportPower PICC line placement via the right basilar venous approach.
# PONTINE INFARCATION AND ICH:  The patient presented with altered mental status, initially concerning for meningitis.
He was continued on heparin gtt with some improvement in his symptoms; coumadin was resumed at 15mg daily at OSH.
He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis.
A ventricular shunt was placed to reduce ICH, supported by infusion of protamine and activated factor IX.
His mental status did not substantially improve despite drainage and normalized ICH.
On [**5-20**] the shunt was noted to have clotted off and TPA was infused to clear it.
The patient's SBP target was increased and he was transferred to the NeuroICU for further specialized management.
As hospital course progressed, it was determined that bleeding had stopped and patient was restarted on heparin drip as bridge to coumadin for mechanical mitral valve.
# CEREBRAL SALT WASTING/HYPONATREMIA/FLUDROCORTISONE TAPER: Patient was started on fludrocortisone taper for cerebral salt wasting.
#  ANTIBIOTICS FOR CULTURE NEGATIVE ENDOCARDITIS:  Patient continues on vanc IV 750 mg Q12 and gentamycin 80 Q12 for endocarditis through [**2113-6-28**].
Patient will need to have creatinine checked every day.
Gentamycin trough should be checked on [**2113-6-26**] and adjusted accordingly (should be less than 2).
Vancomycin has been dosed at 10am and 10pm.
The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis.
He was intubated and sedated on [**5-16**].
He was started on meningitis coverage with vancomycin/ceftriaxone/gentamycin.
Gentamicin was added to his antibiotics to cover culture-negative endocarditis.
He continues on vancomycin and gentamycin through [**2113-6-28**] for culture negative endocarditis.
According to neurosurgery attending, patient will likely have residual hemiparesis, diplopia, and difficulty with feeding.
# LEFT SUBCLAVIAN DVT:  Patient will continue on heparin gtt bridge to coumadin for mechanical valve and will thus be anticoagulated for subclavian DVT as well.
# CAD:  Patient continues on metoprolol and statin.
After heparin drip is discontinued, it may be reasonable to start ASA 81mg QD.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY:  Abilify and celexa were stopped during admission due to critical illness and change in mental status.
He received 1 unit of PRBCs on [**2113-6-20**] with appropriate bump in hematocrit.
He should continue on iron supplementation with frequent hematocrit checks.
#  ANTICOAGULATION:  Patient continues on coumadin with heparin bridge.
His coumadin may need to be uptitrated upon discharge.
#  NUTRITION:  Patient continues on isosource tube feeds through PEG tube.
He states that he knows it is possible that the pt may suffer some medical complications down the road and that if he experiences anything quite devastating like another stroke, he thinks that as a family they would opt for comfort-focused care at that point to minimize the pt's further suffering.
Transitional Issues: --Repeat ECHO on [**2113-6-28**] to evaluate for continued endocarditis --Ensure INR is between 2.5-3.5 and overlap with heparin gtt for 48 hours --Daily creatinine checks while patient is on gentamycin --Vanc IV and gent through [**2113-6-28**] for culture negative endocarditis --PEG care --Check IV vanc and gent trough on [**2113-6-26**] --Twice weekly hematocrit checks --Tube feeds as recommended by nutrition --Neurosurgery follow-up --Consider starting ASA for CAD after patient is off heparin gtt and OK with neurosurgery --Continued goals of care discussion with family and palliative care team --Taper fludricortisone as above .

You subsequently had a bleed in your head and you needed a drain placed by neurosurgery to relieve the pressure.
We were unable to take you off the breathing machine (respirator) and a tracheostomy was placed.
You also had a PEG tube placed so that you could get tube feeds and medications.
You are on a heparin drip bridging you to therapeutic coumadin levels.
Your goal INR is 2.5-3.5 because of your mechanical valve.
You will need to continue on a heparin drip until your INR is over 2.5 for 48 hours.
You will be discharged on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
You were given a blood transfusion on [**2113-6-20**] for low blood counts probably because of iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
You were started on a medication called fludricortisone to treat low sodium levels.
You will continue on vanc IV 750 mg Q12 and gentamycin 80 Q12 for endocarditis through [**2113-6-28**].
You will need to have creatinine checked every day.
