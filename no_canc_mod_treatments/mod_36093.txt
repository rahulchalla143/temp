ACTIVE # Blood in Ostomy: Patient w/ history of UGIB secondary to angiectasias in the duodenum who presented w/ trace blood in his ostomy; patient remaining hemodynamically stable w/ PEG lavage negative; Trace blood in his colostomy bag suggests lower GI bleed; given temporal relationship to initiation of ASA, this was felt to most likely be an exacerbation of underlying issue; bleeding resolved with holding of ASA.
His cardiologist was notified because the patient is now no longer on aspirin or [**Year (4 digits) **], but bleeding risk strongly outweighs stroke risk at this time.
Patient will need to readdress issue of colonoscopy as an outpatient with outpatient providers.
# Hematuria: Patient with a history of hematuria of uncertain etiology who presents w recurrence of bleeding, thought to be secondary recent initiation of ASA; holding of ASA resolved bleeding issue; patient will need to have outpatient follow-up with urology for discussion of cystoscopy; (appt was not yet scheduled).
