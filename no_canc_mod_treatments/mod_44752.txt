Admission Date:  [**2149-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: complete heart block  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pacemaker placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 56272**] is a 51M w/ hx of AS (unknown severity), HTN, hypothyroidism, s/p Hodgkin's treatment w/ extensive radiation therapy to chest at age of 4, who presents intubated from outside hospital with bradycardia.
The patient was given atropine and epinephrine with no change in HR or BP.
Patient was started on a dobutamine drip, transferred here for further evaluation.
His pressures were 100-110 on 5 of dopamine drip.
He was given insulin and calcium gluconate.
Placement of temporary pacing wire deferred secondary to poor access (secondary to radiation) and renal failure.
A femoral triple lumen central line was placed.
Decreased dopamine and increased sedation (fentanyl, midazolam gtts).
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  hypothyroidism -  s/p thyroidectomy -  Hodgkin's lymphoma (at age 4) s/p Cobalt Radiation  Social History: - Tobacco history:  unknown - ETOH:  significant alcohol use, per sister - Illicit drugs:  negative, per sister  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS:  60 externally paced, 136/50, 95% on ventilator (CMV, FIO2 52%, rate of 16, minute ventilation 7.8) Gen: intubated, sedated NECK: Significant radiation scaring.
III/VI late peaking systolic murmur loudest at the LUSB with radiation to the neck.
Intubated and sedated.
III/VI late peaking systolic murmur loudest at the LUSB with radiation to the neck.
The pulmonic valve prosthesis is not well seen.
Acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic (superficial) veins.
He was started on a dopamine drip.
Hyperkalemia was treated with insulin and calcium gluconate.
Due to poor access, temp pacer could not be placed; instead, a femoral triple lumen central line was placed and he was given fluids in the ED and then transferred to the CCU.
Transcutaneous pacing was initiated and the voltage of pacing was increased as needed to facilitate capture.
Decreased dopamine and increased sedation (fentanyl, midazolam gtts).
He was taken to EP suite for permanent pacemaker placement after which he became stable and was weaned off dopamine.
Patient adamantly denied having any medication changes and reportedly did not take more of less of any of his home meds.
However, he intermittently went back into complete heart block requiring pacing, most notably after receiving large metoprolol load prior to CTA torso/coronaries in order to bring heart rate down for coronary imaging.
Pt apparently has been evaluated for AVR but due to his anatomy s/p radiation treatments as a child, he is not a candidate for open repair.
Also eval'ed at [**Hospital1 756**] for percutaneous valve replacement but femoral arteries were too narrow.
Given that corevalve at [**Hospital1 18**] uses smaller sheath, decision was made to eval pt again for percutaneous valve.
Pt was started on a heparin drip and then switched to lovenox injections at a dose of 70mg subcutaneously [**Hospital1 **] for at least 3 months.
bilateral LE dopplers were neg for DVT and RUE doppler (side of entry for pacemaker) showed "acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic (superficial) veins.
# Hypothyroidism: patient s/p thyroidectomy at age of 19.  on synthroid 150mcg qd at home.
The patient was initially continued on synthroid IV 75mcg qd while intubated, and quickly changed back to 150mcg qd home dose.
# HTN: The patient was initially on dopamine upon admission to the CCU.
Dopamine was quickly stopped after placement of the pacemaker.
The patient was started on metoprolol and lasix after he was called out to the floor.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient was hyperkalemic to 6.5 upon admission, without specific EKG changes appreciated, and was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50 and kayexalate.

Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you had fallen and become unresponsive.
You were given a pacemaker and your heart rate and blood pressure improved.
You were evaluated for an aortic valve repair while you were here and should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the next few weeks.
DECREASE lasix to once daily 2.
START taking lisinopril to help your heart pump better 4.
START taking lovenox injections twice daily to prevent the blood clots in your lungs from getting bigger.
