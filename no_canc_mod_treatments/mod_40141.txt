Hospital course included 1 day stay in intensive care unit for obersvation after required reintubation in PACU.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure  - The patient was taken to the operating room for debulking procedure on the day after admission.
After the patient was extubated in the PACU, he was given ipratroprium and albuterol nebs.
He was restarted on his home meds for COPD and CHF, including tiotropium, albuterol, ASA, diltiazem , metoprolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, and lasix.
# Bronchial mass - the bronchial mass was removed by rigid bronchoscopy and electrocautery by interventional pulmonology.
The procedure was tolerated by the patient and without complication.
The patient was kept on heparin drip with goal PTT of 60-80 except for immediately prior to, during, and after his procedure.
Coumadin was resumed on the day prior to discharge.
His INR was 1.2 at the time of discharge and the patient was advised to start lovenox until INRs could be checked and were ensured to be in the therapeutic range.
Despite explaining to him the need for Lovenox teaching, co-administration of Lovenox and warfarin, and the need for INR checks, he wanted to leave the hospital right away.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # COPD with acute exacerbation - The patient was continued on his home medications during this hopsitalization.
As above, the patient did require reintubation for hypercapnic respiratory failure after his OR procedure.
# CHF - The patient presented with some edema likely due to volume overload from suboptimal diuresis versus IVF during ICU stay at this and recent hospitalizations.
