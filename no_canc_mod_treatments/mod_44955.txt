The patient was also placed on gentamicin for three days also to help his blood cultures remain negative for the synergistic effect that vancomycin and gentamicin have together.
Unfortunately, the patient's creatinine started to trend upwards and gentamicin was discontinued at this time.
The patient was also placed on spironolactone due to increasing and worsening peripheral edema secondary to his hepatic failure and low albumin state.
Unfortunately, as the patient's creatinine trended upward from a baseline of 1.1 up to 1.7, the patient's Lasix and spironolactone were discontinued.
The patient was also given blood transfusions three more times during these dates.
The patient's white blood cell count and platelets also started to trend downwards and it was thought at this time that the patient's pancytopenia was probably due to vancomycin myelosuppression.
The patient was also started on Epogen 20,000 units once a week to help increase his bone marrow production of his red blood cells.
The patient was also given albumin on three separate occasions, 50 grams, 25 grams, and 50 grams on occasions to help allow him to retain fluid intravascularly.
The patient continued on his vancomycin with no further spikes in his temperature and remained afebrile and clinically looked quite well at the time of discharge.
The patient was to continue his eight week course of vancomycin at which time he was to have blood cultures drawn.
If these blood cultures remain negative there would be a possibility of liver transplant.
If the blood cultures came back positive, the patient and the family may decide at that time to discontinue any further antibiotic therapies.
The patient was to have VNA services and to have daily CBC, SMA-7, and albumin as well as vancomycin levels faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 833**]  who would follow the patient closely.
The patient was to follow-up with the Infectious Disease Clinic as well as Hepatology and his primary care provider once he was discharged from [**Hospital6 2003**].
