It has been class 2 heart failure maintained on ACE inhibitor, Lasix, Digoxin and amiodarone.
Patient was found to be H. pylori positive, treated with antibiotics and on [**4-23**] had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed chronic inactive gastritis.
Metricor and Lasix were administered.
Patient was started on milrinone of .5 and his PA pressures were 64/22 and a cardiac index of 1.9 in the catheterization laboratory.
Patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for milrinone therapy and tailored therapy.
6) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**4-16**] with chronic gastritis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lasix 60 q.d., Aldactone 25 q.d., Coreg 25 b.i.d., Captopril 60 t.i.d., digoxin .125 q.o.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Coumadin 4 q.d., Protonix 40 b.i.d., Carafate 1 gram q.i.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with class 4 congestive heart failure and a severe dilating cardiomyopathy admitted for hemodynamic monitoring and Noridone therapy.
Heart Failure:  Patient was class 4 congestive heart failure and severe dilating cardiomyopathy on milrinone therapy which was started at .4 mcg per minute which was ultimately titrated down during the hospital course to .3 due to hypotension.
Patient remained on milrinone throughout his hospital stay.
The dosages of these medications were titrated down during his hospital stay due to hypotension.
Amiodarone 200, Lasix 20, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d., Coreg 12.5 t.i.d., Aldactone 12.5 q.d., Digoxin .0125 q.d.
and Coumadin 4 q.d.
He was seen by the EP consultation service who decided he was not a candidate for biventricular pacing due to his significant mitral regurgitation, however, they agreed that a DDD pacer would be potentially beneficial for increased heart rate to increase the patient' cardiac output.
On [**5-24**] the patient had a DDD pacemaker placed without any complications and it has been functioning within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was removed after the pacemaker was placed, and patient was continued on his doses of milranone.
Patient was evaluated by a transplant team, including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], from [**Hospital 10908**] regarding the possibilities of a heart transplant in the future.
He decided that he was not willing to receive blood transfusion, due to his religious beliefs, which has very high likelihood of being required as life saving therapy during both procedures.
He was discharged home on intravenous home Milrinone therapy and will be follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the heart failure service and can readdress the issues surrounding transplant at that time.
Rhythm:  Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm, AV paced after his DDD was placed on th 10th.
He had been on heparin prior to the DDD pacer placement, and was restarted on Coumadin afterward.
He was also continued on his amiodarone but at a lower dose as noted above.
He was continued on his Protonix and Carafate.
He was also continued on his two gram sodium diet with full calorie and 2 liter fluid restriction.
Access:  Patient initially had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed to the groin.
This was removed and he then had peripheral intravenous access.
He had a PICC line placed in the right arm and will be discharged with the PICC line for home milrinone therapy.
He was given a short course of Keflex to treat the superficial phlebitis.
