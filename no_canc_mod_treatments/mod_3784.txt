HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was seen by the Vascular Surgery team who thought that surgical intervention was not necessary at this time.
His blood pressure continued to fall despite adding on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
He was started on pressor therapy with Levophed and then Neo-Synephrine.
Despite using supratherapeutic doses of these blood pressure medications we were unable to maintain his blood pressure at a level to adequately perfuse his vital organs.
Given his poor response to intensive medical therapy, the focus of his care was shifted to providing comfort measures.
