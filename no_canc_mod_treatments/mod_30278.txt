Of note, the patient's diuretics were increased on [**3-14**] (Lasix from 40 mg to 80 mg and Aldactone from 50 mg to 100 mg once per day).
Diovan 160 mg by mouth once per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Folate 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Atenolol 50 mg by mouth once per day.
Ursodiol 30 mg by mouth once per day.
Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Spironolactone 50 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient was treated with lactulose 30 cc by mouth three times per day, and her mental status steadily improved throughout the first several days of her hospital stay.
As she was markedly volume depleted, she was given intravenous fluids aggressively to improve her volume status.
The patient was eventually weaned off of lactulose and then developed some mild confusion.
Therefore, she was restarted on a standing lactulose dose.
She was transfused one unit or packed red blood cells on [**3-22**] for a hematocrit of less than 28.
With regard to her coagulopathy from liver disease, the patient was given vitamin K by mouth and subcutaneously during her hospital stay.
The patient's creatinine did improve with rehydration; however, she did not reach her baseline creatinine during her hospital stay.
Her creatinine did improve to 1.3 but then did worsen to 1.6 when intravenous fluids were discontinued.
Initiation of diuretics were held until [**3-27**] when the patient did appear more volume overloaded despite her renal function.
She will be restarted on low-dose diuretics for discharge and should have close followup from her hepatologist with regard to her volume status and renal function.
Due to concerns about her blood pressure stability, her outpatient regimen, including atenolol and Diovan, were held throughout her hospital stay.
She required intravenous fluid boluses to improve her volume status and did respond appropriately.
Her blood pressure medications will be restarted as an outpatient when her blood pressure returns to baseline.
She was given a course of Levaquin for seven days and remained afebrile and stable without a white blood cell count elevation.
PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her outpatient Zoloft dose to address her baseline depression and anxiety.
She responded well to albuterol nebulizer and a dose of intravenous Lasix.
A chest x-ray done following this event showed a small left pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was initially given intravenous fluids to replete her volume deficits.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was continued on Protonix and had baseline auto anticoagulation.
Folic acid 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Sertraline 50 mg by mouth once per day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Spironolactone 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Furosemide 20 mg by mouth once per day.
At that time restarting her outpatient blood pressure medications including atenolol and Diovan should be considered.
