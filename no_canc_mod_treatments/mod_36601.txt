He was scanned and then transferred here after being given 3 units of PRBCs and being intubated.
He had a trauma line placed in his left groin in the trauma bay, and he was taken urgently to the OR for suspected delayed onset of splenic bleed.
He had a splenectomy at that time.
He had a left subclavian and Swan-Ganz catheter placed secondary to decreasing urine output and rising creatinine preoperatively.
His initial postoperative crit was 26.1, and he was transfused with an additional 2 units of PRBCs with repeat hematocrit of 34.
He required calcium repletion, but his other lytes were within normal limits.
The patient was initially hypothermic on presentation and was warmed gradually with a bear-hugger.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was removed by [**9-8**], secondary to hemodynamic stabilization.
He remained afebrile on cefazolin and Levaquin.
His NG tube was DC'd on [**9-9**], and he was taking small amounts of clear liquids without nausea or vomiting in the unit.
His incision from the surgery remained intact with midline staples.
He resolved chest PT q 4 h, as well as physical therapy to attempt to improve the deconditioning that had occurred while he was in the hospital.
So, his dose of levothyroxine was upped from 50 mcg po to 75 IV with a plan to recheck a T4 in a couple of days.
We continued a bowel regimen with PO Dulcolax, as well as tid ambulation to encourage return of bowel function.
A free T4 was checked on the 23 which showed 0.9 at the lower end of normal, so his levothyroxine was increased to 100 qd.
The patient required occasional albuterol nebs in order to treat some mild expiratory wheezes.
The patient also required a few doses of lasix 20 mg IV for fluid overload.
His UA was positive which was why he was placed on Levaquin for 3 days for the urinary tract infection  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
