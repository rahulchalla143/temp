IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized tricuspid valve vegetation with moderate regurgitation.
Persistent wedge-shaped hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the enlarged spleen, representing splenic infarction; differential considerations including sequelae of splenic enlargement or an embolic process.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 26 y/o male with active IVDA with heroin and oxycodone who presented with dyspnea and fever and was found to have Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis caused by Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus (MSSA) with multiple septic emboli to the lungs.
TTE confirmed a vegetation on the tricuspid valve with mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient initially received empiric therapy with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and after antibiotic sensitivites were known he was switched to IV nafcillin 2g Q4h.
At the time of transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was afebrile although on tylenol and ibubrofen.
This pain has been well controlled with oxycodone 10mg Q4h, acetaminophen 1000mg q6h, and ibuprofen 400mg Q8h.
The patient will likely require 4-6 weeks of IV antibiotics although discretion [**Name6 (MD) **] accepting MD.
Hepatitis C: When the patient presented he had a platelet count of 65, and given his history of IV drug use he was tested for Hepatitis C. Viral load was 1,270,000.
However he should follow-up with an infectious disease physician after he finishes his course of IV antibiotics.
After acute illness has resolved he will likely require vaccination for hepatitis A, and possibly B as his surface antibody was borderline.
Patient will need oral swish and swallow until symptoms resolve .
# Substance abuse: Prior to admission he was actively injecting heroin and oxycodone.
Non-narcotic pain medications were used initially, however the patient had severe pleuritic pain that caused rapid shallow breathing and therefore oxycodone was added to his pain regimen.
# Tachycardia: This was most likely multifactorial with contributions from opiate withdrawal, fever/infection and pain.
# As outlined above, patient will need follow-up for new diagnosis of Hepatitis C. After acute illness has resolved he will likely require vaccination for hepatitis A, and possibly B as his surface antibody was borderline.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours).
2. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day).

The staph infection had spread to one of your heart valves and then to your lungs.
We started you on strong IV antibiotics and also had the infectious disease specialists help with your care.
You will at least 4 weeks of IV antibiotics to be sure that the infection clears from your heart valve.
You were not started on treatment for Hepatitis C during your hospitalization.

Finally, it is very important that once you have finished your IV antibiotics that you start drug rehab.
