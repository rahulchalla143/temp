with history of CHF unkown EF who recently stopped taking her medications admitted [**4-14**] with increasing progressive SOB at OSH who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and work-up for CAD.
She was started on Levaquin PO qHS and received 2 doses.

Return after treatment of her pneumonia for PCI of the LCX in about 2 weeks via femoral access.
CT CHEST NON-CON ([**4-18**]): TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with the administration of IV contrast.
Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are noted but do not meet CT size criteria for pathology measuring up to 5 mm in the right paratracheal station (series 2, image 24).
Axillary lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathology.
Patient was on TB precautions and wearing a mask, causing marked susceptibility artifacts.

The patient also has CAP w/ associated pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and e/o granulomatous lung/liver/mediastinum lesions, which is chronic.
The patient was diuresed with 80mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] with diuresis of approximately 1.5 liters of fluid daily.
She was transitioned to oral lasix 40mg qd approximately three days prior to discharge.
She maintained a net neutral fluid balance for the past three days prior to discharge.
Coronary artery disease: Patient found to have disease in the LCx, LAD, and RCA on left heart catheterization upon presentation.
No intervention was done as the patient did not tolerate the procedure well secondary to respiratory status.
Decision currently has been made to medically optimize the patient and have patient return for catheterization with intervention as an outpatient.
She was restarted on metoprolol 37.5mg three times daily, aspirin 81mg daily (started on [**4-26**] days after stroke), Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and lisinopril 5mg daily.
Patient was initiated on anticoagulation with warfarin, bridging with IV heparin, given risk of cardioembolic stroke.
She was supratherapeutic on heparin at this time, though (this was held and allowed to trend down to the therapeutic range).
Given these small strokes, the recommendation from the Stroke Service is to delay PCI/stenting for at least one week (ideally [**5-10**] weeks) to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion when giving dual antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic anticoagulation.
Warfarin was added, and patient was bridged with lovenox (as opposed to continuing heparin drip).
The patient was restarted on aspirin 81 mg for cardioprotective purposes on [**2137-4-26**] (per neurology, recommended 7 d post-stroke until restarting aspirin.
# Chronic Granulomas: The patient had significant evidence of bilateral granulomas in lungs, liver, mediastinum are chronic (>10yrs old, from [**Hospital6 10353**]) based upon prior imaging that was ascertained from previous hospitals.
Prior to ascertaining that these granulomas were chronic, we attempted to get induced sputums for a rule-out of TB, but sputums unable to be induced by respiratory therapy.
Chronic granulomas are likely secondary to a chronic or old process, and no intervention since patient is asymptomatic.
The patient was placed on metoprolol 37.5mg TID.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: Patient was initiated on treatment for CAP at OSH for possible pneumonia.
Received 2 days of levofloxacin prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**].
Under infectious disease's guidance, the patient was transitioned to antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with Ceftiraxone and Azithromycin.
The patient completed her course of antibiotics on [**2137-4-26**].
Given that the patient was not treated with any antibiotics that would treat VRE while at OSH or here, and no growth on our pleural fluid cultures, we believe this "broth" finding may have been a contaminant.
# RUE Hematoma: On approx [**4-23**], it was noticed that the patient had a significant, likely intramuscular, hematoma near the proximal humerus area.
Pt was treated w/ elevation and warm packs on hematoma.
Patient was continued on Metoprolol and lisinopril through her inpatient hospitalization, without episodes of hypertension.
Follow-up with outpatient cardiologist for both CHF and regarding intervention for known coronary artery disease.
