Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old female with critical AS presenting with gradual-onset dyspnea and weakness, found to have anemia with guaiac positive stools, as well as new hypoxia and leukocytosis with likely pneumonia and acute congestive heart failure exacerbation.
# Goals of Care: When the patient initially presented, she was considered a candidate for possible percutaneous aortic valve replacement (CORE valve).
However given her tenous fluid status, refractory GI bleeding on anticoagulation and delerium, she was no longer considered a candidate.
Several family meetings were convened to assess her goals of therapy and care, and it was decided by all including her son [**Name (NI) **] and daughter [**Name (NI) **], and the care team that further interventions would NOT be of benefit.
She requires frequent perineal cleanings and aquafor cream applications.
Topical lidocaine and prn 1mg dilaudid were also helpful for pain control.
She has not required dilaudid since [**8-5**].
Her cardiologists were contact[**Name (NI) **] and as she was being considered for aortic valve replacement in the near future, she was transferred to the CCU for evalution for prompt replacement vs. valvuloplasty on this admission.
She is maintained on metoprolol and amlodipine predominantly to maintain a low heart rate and reduce her symptoms in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with dyspnea, orthopnea, and hypoxia, with worsening of hypoxia after receiving transfusion 1 unit pRBCs and 2 units FFP for anemia and supratherapeutic INR.
Patient started on non-rebreather in ED, and on arrival to ICU had O2 sats in mid-high 80s on NRB with 95% FiO2 plus 6L NC.
Differential diagnosis included pneumonia (leukocytosis, cough, RLL infiltrate on CXR), acute pulmonary edema/CHF exacerbation in setting of critical AS and recent transfusions (diffuse crackles on exam, pulm edema on CXR, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 28885**]), possible flash pulmonary edema from HTN, possible cardiac event (elevated troponins, normal CK MB), or TRALI.
She was cautiously diuresed with lasix boluses (10mg IV x2, followed by 20 mg IV x1), with 1.8L UOP.
On [**7-25**], the patient was transferred to CCU, with plans for potential aortic valve replacement the following week, pending improvement in general clinical status.
Diuresis was continued in the CCU, and she continued to respond to IV Lasix with improvement in her respiratory status.
She remained on high-flow O2 face mask, and on [**7-27**], we began to wean the O2.
She may require gentle diuresis with furosemide if she develops further pulmonary edema if she complains of shortness of breath.
# RLL PNA: Patient presented with dyspnea, cough, leukocytosis, and worsening RLL infiltrate on CXR.
Blood culture sent, and patient started on empiric antibiotics with vanc/cefepime to cover potential HCAP, given recent hospitalization.
Patient remained afebrile, she completed an 8 day course of antibiotics and her SOB resolved.
# GIB: H/H significantly decreased from most recent value on [**7-9**] of 10.0/27.4, with baseline Hcts over last couple of months between 25-28.
GI consulted and patient started on pantroprazole drip.
Given supratherapeutic INR, received 10mg IV vit K, rec'd 2 units FFP.
Warfarin was held.
Patient's Hct bumped following transfusion 1 unit pRBCs at [**Location (un) 620**], though trended down over next day back to 24.
In addition, heparin was discontinued [**12-20**] continued GIB and melanotic stools accepting the risk of CVA.
Blood cultures sent before intiation of antibiotics on the day of admission.
Vancomycin and cefepime were started on the day of admission for presumed HCAP in the setting of her recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
She did not have chest pain, and only nonsepcific ST/T changes on EKG which are not significantly changed from prior.
With high suspicion of volume overload in the setting of her additional hypoxia, she was diuresed with several doses of Lasix and her sodium improved to 125 the next morning, which is at her recent baseline.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: H/o Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 with baseline Creat 2.2-2.4, up to 2.7 on admission.
# Afib: She has sick sinus syndrome with ventricular pacer, and is additionally rate controlled on digoxin, metoprolol, amlodipine at home; these were held on admission.
She received vitamin K and FFP with INR coming down to 1.3 on the day following admission.
Given that her CHADS2 score is 5, she does need anticoagulation but in the setting of GIB this was not started initally.
In the CCU, heparin was started and was continued even when her INR was no longer supra-therapuetic as we did not want to restart warfarin in the setting of possible cardiac catheterization.
However, warfarin was restarted 24hr after the procedure at a lower dose of 3mg given her elevated INR on admission.
Warfarin was discontinued in the setting her her GIB which is currenlty more symptomatic for Ms [**Known lastname **], it is hoped that stopping anticoagulation may decrease the severity of her GIB.
She was provided trazodone and seroquel for sleep during her stay at [**Hospital1 **].

Your pneumonia was treated with antibiotics.
The GI doctors performed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] (camera down into the stomach) which showed ulcers which are the likely source of the bleeding.
Because of all of your medical illnesses, you and your family have decided to focus on comfort.
Most of your medications were stopped and we stopped checking labs.
