Operative course was notable for prophylactic placement of an IABP given his very poor ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation.
For additional surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
He remained pressor dependent and remained intubated for several days.
Around postoperative day 2 to 3, developed atrial fibrillation for which he was started on Amiodarone.
Also started on broad spectrum antibiotics for postoperative fevers associated with copious, yellow respiratory secretions.
The IABP was eventually removed without complication and pressors were gradually weaned.
Once off all inotropic support, he was extubated on postoperative five.
He was also noted to have a lower extremity cellulitis and started on warm compresses.
He will need a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for both.
Given postoperative atrial fibrillation, he was started on Warfarin anticoagulation.
