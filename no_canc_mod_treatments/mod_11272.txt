In the Emergency Department, the patient was suctioned with increased secretions and the saturation improved on a 40% tracheostomy mask.
Prior to this presentation, the patient had had multiple complicated admissions, including from [**2190-2-27**], to [**2190-3-3**], for hepatic artery stenosis, status post dilatation and stent, complicated by acute renal failure and multiple multiresistant organisms.
The patient then was admitted from [**2190-3-12**], to [**2190-4-9**], with elevated alkaline phosphatase of unknown origin, episode of [**Year/Month/Day **]/sepsis from a urinary tract infection and pneumonia requiring a Medical Intensive Care Unit transfer, questionable dystonic reaction to Phenergan, and intermittent left bundle branch block with troponin leak, and intermittent delirium, pyloric tube placed for feeding and diarrhea.
In the Emergency Department, the patient received Ceftazidime and Azithromycin.
Hepatitis C virus, status post liver transplant in [**2189-1-31**], and redo transplant in [**2189-2-28**], after hepatic artery stenosis, status post stent.
Pyloric tube placed.
Plavix 75 mg once daily.
Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
Prevacid 30 mg once daily.
Paxil 20 mg once daily.
Vitamin C 500 mg twice a day.
Zinc 220 once daily.
Oxycodone 10 mg p.o.
Ativan 0.5 mg p.r.n.
Bactrim 400/80 once daily.
Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q6hours.
Reglan 10 mg three times a day.
Lasix 20 mg once daily.
Ursodiol 300 mg three times a day.
Nystatin Powder.
Prograf 0.5 mg twice a day.
Loperamide 2 mg four times a day.
Tracheostomy was in place.
Chest x-ray showed a right PICC, postpyloric tube into the duodenum, right sided pleural effusion, no changes.
The patient spent one night in the Intensive Care Unit where she responded to frequent suctioning and nebulizer treatments.
However, early in her hospital stay, the patient was having frequent episodes of desaturation and she was started on Zosyn for possible pneumonia.
She was treated with a seven day course of Zosyn although it was felt that the said organisms were more likely colonizers than infection.
She required frequent suctioning and saline washes to try to reduce the viscosity of the secretions.
At the time of this dictation, the patient has been stable from her pulmonary status, although still requiring frequent respiratory therapy and suctioning.
In terms of her tracheostomy tube, it was noted that the patient was unable to speak with her Passy-Muir valve in place and it was wondered if there may be some upper airway stenoses causing increased resistance.
Combined effort between Speech and Swallow, ENT and Transplant Surgery, it was felt that the patient would benefit from slowly reducing the size of her tracheostomy and trying to wean her off the tracheostomy.
Additionally, the patient continued to have problems clearing her own secretions as mentioned above and thus a smaller diameter tracheostomy would increase the difficulty with these secretions.
Her tracheostomy was changed by ENT to a #6 Shiley cuffed as it was felt that a noncuff would increase the risks for aspiration events.
The patient continued to be too weak to speak with her Passy-Muir valve and it was felt that the valve should not be used until she demonstrated improvement in her strength, decreased her aspiration and we were able to clear her secretions more effectively.
The type of tube feed was changed on a number of occasions to see if an alimentary formula would improve the diarrhea, however, there was not much change.
She was treated symptomatically with Loperamide and Tincture of Opium.
Ultimately, the diarrhea was resolved with the stopping of the tube feeds altogether and changing to TPN for nutrition.
Additionally, Ursodiol was stopped and Cholestyramine was started and this may have also contributed to the resolution of the diarrhea.
The patient had considerable pain from this ulcer and was treated with Oxycodone.
The patient's beta blocker was held for this reason.
Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive throughout her stay and her ace inhibitor was slowly titrated up with a close eye on her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine given her history of acute renal failure, especially in the setting of the Prograf use which was thought to be the likely culprit during her last admission.
As mentioned above, the CellCept was titrated off and the Prograf was titrated up in its place.
Imuran was started as well.
Nutrition - The patient initially was fed with tube feeds through a postpyloric nasogastric tube.
This nasogastric tube unfortunately fell out and a regular nasogastric tube was placed.
As mentioned above, due to the diarrhea, the tube feeds were turned off and the patient was given nutrition through TPN in its place.
The patient remained NPO due to her risk of aspiration.
The patient expressed her desire to continue with aggressive care and remain full code.
She was treated with Epogen and transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The remainder of this discharge summary as well as the discharge diagnoses and medications will be dictated as part of an addendum to this summary.
