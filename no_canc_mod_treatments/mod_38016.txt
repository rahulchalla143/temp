There is moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis.
The tip of the esophageal tube projects over the left upper quadrant.
Atrio-biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are also unchanged in their positions.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach which is not distended.
Given respiratory distress, was intubated on admission to the ICU and a R IJ CVL was placed for BP support.
A-line was placed for BP monitoring.
In summary, the pt is an 80y/o gentleman with CAD s/p CABG x2, sCHF EF 25%, VT/AT/AVNRT s/p ICD and ablation, CKD, DM2 and chronic venous stasis who initially presented with LLE cellulitis, course complicated by worsening CHF unresponsive to diuresis, [**Last Name (un) **] progressing to uremia requiring HD, AMS with myoclonus requiring intubation for airway protection, and superimposed pustular MSSA cellulitis, who was subsequently extubated with gradually improving mental status and transferred to the CCU due to hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT.  #.
He is s/p multiple procedures and ICD for his various arrythmias.
Reason for recurrence was thought to be mild ischemia at HD on the day of transfer due to his anti-arrhythmics being held.
Quinidine was restarted as well as his home dose of mexiletine.
He was also started on a lidocaine drip which was quickly weaned.
He has an ICD for additional rhythm control.
Of note, quinidine must be dosed AFTER dialysis or it will get removed (see below).
He was treated for cellulitis with antibiotics and initiated on HD for renal failure.
With these interventions, he became AAOx3 (oriented to year and president but not date) and improved, but not at his previous baseline.
He was on Vanco dosed per HD protocol and completed a 10d course of this with resolution of his cellulitis.
This time his renal failure worsened on the floor in the setting of volume overload, then was refractory to diuretics [**12-27**] poor forward flow.
He will likely need permanent dialysis in the long run.
Obtained vein mapping and baseline PTH.
Removed several liters of volume with HD.
Started isosorbide dinitrate 10mg po BID and hydralazine 10mg QID to reduce preload and afterload.
# PAF: Pt is on aspirin 325mg daily for PAF per dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was initiated on IV flagyl and and his diarrhea and abdominal tenderness improved.
He never had leukocytosis or fever but was recently treated with multiple abx including vanco, clinda, cefepime, and zosyn.
He was switched to po flagyl and should complete his course on [**2115-4-22**].
CCU COURSE #2 # PEA ARREST: The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2115-4-11**] s/p PEA arrest.
Patient was intubated, received two doses of epinephrine, calcium and sodium bicarb.
Patient was started on norepinephrin 0.2mcg/kg/min.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated and weaned off of pressors successfully.
Patient did have dialysis in house and tolerated it well.
Of note, quinidine must be dosed AFTER dialysis or it will get removed.
Alternatively, it is also possible to give BOTH mexilitine and quinidine AFTER HD if this is more convenient and will avoid confusion.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - finish c. diff course (last dose [**2115-4-22**]) - continue HD - dose quinidine after HD session - pt's sluggish response to questions and flat affect appear to be a new baseline for him, perhaps as a result of anoxic brain injury.
