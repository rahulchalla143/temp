Admission Date:  [**2140-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-10-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right internal jugular vein central line temporary pacemaker wire left femoral arterial line   History of Present Illness: 86F h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2140-9-30**] without intervention, CHF (EF 45%), chronic AF on coumadin since [**8-3**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-6**] for pacemaker placement following multiple recent syncopal episodes.
Emergent right IJ line placed successfully with temp wire and left femoral a-line for hemodynamic monitoring.
She was given 250cc bolus NS and started on dopamine gtt.
A second 250cc NS bolus was given as well as 3mg IV lopressor for rate control.
Briefly started on BiPAP but weaned to 50% VM following repeat ABG 7.36/42/150.
Noted to be minimally responsive following second asystolic episode.
During this admission, she had an NSTEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath [**2140-9-30**] which revealed non-obstructing 2v disease and therefore no intervention was performed.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p NSTEMI [**10-3**] CHF (EF 45%) Chronic AF on coumadin (since [**8-3**]) HTN COPD (FEV1 68%) Lung fibrosis Breast CA s/p chemo-XRT and right lumpectomy (ductal CA in situ)  Lung adenoCA s/p RML lobectomy ([**2134**]) h/o polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] --> myelofibrosis chronic anemia (baseline 28-30; transfusions prn for Hct>28) h/o cataract surgery (right eye)  Social History: Widowed.
Therefore, intervention was not pursued on either lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: 86F h/o CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, CHF (EF 45%), chronic AF on coumadin presented with syncope and long sinus pauses transferred for pacemaker placement s/p asystolic arrest.
She spontaneously recovered, was stabilized on BiPAP and transferred to the CCU.
Shortly after arrival in the CCU she had a 20 sec asystolic pause, received epi and atropine, and was briefly transcutaneously paced.
An emergent temporary pacing wire was placed via the right internal jugular vein.
She was started on dopamine gtt and then weaned to neosynephrine due to persistent tachycardia and lack of BP augmentation.
Her SBP increased to 80's and she was responsive only to painful stimuli with labored respirations of unclear etiology (thought to be [**12-31**] CVA vs. medications vs. hypotension).
She was febrile and had a bandemia lending concern for septic shock and thererefore was started on empiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
An attempt to wean neo was performed the following morning, however during weaning she became acutely hypotensive with SBPs in the 50's associated with the new onset of continuous temp pacing.
