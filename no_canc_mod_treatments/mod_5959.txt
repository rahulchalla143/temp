to hold beta blockers given reaction at [**Hospital3 **] with cocaine.
Under ICU care, she continued to deteriorate and required pressors and intubation.
A PA catheter was placed, which showed severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 100/50.
She went into lactic acidosis with an increase in her lactate from 2 to 15 in one day.
Other issues included: lung nodule - Pulm had recommended PET scan for staging and consulting Interventional Radiology or Thoracic Surgery for nodule biopsy (peripheral location, so bronchoscopic access not possible).
h/o DVT/PE &#8211; Pt did not achieve therapeutic INR despite Coumadin and so Lovenox was started [**7-25**].
