Additional edema in the pelvis superior to the Foley catheter may represent fat necrosis or focal omental infarct.
Unusual course of small bowel in posterior to the descending colon may be secondary to prior surgery or due to a internal hernia through congenital defect in sigmoid mesocolon (intersigmoid hernia).
This does not appear to be at risk for incarceration given the long length under which the small bowel loops run posterior to the descending colon.
There is slight interval additional improvement in the parenchymal opacities that might represent a process of fluctuation of superimposed pulmonary edema giving the more involvement of the lung parenchyma than on for example [**2172-4-18**] or [**2172-4-20**], although note is made that the improvement of the lung parenchyma may lag after clinical improvement.
