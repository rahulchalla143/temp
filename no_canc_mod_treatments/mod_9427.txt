Spanish speaking male with history of PUD s/p Billroth II and celiac disease, admitted on [**2124-4-6**] to MICU for BRBPR, s/p colonoscopy revealing diverticulosis.
# Lower GI Bleed: Patient had a h/o gastric ulcers so initially it was thought that he could have a very brisk UGIB, but with negative NG lavage and rectal blood on exam, lower GI bleed felt more probable.
He received 4 units pRBCs, was prepped overnight and then underwent colonoscopy which revealed diverticulosis and several polyps but no active bleeding.
The polyps were not removed given recent bleed and the patient will need another colonoscopy for removal as an outpatient.
His medications were renally dosed and the creatinine trended down during the course of his ICU stay after transfusion.
# Left Bundle Branch Block: Patient did not have a history of LBBB including on an EKG 5 months prior to admission.
Patient would benefit from Echocardiogram as an outpatient.
