Since the previous study, the high-grade narrowing of the spinal canal has resolved which could be secondary to laminectomy at this level.
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating chronic changes of discitis and osteomyelitis at L4-5 level.

IMPRESSION: A single frontal spot film of the chest centered over the right lower lobe was provided for documentation of a fluoroscopic guided procedure without a radiologist in attendance.
It shows a dual channel central venous line, tip projecting over the right atrium.
He responded to fluids and pressors, and vancomycin and gentamicin.
His subclavian line was changed over a wire and the catheter tip also grew out MRSA.
He was weaned from pressors on [**5-23**] but remained in the MICU for until [**5-25**] for CVVH.
He remained hemodynamically stable, restarted hemodialysis without difficulty.
Patient will continue vancomycin for 6 weeks and will follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic on [**6-15**] at 2pm .
# ESRD: Patient was continued on CVVH while in the MICU via a new subclavian line changed over wire.
However given L subclavian is a future site for dialysis access via fistulas in his L arm.
ON [**5-29**] LUE AV fistula was redone by transplant surgery & replacement R SCV tunneled HD was placed.
# Afib with RVR: Patient was loaded on IV amiodarone while in the MICU and then continued on PO amiodarone 400 po bid x 14 days.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need to restart anticoagulation once cleared by surgery, that no further procedures are required.
# Chronic Pain: Patient was continued on methadone, oxycodone, and neurontin per home regimen .
Continued Epo and transfusions as needed with dialysis.
Continued PO amiodarone and BB.
Consider restarting amlodipine and lisinopril as BP allows as outpatient.
He was continued on BB and aspirin.
# Diabetes - Continued diabetic diet, SSI with FS QID.
