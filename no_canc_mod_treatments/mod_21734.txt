On his admission in early [**Month (only) **], he was treated for presumed cellutitis with 2 weeks of Nafcillin.
On his last admission in mid-[**Month (only) **], he received 1 dose of vanco for fever in ED but afebrile thereafter and not c/w with RA, pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis by Xray.
He presents from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab this time with intermittent fevers fever for one week, and fever to to 102.5 s/p right LE angiography yesterday.
Patient reports that he was felt well after the procedure but was a little depressed because he was admitted for RLE angiogram for RLE ischemia and gangrene and no intervention was performed.
Angiogram had demonstrated severely diseased right superficial femoral artery and occluded posterior tibial artery requiring a femoral to below-knee popliteal bypass graft in order to heal his RLE gangrene.
He went to physical therapy but went back to his room shortly after as felt fatigued, had 4 bouts of emesis prior to falling asleep.
Pancultured and started on CTX, vanco, and azithromycin for concern for pneumonia (CXR read as no consolidation), and transferred to ICU.
He last received antibiotics (1 day on vanco) during his last admission in mid-[**Month (only) **].
Of note, he has been on Solumedrol 8 mg daily x few years for RA, increased to 10 mg three weeks ago for RA flare.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
FINDINGS: The patient is status post vertebroplasty at L2.
No abnormal right lower extremity uptake is identified on blood flow, blood pool, or delayed images.
# Fevers of unknown origin: Patient received CTX, Vanco, Azithromycin in the ED and continued on Vanco and Zosyn in MICU given hypotension.
In the ICU, continued on Vanco and started on Zosyn given hypotension.
Vanco and Zosyn were stopped after cultures were negative x 72 hours.
In terms of infection, no evidence of upper respiratory tract, urinary infection, cellulitis, endocarditis, prostatis (low PSA and s/p chemo/XRT, rectal not specific), bacterial gastroenteritis.
In terms of malignancy, [**10-29**] CTA not very concerning for lung or liver malignancy (Compared to [**2128**] CT, RLL mass slightly smaller without associated pleural effusion; hyperenhancing liver lesions); no lung nodules on CXR or recent CTA chest; last colonoscopy 1 year ago w/ benign polyp; completed treatment for prostate CA; no evidence of bone marrow suppression or multiple myeloma (bone pain but no reported lytic lesions, renal failure, or hypercalcemia, SPEP neg).
As patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable without leukocytosis off vanco and zosyn, he was discharged back to Rehab to complete treatment for C. diff (14 days total after the cessation of Vanco and Zosyn).
# Altered mental status: Resolved in the ICU after receiving antibiotics and IV fluids.
# Hypotension: Differential dx includes dehydration versus infection (pre-sepsis), hemodynamically stable after receiving IVF and antibiotics in the ICU.
BP meds held initially in setting of hypotension but restarted gradually as pt remained hemodynamically stable even off antibiotics.
Rectal exam positive for small amount of bright red blood, likely secondary to inflammatory changes s/p radiation for prostate cancer, stools not grossly blood and Hct stable.
Continued on home dose of oxycodone prn pain.

You were started empirically on IV antibiotics in the setting of low blood pressure, which may have been secondary to infection or dehydration.
As your blood and urine cultures were negative, your IV antibiotics were stopped.
There was a question of possible left ankle osteomyelitis on your bone scan, but Vascular Surgery did not think this was likely on exam, and your tagged white blood scan was not suggestive of this.
You were started on the following new medication: - Flagyl for C. diff.
Please continue to take all other medications as prescribed.
You are scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2130-12-13**] at 9:30 am for Vascular Surgery follow-up.
