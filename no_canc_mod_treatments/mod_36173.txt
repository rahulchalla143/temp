In field, pt was intubated for airway protection, given narcan and D50, with no improvement of MS changes (rpt BS = 150 after D50 administration).
1 hour later, BS = 75 - therefore given another 1amp D50.
Pt treated w/ propofol for intubation sedation and to decrease BP.
Chronic [**Hospital Unit Name **] failure with creatinine around 7, on peritoneal dialysis (5x/wk) 3.

Also possible that some component of acute on chronic [**Month/Year (2) **] failure participated in patient's mental status changes and extended recovery, as she had an elevated potassium and Cr on presentation to ED which began to normalize with peritoneal dialysis in ICU.
Patient was managed in ICU supportively, with close q2-4hr FSBS to keep close monitor of blood glucose, maintained on Keppra anti-sz medication (dose adjusted to 500mg q 24hr for [**Month/Year (2) **] dosing per [**Month/Year (2) **] and neuro recs), close neuro checks, continued intubation with airway protection while continued mental status changes, BP management with outpatient medications (metoprolol).
Pt was maintained on Metoprolol throughout hospital stay, as well as her statin.
Was not on ASA [**1-4**] allergy.
Continue epo 3x/wk (mon, wed, fri).
Prophylaxis: Pt maintained on PPI, heparin SC, aspiration, seizure precautions during stay.
Her blood sugars remained very hard to control, requiring high doses of Humalog sliding scale.
She required an Insulin drip for 2 days.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, 40 U on insulin were added to her dialysate, and her Humalog sliding scale was increased.
This provided better blood sugar control and the insulin drip was d/ced.
received a course of IV Vanc to treat the line infection ([**Date range (1) 18555**]) as well as a week of Levofloxacin to treat a possible UTI.
contaminated her PD catheter and pulled it partially out.
A KUB showed that the catheter was still in good position and an adapter was placed that allowed PD to be continued.
was given an dose of intraperitoneal Vancomycin on [**7-9**], as well as Ciprofloxacin for SBP.
