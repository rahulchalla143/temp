He was intubated in the field was converted out of VF with 1 shock, then transported to [**Hospital6 **] where he was given lidocaine 100mg x 1 in the ED and started on amiodarone drip.
[**1-10**] midnight he was found to be in Vtach and was defibrillated x 3 "with transient response;" he was kept on amiodarone drip.
He again went into pulseless VT and CPR was performed; he received lidocaine 100mg x 1 with good response; he was then started on lido drip at 2mg.
He then had another VT event which was resolved by repeat lidocaine bolus and increasing drip to 3mg.
The lidocaine drip was stopped today as per EP recommendations.

cardiac cath had LAD stenosis and bare metal stent was placed.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 58 yo with PMH significant for morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tonsillar CA s/p chemo/XRT, found down with ventricular fibrillation with several episodes of recurrent VT s/p VT ablation.
# Cardiac 1.
A substrate based ablation was performed which modified but did not completely eliminate the VT. Post-ablation, the pt was treated with metoprolol, amiodarone, and mexilitine.
Following stent placement, there was a marked reduction in the amount of arrhythmia the pt was having.
