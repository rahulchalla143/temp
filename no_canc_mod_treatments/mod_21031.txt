Admission Date:  [**2163-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-2-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-4-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with recent right total knee replacement in [**2162-11-25**].
Status post open reduction/internal fixation in [**2162-12-26**].
Her surgeries were performed in [**State 531**], and she was initially in rehabilitation there, but she was later transferred to [**Hospital6 85**] in [**Location (un) 86**] because this facility is closer to her family.
Blood cultures were drawn at rehabilitation, and she received 1 gram of cefepime intravenously en route.
She was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole.
She also received hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously times one because she takes steroids chronically, and it was felt she may need stress-dose steroids.
Total knee replacement on the right on [**2162-12-17**].
Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Zocor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneously at hour of sleep.
Toprol-XL 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
Iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth twice per day.
Lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Clonidine 0.1 mg by mouth twice per day.
Synthroid 50 mcg by mouth once per day 11.
Advair 1 puff inhaled once per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Ritalin 2.5 mg by mouth in the morning.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent orthopaedic procedures who presented from rehabilitation with fever, back pain, and hypoxia.
The patient was started on vancomycin with gentamicin added for synergy.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was planned for [**2-7**], but it could not be performed because of lack intravenous access and the patient's confusion.
There was 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation with a right atrium to right ventricular gradient to 36 mmHg.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was a poor study because of motion artifact that showed abnormal signal from L1 to L5 with probable epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, and L5-S1 discitis.
These remained positive despite vancomycin and gentamicin therapy from [**2-2**] through [**2-7**].
On [**2-15**], gentamicin was discontinued because her creatinine increased to 1.6.
There was concern for gentamicin toxicity.
QUESTION OF ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have increasing oxygen requirements with thick secretions.
She was started on piperacillin tazobactam for broad coverage of nosocomial pathogens.
A sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to levofloxacin and sensitive to piperacillin tazobactam.
She became confused, disoriented, unable to follow commands, and pulled at her tubes and lines.
When studies needed to be performed, she was given Haldol intermittently with moderate-to-good affect.
She was briefly on a diltiazem drip with good control, and she ultimately spontaneously converted to a normal sinus rhythm.
The diltiazem was discontinued, and she was loaded on amiodarone 400 mg by mouth twice per day which should be halved in one week.
The patient was continued on beta blockade, and ACE inhibitor and furosemide was started to decrease preload and afterload.
However, when the patient's renal function worsened the ACE inhibitor and Lasix were discontinued.
Because of the possibility of acute interstitial nephritis, piperacillin was discontinued.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2-8**] when her hematocrit was 27.5.
However, she was empirically started on acyclovir due to the high likelihood of this being herpes.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/ASTHMA ISSUES: The patient has been on prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day for a long time, and this was continued.
HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on Synthroid 50 mcg by mouth once per day.
A right subclavian line was placed on [**2-7**] and was removed on [**2-17**].
A right internal jugular line was planned for intraoperative placement.
An nasogastric tube was placed, and she received approximately three days of full-strength tube feeds prior to proceeding to the operating room for epidural abscess debridement.
The Swallow Service recommended percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in the event her swallowing function does not recover following the operation.
COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient had an INR of approximately 2 for the first and second weeks of her hospitalization which was likely secondary to malnutrition and vitamin K deficiency in her diet.
She was given vitamin K and the coagulopathy resolved.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on heparin subcutaneously for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
