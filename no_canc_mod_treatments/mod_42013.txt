Endotracheal tube tip at carina, proximal repositioning is recommended.
Two left pleural tubes terminate in the posterior left pleural space.
Ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, left greater than right, are nonspecific, but compatible with aspiration or infection in the correct clinical setting.

[**2194-10-6**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] 1.
He was initially awake and following commands, but was intubated in the trauma bay for increasing respiratory distress with possible aspiration.
He was brought to the TSICU for further resuscitation and management.
His ICU course as follows by systems:  Neuro:  GCS 15 and moving all extremities in the trauma bay, the patient was intubated for progressive respiratory distress and was kept intubated and sedated on fentanyl and versed until HD 9.
Propofol was also used to facilitate daily wake ups.
He required paralysis with cisatracurium for ventilation until HD 7.
NG pain medication was added HD8.
Propofol was discontinued on [**10-4**] in order to facilitate ongoing vent wean.
He continued to have his ventilator weaned and successfully extubated the am of HD 12.
On [**10-9**] he sustained a fall and began to complain of thoracic spine tenderness.
Spine surgery were re-consulted and recommended a TLSO brace to be worn while out of bed.
CV:  After being initially hemodynamically stable on admission, the patient required a Neo-Synephrine drip after intubation.
Echo and CXR were unremarkable, but he required ongoing pressor support with Levophed until [**10-2**].
He was placed in ARDS ventilatory settings but had an increasing PEEP requirement for adequate oxygenation complicated by a large left pneumothorax on [**9-27**] requiring urgent chest tube decompression with immediate improvement.
He was aggressively diuresed but required a prolonged wean from the ventilator.
Infectious disease consultation was obtained for presumed aspiration pneumonia with acid-fast bacilli, and initial empiric vancomycin and Zosyn were de escalated to Zosyn on [**9-30**].
On [**9-30**], a repeat CXR revealed increase in a left subpulmonic pneumothorax and a second, posterior chest tube was placed with satisfactory resolution.
Diuresis continued.
PEEP and FIO2 were able to be weaned, and on [**10-6**], he was tolerating pressure support.
The apical chest tube was removed on [**10-6**].
He extubated on [**10-7**] and tolerated this well and has remained on nasal canula oxygen.
He continued to be weaned off his oxygen requirement, until he was on room air and oxygen saturations were above > 90%.
Tube feeds were started on HD2 and advanced to goal, which he tolerated without difficulty.
GU:  He had a Foley placed in the ED and produced adequate urine during his ICU stay, responding appropriately to diuresis.
Endo:  Sliding scale insulin coverage was provided in the ICU.
Heme/ID:  His WBC began to climb though he did not spike any fevers and none of his cultures came back positive as of HD 5.
As noted above, he was treated initially with vancomycin and Zosyn, then de escalated to Zosyn alone.
Infectious disease consultation was obtained, and a 10 day course of Zosyn was completed [**10-6**].
His floor course as follows:  On HD 14 ([**2194-10-10**]), the patient was transferred to the inpatient medical/surgical unit for further management.
On HD 15 he received his TLSO brace and was evaluated by physical therapy.
His  oxygen requirement was weaned to room air and his oxygen saturations were kept above > 90%.
His pain was well controlled with oral medications.
On HD 16 his Foley catheter was discontinued and he was voiding large amounts of urine without difficulty.
On HD 17 (On [**2194-10-14**]) he was taken to the OR by Plastics Hand Surgery for a primary left ring finger distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis.
He will require a 7 day course of Keflex antibiotics post-operatively.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Do NOT smoke  *  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves.
