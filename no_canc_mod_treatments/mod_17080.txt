Admission Date:  [**2102-12-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-1-4**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
The pain improved to [**2-14**] status post sublingual nitroglycerin times two.
The patient was treated with a heparin drip, nitroglycerin drip, aspirin, beta blocker, and Retavase.
The patient is currently chest pain free on a nitroglycerin drip at the time of evaluation.
The patient was sent to the Coronary Care Unit for evaluation of a groin hematoma.
The patient notes using a walker at baseline and notes progressive dyspnea on exertion times one to two months.
Poor balance; status post back surgery times five years ago.
Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Diovan 160 mg by mouth once per day.
Glyburide 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
His creatine phosphokinase was 190, MB was 9.3, cardiac index was 5, and troponin at the outside hospital was 1.21.
There were 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL with inferolateral 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions, showing serial interval changes with T wave inversions in leads I and aVL and decreased inferolateral depressions.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction after having been treated with thrombolytic therapy.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed 3-vessel disease and subsequently was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery for a possible coronary artery bypass graft.
After discussions with Cardiothoracic Surgery and Cardiology, the patient elected to proceed with a 3-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention rather than a coronary artery bypass graft.
Meanwhile, he was continued on aspirin.
He was started on Plavix and Lipitor.
He was weaned off his nitroglycerin drip and was continued on a heparin drip while awaiting his planned multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention.
The patient returned to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**1-1**] and underwent successful stenting of his right posterolateral branch with cypher stent.
He underwent successful stenting of his left anterior descending artery lesion with a cypher stent.
He underwent successful stenting of his first diagonal with a overlapping pixel stent.
Status post catheterization, he was briefly hypotensive after his sheath was removed which responded to intravenous fluids.
Status post catheterization, he was maintained on Integrilin per protocol and continued on the above-mentioned medications; including aspirin, Plavix, statin, and beta blocker.
(b)  Pump function:  Despite normal right-sided filling pressures, the patient was felt to be in mild congestive heart failure based upon rales on examination and lower extremity edema.
He was started on by mouth Lasix 40 mg twice per day for a goal diuresis of one liter negative per day.
He was eventually weaned off nasal cannula.
He saturated well with physical therapy.
The patient was discharged on 40 mg of Lasix by mouth twice per day.
The patient was continued on Toprol 75 mg by mouth once per day.
He was also continued on his Diovan 160 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient was to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24298**] and cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32255**]) in several days' time for further re-evaluation of his volume status and electrolytes.
He was tolerating gentle increases in his metoprolol while he was continued on his Diovan as well.
As mentioned above, he had a brief hypotensive episode after sheath removal following his second cardiac catheterization which responded appropriately with intravenous fluids.
The patient was treated empirically for congestive heart failure with Lasix for a goal diuresis of one liter negative per day.
It was confirmed on the computed tomography scan on [**1-2**] a right groin hematoma extending into right thigh without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
He did end up receiving one unit of packed red blood cells.
RENAL/ENDOCRINOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient's electrolytes and renal function remained stable with his diuresis on by mouth Lasix.
The patient was restarted on his outpatient glyburide for his diabetes.
Status post successful percutaneous coronary intervention stents to the left anterior descending artery, first diagonal, and right posterolateral arteries.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)  1.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Toprol 75 mg by mouth once per day.
Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice per day.
Diovan 160 mg by mouth every day.
Glyburide 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace one tablet by mouth twice per day.
Nitroglycerin as needed.
The patient had done well with physical therapy while in house.
