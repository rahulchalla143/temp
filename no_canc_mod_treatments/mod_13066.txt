In particular, after placement of BiV pacemaker/ICD, the patient developed hypotension.
He was placed on Neosynephrine for a short period of time and responded well with MAPs >65.
Initially the differential of the hypotension included sepsis, cardiogenic shock, tamponade, and dehydration.
However, 2 ECHO's did not show evidence of tamponade, and the swan catheter did not support cardiogenic shock.
Zosyn and vanco were started for presumed nosocomial infection or infection d/t surgery.
BB, ACE, and lasix, and aldactone were initially held, but losartan waw restarted and titrated up to home dose, and [**Last Name (un) 61755**] was started and kept at 1/2 home dose.
Lasix IV was subsequently used when patient demonstrated fluid overload, improving the patient's breathing and clinical status.
After pacemaker/ICD placement on [**6-13**], the patient was started on Vanc per recommendations of CSurg.
Initially the plan was to wait until [**6-17**] for DCCV and load the patient with ibutilide and lidocaine and start him on amio on [**6-16**].
Pneumonia was considered as a cause of the fever and hypotension for several reasons, including complicated OR course of intubation and adjusting lung volumes as needed for placement of leads of pacemaker, developing a new productive cough, and having infiltrates on CXR.
Pt was started on vancomycin per protocol of pacemaker placement and given dose of levofloxacin in PACU for fever.
Laboratory data did not definitively confirm the source of infection, as sputum cultures revealed only moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora ([**6-17**], after antibiotics had already begun), urine cultures were negative, and blood cultures did not demonstrate growth.
In regards to his CHF and cardiac status, digoxin was held d/t dig toxicity (level 1.3), while ASA and zocor were continued.
As hypotension improved metoprolol was added, as well as losartan and coreg.
BP tolerated these medication additions well  Patient has underlying diabetes and was placed on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
He also received SQ heparin and protonix as prophylactic measures for DVT and gastric bleed, respectively.
