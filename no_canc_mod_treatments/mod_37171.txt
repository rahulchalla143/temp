Overall slight decrease in size of moderate loculated right pleural fluid collection following placement of right-sided chest tube.
A pigtail pleural catheter also remains in place.
Although majority of pleural fluid is simple in appearance, a high attenuation focus may represent a hemorrhagic component as discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by telephone on the date of the study.
Loculated gas collections within right pleural fluids, which are likely related to recent intervention with chest tube and pigtail catheter in place.5.
He initially was given levofloxacin that was changed early on to Zosyn/azithromycin but CXR showed pleural effusion.
Bedside thoracentesis was attempted but unsuccessful.
Pleural fluid continued to accumulate and a chest tube was placed by IP and had intermittent drainage.
However on [**5-4**] he was found to be somnolent and in respiratory distress after receiving 8mg morphine and 2 mg dilaudid for pain at the chest tube site.
He required narcan and a transfer to the ICU.
While in the ICU he was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
He was extubated a few hours after the procedure and has done well since then (except for brief hypotension while on the propofol gtt in the MICU).
He was restarted on Vancomycin on [**5-10**] as the pleural fluid from the VATS was again G+ cocci and there was a concern in the ICU for MRSA.
Pt started on levofloxacin and then changed to Zosyn/azithromycin.
Pt required supplemental O2.
Was changed to cefpodoxime given fluid did not grow resistant organisms.
MS changes: Patient was noted to have mental status changes but this occured in the setting of morphine and dilaudid and the transfer to the ICU.
Did not clear with thoracentesis; thus, chest tube placed by thoracic surgery on [**2118-5-4**].
