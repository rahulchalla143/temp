Admission Date:  [**2179-5-17**]       Discharge Date: [**2179-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-3-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2176**], hypertension, and a former smoking history as well as a family history of coronary artery disease and age greater than 55, who presented with increased shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea and vomiting on the morning of admission to [**Hospital3 3583**].
At the outside hospital he was given aspirin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, started on a heparin drip, and given intravenous fluids.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization which showed two-vessel disease, but intervention could not be accomplished given the location of the lesions.
Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent in [**2176**].
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**2177**].
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Hydralazine 30 mg p.o.
Metoprolol  7.
Lisinopril  8.
On Levaquin a week ago for pneumonia.
Chest:  Significant for diffuse wheezing anteriorly and a Tesio catheter on the right side of the chest.
Chemistries revealed a glucose of 173, sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 29, creatinine 6.
Cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease with a left anterior descending coronary artery distal occlusion, a left circumflex 40-50% long obtuse marginal #1, right coronary artery stent from a previous catheterization patent with a small distal PL lesion of 70% at the origin.
There is a question as to whether or not the patient would benefit from coronary artery bypass graft surgery, a question which at the time of this dictation had not yet been answered.
The patient was treated with aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
The patient could not be started on a beta blocker because of hypotension.
Because his coronary artery disease was not repaired during cardiac catheterization, the decision was made to keep the patient on heparin drip during his hospital stay.
This heparin drip had to be discontinued on [**5-24**] because of persistent oozing from a groin line.
The patient was also started on a salt and fluid restricted diet.
Based on the echocardiogram results, the patient was deemed appropriate for long-term anticoagulation, but this was not started immediately, given his hemodialysis issues which are further described below.
He was maintained on heparin during his hospital stay, but this had to be discontinued as mentioned above.
He was able to tolerate captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation without any symptoms while undergoing hemodialysis during his hospital stay.
As a result, he was started on amiodarone.
End-stage renal disease:  The patient underwent hemodialysis as mentioned above.
He was continued on his outpatient dose of Renagel and his PhosLo was changed to Amphojel.
His hemodialysis access site, which consisted of a Tesio catheter, had to be discontinued after he spiked a fever in house and the line was considered a potential source of infection.
The renal team inserted a temporary hemodialysis access catheter into his right femoral vein.
This procedure was complicated by subsequent oozing from the site while on heparin, so the patient's heparin was discontinued.
Given the degree of bacteremia, the patient was continued on vancomycin which he had been started on when presumptive identification of Gram-positive cocci had been made.
The patient has been receiving vancomycin one gram at dialysis based on vancomycin levels drawn in the morning.
He was treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and inhalers while in house.
He was also started on a steroid inhaler, Flovent.
The patient suffered oozing from his right femoral groin site on heparin and so heparin was discontinued.
As a consequence the patient's hematocrit dropped to below 28 and he required transfusion of packed red blood cells.
He was also given EPO at hemodialysis.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  The patient was maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale and [**Doctor First Name **] diet during his hospital stay.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was treated with Protonix for GI prophylaxis.
For deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis he was on a heparin drip for most of his hospital stay.
When this was discontinued he was started on subcutaneous heparin.
