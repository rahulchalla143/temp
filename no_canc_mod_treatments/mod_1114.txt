His PICC line has been in for approximately one year without issues, except one port is clotted.
He was admitted to MICU for further management.
Past Medical History: 1) Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (EF15-20%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V Pacer/ICD ([**11-12**])  2) CAD/CABG [**2135**] (SVG-LAD, SVG-LCX) 3) DMII 4) CRI (Cr 1.3-1.8) 5) Anemia of Chronic Disease 6) HTN 7) Lichen Simplex Chronicus 8) S/p INH repair in [**2151**].
Initially he was placed on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl for broad spectrum abx coverage, but this was decreased to Levofloxacin monotherapy after sensitivities returned.
The PICC line was d/c'd on [**5-31**] and a temporary central line was placed.
Given concern for seeding of his lines and pacer leads, an ID consult was obtained to assess the need for TEE to more definitively rule out endocarditis and course of Abx treatment.
Because of his rapid response to therapy and insufficient evidence to definitively suggest a line infection, a two-week course of antibiotics was recommended and the pacemaker was not removed.

Bumex and coreg were held, and lisinopril and digoxin were continued.
His home medications were resumed on discharge.
