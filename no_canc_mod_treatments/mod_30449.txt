Admission Date:  [**2175-1-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-3-9**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, mechanical mitral valve regurgitation on Coumadin, osteoporosis, prior strokes and rheumatic heart disease who was recently admitted over [**Holiday 1451**] to the left lower extremity weakness and dysarthria that improved over the coming days.
At that time, on initial examination at she had left hemiparesis.She was also taking aspirin at the time.
She was discharged from the Neurology Service at that point on Coumadin and Aggrenox.
At that point she was in the Intensive Care Unit on the Neurosurgery Service and was doing well on heparin drip.
Sensory is intact to light touch, pin prick, vibration, proprioception and temperature.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the Neurology Service we had her on heparin for a goal PTT of 40 to 50.
With anticoagulation there is an increased risk of hemorrhage and bleeding and subsequent death, however, without anticoagulation given her mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation there is also a risk of embolic stroke disability as well as death.
We seemed to agree that using heparin in the short term for a low PTT of 40 to 60 using Coumadin for the long term goal would be an optima solution .
Regarding her mitral valve regurgitation, cardiology would like an optimal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 to prevented thromboembolism, however, in her situation of recent bleed on Coumadin we will plan on watching her INR extremely closely as we do not want to get to a supratherapeutic range.
We consulted cardiology for help with further management of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure has always been systolic of 102 to 120 and this has at times limited us from using antihypertensives and rate control agents such as beta blockers for her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
We decided to mange her BP and HR with Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.
as well as Lisinopril 5 mg q day and we decided to load her on Digoxin for better rate control.
The pharmacologic interaction of Digoxin increasing the INR when the patient is on Coumadin is noted and also needs to be watched extremely carefully while both Digoxin and the Coumadin achieve a steady state for Ms. [**Known lastname **].
She will require frequent INR checks likely q day until the Digoxin load and Coumadin level have both reached a steady state.
She will be discharged to rehab today to [**Hospital1 **] on telemetry monitoring and for physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy.
Status post mitral valve regurgitation.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Coreg 6.25 mg po b.i.d.
Lisinopril 5 mg po q day hold for SBP less then 90.
Digoxin .125 mg po q every other day.
Her next dose should be given on [**1-18**] and then every other day after that.
A Digoxin level should be checked as well.
Coumadin 1.5 mg po q every other day alternating with 1 mg po q every other day.
Her INR should be checked q day until a steady state is reached between her Coumadin and her Digoxin.
Ambien 5 to 10 mg po q.h.s.
Lasix 10 mg po q day.
Zoloft 25 mg po q day.
Synthroid 88 mcg po q day.
Depakote 250 mg po b.i.d.
Her diet is cardiac heart healthy and her rehabilitation potential is good.
