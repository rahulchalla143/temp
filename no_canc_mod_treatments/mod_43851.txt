He denies any chest pain/pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis or nausea.
Per patient, he has had a productive cough with green sputum (x3 day) and hemoptysis (x1 day).
His CXR is concerning for pneumonia, and he received ceftriaxone at OSH.
Pt received azithromycin in ED.
He dropped pressure into 80s, and received 500cc IVF, though careful because of evidence of fluid overload based on elevated BNP at OSH (pt received a small dose of lasix there).
Ortho was following, and planned for operative fixation which was done.

The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital articulations are preserved.
[**2162-11-9**] PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST: Left pectoral dual-lead pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and right ventricle in unchanged position.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103098**] is an 86 year old gentleman with history of Afib (on coumadin w/INR=2.5), moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, history of sick sinus (s/p dual chamber pacer in [**2159**]) and CAD (EF>55% in [**8-/2162**]) presented with hip fracture s/p mechanical fall complicated by pneumonia, was in ICU for oxygen requirement, hypotension and refractory afib, transferred to cardiology floor for further management of fluid, oxygen requirement, and Afib after being stable.
CXR concerning for R-sided pneumonia, CT with right focal opacities concerning for infection.
In ED, new O2 requirement and transient hypotension (now resolved) with differential diagnosis most concerning for pneumonia, with apparently underlying lung pathology (considering amiodarone toxicity +/- COPD).
Patient received one dose of ceftriaxone at OSH and one dose of azithromycin in ED for treatment of presumptive community-acquired penumonia.
In the ICU, patient completed Antibiotic course of azithromycin 500 mg daily + ceftriaxone 1g IV daily.
Vancomycin was discontinued after 24 hours.
Patient remained on albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4h and prn, with chest physical therapy, incentive spirometry.
Cardiology recommended diuresis with afterload reduction using lasix and captopril, which improved oxygenation to 2L NC.
He was started on furosemide 20mg daily and discharged on it with a plan to add on lisinopril as tolerated by blood pressure.
# Mitral regurgitation: He is likely too old and frail to have mitral valve surgery so this will need to be managed medically.
Initially attempted digoxin load, but per cardiology, switched to amiodarone load.
Also, pacemaker sleep mode HR increased to 70.
Given his CT chest findings of bibasal fibrotic changes, pulmonary team was consulted and amiodarone was discontinued.
He was orthostatic with physical therapy the day prior to his discharge.
He underwent ORIF R hip on [**2162-11-3**].
# Pulmonary fibrosis: He has been on amiodarone for several years.
His amiodarone was discontinued.
He was continued on ceftriaxone as above.
Continued home ASA 81 mg po daily and pravastatin 40 mg. ACEi was initially added to reduce afterload but given his orthostasis it was disconitnued.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home pravastatin 40 mg daily .
