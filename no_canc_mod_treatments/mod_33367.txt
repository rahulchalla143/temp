Post-operatively in the PACU, she was noted to be quite agitated and delirious and was given serial boluses of IV haloperidol (total 1.5 mg).
She was also noted to be hypertensive with SBPs as high as the 190s, though these readings were taken on her right radial arterial line in the setting of her thrashing around; she was given standing IV metoprolol and a dose of IV labetalol for BP control.
The patient will not be discharged on anti-coagulation due to her subdural hematoma.
