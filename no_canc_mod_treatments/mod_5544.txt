Was treated with a bolus, 10mg IV diltiazem with good effect.

Pt was started on solumedrol 80mg IV q8h and placed on standing albuterol/atrovent nebs.
As pt seemed to improve clinically, with good oxygen saturation with 1-2L O2 by nasal cannula (usually 97-100% O2 sat on 1L NC), a taper of the steroids was begun.
2.  pneumonia - On admission, pt was on day [**1-28**] of broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, Flagyl, and vancomycin), with H flu the only reported organism growing from sputum cultures at the VA (never here).
The PICC line was pulled, and the tip sent for culture, which revealed coag negative Staph that was oxacillin resistant.
Pt was rate controlled, first with metoprolol, but was then changed to verapamil in the setting of severe lung disease.
Pt was monitored on telemetry, and verapamil was uptitrated as needed to maintain good rate control.
Sources were likely pneumonia, which may not have been adequately treated due to PICC infiltration.
It was recommended that pt get a repeat chest CT in one month, and if there is evidence of progression, he may need to follow up with cardiothoracic surgery as an outpatient for further management decisions.
6.  left cephalic vein thrombosis - Pt's arm was noted to be somewhat swollen, though this was initially thought to be due to PICC infiltration.
The case was again discussed with cardiology and radiology, as well as the primary attending, and it was decided not to anticoagulate the patient, since a cephalic vein clot is not considered to be a deep vein thrombosis, and the risk of anticoagulation in this pt is high.
Pt was treated with heat packs and elevation of the arm.
Pt was covered with a sliding scale insulin, and fingersticks were checked four times per day.
Pt remained hyperglycemic into the 200s with every [**Location (un) 1131**], so he was begun on glargine insulin 20 units for a baseline antihyperglycemic effect.
[**Name (NI) **] - pt was maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
He was given a bowel regimen, as well, as he tends towards constipation.
