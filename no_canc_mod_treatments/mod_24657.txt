His pain was well controlled with a Morphine PCA.
On [**2132-9-19**] he underwent arteriography and embolization of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the splenic artery.
He tolerated the procedure well, continued to have his hematocrits followed and they remained stable.
He was subsequently transferred to the Trauma floor for further management where he continued to make good progress.
The Physical Therapy service recommended home physical therapy and supervision at home over the first 24 hours.
His blood pressure during his hospitalization was generally lower in the 90-100/60 range.
Therefore his pre admission medications were adjusted and will have to be followed by his PCP as he may require the full dose in time.
Pior to discharge he had a Pneumovax vaccine as well as influenza.
