HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post CABG x2, aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement on Coumadin with recent prosthetic valve thrombosis, status post TPA thrombolysis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% with 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring pacemaker and ICD placement, now presents from rehabilitation with acute renal failure and hypertension requiring pressors.
The patient is status post a prolonged hospital course from [**Month (only) 404**] to [**2104-3-15**] for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction requiring a redo CABG.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by renal failure requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath hematoma, failure to wean from the ventilator requiring tracheostomy placement, atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone, ventricular fibrillation arrest, requiring ICD placement, and prosthetic aortic valve thrombus requiring TPA thrombolysis complicated by ICD pocket hematoma.
The patient underwent removal of the ICD and was started on oxacillin for treatment of MSSA cellulitis.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart failure and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**4-15**] on diuretics including Zaroxolyn, Lasix, and aldactone, as well as oxacillin to complete a three week course.
The patient's diuretics were initially reduced, however, the patient's renal failure was thought to be secondary to worsened congestive heart failure with a total body volume overload and ineffective renal perfusion.
More aggressive diuresis was attempted, however, with minimal effect.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive and was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Department, where she received normal saline boluses, and was started on dopamine secondary to systolic blood pressures in the 60s.
Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2092**] with redo CABG in [**2104-1-16**].
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2104-2-9**] for acute graft closure with PTCA and stenting of the LIMA to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the diag.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest [**2104-2-16**] status post ICD placement with dual pacer.
Status post rectus sheath hematoma.
ICD pocket infection status post ICD and pacer removal.
Failure to wean from ventilator status post tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**2104-2-16**].
Aortic stenosis status post bileaflet aortic valve (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] replacement) complicated by valve thrombosis requiring TPA thrombolysis.

PEG tube in place with guaiac positive rectal examination.
Skin examination:  ICD pocket dressing in place, clean, dry, and intact with left thigh dressing in place secondary to a saphenous vein graft harvest site infection with failure to heal.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 127, potassium 4.6, chloride 87, bicarb 23, BUN 115, and creatinine of 3.0 with a glucose of 180.
Chest x-ray with diffuse patchy infiltrates, no pneumothorax and right IJ and PICC line in place.
Arterial blood gas on assist control tidal volume 500, PEEP of 5, respiratory rate 18, FIO2 of 100% with a pH of 7.28, pCO2 62, and pO2 of 52.
Was complicated by hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure and concomitant pneumonia requiring continuous ventilatory support, sepsis requiring pressors, and acute persistent renal failure.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**4-21**] for hemodynamic monitoring with evidence of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output consistent with concomitant sepsis and heart failure.
The patient was continued on oxacillin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis of unknown etiology.
The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as 24 requiring multiple blood transfusions, however, the patient was felt too unstable to undergo colonoscopy.
After multiple unsuccessful attempts at DC cardioversion, the patient was started on digoxin with adequate heart rate control.
Secondary to excessive intravenous fluid boluses in the setting of sepsis, the patient became totally body volume overload with increasing oxygen requirement.
Aggressive diuresis with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn was attempted without effect.
The patient's Heparin was held, however, the patient's hematocrit continued to decrease requiring continuous blood transfusion.
General Surgery was consulted without surgical options and the patient's hematoma continued to grow.
A code was called, CPR performed with multiple rounds of shocks, Epinephrine, atropine, as well as amiodarone loading.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement.
Aortic valve thrombosis status post TPA thrombolysis.
Status post ICD placement and removal.
