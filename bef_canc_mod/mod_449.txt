Opacification at the lung bases is more pronounced on the left today, stable on the right compared to [**3-22**].
Left-sided changes are particularly suggestive of pneumonia due to recent aspiration since right lower lobe atelectasis has been present since [**2-5**].
Azygous distention indicates volume overload.
Heart size top normal, no change.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
No pneumothorax.

#Pneumonia due to Proteus and Methicillin resistant staph aureus: Patient was admitted with hypoxia above 2-3L home needs and was found to have right basilar opacification on CXR and CT showed RLL heterogenous consolidation and RUL ill defined opacification with trace right sided effusion.
#Aspiration: Patient is known to aspirate when eating, but has not had history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias.
It is unclear why the patient aspirated resulting in pneumonia this admission, but it may have been related to an underlying viral URI as subglottic edema was seen on evaluation laryngoscopy with ENT.
She was allowed to eat a soft diet with thinned liquids and all crushed pills and tolerated this without significant desaturations.
#Chronic deep venous thrombosis: Patient had a supratherapeutic INR during admission and Coumadin was held.
#Left Uppe extremity swelling: Patient was noted to have left upper extremity swelling related to the RUE without pitting edema, change in temparature or skin changes of the limb, reduced ROM, or pain.
INR was >3 entire admission and LUEUS showed no DVT.
Given that the patient had a PICC in that arm, it was felt that this swelling related to reduced venous outflow from PICC.
To help keep pain controlled would consider assessing pain every 3-4 hours and giving dilaudid po every 4 hours to keep control of the pain.
#Depression: Continued on citalopram  #Pressure ulcer: Patient has healing ulcer under trach which has been treated with Xeroform guaze.
#Prophylaxis: INR>2  #Contact: [**Name (NI) 9496**] (HCP, not related), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26284**]; [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26285**]  #CODE: DNR  #Disposition: Patient was discharged to rehab to continue abx for pneumonia until [**2127-3-29**] and for continued monitoring of aspiration and respiratory status improvement.
She may require occasional deep suctioning if she has desaturation and should eat with trach button, but otherwise should not have the trach button in per ENT recs.
