Admission Date:  [**2191-9-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2191-9-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2125-8-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 66 year old man who has a history of tobacco use and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] CCU after an elective cardiac catheterization for increasing shortness of breath over the past four and one half years.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recently diagnosed with his history of shortness of breath on exertion, however, no documented pulmonary function tests.
Recent diagnosis of sleep apnea.
Vitamin E.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 35819**] office on [**2191-7-29**], with a history of shortness of breath on exertion over the past 4.5 years.
The patient stated that the shortness of breath had worsened over the past three to four months.
The patient subsequently underwent a stress echocardiogram for evaluation of this shortness of breath.
Apparently there was evidence of mitral regurgitation but no ischemia on the study.
The patient was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and underwent an echocardiogram on [**2191-8-24**], which apparently showed mildly decreased left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%.
There was also concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
On left ventriculography, the patient had severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 10% and mild mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination in the CCU, the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 109, respiratory rate 19, blood pressure 96/55 with oxygen saturation of 97% on three liters nasal cannula.
On examination, the patient was awake, alert and comfortable in no apparent distress.
On cardiovascular examination, he was noted to have jugular venous distention with normal S1 and S2, regular rhythm and no S3 or S4.
He had no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
He had 2+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses.
He had mild 1+ pitting edema in his ankles.
Electrocardiogram showed the patient to be in sinus rhythm at 110 beats per minute with left axis deviation, occasional premature ventricular contractions and low limb voltages.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, on [**2191-9-3**], was noted to have an 18 beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia without any symptoms.
His chest x-ray was unremarkable with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
He also begun on anticoagulation due to his low ejection fraction.
The patient also had a workup for hemochromatosis which was negative and a serum protein electrophoresis was normal.
On [**2191-9-6**], the patient was noted to have a run of accelerated idioventricular rhythm which was again asymptomatic.
On that study, the patient was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20% with left atrial enlargement and lipomatous hypertrophy of his interatrial septum.
There were no thrombi demonstrated in his left ventricle.
There was a degree of mitral regurgitation present but it was unable to be quantified.
He had 1+ to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion.
There was also a note of mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2191-9-8**], the patient's dyspnea and his congestive heart failure had improved to the point that the patient was stable and ready for discharge.
He was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] in two weeks with regards to his congestive heart failure.
At the time of discharge, the patient still had some outstanding tests pending for his workup of his cardiomyopathy including [**Location (un) **] B viruses and Enteroviruses.
