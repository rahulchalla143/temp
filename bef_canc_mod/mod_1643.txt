However, some of these cavitations are showing central lucencies which is concerning for cavitation.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, which are unchanged.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis or intra-/extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Echogenic liver, compatible with fatty infiltration, although other forms of cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded.
Trace ascites and splenomegaly.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs some of which are nodular, but not cavitated, most likely representing multifocal pneumonia.
The moderate right pleural effusion and scattered mediastinal, hilar, axillary lymph nodes are likely reactive.
Extensive largely interstitial infiltration and nonconsolidated alveolitis worsened throughout both lungs.
Pulmonary hemorrhage and viral pneumonia would be leading possibilities.
Smaller regions of consolidation are less prominent today than five days ago, suggesting some improvement in what might have been smaller foci of severe hemorrhage or pneumonia due to another pathogen.
Since there has been an increase in a moderate nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion, pulmonary edema is an alternative third explanation for the widespread pulmonary abnormality.
#  ECHO [**2103-12-13**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or abscess seen.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Following chest tube removal, there is no definite evidence of pneumothorax.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, though they may be somewhat decreased since the previous study.
The appearance probably reflects a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.
# CXR [**2103-12-21**]:  PATHOLOGY: ---------- # RUE Biopsy: Skin, right upper arm, punch biopsy (A):  Focal intraepidermal pustule, mild spongiosis, dyskeratosis, and superficial perivascular infiltrate with focal neutrophils and rare eosinophils.
The combined findings of an intraepidermal pustule, dyskeratosis, and dermal eosinophils favors a pustular drug eruption or acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).
AGEP is usually due to a drug, however, rarely cases may be associated with a bacterial or viral infection.
Gram stain is negative for bacteria.
Lung, lower lobe superior segment, wedge biopsy (A-E): Acute and organizing pneumonia with hemorrhage, see note.
Lung, right upper lobe, wedge biopsy (F-K): Acute and organizing pneumonia with hemorrhage, see note.
Lung, right middle lobe, wedge biopsy (L-M): Acute and organizing pneumonia with hemorrhage, see note.
Note: Likely causes include viral and bacterial etiologies.

She was treated with vanc and zosyn at an outside hosptial for possible hospital acquired pneumonia based on CXR.
Her rash was felt to be related to a drug reaction and despite removing the most likely offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (zosyn) her respiratory status worsened and she was treated with IV steroids.
Her rash evolved in this setting and initial concern for dismemiated zoster was raised, this ultimately was not felt to be the cause of her skin or lung pathology.
As patient had worsening hypoxia and increase in interstitial process seen on interval Chest CTs despite antibacterial and antiviral therapy a bronchoscopy was preformed which did not show evidence of bacterial infection.
The patient was started again on IV steroids and a lung biopsy by VATS preformed for evaluation of her lung process.
Pathology demonstrated both a chronic cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as well as a more acute process with evidence of alveolar hemorrhage.
The patient improved with steroids after a total of three trips to the ICU for respiratory distress.
# AGEP:  The patient presented from an outside hospital after developing a diffuse errythematous, puritic and pustulitic drug rash over her limbs, trunk and face.
The rash worsened over the next several days despite conservative managment developing diffuse pustules initially concerning for diseminated zoster.
IgG was positive and IgM for viracella was positive as well, patient recieved a 7 day course of acyclovir while her pulmonary process was evaluated out of convern for a zoster pneumonitis.
A skin biopsy was preformed which showed acute generalized errythematous pustulosis, a rare neutrophil mediated drug reaction.
# Acute on Chronic Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia:  prior to discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] in mid [**2103-11-8**] the patient developed respiratory distress and found to have a presumed multifocal pneumonia and was treated with vanc/zosyn for likely healthcare associated pneumonia.
She also reports an indolent history of SOB and DOE prior to her [**Month (only) 1096**] admission.
Upon presentation to the OSH as CXR showed multifocal pneumonia for which she recieved vanc/zosyn, on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] this was changed to Vanc/meropenem out of concern for drug rash.
As her skin improved her respiratory status worsened despite antibiotics, Chest CT was preformed which showed diffuse ground glass opacities concerning for pneumoina.
Prior to this procedure, which was preformed in the ICU, the patient developed stridor and was started on solumedrol.
ENT evaluated the patient and did not find evidence of layrngeal inflammation.
As her interval chest imgaging continued to show worsening of her inflammatory process with steroids a VATS procedure for biopsy was preformed.
Pathology demonstrated both a chronic cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as well as a more acute process with evidence of alveolar hemorrhage.
The decision was made to continue steroids as infectious processes for her lung pathology were excluded by multiple cultures and serologies.
She improved dramatically with this treatment and was no longer hypoxic.
# Elevated LFTs:  The patient was noted to have elevated AST and ALT as well as T bili from the time of discharge 2 weeks prior.
This was initially felt to be possibly related to a DRESS phenomenon, though ultimately acute illness was the likely cause.
Abdominal Ultrasound did not show acute liver process.
Her LFTs continued to fluctate over the course of her stay, but she did not have signs of hepatic compromise.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  patient had rise in her creatinine to 1.8 over the course of her stay, renal ultrasound was normal and patient responded to albumin challenge.
This was felt to be secondary to her alcoholic hepatitis and not an infectious process.
# Hypercarbic failure:  Post VATS procedure and extubation the patient was noted to be hypercarbic with a pH of 7.19.
This was felt to be secondary to poor clearance of her anastehtic agents due to hepatic insufficency and the patient was reintubated and sent to the ICU.
# Oral Candidiasis:  Patient was noted to have non-painful candidial placques on her mouth and tounge in the setting of high dose steroids.
# Leg Swelling:  felt to be secondary to hepatic chirrosis and vascular congestion, but patient was having improvement with diuresis with lasix.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient is a full code confirmed on this admission -Patient will need to undergo allergy testing 1-2 months after resolution of her acute illness as the specific [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has yet to be identified and carrying unconfirmed allergies to such broad spectrum antibiotics would severely limit future antibiotic regimens.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 5. hydrocortisone 2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal PRN (as needed) as needed for rectal irritation.
Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing/SOB.
3. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for itching.
You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of your rash, which was felt to be an allergic reaction to antibiotics.
You will need to have allergy testing in the next few months to determine which antibiotics are safe for you to take.
Your skin was biopsied and confirmed a drug reaction called acute generalized errythematous pustulosis or AGEP.
You recieved antibiotics at the outside hospital that may have contributed to the worsening of your rash and upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] these were changed and you continued to be treated for a bacterial pneumonia.
Despite antibiotics your breathing and oxygenation actually got worse and you were seen by our pulmonologists who felt that your rash and breathing could have been caused by a severe case of chicken pox, you were treated for this but ultimately this was not felt to be the cause of your sypmtoms.
A CT scan of your chest showed a large amount of inflammation in your lungs that despite steroids and antibiotics got worse on a repeat scan two days later.
As it was not clear to any of the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 40087**] for [**Name5 (PTitle) **] whether you had an infection or an allergic reaction in your lungs a lung biopsy was preformed.
You tolerated the procedure well, but were slow to wake up so you were sent to the ICU for monitoring overnight.
It appears that part of your lung was affected by a chronic condition called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia while other parts of your lung were affected by more acute inflammation.
You likely developed the chronic condition prior to your hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 1096**] and during this most reccent hospitalization had acute inflammation from a viral infection.
Your liver enzymes were also noticed to be elevated which was felt to be from an acute stress on your liver from your acute illness.
Continuing to drink will have severe consequences to your health and may very well kill you.
You have a fungal infeciton in your mouth from these steroids that you will treat with a medication called fluconazole for the next 7 days.
