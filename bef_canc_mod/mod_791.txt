Admission Date:  [**2140-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-9-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from MICU, initially admitted for hypertensive emergency  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 year old female with h/o SLE, lupus nephritis and ESRD on HD, and poorly controlled HTN on multiple medications presenting on [**8-25**] with unresponsiveness, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and nausea/vomiting.
She was taken to the EW, where she had BP 260s/200s, had a non-contrast head CT showing left frontal ICH, right parieto-occipital ICH, and edema throughout bilaterally thought to be c/w PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) with superimposed ICH, and had a MRI/MRV to exclude venous thrombosis showing ICH in the parieto-occipital lobes bilaterally and pons without venous sinus thrombosis.
She had a tonic-clonic seizure in the ED terminated with 2 mg IV lorazepam.
She was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
She was intubated to have an MRI of the head, as there was concern for sinus venous thrombosis.
MRI was negative for thrombosis.
Hematology was also consulted as the patient had thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.
They did not think she had TTP and thought it was more likely [**Last Name (un) 1724**] from hypertensive emergency.
TTE was done and negative for vegetation.
She denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: # Lupus - Diagnosed [**2134**] (16 years old) - Diagnosed when she had swollen fingers, arm rash and arthralgias - Previous treatment with cytoxan, cellcept; currently on prednisone # CKD/ESRD secondary to SLE - [**2135**] # HTN - [**2137**] - baseline BPs 180's/120's - previous history of hypertensive crisis with seizures # Uveitis secondary to SLE - [**4-15**] - s/p left eye enucleation [**2139-4-20**] for fungal infection # Thrombocytopenia - previous thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia (TTP vs malignant HTN were considered on DDx) # HOCM - per Echo in [**2137**] # Anemia # Vaginal bleeding [**2139**] lasting 2 months s/p DepoProvera injection requiring transfusion # History of Coag negative Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-15**] and [**5-16**] # Previous history of SVC and UE clot, previously maintained on coumadin - SVC venogram performed [**2139**] s/p coumadin therapy revals patent SVY and subclavian - ?APLS but never has had positive anti-phospholipid antibody  Social History: SH: Lives in [**Location 669**] with mother, who works at [**Hospital1 18**], and her 16 year old brother.
She was able to graduated from high school but unable to work since then secondary to her illness.
No clotting disorders in family.
No history of autoimmune disease.
+III/VI early systolic murmur throughout precordium, loudest at LLSB.
NABS Ext: No C/C/E .
+III/VI early systolic murmur throughout precordium, loudest at LLSB.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Multifocal areas of cortical T2 signal hyperintensity, some with foci of recent hemorrhage.
The appearance may represent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
Hemorrhage and pontine involvement in this disorder is somewhat unusual, but has been described in the literature.
No definite evidence of major venous sinus thrombosis.
Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhages peripherally in the right parietoccipital and left frontal lobes, with surrounding edema and local mass effect.
Vasogenic and interstitial edema in a strikingly symmetric and posterior distribution involving both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter of the occipital lobes and frontalparietal regions, bilaterally.
COMMENT: These findings are highly suggestive of PRES (hypertensive encephalopathy), with development of superimposed hypertensive hemorrhages.
However, given the history of SLE, suspicion of underlying "lupus anticoagulant" and non-arterial distribution of edema and hemorrhage, cerebral venous (including dural venous sinus) thrombosis should be excluded, and urgent MRI with MRV has been recommended, below.
Right maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.
Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities, most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-30**] lateral ST-T wave abnormalities have improved.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-8-25**] no significant diagnostic change.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-5-20**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 yo female with a h/o SLE with secondary lupus nephritis, uveitis s/p left eye enucleation, question of APLS and poorly controlled HTN who presented on [**8-25**] with N/V, lethargy, fatigue and headaches, found to have hypertensive emergency,who subsequently seized.
CT head showed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
# Hypertensive Emergency with ICH: Patient initially presented with significantly elevated blood pressures resulting in end organ damage causing seizure and intracranial hemorrhage.
Her intracranial bleed appears to be most consistent with PRES, though septic emboli are on the differential.
# Bacteremia: She had high grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles on [**8-25**] growing oxacillan resistant coagulase negative staph.
A TTE was negative for vegetation.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient has had previous episodes of clinical illness with acute drop in platelets with question of consumptive coagulopathy from thrombosis vs. secondary to malignant hypertension.
Evaluated by heme who did not think thrombocytopenia was consistent with TTP, but more likely to be due to malignant hypertension.
There had been concern in the past for anti-phospholipid syndrome but her APA testing has been negative.
# CKD stage V - Patient most recently had not been to HD for 3 weeks because she did not like the way it made her feel.
HD catheter was pulled during this admission due to high grade bacteremia.
Anemia - Thought to be chronic and likely related to her CKD.
There was concern for hemolytic anemia during this admission, likely caused by malignant hypertension.
