Initial CXR demonstrated new bilateral nodular opacities, old R pleural effusion, and R 5th rib fracture.
demonstrated interval resolution of this opacification.
Squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right upper lobe lobectomy;  On last hospitalization ([**1-4**]) CT and MRI demonstrated a right skull-base lesion worrisome for metastatic bone dx, but f/u bone scan did not reveal evidence of metastatic dx.

Likely etiologies include obstruction (mucus plugging, CA), effusion, infection, or pulmonary edema (flash edema).
Given the acute onset and resolution of his opacity by CXR and acute reversal of CO2 by ABG, an obstructive process, ie mucus plug, was most likely.
He was started on Solumedrol 80mg IV TID for potential COPD flare.
He remained on ventilatory support secondary to respiratory distress until health care proxy could be contact[**Name (NI) **] in regard to his desired level of care.
Family and PCP were notified of the patients status, and the family expressed their wish for his status to be DNR/DNI, with no aggressive measures.
He was extubated on [**2133-7-16**] and died secondary to respiratory failure the morning of [**2133-7-16**].
