[**Year (4 digits) **] cultures showed four out of four bottles positive for staphylococcus aureus.
Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, primary AV block, QRS 124 milliseconds with left bundle branch pattern, ST elevated in V2 through V3, T waves decreased in II, III and AVF, ST depression in V5 and V6.
These are all seen in his prior electrocardiogram, however, inferior T wave depressions are slightly more pronounced.
Chest x-ray:  Clear lung fields, no congestive heart failure, no infiltrate.
Head CT:  Encephalomalacia in right frontoparietal region, age indeterminate, no acute intracranial hemorrhages.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 36-year-old male with Type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, question of coronary artery disease, neuropathy, hypertension, hepatitis C, who presents with a one day history of nausea and vomiting and mental status changes, admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Evaluation for causes of the diabetic ketoacidosis revealed staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, likely from his hemodialysis central line.
He was also noted to have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction (electrocardiogram changes, troponin-I elevation to 5, without changes in ejection fraction on echocardiogram), which was evaluated and followed by Cardiology.
After treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was transferred to the Medicine service on [**8-20**].
He did experience some episodes of hypoglycemia, which were treated with juice or D-5-W while he was nothing by mouth.
Infectious Disease:  Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with likely source to be his hemodialysis central line.
Upper extremity Dopplers were obtained in order for Transplant Surgery to assess for possibilities for access in the future.
Cardiology:  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Neurology:  There were no focal neurological deficits.
Mental status changes were attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis and infection.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any embolic sources, which was negative.
Diabetic ketoacidosis 3.
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction 4.
