Admission Date:  [**2179-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 84 yo M w/ h/o COPD on 2L home oxygen, cor pulmonale with severe R sided diastolic dysfunction, dementia, and R sided weakness s/p CVA who presents after recent admission for syncope with altered mental status.
Was admitted from rehab recently on two occasions- from [**3-18**] to [**3-20**] for syncope in setting of pseudomonal UTI and from [**2-22**] to [**2-25**] w/ hypotension and bradycardia admitted to the ICU, ultimately diagnosed with syncope of unclear etiology.
He was most recently discharged w/ a dx of vasovagal syncope with a increase in his bowel regimen, decrease in his metoprolol and plan for a two week course of ciprofloxacin for his pan-sensitive pseudomonal UTI (he has h/o recurrent UTIs including pseudomonal, proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp), enterococcus (R to tetracycline), and klebsiella).
His family reports that he left the hospital in excellent shape but has gradually deteriorated with weakness, lethargy and poor PO intake.
He was BIBA from the [**Hospital1 1501**] due to his altered state and due to hypoxia- to the 80s on 2L, only improving the low 90s on non-rebreather.
CXR was notable for mild pulmonary edema, but no infiltrate.
He denies any pain, difficulty breathing, or palpitations.
(+) Per HPI; also w/ cough productive of dark colored sputum.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies shortness of breath or wheezing.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

Derm: L arm and R shoulder burn scars noted.
Pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or definite CT evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Small vessel ischemic disease and age-related involution.
Multiple bilateral up to 11-cm cysts, some of which with mural calcifications and septation.
Collapsed thick-walled urinary bladder with internal debris.
[**2179-3-29**] CXR: The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered.
There is prominence of the perihilar vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema on the current study.
Calcified diaphragmatic plaques are seen suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M w/ h/o COPD on 2L O2, cor pulmonale w/ severe RV diastolic dysfunction, OSA, R hemiparesis s/p CVA, and dementia who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] w/ altered mental status in setting of hypoxia and hypernatremia.
# Acute toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: Patient noted to have increased lethargy and twitching in rehab in setting of poor PO intake.
Altered mental status was likely secondary to hypernatremia (see below) and hypoxia.
There were no signs/symptoms of recurrent infection.
Given a dirty UA and h/o recurrent UTIs he was initially treated broadly (vanc/cefepime), but was narrowed back to cipro when urine culture was negative.
CT head was negative for acute process.
With improvement in hypernatremia and hypoxia (patient back on baseline oxygen requirement), mental status significantly improved.
# Hypernatremia: Likely occured in setting of poor access to free water and poor thirst mechanism in an elderly, demented patient.
Using current dry wt (104kg), initial free water deficit was appx 6.3 L. He was volume resuscitated w/ NS, then corrected gradually w/ D5 1/2 NS to a Na of 138 at transfer to floor (HD4).
Unclear etiology: volume overload appeared improved on CXR w/o obvious infiltrates.
Was possibly due to mucous plugging given h/o thick secretions vs. aspiration in setting of altered MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11419**] in MICU patient was transitioned from CPAP to non-rebreather with good tolerance.
# Urinary tract infection: Pt w/ h/o recurrent UTIs including pseudomonal, proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp), enterococcus (R to tetracycline), and klebsiella.
# Acute renal failure: Patient w/ baseline creatinine around 2.0 during last hospitalization, w/ elevation to 3.9 on admission.
Likely secondary to h/o poor po intake in setting of altered mental status, lack of access to free water, and continued use of diuretics and lisinopril.
Renal ultrasound was done which showed multiple bilateral up to 11-cm cysts, collapsed thick-walled urinary bladder with internal debris, but no hydronephrosis.
No signs of infection (see above) and was maintained on broad spectrum abx.
No further hypotension was observed after HD4.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets below baseline (was in 200s last month and trended down during hospitalization (as low as 73 during this admission).
Given recent exposure to heparin during last admission there was concern for HIT.
Also considered possibility of dilutional effect leading to thombocytopenia.
He had no sign of thrombosis, and thus systemic anticoagulation was not given.
# Diastolic CHF: Has h/o severe RVD [**3-11**] cor pulmonale w/ intact EF of 50-55% on recent echo on [**3-18**].
Torsemide will be restarted at 20mg daily, though patient will require ongoing assessment of his volume status at his facility, and may need increase in torsemide back to prior 40mg daily dose if weight increases or he develops signs/symptoms of worsening heart failure.
# CAD/Troponin leak: No ischemic changes on EKG and no h/o chest pain, though patient does have strong h/o CAD.
Likely some demand related leak and persistent levels in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient was FULL CODE this admission, though per his wife they will likely continue discussion in outpatient setting about possible transition to hospice care -Patient should have repeat chem7 checked [**2179-4-3**] to ensure renal function remains stable at baseline and to assess electrolytes in setting of restarting torsemide -Patient will need ongoing monitoring of weight and daily fluid balance, and may need increase in torsemide dose to 40 mg daily if weight increasing.
-Patient noted to have multiple bilateral (up tp 11cm) renal cysts on renal ultrasound.
-Imaging also revealed evidence of diaphragmatic/pleural plaques, suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
