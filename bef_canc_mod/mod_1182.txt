VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
There is a new right subclavian central venous catheter with tip overlying the expected region of the cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax is detected.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches, without focal dilatation or aneurysm.
However, please note that the patient's known saccular descending thoracic aortic arch aneurysm is not evaluated on this study.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Thrombus in the distal cephalic vein adherent to the indwelling venous catheter consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis.
No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
No dissection or PE is identified.
There is a stable small saccular aneurysm along the inferior aspect of the descending aortic arch.
New small regions of subpleural ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right, new compared to the previous examination.
Interval increase in size and extent of predominantly right-sided ground- glass opacities.
The differential diagnosis would include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as well as atypical infections including atypical mycobacterial infection.
Brief Hospital Course: # Sepsis - Upon admission, the patient had a picture concerning for sepsis given fever, leukocytosis, bandemia & diarrhea.
CT of abd/pelvis without pathology, and degree of described diarrhea seemed inconsistent with her degree of hypotension.
Differential diagnosis also included hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea, ACS with + trop (though more likely [**2-18**] demand ischemia,) and adrenal insufficiency likely contributing to profound hypotension on admission given marginal cortisol stim test on day of admission.
Stool cultures were negative and her diarrhea decreased in frequency and amount.
On [**4-8**], the patient became hypotensive with SBP in the 70s and fevers/rigors.
CT revealed small ground glass opacities in the RUL concerning for a possible pneumonia.
She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and azithromycin for broad coverage however no source of infection was found.
Discontinued linezolid on [**4-10**] as no evidence for staph bacteremia.
She developed a drug rash and meropenem was continued.
She completed a 7 day course of azithromycin for empiric pneumonia coverage.
# Syncopal episode - On [**4-7**] the patient had a syncopal episode in the setting of rising from seated position.
This was felt most consistent with vasovagal syncope.
No events on telemetry.
This was in the setting of adrenal insufficiency and she had been rapidly tapered from stress dose steroids after being transferred out of the MICU.
# N/V/Diarrhea- The patient has no recent antibiotic use.
Differential diagnosis includes bacterial vs viral infection vs GVHD.
CT abd/pelvis without evidence of colitis or SBO.
Currently tolerating regular diet but continued to have loose stools.
# ARF ??????
The patient presented with creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 0.9-1.1) & non gap acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea, bicarbonate loss & NS resuscitation.
Creatinine trended down to baseline with IVF and hyperchloremic acidosis resolved.
# ONC - The patient is with a history or erythroleukemia evolving from MDS '[**80**], s/p allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling donor on [**2191-4-14**], complicated by mild GVHD diagnosis [**1-24**] and started on prednisone.
# Cardiac - On admission, the patient denied chest pain or shortness of breath.
In the setting of hypotension and tachycardia on admission, she had anterior ST segment depressions.
With fluid resuscitation and resolution of tachycardia, the ischemic changes on her EKG resolved.
Thus they were felt to be demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis.
Patient essentially failed physiologic stress test, and should have out patient cardiac follow up with exercise stress test.
Echo was unchanged, with preserved systolic function.
In addition to the EKG changes noted above, her rhythm was sinus bradycardia & new prolonged QT on admission.
On [**4-7**] the patient had a syncopal episode as above.
No symptoms of chest pain, no ECG changes.
# Drug rash - The patient developed 2 drug rashes during her admission, felt most likely to be due to a reaction to ceftriaxone and meropenem.
She had elevated peripheral eosinophils which supports this.
# GERD - She was continued on her outpatient regimen of protonix.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Her diabetes is diet-controlled at home.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Diarrhea .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and diarrhea.
The cause of the diarrhea was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] were treated with antibiotics in case there was an infectious cause, but no source of infection was found.
On the regular medical floor, you had an episode where you passed out due to low blood pressure.
The next day you had a fever with low blood pressure.
Again there was concern for an infection and you responded well to antibiotics, but no source of infection was found.
You were found to have an allergy to 2 antibiotics-- meropenem and ceftriaxone.
Please be sure to alert all healthcare workers in the future that you are allergic to these medications.
If you develop fever > 101, chest pain, shortness of breath, or profuse diarrhea, please go to the nearest emergency room.
