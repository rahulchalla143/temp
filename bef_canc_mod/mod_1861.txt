Admission Date:  [**2179-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin / Depakote  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is an 82yo M wiith history of recurrent meningioma(resected twice, radiation,treated with steroids, ventriculoperitoneal shunt)DVT in [**2176**] who presented with shortness of breath.
Patient complained of shortness of breath since one day prior to admission.
He denies chest pain/nausea/palpitation.
He claims that he has no history of COPD/asthma.
OFnote, he had recent history of URI and was started on prednisone and levaquin.
Past Medical History: - Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels - hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - history of deep vein thrombosis - history of pneumonia - transitional cell meningioma, status post resection times two, blood pressure shunt - glaucoma - Adhesions of the abdominal cavity and obstructed abdominal end of ventriculoperitoneal shunt, now status post revision - steroid myopathy resulting right hemiparesis in the arms and proximal legs - dementia - cholecystectomy -h/o meningioma: since [**2173**].
There seemed to be no recurrent events after that.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] placed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus in [**2173-12-28**].
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T 97.3, BP 131/58, HR 80, RR31 97% on NRB gen: obese elderly male, on NRB, no resp distress heent: mucus membranes dry.
PERRLA JVP: unobtainable due to body habitus Lungs: diffuse expiratory wheezes.
NABS EXT: 1+ pitting edema b/l LE's.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
R waves in lead V1 which may represent right ventricular hypertrophy.
* Radiologic Studies: ------------------ [**4-9**] CXR: no evidence of CHF [**4-10**] CXR: There is no evidence of failure, pulmonary parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
[**4-11**] CTA: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse, faint ground glass opacity with nonspecific patchy opacities at the bases dependently, suggesting an element of fluid overload.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valveleaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with history of recurrent meningioma, DVT in [**2176**] who presented with shortness of breath, hypoxic respiratory distress   #hypoxic respiratory distress: Suspect secondary to CHF in setting of NSTEMI.
Initial CXR showed mild pulmonary edema his pro-BNP was elevated consistent with CHF.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and diffuse wheezes on exam, therefore CTA was performed to rule out PE as a cause of his symptoms.
CTA was negative for PE but did show evidence of CHF.
There was no noted infiltrate by CXR or chest CT, therefore antibiotics were not continued (he recieved one does of ceftriaxone/azithro in the ED).
He was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs for symptomatic relief, with some effect.
Mucomyst nebs were also tried, without much improvement.
#NSTEMI: Ruled in by enzymes with no acute ST changes.
Initial EKG showed initial ST depression in anterior leads which resolved and old slightly wide QRS.
He remained chest pain free and his troponin peaked at 1.2, CK max of 518.
After discussion with the patient and his wife, medical management was opted for, so no plan was made for diagnostic or therapeutic cath.
Echo obtained on [**4-12**] showed EF 55-60% with no wall motion abnormality.
Suspected pre-renal etiology secondary to intravascular volume depletion from CHF.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain or if there are any concerns at all  Please take all prescirbed medication.
