Past Medical History: rectal ca hypertension diabetes mellitis end stage renal disease on hemodialysis mitral regurg congestive heart failure tonic-clonic seizures Left retinal hemorrhage left temporla meningioma s/p cholecystectomy gallstone pancreatitis s/p resection of rectal ca   Social History: lives with spouse  Family History: non-contrib  Physical Exam: Vitals:104-110 to 170's-24-130/85   100%  Gen:patient clearly uncomfortable.
A&O HEENT: Chest:clear bilat CV:RRR Abd:soft, healthy appearing ostomy Ext:R arm +thrill, extremely tender & erythematous   Pertinent Results: [**2199-6-20**] 2:45 pm BLOOD CULTURE      L AC.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2190**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-2-6**], the severeity of mitral regurgitation has decreased (the blood pressure is also lower on the current study).
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-6-20**] after two day history of fevers/chills and chest pain suggestive of reflux.
He was taken to the OR for incomplete excision of R AV loop graft.
went into afib with SBP initially of 130s that dropped to 110s in the ER so the pt.
Pt underwent TEE [**2199-6-27**] that demonstrated no vegetations.
Outpatient dialysis arrangement were made with set up for vancomycin dosing at hemodialysis per level for positive blood cultures and graft on [**6-20**] for staph aureus coag positive for a total of 6 weeks.
Rectal screen for VRE and MRSA was negative.
Upon dischare the right forearm old graft site was slightly pink with sutures and no drainage.
