HISTORY: 25-year-old male patient with bilateral craniotomy, now with left- sided fluid collection.
TECHNIQUE: 5-mm axial images from the skull base to the vertex obtained without intravenous contrast administration.
Since the prior study, the left frontal lobe herniation has resolved.
This could be due to resolution of the herniation and mild expansion of this subgaleal collection.
The small extra-axial collection in the right side has remained stable.
There is no mass effect or shift of the midline structures.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There is stable appearance of the partially visualized multiple fractures involving the right maxillary sinus and nasal bones.
Stable appearing of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe and in the right frontal white matter.
Resolution of the herniation of the left frontal lobe with decreasing the edema along the left frontal lobe.
The extracranial (subgaleal)fluid collection on the left side appears somewhat larger than on the prior study but this could be due to the interval resolution of the herniation.
Pt will continue on vancomycin for 10days total - may d/c abx on [**2169-3-17**] after last dose.
