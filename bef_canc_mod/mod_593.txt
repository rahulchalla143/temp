Admission Date:  [**2140-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from OSH for worsening PNA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Pt is 56 yo m with progressive multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder with h/o multiple UTI's, h/o upper GIB, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2140-9-28**] with lethargy and generalized weakness noted by VNA.
He had been previously admitted to [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) 359**] and d/c'd on [**9-8**] (diagnosis not listed in d/c summary, although pt's wife reports 5 admissions in the past 2 months for "sepsis" or "GI bleeding").
On the most recent admission, he was noted to have a dirty UA and was treated for UTI.
Pt then had a CXR which showed RLL PNA, with subsequent CXR showing worsening R sided PNA, so he was changed to azithro and CTX.
Subsequent CXR's showed bibasilar pulm process.
Pt currently has no complaints, except being "thirsty".
Currently denies N/V, F/C, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia (although pt had black stools in the past prior to GIB diagnosis).
Family History: Father had CAD and CVA.
Pertinent Results: CXR (prelim): R sided peri-hilar fullness and RLL infiltrate, L sided infiltrate .
CXR ([**9-28**], OSH): New bihilar infiltrates and more patchy densities in the periphery of both lungs may represent asymmetric pulm edema vs bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
Much of the increased density has shifted from the lower to the upper lung field.
This may represent fluid in the pleural fissures rather than a parenchymal process.
The cardiac silhouette is ill-defined, though likely at least mildly enlarged.
Grossly, no left-sided pleural abnormality is seen.
**FINAL REPORT [**2140-10-7**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2140-10-7**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Pleural thickening at the apices is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of parenchymal opacities.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year old male with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with UTI and worsening multi-focal PNA likely [**12-24**] aspiration.
The results are as  follws: "Mr [**Known lastname 25925**] presents overall with a functional oral and pharyngeal swallow mechanism.
However, no aspiration occurred during the exam, and strategies were effective at eliminating spill over of liquids prematurely to the pharynx.
An ECHO done at that time to assess for CHF revealed a normal LVEF but positive for diastolic dysfunction.
He was treated both for pneumonia and CHF (lasix) with decrease in O2 requirement.
Neurology was consulted to evaluate if the dyspnea and hypoxia could be due to exacerbation of MS They did not think that this was an exacerbation of MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 25926**], no IV steroids were given.
His recent recovery from CHF and pneumonia may offset the results of PFT at this time.
ECHO here - normal LV EF with some evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Repeat chest xray showed marked improvement.
#) h/o GIB: pt reportedly has erosive esophagitis and gastritis.
Hematocrit remained at baseline with no acute bleeding.
PT cleared him for discharge.
