Admission Date:  [**2157-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - bronchoscopy - rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old female presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
Ms [**Known lastname 13143**] has a history of stage I lung cancer which was wedge resected in [**2153**].
Just prior to this diagnosis, she also was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism for which she was anticoagulated.
Between [**2153**] and [**2157**], she has had continued respiratory events which are described in detail below and lead to her current hospitalization.
She also has a diagnosis of COPD with a 20 pack year smoking history (she quit many years ago).
Over the past four years, she has been dealing with intermittent periods of shortness of breath.
This has been worked up by various physicians who have referred her complaints to multiple diagnoses, including COPD, asthma, and most recently, tracheobronchomalacia.
In early [**Month (only) 547**], given advancing symptoms, her stent was removed and significant laryngeal edema was identified.
Now, since stopping the steroids, she has developed increasing wheezing over the past 24 hours.
A chest x-ray was obtained which reveals surgical scarring on the left secondary to her wedge resection, but no other acute process.

Her heart is regular rhythm with a slightly tachycardic rate.
Pulmonary exam is surprisingly free of wheeze or rales.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.

Anterior lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal fixation hardware is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
No tracheal narrowing or evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
Mucosal irregularity posterior tracheal wall could be inflammation or artifact from recently removed tracheal stent.
Right airways appeared normal to the segmental level, left airways were noted for a surgically absent left upper lobe.
Dynamic airway maneuvers were then performed, with the following findings: proximal trachea - moderate collapse; mid-trachea - severe collapse; distal trachea - mild collapse; RMS - moderate collapse; [**Hospital1 **] - mild to moderate collapse; LMS - mild collapse.
Impression: 63yo F with chronic cough and paroxysms of wheezing, diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia with failed tracheal stent at an outside hospital admitted for wheezing.
Flexible bronchoscopy with dynamic airway maneuvers was performed today.
Severe tracheomalacia at the level of the proximal and mid-trachea.
This was complicated by LMS partial mucosa tear non communicating with the mediastinum by bronchoscopic direct visualization asssessment.
No other complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 63yoF with h/o stage I lung cancer sp wedge resected in [**2153**], PE [**2151**] asthma/COPD, possible trachobronchomalacia, who p/w SOB, hypoxia, and wheeze.
In this admission we diagnosed severe tracheomalacia, and mild asthma, as well as significant anxiety, as the primary contributors to her symptoms.
# Dyspnea - When she first presented, she was wheezing and in respiratory distress, and went to the MICU.
CT trachea showed no evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
She had 1-2 episodes of wheezing, tachypnea with facial flushing.
She would de-sat to low 90s during these episodes but did not have major episodes of hypoxia.
ENT evaluated pt with laryngoscopy and did not feel that this was consistent with vocal cord dysfunction.
She underwent bronchoscopy that showed severe upper tracheomalacia.
Because of her difficulty w/ managing secretions, she was sent to pulmonary rehab.
# Asthma: she had PFT's (prior to stent placement), that were suggestive of mild asthma.
# Depression/anxiety: we thought anxiety contributed to her SOB and attacks, though certainly does not explain them entirely.
We held this the entirety of her admission, and did not get volume overloaded.
# Hypertension - held metoprolol to see if that made any difference w/ SOB, but it did not so we restarted it .
# Hyperlipidemia - continued simvastatin .
# s/p stage I lung cancer - resected .
# history of pulmonary embolus - several years ago, likely in setting of underlying malignancy, now resected, off anticoagulation .
# GERD - continued omeprazole .
===================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Will f/u with IP in ~1 week for further management of her severe tracheomalacia # At discharge, she should be set up to have home suction and yankaur device at home # She will need Q6H hypertonic saline.
