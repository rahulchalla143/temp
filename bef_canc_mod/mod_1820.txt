There is no other documentation of the details prior to being [**Last Name (un) 4662**] tot he ED and the patient is nonverbal and responds only by nodding or shaking head.
She was noted to have mucus plugging of her trach and was suctioning with improvement of her respiratory status and satting 100% on 15L trach mask.
However in the ED she was noted to have a rigid abdomen and dilated bowel on initial CXR.
A KUB again demonstrated dilated loops of bowel with multiple air fluid levels very suggestive of sigmoid volvulus.
She was given vanc and zosyn for possible evolving sepsis and was admitted to the MICU.
She complains of moderate abd pain as well as SOB.
Of note the patient was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 100915**] for multifocal PNA treated with vancomycin, zosyn for 10 day course.

There are bibasilar opacities, which likely represents atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No large pleural effusion identified.
Please see dedicated abdominal films for better characterization of the abdominal findings.
This is causing bibasilar atelectasis, however, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be ruled out given the basilar opacities.
No free air identified.
There is no definite air-fluid level seen.
There is consolidation or atelectasis seen in the right lower lobe.
No free air is identified.
IMPRESSION: Dilated large bowel in a configuration that may represent a sigmoid volvulus, see subsequent CT. .
Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or pneumonia/aspiration.
Nonobstructing stone in the left renal pelvis.
KUB [**2177-4-29**] 5:52 pm FINDINGS: Two supine frontal views of the abdomen demonstrate increased lucency in the right abdomen and [**Last Name (un) 100916**] sign consistent with a large amount of intraperitoneal free air.
Massive dilatation of the large bowel is not improved from the preceding radiograph, consistent with sigmoid volvulus, better seen on CT performed at 13:50 p.m.
Large amount of free intraperitoneal air consistent with perforated viscus.
Persistent massive dilatation of large bowel consistent with sigmoid volvulus, unchanged from preceding radiographs and CT. .
CXR [**2177-4-29**] 9pm FINDINGS: Large free pneumoperitoneum is present causing elevation of bilateral hemidiaphragms.
[**Hospital1 **]-basal atelectasis is present and upper lungs are clear.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F AFib, COPD, h/o SBO, HTN, breast and thyroid CA, s/p tracheostomy several years ago after breast cancer surgery and hysterectomy presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with respiratory distress found to have sigmoid volvulus.
#Signoid Volvulus: She presented with shortness of breath from sigmoid volvulus with massive distension causing lung compression.
They expressed understanding that her condition was very serious and that not undergoing surgery would expose her to the risk of death.
However, she became hypotensive and tachycardic later that evening and KUB showed free air in the peritoneum.
A repeat CXR showed massive free air in the peritoneum from a ruptured viscous.
