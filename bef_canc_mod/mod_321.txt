HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year-old female who was initially found lethargic in front of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building and was briefly evaluated at [**Hospital 191**] clinic and gave a history of three days of fevers up 104 and significant cough.
She also complained of some light headedness and weakness.
Vascular surgery was then called because of patient's respiratory difficulty and internal carotid catheterization she was intubated.
After her intubation she had low systolic blood pressures and was placed on Levophed for blood pressure support.
5) Possible history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, no documented pulmonary function tests.
Notable hematoma of the neck on the right.
Extremities had no peripheral edema.
Initial chest x-ray read as extensive pneumonia in the right lower lobe and probably right upper lobe as well.
Sepsis:  Patient appeared to have sepsis secondary to significant pneumonia.
She had had one positive blood culture showing strep pneumoniae as well as a sputum culture growing strep pneumonia as well.
Pulmonary:  Patient was initially intubated to facilitate line removal as well as because of some moderate respiratory distress.
However, she had some difficulty weaning off the ventilator, some difficulty with oxygenation and experienced some auto PEEP and elevated pips.
It was felt that given her past medical history she may have an element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with reactive airway disease and was given intravenous steroids with standing nebs with much improvement in her arterial blood gases and ventilation.
Acidosis:  By her initial arterial blood gases she has significant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology.
She did not relay a history of diarrhea prior to intubation and she did no9t have evidence of renal failure.
She was initially overventilated to help compensate for this acidosis and her acidosis slowly resolved over several day.
Her aspirin was restarted given her history of coronary artery disease and she had a transthoracic echocardiogram done that was difficult to read but appeared to have normal ejection fraction.
