Overall growth and progressive gaseous contents of a large right infrahilar phlegmon, probably an abscess, and larger air and fluid loculations in the dependent right pleural space, are indirect but strong indications of active connections between the lungs or airway and the pleurae, even though a discrete connection from the lower lobe bronchial stump is not visible.
The findings of peripheral alveolitis in the left lung conform to 'spillover' pneumonitis seen in such circumstances.
Right middle lobe bronchus is still obliterated.
Severe coronary artery calcification and possible aortic valvular stenosis.
Requested laboratory analysis pending .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2117-4-14**] Fluoro for HD catheter: Successful placement of a tunneled hemodialysis access catheter through the left internal jugular vein approach.
Otherwise, there is no relevant change.
Unchanged mild fluid overload.
Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
Focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.
Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusions associated with adjacent lung atelectasis and bilateral pulmonary vascular congestions is unchanged.
No new interval changes in the lung.
[**2117-4-19**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No right or left lower extremity DVT.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2117-3-29**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2117-3-27**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2117-3-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2117-4-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
His chest CT showed a large collection of fluid and air in the right pleural space along with pneumonitis and his WBC was 21K.
On [**2117-3-26**] he underwent a bronchoscopy to R/O bronchopleural fistula.
There was no visualization of a BPF but the stump was poorly visualized.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2117-3-29**] and underwent  a Bronchoscopy, and right thoracotomy, right middle lobectomy with intercostal muscle flap buttress and decortication for a bronchopleural fistula and empyema.
His post op course was complicated by prolonged intubation and acute kidney injury requiring CVVH on [**2117-4-2**] with a high creatinine of 6.4 and eventually hemodialysis.
The Speech and Swallow service assessed him on multiple occasions and felt that he was a high aspiration risk due to his occasional lethargy.
The patient continues on hemodialysis for improvement of the acute kidney injury he sustained as above.
The patient will receive 6 days of ciprofloxacin to cover a possible urinary tract infection, although to date, urine culture remains NGTD, the patient is afebrile, and white count continues downtrending.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 91948**], You were admitted to the hospital with fevers, shortness of breath, and lethargy due to an infection in your lung.
You were very sick, and unfortunately suffered an acute kidney injury for which you are still receiving hemodialysis.
* You have improved daily, and are now breathing on your own without difficulty or assistance.
