Initially received 3L NS, levofloxacin for presumed UTI with positive UA, though cultures from the outside hospital were not performed.
In MICU, the patient was normotensive, continued on Levofloxacin, diuresed for increasing crackles on exam and being 5 liters positive.
He was then called out to the floor without fever, stable hemodynamics, and with a decreasing white count.

)UTI with sepsis -- Initially quite ill appearing, with fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea, Mr. [**Known lastname 99933**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99934**]d well to fluids, was transiently on pressors, and levofloxacin.
Within a day, the patient was off pressors, required no more fluid support, and demonstrated a dramatic decline in his WBC.
Unfortunately, the patient did not have any cultures grow out despite grossly positive urinalyses, yet the brisk clinical response certainly points to a sensitive organism.
)CHF -- The patient has a known EF of 45% and became volume overloaded in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation, a necessary component of the treatment for sepsis.
He then was diuresed while in the MICU, and by the time he was called out to the floor, had an improved chest x-ray and was satting well, with a lung exam that, though limited by poor inspiratory effort, demonstrated decreasing rales.
He was restarted on his metoprolol and lisinopril, without requirement for daily diuretics.
)Coronary artery disease -- The patient's disease remained quiescent throughout his hospital stay, with no evidence of ischemia.
)Sinus tachycardia -- On the floor, the patient again became tachycardic, without fever, hypotension, or hypoxia.
Previous iron studies demonstrated an anemia of chronic disease, with a normal B12.
