Pertinent Results: Chest Xray [**2114-9-15**] No acute pulmonary process .
LLE LENI [**2114-9-15**] No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
CTA Chest [**2114-9-15**] No central or segmental pe.
distal branches obscured due to breathing.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2114-5-1**] demonstrated: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The ST segments are uninterpretable in the setting of RBBB with diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities at baseline.
The rhythm was sinus with frequent AEA (isolated APDs) and frequent VEA (isolated multifocal VPDs, ventricular couplets and ventricular bigeminy).
Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 74 y/o M with history of a fib, cardiomyopathy, HTN, gerd, DVT (on lovenox), p/w SOB, LE edema and in Afib with RVR.
AFib RVR: Patient has been noncompliant with his medications for the last few days, secondary to "not feeling well."
Start wean - Load with PO dilt, 60 QID - Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (on 200mg toprol as outpatient) - monitor vital signs, consider cardioversion for instability -> Pt admitted to CCU.
Lovenox continued at therapeutic doses for anticoagulation for DVT and A. Fib.
CHF, diastolic acute on chronic: patient with significant LE edema, has not taken diuretics for last 2 days, bibasilar crackles, SOB, O2 requirement - back on home dyazide - 10mg Lasix IV - goal out 1L today -> Patient diuresed well with net ouf 750cc day 1 and net out on day of discharge.
Given 10meq PO Potassium as mildly hypokalemic during hospital stay.
Dyspnea: likely secondary to a fib and CHF exacerbation.
no wheezes - treat a fib with rate control - diurese -> Improved and 93% on RA on day of discharge.
-> CTA of chest showed no significant PE but ?
LE USD negative for DVT with compression of popliteal vein (also limited study).
CT Scan of chest demonstrated lymphadenopathy noted on prior scans and stable RUL nodule.
5. depression - stable - continue paxil .
Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure.
Dilated cardiomyoapthy 3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 4.
Hypertension 5.
Depression 6.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of shortness of breath, and lower extremity swelling.
These symptoms are likely related to your heart failure and having missed doses of your medications.
Should you develop any new shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling please call your primary physician or present to the Emergency Room.
If you develop any sudden severe chest pain or other symptoms concerning to you please call your PCP or return to the ED.
Repeat CT scan in [**5-8**] months for interval change in lung nodules.
Discuss with your PCP regarding PET scan or CT scan for lymphadenopathy in lung nodules.
