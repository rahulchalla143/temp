Admission Date:  [**2141-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-3-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**] Chief Complaint: chest pain & shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stents x2 to ostial and mid RCA.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with a complicated history including CAD s/p CABG in [**2130**], PVD, systolic CHF (EF 45-50% in [**11-15**]) w/ diastolic dysfunction, severe COPD, severe AS (0.8cm2) & AI who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for respiratory failure.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been hospitalized multiple times in the last several months for respiratory failure and has been intubated 3 times over the past 3 months most recently in early [**Month (only) 404**] at [**Hospital1 34**].
[**First Name (STitle) 216**] on [**2141-12-13**] for persistent upper respiratory symptoms and placed on a Z-pack.
His symptoms improved, but the patient's wife called the patient's PCP 3 days prior to this admission stating that the patient had developed worsening cough productive of thick yellow-green sputum and worsening shortness of breath on his home 2L O2, as well as chest tightness that resolved after SL NTG x 2.
At that time, his wife reported that he had no chest pain, nausea, sweating, [**Date Range **], chills, vomiting or dizziness and he was directed to [**Hospital6 33**] for further evaluation.
For unclear reasons, he did not seek care until the day prior to admission when his breathing and chest pain symptoms worsened.
He was initially treated for presumed systolic CHF exacerbation and COPD with CPAP, IV Solumedrol, nebulizers, Lasix, and Nitrates.
He was also given a dose of IV Levaquin out of concern for infection but his respiratory rate declined and his ABG's demonstrated severe respiratory acidosis so he was intubated in the [**Hospital3 **] ED.
In the ICU, EKG's demonstrated sinus tachycardia with left anterior fascicular block and ST depressions in II, V3, V4.
He was able to speak with the health care team, but demonstrated a visible left hand tremor and was relative immobile.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Severe, but noncritical aortic stenosis.
CT Abd/pelvis Noncon [**12-31**] CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion.
A focal hypodensity anteriorly is unchanged and likely represents focal fatty infiltration.
A small gallstone is present in a decompressed gallbladder.
There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney.
The stomach and duodenum are distended with fluid and small amount of ingested material.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification, but is normal in caliber.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Large bowel demonstrates residual oral contrast material, possibly from the CT of [**2141-12-13**] or from an outside hospital study.
Both small and large bowel extends into a large, wide-based ventral hernia.
A transition in small bowel caliber is noted just adjacent to the ventral hernia, with a small segment of fecalization of contents of the dilated small bowel, measuring up to 4 cm.
There is no extraluminal fluid or air.
The sigmoid colon demonstrates scattered diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid layering dependently in the pelvis.

The patient has undergone prior low anterior resection and surgical material is present at the rectosigmoid junction.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are present throughout the lower spine, with no interval change.
There is no new fracture.
Obstruction may be early, as there is residual oral contrast and stool within the colon, which is minimally decompressed.
No evidence of perforation.
Obstruction occurs adjacent to the mouth of the large ventral hernia.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
No evidence of obstruction at the rectosigmoid anastomosis.
Atherosclerotic disease.
The radiograph demonstrates focal mild dilatation of small bowel loops in the epigastric region measuring 3.2 cm, consistent with the small bowel loops seen within the ventral hernia on the prior CT scan.
The relative lack of air in the distal small bowel suggests likely partial or early small bowel obstruction.
There is no intraperitoneal free air.
Findings suggestive of early/partial small bowel obstruction.
Labs at admission: 9>31.8<142 (WBC peaked at 15.3 on [**12-31**] in the context of steroids) N 90, L7.1, M2.2, E0.6, B0.2 PT 12, PTT 116, INR 1.0 (normalized at discharge) 137/3.8/99/30/25/1.3<171 (Cr peaked at 2.6 on [**12-31**] and was 1.2 at discharge) ALT 46, AST 45, LD 262, CK 124, Alk Phos 48, TB 0.4 (this was peak CK), other LFTS normalized before discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old man with a complicated history including CAD s/p CABG, PAD, systolic CHF (EF 45-50% in [**10-16**]) w/ diastolic dysfunction, severe COPD, severe AS (0.8cm2) & AI and a severe ventral hernia who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for respiratory failure.
He had intermittent abdominal pain that progressed to an SBO on [**12-31**].
Patient made progressively less urine and was transferred to MICU through [**1-1**].
# Small bowel obstruction Patient has history of severe ventral hernia s/p laparotomy for colon resection and intermittent abdominal pain, last on [**2141-12-13**].
On [**12-28**] he complained of abdominal pain that passed with ativan and simethicone.
On [**12-30**] he had constipation, [**12-31**] he had obstipation, bilious emesis and acute renal failure.
Surgery followed and his NGT drainage decreased and he started to have BMs on [**1-2**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 9907**] then had intermittent nausea without vomiting which resolved with Ranitidine.
He continue to have BMs and flatus.
Patient made very little urine and was therefore transfered to a MICU for management of fluid status given ARF and Aortic stenosis.
# Respiratory failure/ COPD Patient with known history of COPD, Asthma, and OSA as well as an extensive smoking history.
He is on 2L of continuous O2 as well as Albuterol, Advair, and Tiotropium at home and over the past 3 months has required multiple intubations for respiratory distress despite repeated courses of Prednisone & antibiotics, most recently approximately 2 weeks PTA.
Etiology likely obstructive lung disease with systolic CHF as patient did not demonstrate e/o infection.
# Systolic Heart Failure   Diasolic Heart Failure   Aortic Stenosis, Severe   Aortic Insufficiency Patient with known systolic heart failure, last EF in [**11-15**] demonstrated EF 45-50% with severe AS (mean gradient 47 mm Hg and area 0.8cm^2) and [**1-10**]+ AR.
CXR's from OSH have not demonstrated e/o congestion or effusions and clinical exam does not support fluid overload, but pBNP was elevated at 3969.
His last cardiac catheterization in [**2138**] demonstrated three vessel coronary disease with a patent LIMA, but occlusion of all vein grafts.
Patient with possible old inferior MI based on micro-Q waves in II, III, AvF, but EKG on admission does not demonstrate new ST changes.
He did not receive Plavix at OSH as he has a history of GI bleed and thrombocytopenia while on Plavix.
He was discharged with the addition of Plavix and high-dose statin with high-dose aspirin.
Given h/o AS, patient likely pre-load dependent.

#  H/o Colon cancer: s/p sigmoid colectomy w/ colorectal anastomosis '[**37**] and adjuvant Xeloda therapy with resulting post-surgical anterior wall abdominal hernia.
Patient uses belt for hernia control, but this has exacerbated SOB in the past, so it was not utilized during this hospitalization.
