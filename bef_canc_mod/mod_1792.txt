The patients R BKA appeared erythematous and was tender to palpation posteriorly and inferiorly.

Post ablation pt had repeated runs of NSVT and placed back on Lidocaine drip and PO amiodarone.
# Cardiomyopathy.
Over the course of his MICU course he was given IVF via his antibiotics and pt slowly became overloaded R>L as evident by CXR and increased 02 requirement up to 5L.
