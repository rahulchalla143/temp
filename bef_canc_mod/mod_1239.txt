Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo female resident of [**Hospital1 5595**] with CAD, HTN and recent admit for PNA and CHF exacerbation (admitted [**2163-9-27**]-discharged [**2163-9-29**]) presents with CP, abd pain and hypotension.
1: Hypoxia: We thought that her hypoxia might have been secondary to fluid overload/CHF or a pneumonia.
Hypotension: We thought that the patient's hypotension was secondary to volume depletion as demonstrated by its rapid response with IV fluids.
Chest pain: We were concerned that her chest pain might have been secondary to an acute coronary syndrome.
She was ruled out with negative serial cardiac enzymes and the absence or ECG changes.
PNA: The patient was first started on levoquin but in light of her increasing hypoxia she was switched to zosyn to broaden her coverage.
She remained afebrile and without a leukoctyosis was thus discharged on a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
Abd pain:  The occurance of abdominal pain is conincident with her recent onset of constipation.
The pain is most likely secondary to constipation.
Her abdominal pain and distension improved significantly with the administration of an enema which resulted in a successful bowel movement.
