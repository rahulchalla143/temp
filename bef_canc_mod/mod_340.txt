IMPRESSION:  This is a 49 year old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis who is admitted with upper GI bleed secondary to gastric variceal bleeding.
Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was given for SBP prophylaxis.
The initial plan had been to go for a TIPS placement the next day, but that evening, the patient developed nausea and dropped his blood pressure to 50/palpable.
The patient therefore went emergently to Interventional Radiology for TIPS placement, which was performed without complications.
He received two units of packed red blood cells which bumped his hematocrit up to 38; there was no further bleeding.
It was recommended that he have a repeat upper endoscopy and echocardiogram as an outpatient shortly.
