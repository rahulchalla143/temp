Admission Date:  [**2104-12-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2105-2-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2028-5-12**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GOLD SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female who was recently diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**] with metastatic ovarian carcinoma for which she underwent a debulking surgery, total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid colon resection, and colostomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, breast cancer status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**], ovarian cancer diagnosed [**2104-11-1**] status post debulking surgery, hypercholesterolemia, status post appendectomy, history of shingles.
An initial surgical consult was sought as cholecystitis was a possible source of her sepsis.
She underwent her first EGD on [**12-26**] which revealed grade II esophagitis, gastritis, and an ulcer in the anterior aspect of the first part of the duodenum.
A chest x-ray revealed bilateral lung infiltrates, and pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of this.
Each of these EGDs revealed healing esophagitis and blood in the antrum and body of the stomach and a large clot in the bowel of the duodenum with no active source identified.
EGD done on [**1-5**], showed a single oozing ulcer noted in the anterior bowel of the duodenum which was about 2-3 cm in size.
On [**1-7**], she underwent repeat EGD which showed a fungating ulcerative bleeding mass distal to the duodenal bulb.
As the patient continued to have a transfusion requirement, Surgery was reconsulted for management of this bleeding duodenal mass.
The duodenal ulcer was oversewn, and a pyloroplasty was done.
Over the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay, she developed MRSA sepsis followed by VRE sepsis and fungemia for which she received appropriate treatment.
She had bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left.
Subsequently she was noted to have loculated pleural effusions, again worse on the right side.
Her Intensive Care Unit stay was further complicated by rapid onset of atrial fibrillation for which she received Amiodarone.
She also underwent a CT scan of her head in early [**Month (only) 958**] for persistent mental status changes.
She did not have any further infective issues and has remained off antibiotics.
She has been making good urine, and there are no issues with renal function at present.
Metastatic ovarian carcinoma status post debulking surgery.
Bleeding duodenal ulcer and fungal duodenal mass status post exploratory laparotomy and oversewing of duodenal ulcer and pyloroplasty.
Status post Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sepsis, fungemia, and Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
Malignant pleural effusions status post pleurodesis times two.
Right groin pseudoaneurysm status post injection of thrombin.
