Admission Date:  [**2177-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right PICC insertion [**2177-11-7**] IR guided drainage of large abdominal hematoma [**2177-10-29**] Angiography of the celiac artery, SMA, GDA, and abdominal aorta [**2177-10-28**] Left Internal Jugular central Line insertion [**2177-10-28**] Arterial Line Placement [**2177-10-28**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old male with PMH of multiple myeloma s/p 11 months of chemotherapy through [**7-/2177**], RCC s/p left nephrectomy, CKI newly started on HD M/W/F as of 2 weeks ago, DM2 c/b gastroparesis/peripheral neuropathy, HTN, and CAD being transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with altered mental status, Afib with RVR, hypotension requiring neosynephrine drip, and for IR embolization for what was thought to be a large fluid collection in his abdomen representing an actively extravasating hemorrhagic right renal cyst.
After one of these falls, he was most hospitalized at [**Hospital6 5016**] from [**10-11**] to [**10-21**] for a syncope work-up.
He also was found to have epigastric pain with coffee-ground vomiting at that time.
Per OSH records, a CT abdomen revealed a hemorrhagic cyst of the liver vs. a right renal hemorrhagic cyst but no management of this fluid collection was initiated at the time.
This morning, he began complaining of intensifying abdominal pain and the rehab staff noted pallor on physical exam.
He also developed altered mental status and EMS was called.
He was transported back to [**Hospital3 **] where his hematocrit was found to be 24 and a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed that showed marked interval enlargement of what was read as an exophytic right renal cyst with concern for active hemorrhage.
A neosynephrine drip was also started for hypotension and he was given 3L of NS.
On physical exam he was noted to have a large, tender mass on the right side of his abdomen.
His OSH scans were reviewed and on preliminary read it looked as though he had a chronic free standing fluid collection with subacute blood in it, but no active extravasation.
It was unclear if the fluid collection was originating from the pancreas or the gastroduodenal artery.
There was also a separate right renal/adrenal cyst noted.
IR decided to take the patient for an aortogram to see if there was any active bleeding that could be embolized.
He was also noted on CXR to have a RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA and was given a dose of vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the ED.
In the IR suite, the fluid collection was felt to be a pancreatic pseudocyst.
Arteriograms of the aorta, celiac, and SMA systems revealed no active extravasation or bleeding.
The patient's main complaint was back pain which he has chronically and was exacerbated from laying still after his IR procedure.
Besides the pain the patient was feeling much better and was no longer confused.
Otherwise, he denied any shortness of breath, cough, fevers, chills, headache, or chest pain.
He does report having recent difficulty focusing his vision, new onset palpitations earlier today which have since resolved, and constipation.
He also reports right sided abdominal pain which has become less severe and increasing edema.

Cytology Report PERITONEAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2177-10-29**] DIAGNOSIS: Peritoneal Fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with PMH of plasma cell dyscrasia s/p 11 months of Melphalan and Prednisone through [**7-/2177**] RCC s/p left nephrectomy, ESRD recently started on HD, DM and HTN who was admitted with hypotension, rapid AF and confusion for possible IR embolisation of what was thought to be a large intra-abd hematoma with concern for ongoing hemorrhage.
# Large intra-abdominal hematoma: Pt was transferred from an OSH due to concern for possible enlarging hemorrhagic renal cyst.
Pt had required blood transfusions prior to transfer and was hypotensive with a pressor requirement on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Repeat CT abdomen without contrast on [**10-28**] demonstrated the large hematoma which was causing IVC compression and was felt possibly secondary to trauma.
Surgery and IR were consulted and this was felt possibly due to duodenal hemorrhage.
Pt underwent angiograms of the aorta, celiac, and SMA on [**10-28**] which did not showed any evidence of extravasation or pseudoaneurysm.
The hematoma was drained on [**10-29**] by IR and put out 750cc.
Pt had considerable abdominal pain at the drain site which improved with IV dilaudid.
Pt had a repeat CTA abd and pelvis on [**11-10**] which showed an interval decrease in size but still a large residual hematoma with no blush to suggest active bleeding.
His Hb/HCt remained stable and abdominal pain improved significantly.
# Pneumonia.
The patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia at his rehab hospital and was given one dose of vancomycin on [**10-22**] and continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for a 10 day course.
CXR at [**Hospital1 **] showed RLL infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions secobdary to his volume status.
He completed a course of ABx for HAP after which he remained afebrile without respiratory complaints .
# ESRD on HD: Mr [**Known lastname 87676**] had worsening renal unction prior to admission and this was initially felt due to worsening of his plasma cell dyscrasia and previous RCC s/p nephrectomy.
Pt had been started on HD 3 weeks prior to admission and presented with massive volume overload/anasarca that was complicated by his low albumin.
He did not require any other nodal agents and was not anticoagulated given his large hematoma and relative thrombocytopenia.
# Left Eye conjunctivitis: On [**11-10**] there was noted evidence of left conjunctival erythema and exudate clinically compatile with mild bacterial conjunctivitis.
# Pericardial effusion: On [**11-3**] there was evidence of a moderate pericardial effusion on echo and was not causing tamponade.
He went on to a repeat echo [**11-3**] which showed normal LV/RV (LVEF>55%)and a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent (1.3cm) around the apex of the right and left ventricle and relatively little inferolateral (<0.5cm) to the left ventricle with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# Plasma cell dyscrasia: Initially documented on admission to be myeloma but on further discussion with his outpt hematologist, it was felt that the exact nature of his plasma cell dyscrasia was not entirely understood.
He was noted to have a large MCV while in house with high retic count and further hematology managment was deferred to the outpatient setting.
# Malnutrition/Ascites: Pt presented with a low albumin and anasarca.
Pt was noted to have poor oral intake which was felt to be as a result of abdominal dyscomfort.
This was initially treated with HISS but he had a poor nutrition status and minimal oral intake.
Pt was transitioned back to regular diet when his intake improved and his blood sugars remained well controlled without any short acting insulin coverage.
The gabapentin was decreased to 100mg qhs and neuropathic pain was controlled.
# Anisocoria: Noted to have left pupil larger than right which was persistent with GCS 15/15.
No focal neurological deficit.
Hypothyroidism: Pt was noted to have an elevated TSH at 17 and low fT4 0.91 on [**11-6**].
CT-abd [**10-28**] showed right middle lobe ground-glass nodules measuring up to 8 mm, possibly infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Radiology recommended followup in three months with CT-chest to document stability especially in a patient with known primary malignancy.

You were initially transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with confusion and a low blood pressure requiring medications to support this in addition to an increasing collection of blood within the abdomen.
The outside hospital had taken a chest X-ray which showed pneumonia and you were treated with intravenous antibiotics for this completing a 10-day course.
You had no further fevers during your hospital stay.
You also briefly had a fast irregular hreat beat which was treated with medications to slow the heart and resolved with no futher episodes.
Given inncreasing abdominal pain, you were reassessed with a CT-scan which showed an enlarging collection of blood (called a hematoma) in your abdomen.
You were transferred to the ICU for monitoring and had an angiogram to look at the blood vessels and there was no evidence of active bleeding or any swellings of the blood vessels.
The cause of this collection of blood is not known but may have been related to a bleed from the gut.
You required no transfusions while at the [**Hospital1 18**] although you did have some prior to your arrival here and your blood count remained stable.
Due to the blood collection, we held your aspirin and pain was controlled with appropriate pain-killers and improved during your admission.
They were able latterly to take off 3-4 liters of fluid but there were problems regarding your blood pressure which tended to drop during dialysis.
You were incidentally found to have right sided lung nodules on your CT scan which was in teh context of being treated for pneumonia.
You initially required nutrition through the veins due to poor oral intake but latterly you no longer required this and were eating well.
You also noted a loose left upper incisor tooth and this should be followed up by a dentist at your rehab.
You were treated for a possible bacterial infection on the outside of the eye called bacterial conjunctivitis with eye drops.
Medication changes: We stopped aspirin due to your abdominal blood collection WE increased your levothyroxine to 137mcg daily Given your kidney function we reduced gabapentin to 100mg daily .
