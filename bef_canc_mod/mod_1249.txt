[**2129-5-7**]: Re-exploration with placement of lateral duodenostomy tube and feeding jejunostomy tube.
[**2129-6-1**]: Successful CT-guided catheter drainage of liver abscess   History of Present Illness: 66 year-old woman with gastric outlet obstruction from a pyloric ulcer and duodenal stricture status post dilitation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**4-13**], who was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**4-20**] with vomiting and abdominal pain as well as diarrhea for 2 days.
Her abdominal pain was mild and located in the upper abdomen.
She felt weak and had mild chills and diaphoresis.
KUB showed dilated stomach.
Her symptoms initially improved and diet was advanced to pureed diet, but this triggered further nausea, abdominal cramps.
She currently has mild crampy abdominal pain periumbilical and lower abdomen, no epigastric symptoms.
No nasuea currently, her symptoms of cramping are post prandial, her nausea is intermittent and not related to food intake.
Mild fatigue.
Denies chest pain and shortness of breath.

CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABD: Soft, mild periumbilical tenderness, no rebound or guarding, normal bowel sounds present.
No lower extremity edema.
PSYCH: Calm, appropriate  DISCHARGE P/E:   Pertinent Results: [**2129-4-20**] KUB 1. no bowel obstruction, free air or wall thickening 2. stomach is distended with both gas and fluid  [**2129-4-26**] KUB: No free air on supine radiographs.
Diffuse symmetric thickening of the gastric wall at the level of the pylorus, with few perigastric lymph nodes.
These findings are concerning for a gastric malignancy with local lymph nodal disease.
No evidence of distant metastases in the abdomen and pelvis.
Multiple bilateral adrenal lesions, consistent with adenomas.
Antral/pyloric-type mucosa with extensive ulceration, granulation tissue formation, acute and chronic inflammation and focal reactive epithelial changes.
No dysplasia is identified.
Note:  Immunostain for H. pylori is in progress; results will be reported in an addendum.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Large inflammatory phlegmon involving the transverse mesocolon extending up to the right subhepatic space where it is continuous with a small air and fluid collection adjacent to the gallbladder.
However, there may be a small access window posterolaterally on the right.
Also of note, there is very little fluid within this inflammatory phlegmon, though a very large percutaneous drain would be required to drain it.
Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are likely reactive.
Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate.
Slight decrease in size of fluid collections along segment IV of the liver as well as the peri-pancreatic collections.
Unchanged size and appearance of collection in the transverse mesocolon.
Narrowing of the SMV as it crosses the duodenum and T-tube without venous thrombus, increased from the prior study.
Decreased size of bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
There is associated periportal edema and gallbladder wall edema related to systemic inflammation.
T-tube remains in place within the duodenal stump with near complete resolution of previously described fluid collection.
There is a moderate amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
[**2129-6-6**] CARDIAC ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year-old woman with gastric outlet obstruction from pyloric ulcer and duodenal stricturing s/p duodenal balloon dilation on [**2129-4-13**] and [**2129-4-25**] without improvement in symptoms.
Patient could not tolerate POs without increase in nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
On [**2129-5-5**], the patient underwent vagotomy and antrectomy with B2 reconstruction, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with NGT, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
On [**2129-5-7**], (POD2), the patient's drain output turned bilious and she developed peritonitis on exam, concerning for duodenal stump leak.
Post operatively in the PACU, the patient was tachycardic and was given IV Metoprolol 5mg x 2 with good effect.
The patient's recovery course was complicated by prolonged diarrhea [**3-16**] tube feeding despite multiple changes of feed, abdominal cramps relieved by hyoscyamine, liver abscess and bacteremia/sepsis.
Neuro: The patient has a history of chronic back and abdominal pain, she is on Vicodin and Soma  at home prior admission.
Post operatively, the patient received Bupivacaine/Hydromorphone via epidural catheter for pain control.
The pain was adequately controlled.
The patient was started on Toradol after second operation for better pain control.
The patient's pain was not adequately controlled on home medications regiment and Vicodin was changed to Dilaudid PO.
The patient was restarted on Soma, Hyoscyamine was added to help with abdominal cramps.
CV: The patient was tachycardic and hypertensive postoperatively, her symptoms were treated with IV Metoprolol and her epidural was splitted.
This episode of hypotension was [**3-16**] bacteremia/sepsis, BP improved on [**6-1**].
Cardiac echo was done on [**6-6**] to rule out endocarditis.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
On [**5-31**] the patient received large amount of fluid [**3-16**] hypotension, she developed SOB and wheezing and was intubated in the ICU.
The patient was extubated on [**6-1**] without difficulties.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral small pleural effusions.
The patient developed severe abdominal cramps and TF was held.
TF was held again [**3-16**] severe abdominal cramps and diarrhea.
The patient continued to have significant diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
The patient's diarrhea and abdominal cramps decreased.
ID: The patient's was afebrile with normal WBC on admission, her urine cultures were negative.
The patient was transferred into ICU, abdominal CT revealed large liver abscess.
The patient underwent IR guided drainage of the abscess and JP drain placement on [**2129-6-1**].
The patient's blood and abscess cultures came back positive for multiple organisms including VRE and MRSA.
Wound care: The patient's midline incision healed well and currently open to air.
Currently, D-tube continued to have minimal leak around the tube, the tube is capped and attached to small ostomy pouch.
At the time of discharge in Rehab, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
