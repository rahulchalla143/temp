[**3-13**] ECG: Sinus rhythm Prior inferior myocardial infarction No previous tracing available for comparison .
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic microvascular angiopathy.
Right supraorbital facial swelling.
No fracture identified.
[**3-13**]: CT C-spine: No evidence of acute fracture or listhesis.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
Soft tissue swelling over the right orbit.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Note added at attending review: There is a fracture of the tip of the coronoid process of the right mandible.
[**3-14**] MRI Head: Significantly limited MRI of the brain due to motion artifact.
Extensive chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes.
Scattered old lacunar infarcts within the brainstem.
No acute territorial infarcts are seen within the brain.
There is mild-moderate cortical atrophy.
There is severe, confluent FLAIR-hyperintensity in bihemispheric periventricular and subcortical white matter, representing extensive chronic microischemic change.
However, there is no focus of restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarction.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
There are a few punctate foci of blooming susceptibility artifact, unchanged, likely representing hemosiderin from past petechial hemorrhage, related to small vessel infarction.
Again noted is a prominent developmental venous anomaly ("venous angioma") in the right paramedian cerebellar vermis, with no associated cavernous angioma or hemorrhage.
There is no other pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement.
IMPRESSION: 1) No acute process and no significant interval change since the [**3-20**] examination.
2) Severe chronic micro-ischemic change in bihemispheric white matter.
3) Extensive fluid within bilateral mastoid air cells, significantly worse since the previous examination, and bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening with small amount of fluid in the sphenoid sinus, some of which may relate to protracted supine positioning (is there clinical suspicion of either sinusitis or mastoiditis?).
There is a prominent mediastinal venous engorgement with no overt pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar mild atelectasis are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname 3647**] was initially admitted to the medicine ICU for observation given her chronic tongue swelling and fall on her face with trauma.
She was monitored overnight on standard ICU monitoring and a 1:1 sitter with no problems or events.
The dementia workup was negative and the MRI (limited study) was significant for no acute stroke.
The pt was noted to have extensive chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes and scattered old lacunar infarcts within the brainstem.
On the morning of transfer to the floor the pt has a CT head that showed an isolated fracture of her mandible.
The pt became increasingly somnolent on arrival to the floor and had decreased responsiveness.
She became mildly rousable on her third day on the floor.
Due to concern for altered mental status secondary to meningitis/encephalitis, an LP was attempted by the Anesthesia team and house staff.
A day after initiation of these medications, there was an interval increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.2.
# Frequent falls/altered mental status: The pt was noted to have a progressive decline in mental status over the last few years with a significantly accelerated decline over the last 2-3 weeks.
The pt's fall did not appear to be a syncopal event and her labs and urinalysis were unremarkable.
Her head CT revealed chronic microvascular angiopathy likely representing dementia.
A STAT EEG showed markedly abnormal brain activity indicating severe encephalopathy.
Her EEG showed evidence of a deep encephalopathy.
She was started on IV glycerine to treat brain edema related to her fall.
She remained minimally responsive.
Initially, she had absent reflexes and no withdrawal to noxious stimuli; she began to regain reflexes and withdrew her lower limbs to nailbed pressure, raising the possibility of resolving critical illness polyneuropathy.
As she did not follow commands, further workup was pursued, including sending anti-TPO antibody to check for Hashimoto's encephalitis.
LP was also repeated to look specifically for signs of limbic encephalitis (anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]), intravascular lymphoma (LDH), and Creutzfield-[**Doctor Last Name **] Disease (CSF for CJD).
Multiple blood and urine cultures were sent which showed no signs of infection.
She also had several days of EEG monitoring with no evidence of seizure, and only showing encephalopathy.
# Renal - the patient temporarily developed ARF on IV acyclovir.
# Swollen tongue: The pt was noted to have a swollen tongue on admission but this was not noted in admission to the floor; in fact the pt had had a large tongue (per husband) for the last 40 years secondary to chronic Fluphenazine use.
The pt did not have any evidence of airway compromise.
The pt's husband reported that the pt has h/o tongue angioedema scondary to chronic (>40y) fluphenazine use.
# Thyroid mass Pt noted to have a 4.4-cm mass in the right lobe of the thyroid on ultrasound.
She could be considered for ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass in the future.
# Urinary incontinence.
No evidence of acute infection or retention.
# HTN.
BP was elevated upon arrival to medical ICU; this was thought to be likely secondary to agitation.
She had no further BP issues while on the floor and was stable on discharge.
She did have a small amount of captopril added while she was here and was sent out on this.
# Psych.
Upon further questioning, her husband described a gait that resembled a Parkinsonian gait - she likely had an element of drug-induced Parkinsonism prior to hospitalization; it is possible that an unsteady gait contributed to her fall.
She did develop a bilateral PNA which was successfully treated and subsequent CXRs were clear.
She also had an element of mild fluid overload on some of the CXRs.
Of note, the patient is tachypneic at times with no other instability with rates of ~30.
#In summary, the patient had a rapidly progressive encephalopathy while in the hospital.
She had a fall, then became unresponsive fairly soon after.
She also developed ARF likely due to med effect.
She later developed a pneumonia which was treated.
A large work-up, including MRIx4, LPx2, and multiple blood tests yielded no reason for her symptoms.
The theory as to what is causing her problems is that she has a large amount of small vessel disease at baseline.
She has no spontaneous movement or attempts at speech.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Persistent encephalopathy thought to be due to recent status epilepticus as well as severe small vessel cerebral disease.
-- HTN Thyroid nodule   Discharge Condition: Pt is unreponsive, but opens her eyes to sternal rub.
