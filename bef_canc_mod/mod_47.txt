HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 78-year-old man with past medical history significant for PMR, hypertension, with no known history of coronary artery disease, who presented at outside hospital complaining of chest pressure radiating to neck when using a snow-blower.
Pain subsided with rest, but returned with activity.
He says three days ago he had the same symptoms when also using a snow-blower.
No dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting at the time of chest pressure.
Reports waking up with chest pain approximately one week ago.
Had jaw pain at that time also.
Also reports that over the past month he has had increasing chest pain with exertion.
Daughter, who is a R.N, states that he has had increased dyspnea with exertion x1 year.

General:  Pleasant-elderly man well appearing in no acute distress.
J-point elevated in V4-5 with early R-wave progression.
CHEST X-RAY:  No effusions or infiltrates.
No emphysematous changes.
Summary of his catheterization showed 2+ mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 45%, left main 70% lesion, left anterior descending artery, no significant disease, left circumflex 80% at the origin, ostia 99% proximal, 100% in the distal.
On [**2-11**], the patient was brought to the operating room at which time, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with a mitral valve repair.
He showed a respiratory acidosis.
He did have a period of atrial fibrillation, and was started on amiodarone at that time.
On postoperative day three, patient became somewhat hypoxic as sputum production increased and he was empirically started on ceftriaxone, and sputum cultures were sent at that time.
