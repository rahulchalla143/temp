HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer with multiple medical problems who presented with hypoxia after being found hypoxic at rehabilitation with an elevated white count.
A brief summary of her most recent history includes a diagnosis of an inoperable nonamenable small-bowel obstruction secondary to her tumor.
She had several brief episodes of supraventricular tachycardia which were self-limited.
She was also found to have renal failure which was attributed to obstructive uropathy from tumor along with a small prerenal component.
On [**2-21**], these were changed to vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia once sensitivities were determined.
On [**2-24**], she was found to have dark drainage from her nasogastric tube which was thought to be blood.
Her right arm was found to be swollen, and an ultrasound revealed a deep venous thrombosis.
On [**2-25**], she was found tachypneic and hypoxic and began to be febrile as well.
She had blood from her ostomy as well as occult blood positive nasogastric tube output.
Her mental status worsened, and she no longer responded to pain or voice.
She had no spontaneous eye movements.
She was transfused multiple times for a falling hematocrit.
She was noted to be in respiratory distress by her family on [**3-1**].
She then developed a narrow complex tachycardia with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s with a palpable carotid pulse.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was rapidly weaned from pressors, and she was treated for her pseudomonal pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
The patient was extubated and then failed secondary to her mental status and had to be reintubated.
She was negative for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody.
She continued to have minimal output from her colostomy secondary to her obstruction by tumor.
She did develop positive cultures on [**3-15**] and [**3-16**]; which were not treated as there had been no change in her clinical status.
Her urinalysis was negative for signs of infection.
At the rehabilitation facility she was found to be hypoxic and have an elevated white blood cell count with thick material being suctioned from the tracheostomy.
Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**]; status post debulking, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, status post omentectomy, status post sigmoid resection, and end colostomy.
Status post bleeding ulcer and duodenal mass.
Status post oversewing of ulcer and pyloroplasty.
History of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
History of malignant pleural effusions; status post pleurodesis times two.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
High cholesterol.
Recently (in [**2106-1-30**]) diagnosed with a small-bowel obstruction related to tumor burden which was inoperable and not responsive to chemotherapy.
The left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic with an ejection fraction of greater than 75%.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was no significant aortic valve stenosis.
There was 1+ aortic regurgitation.
There was no mitral valve prolapse.
There was trivial mitral regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.
The patient had a tracheostomy and unresponsive to deep sternal rub.
The chest revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The abdomen was distended, hard, and with no bowel sounds.
There was left upper extremity trace edema.
There was bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema.
A urinalysis had moderate leukocyte esterase, moderate blood, negative nitrites, trace protein, moderate bilirubin, greater than 50 white blood cells, greater than 50 red blood cells, many bacteria, and 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the head done on [**2-16**] showed minimal mucosal thickening present in the right maxillary sinus and within the ethmoid air cells; otherwise, no acute process.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2-19**] showed no evidence of cholecystitis with septated fluid regions representing metastatic spread adjacent to the liver.
An upper extremity ultrasound from [**2-24**] showed an occluding thrombus in the right cephalic vein.
A abdominal ultrasound from [**3-2**] showed no intrahepatic bowel ductal dilation.
There was extensive metastatic disease throughout the peritoneum.
There was unchanged bilateral hydronephrosis.
A chest x-ray done on [**3-18**] showed an increasing left pleural effusion, retrocardiac, and a right lower lobe opacity which may have been atelectasis versus pneumonia.
A urinalysis from [**3-16**] was negative for nitrites and leukocyte esterase.
She had a tracheostomy and needed no sedation at that time.
She did require frequent suctioning for thick sputum.
She was treated for pneumonia with vancomycin.
She was also started on Zosyn for her urinary tract infection.
She was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor for her history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
The patient had a known right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and was not anticoagulated given her risk of a gastrointestinal bleed.
This was felt to be secondary to her metastatic disease.
She did not respond to voice or pain.
This was felt to be secondary likely to an anoxic brain injury as well as her multiple metabolic abnormalities from her multiple medical problems.
The patient was also noted to have renal failure.
This was secondary to obstructive disease from her ovarian cancer.
Initially, the patient was seen by the Gastroenterology Service who felt that her gastrointestinal bleed should be managed conservatively with proton pump inhibitors.
Her gastrointestinal bleeding slowed down somewhat.
It was felt that Ms. [**Known lastname 96805**] was dying from her terminal metastatic ovarian cancer.
At no point was she responsive to voice or pain.
She was noted to have a coagulopathy with an INR of 1.7.
Once again, the Gastroenterology Service felt that there was no intervention that was possible in this extremely ill and terminal woman.
Metastatic ovarian cancer.
Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
Obstructive nephropathy.
Renal failure.
Right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Blood loss anemia.
