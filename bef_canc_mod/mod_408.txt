Early goal-directed therapy for sepsis was initiated, and a L subclavian Presept catheter was placed, she was bolused 2L NS, given vancomycin and ceftazadime, and started on norepinephrine as her MAP was <65 in spite of a CVP of 14.
She had an abd CT which showed no abscess but bowel wall thickening c/w colitis (c diff).
Left lower ex noninvasives negative.
She had a slight trop leak thought [**2-19**] demand and also in the setting of renal failure.
She continued to have fevers up to 101 but remained hemodynamically stable on dapto and flagyl.
She has had diarrhea but no nausea or abdominal pain.
She denies any headache or neck pain, denies CP, SOB, palpitations.

No abnormal enhancing fluid collections are identified within the abdominal cavity.
No free air is noted within the abdominal cavity.
No pathologically enlarged nodes are present.
There has been no significant interval change in the amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There has been interval development of bowel wall thickening involving the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.
It is difficult to evaluate for signs of adjacent mesenteric stranding given the diffuse engorgement of the mesentery and pelvic ascites that are slightly increased from prior examination.
The uterus, adnexa, and Foley containing urinary bladder appear unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
No abnormal enhancing fluid collections to suggest underlying abscess.
Interval development of colitis involving the ascending, transverse, and descending colon most suggestive of C. Difficile.
Ischemia is unlikely based on the non-vascular distribution.
Stable abdominal ascites with progression of pelvic ascites.
Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis   Brief Hospital Course: Sepsis In the ED a central line was placed and early goal-directed therapy initiated with pressors, vancomycin, and ceftazidime.
She was admitted to the medical ICU for sepsis and maintained on pressors.
Multiple cultures did not grow responsible organism but tests for C.difficile were positive and this was presumed to be the source.
Abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening consistent with colitis.
She was initially treated empirically with cefepime, flagyl, and daptomycin but then coverage was narrowed to flagyl PO for C.diff and daptomycin for possible occult line infection (she was initally still having fevers).
Hypothyroidism Although she has previously carried a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, she was not on levothyroxine on admission.
Myelofibrosis/Anemia Hematocrit was followed and she received 1u of PRBCs with hemodialysis on [**2202-7-28**] as her hematocrit had fallen to 24.
No source of bleeding was identified and hct drop was presumed to be due to ESRD and myelofibrosis.
Although there have been several psychiatric medication changes through prolonged rehab/hospital course, she was on the most recent regimen as verified with her husband but affect did not improve.
