Since previous tracing of [**2111-5-25**], ST-T wave abnormalities decreased    Brief Hospital Course: 46 yom with hx of Hep C, HCC, s/p liver transplant now with reactivation Hep C who presents to ER with Hypertensive emergency.
Pt sent to the ER for BP control.
In the ER patient found to have elevated Cr 2.4, which is above baseline of 1.0-1.3.
Pt also with headaches x 5 days which was attributed to elevated blood pressures.
There are no focal neurologic deficits.
CT scan of the head was negative for hemorrhage or mass effect.
Renal u/s ordered to evaluate for RAS, which did show blunted arterial upstrokes which can be seen in RAS.
PT then transferred to MICU for BP control.
Cause of Hypertensive Emergency likely due to meds vs. renal artery stenosis.
Pt began cyclosporine 2 weeks ago and now presents with HTN and ARF, which are both adverse side effects of this medication.
PAtient will have MRA of kidney  as outpatientto further evaluate renal artery stenosis once creatinine back at baseline.
Etiology is likely HTN emergency [**1-13**] RAS vs. cyclosporine.
3) Liver transplant: Pt with transplant in [**2111-5-13**] [**1-13**] Hep C cirrhosis and HCC.
