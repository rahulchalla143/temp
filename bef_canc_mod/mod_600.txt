POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Malfunction of left axillary- bifemoral graft.
INDICATIONS:  This 72-year-old lady with severe peripheral vascular disease has previously had a left axillary-bifemoral graft.
She recently developed recurrent symptoms of claudication and early, mild ischemic rest pain in her left foot.
Duplex ultrasound suggested a stenosis at the proximal anastomosis of the axillary graft to the axillary artery and also a focal high- grade stenosis in the superficial femoral artery just distal to the distal anastomosis on the left side.
A lateral incision was made through the old incision, incising the deep fascia and reflecting the proximal sartorius muscle.
A longitudinal incision was made just proximal to the groin incision, directly over the axillary femoral graft, at about the level of the iliac crest before it entered the groin.
Arteriography confirmed the presence of what appeared to be only about a 50%-60% stenosis of the anastomosis into the origin of the left axillary graft; however, the ultrasound had suggested a far more significant stenosis, and we had noted a weak pulse in the axillary- femoral graft when dissecting it free.
A catheter was then placed and connected to a pressure transducer and a pull-back pressure done, which showed about a 5-mm systolic pressure gradient across the anastomosis, with no change in diastolic blood pressures, and about a 2- to 3-mm drop in the mean arterial pressure.
Flow was reestablished without difficulty.
