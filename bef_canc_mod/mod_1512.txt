She lives in a group home and per report has had two admissions this year for shortness of breath, last in [**2156-8-5**], attributed to either pneumonia or COPD exacerbation.
She has also had multiple PCP/outpatient office visits and ED visits for shortness of breath, generally attributed to bronchitis or reactive airway disease.
She has also had acute on chronic abdominal pain and underwent EGD recently that demonstrated gastritis.
She was in her USOH until this afternoon when she began having worsening abdominal pain after being picked up in a car by her case manager.
Her recent history is notable for the absence of fevers, chronic nonproductive cough, and no increase in her baseline nebulizer requirement.
She became hypertensive to SBP 180-200 and had worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on room air.
She was then intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and tachypnea, and was given methylpred 125, bronchodilators, and levofloxacin, after which she was noted to be moving air more effectively.
Of note, ROS is negative for change in bowel or bladder movement, blood in stool, diarrhea, or nausea, though patient has chronically reduced appetite with 50 lb weight loss over past year.
She had a CT scan of her chest in [**Month (only) **] of [**2152**] that showed hilar lymphadenopathy that was stable on a repeat CT in [**2153-6-5**].
She does not have any parenchymal lung disease on these scans and no further workup was pursued at the time.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2156-10-6**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 106357**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of bronchiectasis, likely COPD, ?sarcoidosis, and mild mental retardation who presented to the ED with acute on chronic abdominal pain and dyspnea and was intubated in the setting of hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated in the setting of hypoxia, tachypnea, and hypertension in ED.
Found to have poor air movement on exam.
No significant pulmonary edema on cxr although circumstances raised question if pt had flash edema.
Initial ABG showed mild acidosis with mild CO2 retention.
She was started on IV steroids as well as broad spectrum Abx vanc/cefepime/azithro for emperic PNA coverage.
When CXR showed no obvious infiltrate taken off Vanco/Cefepime and unasyn added for possibility of aspiration event.
Question of fluid overload was raised so pt given IV lasix with good diuresis response.
Vanco was briefly restarted as sputum GS showed GPC but then stopped again once culture grew commensal organisms.
Her underlying lung disease requires further outpatient workup but at the present time the most likely cause for her acute deterioration was a COPD flare.
Abdominal pain/Gastritis: Initial symptoms prompted by acute on chronic abdominal pain, unclear etiology with known gastritis and hepatitis C, and no acute etiology on abdominal CT in [**3-17**].
Schizophrenia:  no change in outpatient management.
