Admission Date:  [**2123-11-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2123-12-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-12-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 64-year-old white male with multiple medical problems including tracheal stenosis, tracheal malacia, status post recent photodynamic treatment and endobronchial stent, osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, who was transferred with fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia.
The patient has a long history of tracheal stenosis and tracheal malacia following a long period of intubation while hospitalized at [**Hospital6 2561**] from [**2121-10-1**] to [**Month (only) 958**] to [**2123**] for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair complicated by graft infection requiring revision.
The patient also has a history of endotracheal cancer discovered at bronchoscopy.
The patient underwent laser photodynamic therapy for stenosis endotracheal cancer in [**2123-9-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was admitted from [**10-30**] to [**11-6**] for elective procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well where he received tracheal and left main bronchus stents complicated by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis and diarrhea.
For the past 10 days the patient had noticed shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and cough productive of blood-tinged yellow sputum.
He has also noticed worsening of chronic bilateral left lower extremity edema and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He denies chest pain or abdominal pain.
Complaints of shortness of breath and orthopnea.
Given complicated pulmonary history and hypoxia the patient was electively intubated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by bronchoscopy.
Tracheal stenosis and tracheal malacia, status post photodynamic therapy in [**2123-9-1**].
History of tracheal cancer, status post photodynamic therapy.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Obstructive sleep apnea, on BiPAP.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
History of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
History of pseudomonal sepsis.
History of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Numerous abdominal surgeries.
General, an obese, uncomfortable white male, in mild respiratory distress.
Heart was distant, a regular rate and rhythm, without murmur, rubs or gallops.
Lungs revealed bilateral basilar wet crackles anteriorly decreased breath sounds.
Extremities revealed 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood, 0 to 2 red blood cells, rare bacteria, trace protein, 3 to 5 white blood cells.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 105, left axis deviation, 0.5-mm ST depressions in II, V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray revealed possible left lower lobe infiltrate, cephalization, hilar prominent with diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
He had a left subclavian placed as well as a arterial line.
He had an echocardiogram done which showed left atrium moderately dilated, left ventricular cavity was normal, left ventricular function depressed, but ejection fraction could not be determined, mild aortic regurgitation.
Thought likely to have a component of congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.
Blood cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus which ended up being methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
He had been ruled out by enzymes for myocardial infarction.
Norvasc was stopped, and ACE inhibitor was started at a low dose as the patient has had congestive heart failure.
In addition an tracheal stenosis of 0.5 cm proximal to the stent was found, and it was recommended that likely he would need resection of the stenosis with electric cautery and silicon stent placed at some point.
He was on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis as well as Protonix, and blood pressure remained stable.
On the floor, the patient developed diarrhea with antibiotics.
This has happened before, and he had slightly increased abdominal pain which has also happened before, and was nonfocal.
Congestive heart failure.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2121**], status post graft infection and tracheal stenosis, status post stent.
Tracheal carcinoma, status post photodynamic treatment.
Coronary artery disease, status post stent.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy in right lower leg.
Many abdominal surgeries.
History of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Vancomycin level peak and trough to be checked on [**12-3**] as well as a Chem-7 as it was slightly low here.
