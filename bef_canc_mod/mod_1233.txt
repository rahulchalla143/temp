male s/p liver transplant [**2170-3-8**] with h/o HCC [**2-2**] hemochromatosis, readmitted from [**Hospital3 7**] to ED with 2 day h/o sob/leg edema.
Recently admitted with with elevated creatinine up to 2.7 from baseline of 1.2 and poor nutritional status as well as diarrhea.
Pt c/o increasing sob and leg edema since [**2170-4-7**], low grade temps (100.7) and decreased diarrhea.
He c/o DOE but which would subside with rest.
Hypertension 5.
Known partial portal and SMV thrombosis, first seen on imaging 01/[**2168**].
Esophageal varices, status post banding on [**2169-4-11**] and [**2169-6-6**] 8.
History of TIA 10.
Chronic pancreatitis with diffuse duct dilatation, ?
2 healthy sisters.
CXR showed bilateral effusions.
EF was 25% with severely depressed LV function, with septal hypokinesis/akinesis and dilated right and left atrium.
Liver u/s showed intrahepatic fluid collection and subdiaphragmatic fluid collection, new in the interval since [**2170-3-4**].
Abd CT also showed large bilateral pleural effusions,persistent stone in distal pancreatic duct with massive pancreatic ductal dilatation and two fluid collections, one at the dome(72x34mm) and one periportally (58x77mm).
He was tachycardic and hypotensive.
Lopressor was given and he was intubated for cardiogenic shock.
On [**4-12**] he had an episode of afib that converted to SR. Levophed requirements decreased with preservation of cardiac output and cardiac index.
A lasix drip was started with increased  urine outputs.
This was stopped on [**4-16**] for metabolic alkalosis.
On [**4-10**] he had ultrasound-guided drainage of a large left hepatic abscess.
Approximately 150 cc of purulent material was aspirated.
Attempt at aspiration of the right-sided subdiaphragmatic collection revealed old hematoma, therefore a catheter was not placed.
Cultures from thoracentesis from R & L  were negative.
On [**4-24**] a Abd CT was showed bilateral pleural effusions left more than right and right subdiaphragmatic collection.
Chronic pancreatitis-type picture with pancreatic duct dilatation and calcification.
Some mild thickening of the antrum of the stomach appeared improved.
Left hydrocele and free fluid in pelvis.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Extensive, nonocclusive thrombus extended  from right internal jugular into right cephalic veins.
There were abnormal dampened venous waveforms on the left arm.
LV systolic function appeared depressed with septal and apical akinesis/hypokinesis and basal inferior akinesis).
Coumadin was started and heparin was stopped when he became therapeutic.
Coumadin was later stopped when he became supratherapeutic to 3.6 on [**5-8**].
[**Last Name (un) **] followed for hyperglycemia adjusting insulin.
He was doing well until [**4-29**] into [**4-30**] when he developed respiratory distress and was transferred back to the SICU.
CXR and CT scan demonstrated moderate pleural effusion on the left and large effusion on the right.
As a part of the work-up, he underwent a repeat TTE which showed a stable EF 25-30% without visualizing the LV thrombus seen on prior TTEs.
Ruled out for MI by enzymes and EKG.
His blood sugars were elevated requiring a transient insulin gtt while on TPN.
On [**5-8**] he was transferred back to the SICU for hypotension after receiving overdiuresis after FFP for pleural tube removal.
CXR showed marked worsening of left retrocardiac opacity.
EKG was without acute change.
This was positive for GNR subsequently identified as pseudomonas.
This came back positive for pseudomonas, but with different sensitivities therefore ID was consulted.
On [**5-16**] a transjugular liver biopsy revealed Central venular hemorrhage, congestion and hepatocellular drop out, focal bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils.
No evidence of acute cellular rejection seen.
An ERCP was done to rule out biliary obstruction/ischemia.
This demonstrated contrast extravasation from the biliary anastomosis site, as well as a stenosis at this point.
There was dilatation of the upstream biliary tree.
Pulmonary, but deferred given that he was not sob and effusion looked such that this could wait.
An u/s of his scrotum was done for complaints of bilateral swelling with discomfort greater on the right side.
This showed right scrotal fluid collection with multiple septations and low level echoes, which possibley represented a chronic hydrocele with proteinaceous debris, although a pyocele could not be completely excluded.
A simple appearing fluid collection within the left inguinal canal possibly trapped from previous intra-abdominal ascites was noted.
