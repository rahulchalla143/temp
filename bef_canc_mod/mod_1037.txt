Admission Date:  [**2188-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**] Chief Complaint: somnolence, hypercarbic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and mechanical ventilation placement of left radial arterial line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] is an 80 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI in [**2181**] and CABG in [**2182**], CHF with EF of 55% in [**11-10**], A. fib on warfarin, and 2 recent admissions for a right retroperitoneal abscess and right empyema which grew Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) which was resistent to cefazolin and ampicillin, but sensitive to fluoroquinolones.
Pigtail drains were placed in the retroperitoneal abscess and VATS was performed to debride the empyema.
Cultures from the residual pleural effusion and retroperitoneal mass were negative at that time.
That hospitalization was complicated by delirium and foley trauma.
A CXR showed the known RLL effusion as well as a possible new infiltrate in lingula.
He denied and SOB or CP.
He was placed on BiPAP but his mental status worsened and he became unresponsive.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Given his history of PE, a CTA was done which showed no PE and stable to improved RLL infiltrates.
A CT of the head showed no bleed or process to explain his respiratory failure.
No cultures were taken but the patient was treated empirically for HAP with vancomycin 1g IV x 1 on top of the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin received at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

- Segmental pulmonary embolism within the right lower lobe .
Past Surgical History: - CABG [**2182**] - Permanent pacemaker placement [**2183**] - Left thoracotomy with total lung decortication ([**Hospital1 18**] [**2183-12-5**]) - Left thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and drainage of pleural fluid ([**Hospital1 18**] [**2183-11-10**]) - Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs - Bilateral total knee replacements - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  Social History: The patient is a retired tool and dye maker; he worked around chemicals but no asbestos.
Family History: Both parents died of coronary artery disease.
One brother died at 72 of heart disease.
No cervical LAD.
Micro:Sputum cxr - Commensal Respiratory Flora.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Right pleural fluid collection unchanged or slightly improved compared to the prior study.
No superimposed consolidation or pneumonia.
[**12-17**] CT Head - No hemorrhage or edema .
[**12-17**] CXR - Cardiomegaly, right basilar effusion and consolidation .
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular paced beats.
ST-T wave abnormalities and intrinsic beats are non-specific.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year-old man with s/p recent VATS and drainagae of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib, admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of the patient's respiratory failure is thought to be multifactorial, with likely aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of the patient's underlying lung abnormalities (right pleural effusion, PE, retroperitoneal abscess) and hypothyroidism (TSH 35) all contributing.
Although the patient's respiratory failure was initially though to be infectious in origin, and he was treated with Vancomycin  Flagyl and Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia (given his history of aspiration--see speech and swallow notes--as well as his recent history of hospitalization, rehab and empyema + retroperitoneal abscess growing Pantoea spp), antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days when the patient failed to spike a fever, become hypoxic or develop any significant leukocytosis or infiltrate on chest xray.
He was intubated and mechanically ventilated for one day, and was extubated without difficulty.
Although the OSH was concerned about CHF, the patient did not become hypoxic at any point and had no crackles on exam or evidence of CHF on xray.
Based on the patient's ABGs, he seems to be somewhat of a chronic retainer (possibly due to pulmonary physiology s/p effusions and empyema and abscess and surgeries) and his pCO2 settled out at approximately 54.
# Aspiration - The patient was evaluated by video swallow, which showed aspiration with straw sips of thin liquids; penetration with cup sips of thin liquids.
Assist with meals as needed to maintain aspiration precautions, including:    a) sit fully upright for all PO    b) swallow twice per bite/twice per sip    c) no guzzling - single sips only 5.
# Pulmonary embolus: The patient was diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with Segmental pulmonary embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled without elevations, and he was monitored on telemetry without events.
Hospital Bed Indication: Aspiration Pneumonia/Pneumonitis 3.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1. respiratory failure 2. hypothyroidism 3. aspiration  Secondary: 1. pulmonary embolism 2. atrial fibrillation 3. coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure.
Although you were intubated for a little while in the ICU, you were extubated without complication.
These problems quickly resolved while you were in the ICU and your antibiotics were stopped.
