She presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital with worsening shortness of breath.
She was scheduled for pleuredesis here in the future.
Pt states increasing SOB and increased drain output x 2 weeks, but acutely worse this week, with the output from the R-sided drain appearing more bloody.
Does note LE edema bilaterally, as well as productive cough for the past week.
CXR initially with loculated effusions.
CT of chest with worsened pleural effusion.
[**5-/2108**]:  Multiple suspicious areas on breast MRI.
Bilateral breast biopsy demonstrated invasive lobular carcinoma.
[**6-/2108**]:  Underwent bilateral mastectomy for what appeared to be multifocal disease in both breasts and had negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.
The left breast lesion was T1C M0, ER/PR positive, HER-2/neu negative without lymphovascular invasion and grade II.
The last bone mineral density scan in [**7-/2108**] revealed osteopenia at the left femoral neck   Social History: Lives with husband.
Family History: A brother who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 59, metastatic disease at age 60.
She has a sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 49 and died at age 51 from metastatic disease.
She has another sister recently diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2109**].
Lungs: Clear to auscultation b/l in upper lung fields; decreased air movement halfway up lung fields, dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, rubs, and coarse ronchi in b/l lower lung fields.
Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding.
B/l chest tube sites with clean dressings.
GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge exam - expired  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD WBC-7.2 RBC-3.59* Hgb-10.6* Hct-34.1* MCV-95 MCH-29.7 MCHC-31.1 RDW-18.3* Plt Ct-410 [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD Neuts-78.9* Lymphs-18.0 Monos-2.2 Eos-0.5 Baso-0.4 [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD PT-11.5 PTT-27.3 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD Glucose-96 UreaN-14 Creat-0.9 Na-133 K-4.8 Cl-100 HCO3-22 AnGap-16 [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD proBNP-1349* [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2112-6-27**] 05:05AM BLOOD CK-MB-1 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2112-6-26**] 11:15PM BLOOD Calcium-8.4 Phos-4.0 Mg-2.0 [**2112-6-26**] 11:36PM BLOOD Lactate-1.5  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2112-6-30**] 04:23AM BLOOD WBC-10.4 RBC-3.60* Hgb-10.9* Hct-33.5* MCV-93 MCH-30.2 MCHC-32.5 RDW-17.6* Plt Ct-486* [**2112-6-30**] 04:23AM BLOOD PT-13.5* PTT-25.6 INR(PT)-1.3* [**2112-6-30**] 02:53PM BLOOD Glucose-154* UreaN-22* Creat-1.1 Na-125* K-5.0 Cl-95* HCO3-19* AnGap-16 [**2112-6-30**] 04:23AM BLOOD Calcium-8.0* Phos-3.5 Mg-1.8  MICRO: -BCx - NGTD -Sputum - yeast and commensal respiratory flora -Pleural fluid - no growth  IMAGING: -CXR (admission, [**2112-6-26**]): Increased moderate loculated right and small dependent left pleural effusions with accompanying mild pulmonary edema.
-CXR (most recent, [**2112-7-1**]): Compared to the most recent radiograph from [**2112-6-30**], moderate right apical pneumothorax accompanying passive collapse of underlying lung has minimally increased whereas minimal right basal pneumothorax is smaller.
Bilateral, diffuse, pulmonary edema is constant.
Left lung base opacity improved over last 24 hours is mostly atelectasis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Interval increase in large loculated right and small dependent left pleural effusions with resultant increase in consolidation in the right lung, most of which is likely compressive atelectasis.
Bilateral left greater than right ground-glass opacity with septal thickening is most likely pulmonary edema, though in this patient on chemotherapy accompanying atypical infection would be difficult to exclude.
Progression of metastatic disease is felt less likely given the time course.
Tiny left apical subsegmental pulmonary embolus of questionable clinical significance.
Stable mediastinal and hilar metastatic disease  -LENIs ([**2112-6-27**]): No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] is a 71-year-old woman with h/o metastatic breast cancer and known chronic pleural effusion (has bilateral Pleurex catheters, gets drained QOD), who p/w 2 weeks of worsening SOB and hypoxia.
She had persistent hypoxia and a trapped right lung, for which further intervention could not be undertaken.
During this hospitalization, she made a transition to defer further aggressive treatment or diagnostics and was transitioned to comfort measures.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # SOB and Hypoxia: This was likely due to an increase in her malignant effusions, as well as trapped right lung.
She does have notable h/o recurrent bilateral malignant pleural effusions with bilateral pleurx catheters - s/p right sided Pleurx on [**2112-4-11**] and left sided PleurX on [**2112-4-20**].
She was also found to have a PNA (had new GGO's on CT chest), and was treated with vanc, cefepime and azithro which was subsequently changes to levofloxacin.
Per IP, there was no further intervention possible for her trapped lung, as well as PTX and loculations.
# Goals of care and symptom control: Given her metastatic disease and trapped right lung refractory to medical interventions, the decision was made to pursue comfort-focused care after a family meeting.
CHRONIC/INACTIVE ISSUES:  # Metastatic breast CA: At admission, pt on weekly taxol 80mg/m2 C3D12.
# Afib/flutter: occurred during pericardial window.
