Left atrial abnormality.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy and possible biventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities with probable prolonged QTc interval, although is difficult to measure - are non-specific but could be due to intraventricular conduction delay, left ventricular hypertrophy, drug/electrolyte,metabolic effect or possible ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2161-7-22**] the rate is slower and ST-T wave changes are less prominent   [**2162-1-19**] 12:39 AMCHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of:Stable cardiomegaly.
