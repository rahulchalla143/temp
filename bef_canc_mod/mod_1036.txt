The abdominal CT showed inflammation, edema of the entire small bowel and colon, and a thrombus in the mesenteric vein and portal vein.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion.
It was consistent with a transudate.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an EF of 30% and global hypokinesis with 2+ MR.  A Swan was performed which showed PA pressures of 30/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 with poor wave output.
Diverticulitis, status post sigmoid resection in [**2145-3-20**] with a diverting colostomy which was reversed in [**2145-11-20**].
Allergic rhinitis.
