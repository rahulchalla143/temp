You were admitted for infection in your legs and you were also found to have low blood pressure requiring brief care in the intensive care unit.
We made the following changes to your medication: We STARTED Vancomycin - 1 g every 8 hours for leg infection to be taken for 9 more days - last day is [**12-5**].
We STOPPED torsemide because of low blood pressure - this medication may need restarted if you begin to have more swelling in your legs or abdomen We STARTED oxycontin and oxycodone for pain -> these are very powerful pain medications and you should take the lowest possible dose necessary.
