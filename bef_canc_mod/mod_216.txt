The patient has had an increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.1, and hyperkalemia to 5.8, noted on his laboratories over the last two weeks.
The patient reports increased fatigue over the last week.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to have difficulty breathing.
Chest x-ray revealed dense opacities of the lower two-thirds of the left lung.
Chest CT revealed large areas of collapse on the left, with peribronchial opacity noted.
Abdominal cuts showed extremely large sigmoid colon, rectum which was dilated and filled with stool, and the maximum diameter was about 24 cm.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, with an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% on an echocardiogram done in [**4-1**] 2.
Renal cell cancer status post left partial nephrectomy in [**2128**], left RFA in [**8-2**] 4.
History of panhypopituitarism due to pituitary adenoma 5.
History of deep venous thrombosis, on Coumadin 8.
Hypertension 9.
Diabetes mellitus 10.
History of atrial fibrillation status post DCCV 11.
History of lower gastrointestinal bleed due to rectal ulcer 12.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.5 13.
Hypercholesterolemia 14.
Spinal stenosis with a T10 compression fracture  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 25 mg once daily, NPH 24/6, Cozaar 25 mg once daily, Ambien as needed, amiodarone 200 mg daily at bedtime, Androgel, aspirin 81 mg once daily, Coumadin 5 mg once daily, famotidine, Lipitor, prednisone 7.5 mg once daily, Synthroid.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, mucous membranes moist.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Respiratory:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, decreased air movement at the bases, no dullness to percussion, no tactile fremitus.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented x 3, no gross deficits.
Urinalysis negative.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, no change from baseline, no ST or T wave changes.
Chest x-ray revealed a large left-sided opacity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was electively sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated and started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were taken that revealed only oropharyngeal flora.
The patient had a bronchoscopy which was done, which revealed mucous plugging.
The patient did well in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was followed by Surgery due to his problems with dilated colon and persistent stool in the bowels.
One day after his discharge out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he developed problems with persistent tachypnea.
A chest x-ray was done, which revealed elevated left hemidiaphragm with very large dilated colon pressing up against the left lung.
It was thought at that time that the patient's removal of his rectal tube probably caused increased abdominal distention and distention o his colon, which impinged his already tenuous pulmonary status.
It was thought at that time that the patient's decompensation was probably due to his acute renal failure and his inability for his kidneys to compensate for his pulmonary difficulties.
He was taken off his ACE, which had been put on in the Medical Intensive Care Unit since there was a concern that his hyperkalemia and his acute renal failure would return.
The patient returned to the floor, did quite well, was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] from Pulmonary, who recommended an outpatient sleep study since he thought that the patient had a flail chest status post his sternotomy and his wound dehiscence at that area.
The patient's heart rate remained under good control, between 80s and 90s off the amiodarone, and he did not have any events of tachycardia or arrhythmias.
The patient did quite well, and ambulated the day prior to discharge without oxygen, and had very little oxygen requirement.
Dilated aigmoid colon 2.
Acute renal failure 3.
