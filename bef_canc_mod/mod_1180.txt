The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and inferior wall hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Tricuspid annuloplasty ring insitu with no TR or perivalular leaks.

Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with a patent LIMA and SVG-OM.
SVG-RCA with 70% ostial and distal anastomosis lesions.
Echo revealed EF 45%, moderate to severe MR, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Non-invasive carotid exam reveals no stenoses bilaterally.
He was brought to the Operating Room on [**2148-2-7**] where the he underwent redo sternotomy, mitral replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty.
A CT of the chest was performed prior to discharge for further characterization of the LLL pulmonary nodule which was likely unchanged allowing for technique.
He developed brief, controlled rate atrial fibrillation and Coumadin was begun with a goal INR of [**1-9**].5.
