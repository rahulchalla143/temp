Admission Date:  [**2133-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-4-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-5-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Vancomycin / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain - initial presenting complaint Abdominal pain - developed during hospitalization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization -- [**2133-4-1**] Exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic transverse and left colon and spleen -- [**2133-4-5**]   History of Present Illness: Per Cardiology Service: 78 yo woman with a PMH of CAD, s/p CABG and PCI, CHF (systolic), s/p BiV-ICD, AF, DM, HTN, HC, hypothyroidism, CKD, and breast cancer s/p mastectomy in the 80's presents with chest pain.
Later in the morning she was at [**Hospital **] clinic for a regular appointment when she noted sudden onset [**8-7**] dull chest pain that radiated to her left arm and back.
This was associated with mild SOB and lightheadedness when pain was at its worst, but no nausea, vomiting, change in vision or diaphoresis.
She affirms that this pain and lightheadedness is very similar to her prior presentations, including this [**Month (only) 956**].
Of note, per her Cardiologist, the patient has chronic chest discomfort, which awakens her at night and is always present.
There is no exacerbation with her minimal physical activity and it can last for up to hours at a time.
She does not note any exacerbation with food intake and differentiates this from her typical "heartburn," which is more of a burning sensation in the mid chest.
She was hospitalized in late [**Month (only) 956**] with left-sided chest pain and black stool.
Troponins were negative, no EKG changes.
During that admission EGD revealed no bleeding but did show candidal esophageal infection.
She was seen in the ED on [**3-10**] for chest pain, again cardiac enzymes negative.
Pharmacologic stress test showed no change and she was d/c without admission.
She last saw her cardiologist on [**3-19**] for a post-discharge visit at which time she was noted to be volume overloaded.
She also complained of chronic chest pain at that time, and anti-fungal treatment with fluconazole was recommended.
Per clinic notes, she reported chest pain in late [**Month (only) 958**] ([**3-25**], [**3-26**]) and requested additional NTG tablets.
By her report she uses these tablets perhaps once a week, 2-3 tablets per chest pain episode.
She does not believe that the pace of her chest pain worsened over [**Month (only) 958**].
On [**3-26**] she complained of weakness and her VNA noted she was pale; she also notes that about this time she started to have increased dyspnea on exertion, such that walking shorter distances caused her to be short of breath.
Prior to this time she could walk from her apartment to her car without dyspnea, but in the last week she could no longer do this.
On [**3-31**] her VNA reported volume overload and her Lasix was restarted at 40mg daily.
EKG showed ST depressions in V1 and V2, troponin < 0.01.
No intervention was performed.
On arrival to the floor, patient complains of a sensation of urinary urgency, but denies chest pain or dyspnea.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Positive for orthopnea (wedge and pillow, unchanged), feeling cold, lightheadedness on standing.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

# CORONARIES:  History of prior IMI, CABG in [**2106**], subsequent stenting to SVG to PDA and anterograde limb of PDA.
The chronicity of this occlusion is uncertain, and she had no cardiac enzyme elevation.
She has a history of chronic chest pain, thought to be both of cardiac and non-cardiac origin.
Lisinopril was held for two days due to acute kidney injury (see below).
# PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure, infarct mediated, ejection fraction 30% status post biventricular ICD: NYHA III.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema and trace effusions.
Home Lasix was initially continued, then held for two days due to acute kidney injury (see below).
Ranolazine was started [**4-3**] in an attempt to reduce her chronic chest pain.
# Post-cath bleeding:  When the sheath was pulled [**4-1**], the patient had a small hematoma and 50 cc blood loss.
Pressure was held and the hematoma pressed out, groin was soft without hematoma on [**4-2**].
No Hct loss, VSS.
No need for ultrasound given normal clinical appearance.
At 0430 she suddenly developed explosive brown diarrhea with urgency, frequency, and associated abdominal pain.
At 0700 she began to have tachycardia to the low 100s (rate usually controlled to 60-70s).
Diarrhea continued through the morning, patient became clinically dehydrated with BP down to 80s/40s.
KUB showed sign of either cecal volvulus or ischemic colitis with distension, no sign of perforation.
Lactate elevated to 5.9, lactic acidosis with venous pH 7.32.
Due to the patient's hypotension, volume loss, and acidemia, she was transferred to MICU for monitored resuscitation.
# Candidial esophagitis and GERD:  EGD in [**2133-1-28**] showed no bleeding, but did find candidal infection causing esophagitis.
Patient also complains of chronic GERD.
Unclear if she completed fluconazole for candidial esophagitis, although at admission she had no thrush and no globus sensation.
# Blurred vision:  The patient states that she noted slight blurring of her vision the morning of [**4-1**], but this has now resolved.
No associated neuro signs.
# UA:  UA showed trace leuks, few bacteria.
Patient complained of some urinary frequency and burning.
# AoCKD:  baseline Cr 1.6-1.8 with Mild hypercalcemia due to renally-derived secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Inactive issues: # Hyperlipidemia: continued statin as above, held fish oil (not available on formulary) # Anemia:  Baseline Hb 10.
No evidence of bleeding.
Transitional Issues: - monitor digoxin levels, particularly in light of renal failure - ongoing surveillance of renal function - continue to emphasize appropriate and continued medication use .
Surgery Hospital Course: 78F with multiple medical/surgical comorbidities as described above.
The ACS service was consulted on [**2133-4-5**] for acute abdominal pain with distension and copious diarrhea that began hours after patient had received kayexalate for treatment of hyperkalemia on [**2133-4-4**].
Her symptoms persisted and she was reportedly hypotensive and tachycardic briefly but responded to IV fluid boluses on morning of [**2133-4-5**].
A KUB was done that demonstrated markedly distended cecum, without evidence of distal colonic decompression and raised the possibility of intermittent cecal volvulus.
On physical exam at this time, her abdomen was soft but moderately distended and diffusely moderately tender, right abdomen greater than left but there was no rebound.
She continued to have diarrhea that was heme positive but non-melanotic or grossly bloody.
The patient understood that she was a high-risk operative candidate for morbidity and mortality given her numerous comorbidities and poor cardiac and renal functions.
The scan demonstrated no evidence to suggest cecal volvulus but there were fluid-filled loops of small bowel suggestive of enteritis along with mild nonspecific thickening of the wall of the left colon which could be secondary to infectious causes or ischemic colitis.
At this juncture, it was felt that this was possibly a pseudoobstructive picture of the colon and GI was consulted for colonoscopy for further evaluation of the colonic mucosa along with potential endoscopic decompression.
Chemical decompression was not attempted given the patient's significant history of cardiac dysrrhythmias.
However, she had some intermittent episodes of hypotension to SBP 90's along with tachycardia and was transferred to the MICU (no available SICU beds) with surgery following closely.
GI was unable to visualize colonic mucosa secondary to copious amounts of stool and attempted to decompression the colon with moderate effect.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
Her exam post-procedure demonstrated a softer, less distended abdomen and mildly less tender.
Her stool started to appear more blood-tinged and her coagulation panel returned with markedly elevated INR 4.5 and PTT 150, which was not compatible with a picture of possible supratherapeutic pradaxa levels.
A concern for a comsumptive coagulopathy was raised and a DIC panel was sent (which eventually returned normal).
Informed consent was obtained from him given that the patient was somewhat somnolent from recent pain medications.
The patient became increasingly unstable and was transferred to the operating room emergently where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, resection of ischemic transverse and left colon and spleen.
At this time, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had already been in contact with the patient's son and she explained to him his mother's critical condition and her son wished to continue resuscitation as needed.
The patient was briefly stabilized for transfer to the SICU but shortly after arrival, she went into VTach with loss of BP, ACLS protocol was initiated again and a blood pressure was recovered.
Her son also declined an autopsy due to personal/religious reasons.
