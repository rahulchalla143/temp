Bilateral pleural effusions remain, left greater than right, with perhaps small decrease in the size of both.
Suture material is seen in the right upper lung, most likely corresponding with the prior history of right upper lobectomy.
IMPRESSION: No significant changes in bibasilar atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, slightly decreased since prior study.

In summary she had Mitral valve replacement(mechanical)Coronary bypass grafting x3 with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending with jump obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and a concomitant left carotid endarterectomy.
The patient was hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op peroid however several attemts to wake and wean sedation were met with increasing hypertension and agitation, she was therefore resedated and ventilated throughout the operative night.
Once extubated she had an uneventful post-operative course however she stayed in the ICU for several additional days for hemodynamic, neurologic and pulmonary monitoring.
Diuresis along with chest physiotherapy TID and inhalers were continued with improvement evident.
