Admission Date:  [**2115-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-2-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-4-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Neupogen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2115-2-14**] Non-tunneled hemodialysis line placement [**2115-2-22**] Tunneled hemodialysis line placement   History of Present Illness: 64 year old man with history of cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2109**] after acute tubular necrosis from a viral gastroenteritis whose kidney function has been slowly worsening of the past year who presents with shortness of breath for 1 week.
Patient reports cough and shortness of breath, mainly with extertion for the past week.
The symptoms started with runny noise and the patient thought he had a cold.
He notice dyspnea on extertion when he was walking from his car to his house, a distance he is normally able to do without difficulty.
He also has noted this dry cough, worse at night that makes him sit up off the side of the bed.
He denies any chest pain or history of chest pain with extertion.
He also denies recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation.
He has noticed a progressive decrease in his urine output over the past year but no acute change recently.
The patient was also recently admitted at [**Hospital3 2568**] for a similar progressive shortness of breath.
It was thought due to his worsening renal function.
He denies any associated chest pain, weakness, dizziness, or palpitations.
#Pericardial Effusion - s/p drainage, unclear etiology .
#Kidney Disease - ESRD from ATN in setting of acute gastroenteritis, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2109**], worsening renal function over the last year.

Used to work as a spray painter  Family History: History of CAD, cancer, MS  Physical Exam: Vitals: 96.9, 132/80, 92, 20, 97% on 4L GEN: Coughing repeatedly during interview with moderate distress, some difficulty completing sentences because of coughing HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, Clear OP with MMM Neck: no LAD, JVP difficutly to assess because of girth CV: [**Last Name (un) 3526**] [**Last Name (un) 3526**], otherwise heart sounds difficutly to interpret because of loud ronchi Lungs: diffuse ronchi throughout lung fields, few crackles apparent at bases ABD: +BS nt nd, soft, obese, large irregular ventral hernia appreciated Ext: [**1-9**]+ peripheral edema, r>l, erythema of right leg but without significant warmth or tenderness, some bruising at right ankle.
======= STUDIES ======= UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2115-2-12**] RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The exam is technically limited, because pain limited the patient's ability to tolerate compression of the superficial femoral vein at its mid and distal portions.
Color flow and Doppler [**Name (NI) 108683**], without compression, were obtained for the mid and distal right superficial femoral vein.
If clinical concern persists, followup exam can be performed following appropriate pain control.
AP PORTABLE CHEST [**2115-2-12**] The study is limited secondary to AP portable technique and body habitus.
The cardiomediastinal configuration remains markedly enlarged but stable.
There is no superimposed edema or consolidation evident.
No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Again noted and slightly exaggerated is a dextroconcave curvature of the thoracic spine likely at least in part positional.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes; however, no focal consolidation seen.
ECG Study Date of [**2115-2-12**] Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Diffuse low voltage.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-14**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2115-2-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2109-10-22**], cardiac rhythm now atrial fibrillation; no pericardial effusion seen; otherwise findings similar.
Bibasilar atelectasis are again seen, slightly worsened on today's examination with a lower lung volume than before.
Small bilateral pleural effusion have not changed.
There is cardiomegaly along with minimal vascular congestion.
Lower lung volume with more prominent bibasilar atelectasis.
No pulmonary embolism.
There is CT evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
There appear to be centrilobular nodules, ground- glass opacity and atelectasis.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Rounded hypodense liver lesions are not fully characterized on this study but not appear greatly changed from [**2109-12-2**].
Right lower quadrant renal transplant.
Right flank ecchymosis and focal right abdominal wall muscular enlargement, possibly representing a hematoma.
This muscle enlarged should be followed to complete resolution to exclude an underlying mass.
The left brachial artery is patent with triphasic waveforms.
There is respiratory phasicity of the left subclavian venous waveform.
Generalized low voltage.
Delayed precordial R wave progression - cannot exclude anterior myocardial infarction.
Generalized non-specific repolarization changes most marked anteroseptally and laterally consistent with ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-2-13**] anteroseptal T wave inversions are new.
[**2115-2-18**] Blood Culture (4 BOTTLES):    NO GROWTH FINAL.
CULTURE CONFIRMATION PENDING.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS The patient's respiratory distress was likely multifactorial due to volume overload and RSV infection (by nasopharyngeal aspirate).
In the MICU, the patient was also determined to have chronic CO2 retention likely secondary to obstructive sleep apnea given his habitus.
COPD exacerbation, was discontinued given lack of improvement and no known COPD (not a smoker).
CT chest was negative for pulmonary embolism.
However, wheezing persisted and low O2 saturations (~91% room air) persisted after significant volume removal.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate showed patient had an RSV infection.
Supportive care was provided for viral pulmonary infection.
By the time the HSV culture returned ([**2-27**]), the patient's respiratory status was at baseline; no antiviral for HSV was felt to be indicated.
END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS See above.
For renal transplant, continued low dose prednisone, and cyclosporine was decreased to 25 mg daily.
Venogram was performed in anticipation of outpatient fistula placement.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion and re-presented in atrial fibrillation in the setting of metabolic derangements and fluid overload.
Of note, diltiazem elevates cyclosporin which could be problem[**Name (NI) 115**] in this patient.
In the future if respiratory distress deemed not to be related, beta blocker may provide more cardiac benefit and also does not have cross reaction with cyclosporin; defer to outpatient PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] cards, no cardioversion was indicated during this admission as the patient could not lie flat for procedure, which would require TEE.
He was in atrial fibrillation through admission with adequate rate control upon discharge.
ACIDEMIA The patien presented with mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
Respiratory component possibly due to CO2 retention (OSA vs obesity hypoventilation syndrome vs COPD); AG metabolic acidosis due to his renal failure.
