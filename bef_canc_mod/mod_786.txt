Biatrial enlargement and new T wave inversion in lead aVL with dissociated ST-T wave flattening in lead I.

Brief Hospital Course: A/p 20 yo F with ESRD on HD who p/w hypertensive crisis and has new onset seizure .
In light of her complaints of chest pain we were reassured by her ECG and by her flat cardiac enzymes.
2) New onset seizure We thought that her new onset seizures were probably due to her severely elevated blood pressure but other diagnoses including lupus cerbritis were also considered.
It demonstrated abnormal T2 and FLAIR signal within both occipital and parietal lobes in a pattern suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
We consulted the rheumatology service who thought that her presentation was more consistent with hypertensive encephalopathy rather lupus cerebritis.
With dilantin loading and control of her blood pressure she did not have a recurrence of her seizures.
5) Knee Pain: On the day of discharge the patient complained of L knee pain.
She was instructed to use tylenol prn for pain and to return o the clinic or emergency room should she develop worsening knee pain, fevers or chills.
