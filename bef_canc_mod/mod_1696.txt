tracheostomy/percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement [**2171-12-12**]   History of Present Illness: This 69 year old female with dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 20-25%, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis presented for right and left heart cardiac cath in the setting of prorressively worsening dyspnea and fatigue.
Her dyspnea  has progressively worsened over the last few weeks.
She was referred for a right and left side heart cath.
Her cardiac catheterization showed left main disease w/70-80% occlusion, LAD 50% and Circ 99%.
Her recent echo also showed dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, probable aortic stenosis w/ mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Hodgkins Lymphoma [**2139**] with Radiotherapy, splenectomy.
Hypothyroidism Anxiety   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: Pt lives with husband Lives with:Husband Occupation: Owned a shoe business with her husband.
Retired teacher Cigarettes: Smoked no Other Tobacco use:denies ETOH: < 1 drink/week Illicit drug use:denies   Family History: Mother with hypertension  Physical Exam: VS: T= 98 BP= 107/68 HR= 100 RR= 16 O2 sat= 98% 2L GENERAL: NAD, mildly tachpneic with accessory work of breathing.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout precordium.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp with decreased volumes.
Crackles at bases with intermittent wheezes as well.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominal bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: Right leg wound with superficial ulceration.
No thrombus in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
I Conclusions PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
All mid-papillary segments except for the anterior and anterolateral segments appear severely hypokinetic.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral leaflets fail to coapt, leading to severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
This is likely due to LV dilation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There are no paravalvular leaks.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is mild mitral stenosis with mean gradient of 4mmHg across the mitral valve.
The tricuspid regurgitation remains moderate.
Her JVD returned to near normal, breathing much easier, and she was no longer tachypneic.
Additionally she underwent cardiac catheterization for preoperative evaluation [**11-12**] and was found to have coronary artery disease, she had no chest pain preoperatively.
She had a dental consult and subsequently had teeth extracted on[**11-17**] in preparation for valve surgery.
She had a right leg ulcer on her shin from traumatic injury over one month ago.
Dermatology performed a biopsy with cultures growing out pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
The wound does not appear infected with clean base and edges.
Additionally surgery was delayed due to increased creatinine which peaked at 2.1 on [**1-19**] with BUN 39, the diuretic was held over the next few days and creatinine decreased to 1.6 on [**11-20**] and she was taken to the Operating Room.
She underwent aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair, and coronary artery bypass graft.
She remained intubated overnight due to hemodynamic instability and was able to be weaned and extubated on post operative day one.
She went into a rapid atrial fibrillation and given an Amiodarone bolus and drip on POD#3.
Hydralazine was started for afterload reduction as blood pressure tolerated (ACE-I was not started due to increased creatinine.)
Coumadin was initiated and she was anticoagulated to a goal of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical AVR and afib.
She was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip due to CXR showing pulmonary edema and respiratory issues.
She was taken off the Lasix drip and started on Spironolactone due to her heart failure.
Pleural chest tubes remained in place due to high serous drainage for several days post op.
She had a poor oral intake and she was given Glucerna for additional nutrition support.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of her strength and mobility.
For two days on the step down unit Ms.[**Known lastname 13534**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**]  worsening renal function and failure to thrive.
She was ultimately reintubated secondary to pulmonary edema and requiring pressor support on [**11-30**].
Nephrology was consulted for acute renal failure with rising creatinine.
GI was consulted for c. diff colitis and GI bleed.
A PPI drip was continued along with supportive care.
Electrophysiology was consulted for evaluation and management of heart failure and for possible BiV pacemaker, which will be reevaluated as an outpatient.
After several days of failure to wean on the ventilator, Thoracic surgery was consulted for Trach and PEG.
Her amiodarone was increased for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ultimately on POD# 21 she converted back into normal sinus rhythm.
She was tolerating one and a half hour trach collar trials at this time.
