Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed significant obstructive two vessel disease.
The LAD revealed discrete mid 70-80% and distal 70% stenoses, with its proximal D1 branch exhibiting 70% stenosis and D2 branch with diffuse disease up to 70%.
The LCx revealed a mid-vessel 40% lesion, with its OM3 branch exhibiting a 30-40% stenosis proximal to the widely patent stent.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Chest pain non-reproducible LUNGS: CTA B/L, good inspiratory effort, no wheezes, crackles, or rales ABD: soft, nt, nd, NABS EXT: warm, dry.
EKG demonstrated V-paced, no significant change compared with prior dated 8/[**2109**].
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2108-10-31**] demonstrated: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall  left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed EF 40-45%.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild  pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is  seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No neck, arm, back, or chest discomforts were reported throughout the procedure.
The EKG was uninterpretable due to the presence of a paced rhythm.
These demonstrated significant left ventricular systolic  dysfunction with global hypokinesis to akinesis.
Focused Doppler demonstrated  trace aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared  with a prior study from [**2100-9-10**] (baseline for exercise echo), there has been a significant deterioration in left ventricular function.
At peak dobutamine stress [40 mcg/kg/min; heart rate = 69 bpm, blood pressure  = 158/76 mmHg), there was persistent augmentation of the basal  inferoposterolateral wall and anterior wall.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2103**]: Right dominant system revealed significant obstructive two vessel disease.
The LAD revealed discrete mid 70-80% and distal 70% stenoses, with its proximal D1 branch exhibiting 70% stenosis and D2 branch with diffuse disease up to 70%.
The LCx revealed a mid-vessel 40% lesion, with its OM3 branch exhibiting a 30-40% stenosis proximal to the widely patent stent.
Left ventriculography revealed a moderately severe anterolateral and apical hypokinesis, with posterobasal and inferior akinesis.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
There is a left-sided pacemaker with leads in standard position.
The thoracic aorta is somewhat tortuous, but unchanged given differences in technique.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of a small effusion.
No pulmonary vascular congestion is appreciated.
There are linear opacities also in the right mid lung and left base consistent with atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Small left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
No definite change in the cardiac or mediastinal contour from prior studies given differences in technique.
CXR PA and lat [**10-11**]: Small left pleural effusion is confirmed, and there is also a probable very small right posterior effusion.
Minor bibasilar atelectasis is present.
Persantine MIBI [**10-11**]: 1) Mild inferior wall defect likely representing attenuation.
2) Moderate global hypokinesis and biventricular dilation with ejection fraction of 35%.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cardiac Patient presented with chest pain that was not typical of ischemic pain, but given his significant history of coronary disease, he was treated as a possible acute coronary syndrome.
The day after presentation, the patient received a persantine MIBI which was found to have EF of 35% and a mild inferior wall defect thought to be secondary to attenuation.
The patient has known chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure with an EF of 40%; he was euvolemic throughout his admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also has a h/o AV block and AFib s/p PPM; he was monitored on telemetry and had no significant events during his admission.
# Acute renal failure Patient has baseline creatinine 1.0-1.4, found to be 1.7 on admission.
# Anemia Patient has a chronic macrocytic anemia, and his hematocrit was at his baseline (25-31).
He reported that his PCP is aware of his anemia and has been working him up.
# Hypertension Patient's carvedilol was continued.
# Back pain- Patient complained of chronic back pain, for which he receives percocet at home.
He did receive some percocet for this pain during his admission.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for back pain.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: chest pain Secondary Diagnoses: CAD, cardiomyopathy with EF 40% by echo in [**2108**], sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker in [**2100**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, spinal stenosis, chornic low back pain   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile with stable vital signs, chest pain free.
You were evaluated with blood tests and a stress test and found not to have had a heart attack.
You had a chest xray that showed some fluid outside your lung (a pleural effusion) on the left side.
