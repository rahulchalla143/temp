History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 67M with colon CA s/p colostomy and recurrent enterocutaneous fistula admitted with 2 days of copious rectal drainage.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 49563**] for septic shock from ascending cholangitis, E. Coli bacteremia c/b liver abscesses s/p IR drainage [**9-16**], HAP, hypoxemic resp failure, ATN requiring CVVH, rapid afib/flutter s/p DCCV and GI bleed.
Underwent ERCP and CBD stent [**9-16**] to treat obstruction in the lower third of the biliary tree felt to be from stone or stricture.
EGD and C-scope [**10-10**] showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small erosion/ulceration of the skin at the anal anastamosis with evidence of oozing.
Presented to [**Hospital3 5097**] with 2 days of a report of increased rectal output.
Surgery compared OSH CT to our prior images and felt that anastamotic leak was old with just increased output now, and recommended conservative management given his poor surgical candidacy.
On the floor, patient has no complaints.
He does endorse intermittent fever, chills, and mild intermittent diffuse abdominal discomfort over the past few days.
He does not think that his ostomy output or rectal drainage has changed in quantity.
He states that he was told he has a viral infection but that a cause could not be found.

Ulcerated non-mobile complex atheroma in the descending aorta at the esophageal level of 35 cm from the gum line  CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE  [**2194-11-7**] Following this, an 8 French catheter was then introduced into the collection under CT fluoroscopic guidance using via trocar technique.
[**11-14**] CT ABD/Pelvis - report pending  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated history including hx of metastatic rectal cancer s/p multiple surgeries including colostomy, and probable neoadjuvant chemo and XRT, and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, recurrent enterocutaneous fistula, and clear cell RCC (s/p partial nephrectomy), was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cholangitis c/b liver abscesses (drained last admission), septic shock, respiratory failure (intubated).
Pt presented 12 days later with complaints of copius rectal drainage, hypotension, and sepsis which appears to be due fungemia.
During this admission, pt was also noted to have a signficant fluid collection in the pelvis, which is now s/p IR drainage.
#Sepsis/fungemia: Pt presented with increased amounts of output from his colostomy, with history of severe C. diff and was on chronic Abx therapy.
He also had noted recent hepatic abscess as well as PICC line in place (concern for line sepsis) and multiple ostomys and enterocutaneous fistula as sources of possible infection.
He was intially started on daptomycin (history of VRE rectal abscess) and zosyn for empiric coverage of intra-abdominal process.
In addition, he was started on IV flagyl and PO Vancomycin for empiric coverage of C. diff.
ERCP was consulted for possible cholangitis secondary to elevated LFT's in setting of recent procedure and septic picture.
TTE had worsening aortic regurge and concern for valvular vegetation so TEE was done, which was negative for vegetations.
TEE revealed large deep ulceration of an aortic plaque.
# Cholangitis/Liver abscess/Presacral fluid collection: Pt was known to have liver abscesses from cholangitis from his previous hospitalization.
However, after discontinuation, pt  developed increased temperature and clinical instability (HR to 130's).
Discussed pt's presacral abscess with ID attending at length, and it appears that this pocket may pose significant challenges.
It appears that this infected area likely communicates with bowel, and thus there is likely no endpoint to antibiotic therapy, however, antibiotics obviously can not be continued indefinately.
JP drain for pelvic abscess now with no outpt since [**11-11**].
It was unclear if pocket resolved or if drain no longer accessing pocket, so another CT scan was obtained which showed enlarged peri=rectal fluid collection.
Case was re-discussed with surgery - who felt that the fluid collection represented stool output from fistula to small or large bowel,and that patient was not a surgical candidate for correction of this.
Pip/tazo was discontinued on [**11-17**], and patient did not have any fevers off antibiotics.
Patient also with brown discharge from urethra, and this, too, is felt to represent fluid from the per-rectal fluid collection.
Pt later became tachycardic on the floor after discontinuation of Pip/Tazo, and his diltiazem was uptitrated with improvement in his HR.
chronic cholecystitis:  Ab ct showed large fluid collection in the liver, so patient was initially scheduled for IR drainage of this collection.
However, re-examination of the images revealed that patient had markedly appearing gallbladder.
Gallbladder has appeared abnormal in many past radiological images over the years, but now appeared even worse, raising suspicion for necrotic gallbladder or chronic cholecystitis.
Patient without RUQ pain whatsoever, no fevers, normal wbc count - all off zosyn.
He was watched for 72 hours off abx, and had no symptoms.
The gallbladder abnormality may represent gallbladder CA or adenomyosis of the gallbladder.
#Acute on chronic renal failure - appeared pre-renal; resolved with fluids.
#Microcytic anemia - hct at baseline, but pt was guaiac positive so there was concern that there may be some bleeding for gastritis or duodenitis noticed on previous EGD.
#Ulcerated aortic ulcer/plaque - During TEE, pt was incidentally noted to have an ulcerated plaque on his aorta.
# GOALS OF CARE:  During patient ICU course there were lengthy conversations with SW and with multiple medical teams.
Palliative care consulted via ICU, and had multiple meetings with the patient.
Patient feels that he has had multiple medical challenges over the years, and has overcome all of them.
He was counselled that the gallbladder may still represent occult infection and cancer, and that the peri-rectal fluid collection of stool may also become problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
We reviewed that he has had multiple infections and complications of treatment.
# DVT Prophylaxis: heparin SQ TID   Medications on Admission: 1. amoxicillin-pot clavulanate 875-125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 5 weeks.

6. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for sleep.
12. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times  a day) as needed for watery stools in ostomy.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 169**] [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: # Sepsis/fungemia; [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) glabrata # Presacral fluid collection secondary to fistulous connection with bowel - drain placed # Atrial flutter with [**Female First Name (un) 5509**] # Ulcerated aortic ulcer/plaque # Abnormal appearing gallbladder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood pressure and large amounts of drainage from your rectum.
You were also found to have a signficant collection of stool in your pelvis, next to your recturm, for which Interventional Radiology placed a drain.
