Admission Date:  [**2183-10-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-10-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2125-3-28**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**] East  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint is dyspnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and increased cholesterol who presents with a 2-month history of malaise, increased shortness of breath, cough, and now fevers and chills at home for the past two days.
Over the past two months she has been fatigued with a mild cough.
She has been treated with erythromycin for a upper respiratory infection approximately one and a half months ago.
She continues with cough productive with brown sputum, pleuritic chest pain with cough, and has been feeling better than over the past week.
She has had increased fatigue and increased sputum with blood tinges in the sputum.
Two days ago, she became significantly short of breath and febrile at home.
Coronary artery disease; status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2179**].
Status post hip fracture in [**2182-5-31**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes.
No jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the left base.
Dullness to percussion at the left base.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
No effusion, and no cephalization.
Poor R wave progression, and 1-mm ST elevations in V1 through V3, and 0.5-mm ST depressions in II.
New T wave flattening since [**2182-5-31**].
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonia.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have electrocardiogram changes compared to her previous electrocardiogram back in [**2182-5-31**].
It was felt that this troponin leak in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia was most likely a rate work related response and not necessarily thrombotic.
A further workup of her troponin leak was not performed secondary to her pneumonia and will need to be followed up for possible outpatient stress test for further evaluation.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have a baseline creatinine of around 1 and was noted to have an elevation in her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ratio on admission.
A urine sodium was drawn which revealed a value of 14; suggesting a prerenal picture.
Her lower extremity edema continued to improve.
A 24-hour urine was collected to measure the amount of protein and albumin excreted which revealed an elevated albumin to creatinine ratio; suggesting that nephrotic syndrome may have been contributing to her lower extremity edema.
She was to have close followup with her primary care physician within the next two weeks to further monitor her renal function.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have an abrupt drop in her hematocrit after hydration from a value of 35.4 down to a nadir of 26.6.
There was no indication of hemolysis during this decrease in her hematocrit, and no further issues were seen with regard to her anemia.
The patient to follow up with her primary care physician within two weeks; at which time her renal function will again be monitored, as well as further evaluation of her lower extremity edema and volume status.
Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
