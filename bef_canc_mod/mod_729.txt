Admission Date:  [**2157-2-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-3-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-3-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardothoracic Service  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 47-year-old woman with a possible history of rheumatic heart disease as a child, and an atrial septal defect repair in [**2133**], had a history of palpitations and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.
In [**2156-11-13**], she was admitted to an outside hospital with congestive heart failure, and the sotalol was discontinued at that time.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate left atrial dilatation, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
In addition, to a mitral valve replacement she has a possible tricuspid valve replacement as well as a Maze procedure and plus or minus tieing off of a left atrial appendage.
Atrial fibrillation times four to five years, status post transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion.
Congestive heart failure.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy, supple.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular, a [**1-19**] holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex.
Extremities were warm with no edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Echocardiogram from [**1-11**] showed a normal ejection fraction with 4+ mitral regurgitation, mild left atrial dilatation, dilated right ventricle, hypokinetic right ventricular systolic dysfunction, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension.
No atrial septal defect.
Electrocardiogram at the time of admission showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 55, normal axis, T wave flipped in III and F, T wave inversions in V1 through V3, and flipped in V4 and V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2-10**], the patient was brought to the operating room at which time she underwent a mitral valve replacement and a tricuspid valve repair.
Checking her underlying rhythm at that time showed only P waves with no ventricular escape.
On the morning of postoperative one, in checking the patient's underlying rhythm it was noted that she was in complete heart block with a ventricular escape in the 30s.
Because she had no underlying rhythm, she remained in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day three, it was noted that the patient was in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 80s.
The echocardiogram showed normal valvular function with no evidence of pericardial effusion at that time.
The Electrophysiology Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to evaluate for permanent pacemaker, and Hematology was consulted to evaluate anemia without any obvious bleeding source.
The Electrophysiology Service wanted to wait until the patient's respiratory and hematologic issues were resolved, and the Hematology Service felt that her anemia was possibly due to a delayed transfusion reaction.
Over the next several days, the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit as she continued to have complete heart block while awaiting for evaluation for a permanent pacemaker.
The patient was also noted to have a climb in a white blood cell count.
In summary, the patient had a dual-mode, dual-pacing, dual-sensing pacemaker placed without complication.
First heart sound and second heart sound with a loud click.
The incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
Left shoulder incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
