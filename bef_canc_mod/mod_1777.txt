Discharge exam: General: Alert, oriented, tachypneic HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP unable to see due to collar, no LAD CV: tachycardic irregular rate/ rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Diminished at bases with crackles.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, obese, Gtube present without erythema, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: foley  in place, flexiseal in place draining stool Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A&Ox3, CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact Skin: per report: large decubitus ulcer, not visualized due to patient discomfort.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and multifocal ventricular premature contractions.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Generally poor R wave progression suggests prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Diffuse repolarization abnormalities in the limb leads.
Depolarization and repolarization abnormalities are similar.
A moderate-to-severe interstitial abnormality suggests known interstitial lung disease without significant change.
Because of severe background lung abnormality, it is difficult to exclude a superimposed edema or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Similar severe widespread predominantly interstitial  opacification, most confluent at the lung bases; although there is no definite change, subtle superimposed process could be readily obscured by a severe background abnormality.
Low lung volumes with massive bilateral diffusely distributed reticular or reticulonodular opacities.
The presence of small pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No pneumothorax.
# Respiratory distress: Pt initially fit SIRS criteria with tachypnea and leukocytosis.
PNA was suspected by leukocytosis and history of frequent cough, as well as potential aspiration risk.
Pt's sputum culture grew Pseudomonas and received 8 days of meropenem for presumed HCAP.
On the day on his planned discharge ([**6-22**]) he was noted to have secretions which were thought to be [**12-31**] fluid status.
Sputum Cx were sent, however there was low concern for infection given he had finished his 8 day course of meropenem the day prior.
His lasix 40mg IV BID was restarted out of concern for fluid overload.
Of note, on the day of discharge it was noted that his sputum culture had grown Pseudomonas so [**Hospital 100**] Rehab was called and the physician taking care of him there was personally advised to continue Meropenem for a total of two weeks (with a planned stop date of [**2168-6-30**]) in an effort to completely and optimally treat this Pseudomonas.
# C-diff by report: Pt was found to be C. diff toxin positive at previous hospitalization at OSH, and was continued on Flagyl at [**Hospital1 18**] with flexiseal in place.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt's CHADS2 score of 4, but anticoagulation was held initially due to supratherapeutic INR.
His INR was difficult to control likely due to antibiotic therapy and decreased hepatic clearance.
Unsure if this is anemia of chronic disease versus occult bleed from elevated INR.
Guaiac stools were negative and no obvious acute bleeding was found during MICU stay.
# Polymyalgia rheumatica: Was previously treated with prednisone 15mg PO daily, but was never given PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
We discontinued hydroxycholoroquine in the setting of treating pneumonia along with titrating down pt's prednisone from 15mg to 10mg PO daily.
# Type II DM: Pt was on MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 1000 mg PO BID, Pioglitazone 30 mg PO DAILY and NPH 4 Units Breakfast, NPH 4 Units Dinner with ISS pre-admission.
# Hyperlipidemia: unknown control.
# Rash in perianal area: Pt's decubitus wound was dressed with following regimen: Cleanse area around flexiseal with foam cleanser and pat dry.
# Med rec: - Continue Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever/ pain - Hold Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID:PRN constipation - Hold Senna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN constipation - Hold ALPRAZolam 0.25 mg PO TID:PRN anxiety - OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN pain - Hold Albuterol-Ipratropium [**11-30**] PUFF IH Q2H:PRN dyspnea  Transitional Issues: - Complete two weeks of Meropenem (last day [**2168-6-30**]) for Pseudomonas treatment.
- Consider further Prednisone titration if his PMR symptoms are adequately controlled on 10mg q24h - ideally would like to titrate Prednisone off if possible.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever/ pain 20.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever/ pain 2.
Albuterol Inhaler 6 PUFF IH Q4H:PRN dyspnea/ wheeze   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventilator associated pneumonia Interstitial lung disease Clostridium difficile colitis Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Your sputum cultures confirmed that you had a pneumonia and you tolerated the 8 day course of antibiotics very well.
You also had fluid in your lungs which made it difficult for you to breate; we gave you diuretics to help remove this fluid.
