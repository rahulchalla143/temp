Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo M with h/o advanced MS, neurogenic bladder, schizoaffective d/o, hypothyroidism, h/o ex lap for removal of migrated gastrostomy tube from terminal ileum, h/o tracheostomy tube placement [**10-22**], p/w fever and tachycardia from rehab admitted with sepsis.
# Sepsis: Pt meets SIRS criteria with multiple potential sources for fever, including decub ulcer and osteomyelitis (by definition as can probe to bone), urine positive for ESBL klebsiella, and possible pneumonia given copious secretions.
Ultimately it was felt his sepsis was primarily secondary to ESBL urosepsis.
His sputum cultures were contaminated and with multiple epis, he completed a 7 day course of vancomycin for potential pneumonia given he had a lot of secretions.
Repeat sputum GS was positive for gram positvies cocci so vancomycin was restarted on [**2119-12-22**] and he should complete a 7 day course, through [**2119-12-29**].
Has had increasing frothy white sputum and he is net 6.5 L positive.
# Pneumothorax: He had evidence of small ptx on CXR after line placement that progressed on subsequent imaging.
Chest tube placed by thoracics, placed on water seal [**2118-12-19**], pulled [**2118-12-20**], and ptx continued to improve on CXR with no residual ptx on discharge.
# ARF: cr 1.7 on admission likely [**1-19**] to hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and responded very well to IVFs with creatinine now at baseline.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST both improved since admission.
In review of previous labs, has consistently had transaminase abnormalities, but not to extent as on admission.
# G-tube: repositioned by general surgery.
No issues currently.
Also has mucous fistula.
