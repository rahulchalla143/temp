On the occasion of these presumed bleeds, there was inability to perform endoscopy at [**Hospital1 **] due to anatomy and inability to lie flat.
She thus did not receive EGD or colonoscopy, but both were planned as outpatient.

No history of postmenopausal bleeding.
No hot flashes.

pulmonary vascular prominence c/w pulmonary edema.
Increased hilar prominence and peri-hilar haziness also c/w picture of pulmonary edema.
Increased opacity in left mid-lung zone which may represent pneumonia, atelectasis, or asymettrical edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly, stable.
No evidence of sizable pelural effusion or pneumothorax.
EKG: SR nml axis, nml intervals, J point elevated in V2-V3 is unchanged from [**11/2194**]   Brief Hospital Course: 63F with COPD, chronic GI bleeding, presents with dyspnea, productive cough, and hypoxia, as well as Hct 20 and low plts.
#COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary COPD exacerbation secondary to viral illness due to low temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset.
She underwent a TTE yesterday which showed moderate AS with a valve area between 1-1.2 cm2, so her SOB is unlikely to be secondary to AS.
-The patient will benefit from inpatient pulmonary f/u given her severe obstructive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension.
Given her severe underlying pulmonary disease, the patient's metoprolol was changed to diltiazem.
Given the patient's GI bleed and transient nature of her a-fib, she was not started on cardioembolic prophylaxis with either aspirin or coumadin.
#GI bleed: The patient was found on admission to have a Hct of 20 and guaiac positive stools.
She had a history of GI bleeds on coumadin.
Likely due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
# Abdominal pain/diarrhea: The patient developed crampy abdominal pain while hospitalized.
This could be due to a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the past and would explain anemia or also be due to C.diff in the setting of recent diarrhea.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE which showed a normal EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).
Her lasix was initially held due to negative fluid balance and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
# OSA: The patient is on CPAP at home, but likely has a component of obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
She sould have a sleep study as an outpatient to determine her optimal sleep settings and follow up with sleep medicine, especially as her TTE showed moderate pulmonary htn.
#Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia with platlets in the low 100's for years.
Could be ITP, or related to anemia of chronic disease.
Unlikely to be DIC as there are no signs or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage.
Has antiplatlet antibodies pending.
Also is noted to have pancytopenia and would likely benefit from outpatient workup of her pancytopenia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia, acute GI blood loss COPD exacerbation Hypoxemia Pulmonary Hypertension Bronchitis, acute Obstructive Sleep Apnea Obesity Hypoventilation Atrial fibrillation with RVR, new onset Moderate Aortic Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable, Hct 29.9, platelets 91   Discharge Instructions: Return to the ED if you are having worsening SOB, fevers, chills, significant chest tightness not responsive to meds, worsening productive cough, confusion, significant lethargy, blood in your [**Doctor Last Name 3945**], vomiting blood, unexplained dizziness.
You presented with anemia of acute, likely upper GI blood loss, with a hct of 21.
You opted not to undergo endoscopy and you were transfused blood with resolution of your GI bleeding.
You had an episode of irregular heart rate, likely atrial fibrillation, but given your recent significant GI bleed, you were not started on coumadin or aspirin at this time.
You also had worsening of your asthma and COPD, and were treated with steroids and place in the ICU.
