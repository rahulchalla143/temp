That was complicated by embolic CVA and seizures.
Over the last year, she has noted increasing dyspnea on exertion with walking 20ft and during flight of stairs.
She has been followed closely with serial ECHO and underwent cardiac MRI in [**2139-1-13**] with confirmed severe MR with effective forward ejectin fraction of 25%.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
An eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no coronary artery disease.
LVEDP was elevated at 22 mmHg, consistent with elevated left sided filling pressures.
There was no transaortic gradient on pullback of catheter from LV to aorta.

FINDINGS: Unchanged appearance of extensive bifrontal encephalomalacia with volume loss and dilated lateral ventricular frontal horns, at site of extensive frontal craniotomy and cranioplasty.
The previously noted small left parafalcine meningioma is not well visualized on non-contrast study; however, was better characterized on the MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**2139-6-26**].
There are no foci of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no major vascular territorial infarct.
A dense focus of high attenuation, probably calcification is noted in the right anterior temporal region (2A:18).
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Unchanged extensive bifrontal encephalomalacia, with volume loss and associated slight bilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] dilation.
Previously noted left parafalcine meningioma is not well characterized on the current study; however, was recently well-seen on the MR study from [**6-26**], [**2139**] (MR).
Shortness of breath.
