Past Medical History: SCC of tongue - recent CT chest/abd/pelvis was negative for metastatic disease - Weekly paclitaxel (30mg/m2), carboplatin (1.5 AUC) on 11.18-12.23.

No ST elevation or depression.
CT head/neck with and without contrast & recon: 1.
Submucosal hypervascularity and enhancement extending from the base of the tongue to the supraglottic larynx is likely a sequela of radiation therapy; however, no definite actively bleeding arterial lesion is seen.
Concentric soft tissue thickening and narrowing of the supraglottic larynx is likely also a radiation effect though direct inspection can help confirm this.
Limited evaluation of the base of the tongue secondary to streak artifacts related to dental hardware.
Bilateral LENI: Negative for DVT .
No evidence of obstruction 4.
Dense inferior loops of small bowel are likely old tube feedings.
Oral contrast seen in the colon without evidence of bowel obstruction or stricture.
SMall bowel is decompressed and without abnormality evident.
Unchanged small bladder diverticulum.
Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
Mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia is noted with reduced tongue movement, epiglottic deflection, pharyngeal contraction, and narrow upper esophageal sphincter relaxation.
There is evidence of valleculae residue often spilling to the poorly defined pyriform sinuses resulting in penetration of thick liquids and aspiration of thin liquids after the swallow and during follow-up swallows.
There was clearing of penetration and intermittently effective in clearing  aspiration after cough-swallow.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o M PMH SCC of the tongue, PE on lovenox who presents with hematemesis.
# Hematemesis: Concern for upper GI bleed versus oropharyngeal bleed from squamous cancer.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable.
The mucosa in the upper third of esophagus was very friable with some amount of diffuse oozing compatible with radiation-induced esophagitis.
There was no exudates suggestive of [**Female First Name (un) **].
Abnormal mucosa in the stomach.
Upon re-scoping, the area was improved and it was felt that the mucosa friability was not consistent with radiation damage.
(Area may have been irritated by severe GERD --> emesis).
CTA showed hypervascular region near vallecula but no active bleed to intervene upon.
He was transferred to the floor on these medications and had no further issues with vomiting.
# Nausea and inability to tolerate TPN or PEG feedings: The patient was continued on TPN in the MICU, and a PICC was placed for better access, but upon arriving on the medical floor, had constant complaints of a chemical taste in his mouth as well as a strong burning sensation in his throat, which he said began when TPN was initiated and only would stop when it was turned off.
Patient also endorsing history of fullness after tubefeeds or getting meds via PEG tube.
This demonstrated no obstruction.
# PE: Initially lovenox was held for concern of acute bleed.
# Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: Patient received IV narcotics until [**2-4**], when he was re-started on his home narcotic regimen.
# Atrial fibrillation: Regular rate on EKG on admission.
Metoprolol was held in the MICU given the recent bleed, but was re-started after he was noted to be hemodynamically stable with no evidence of further bleeding on the floor.

You had an area in your mouth that was found to be a possible souce of bleeding.
You had an upper GI endoscopy with the gastroenterologists that showed irritation of your stomach and esophagus but no ulcers.
The ENT doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 6349**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] this irritated area at the back of your tongue that was most likely the source of bleeding, probably caused by continued irritation from vomiting that you had been having at home as well as reflux of acid from your stomach.
You had significant problems with TPN while in the hospital.
We then did a CT scan that showed that you had no obstruction in your bowels.
You were eventually able to tolerate these either by mouth as crushed pills or dissolving pills or via your PEG.
It is very important to take your anti-nausea medications around the clock to prevent nausea so that you can get the maximum dose of tube feeds.
