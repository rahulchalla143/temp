Admission Date:  [**2170-10-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-10-18**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old female with coronary artery disease.
The patient is status post cardiac catheterization during [**2170-8-31**] admission for right femoral-popliteal bypass when the patient developed an episode of chest pain while at dialysis.
The patient had no further cardiac symptoms following this until four days prior to her current admission when she developed an episode of chest pain.
Several hours following this she developed chest pain which was accompanied by weakness and lethargy.
Her weakness continued over the next few days.
She also noted dyspnea with walking and presented to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
History of transient ischemic attack.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right femoral-popliteal bypass; status post left femoral-tibial bypass graft; status post right coronary artery stent.
In general, the patient was a pale elderly female in no acute distress.
Left pupil was dilated and nonreactive.
There was a holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex.
There were 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF.
Cardiac catheterization showed a thrombus in her proximal right coronary artery stent.
The catheterization also showed elevated filling pressures with an elevated wedge pressure.
The patient developed a cough with the ACE inhibitor and was instead switched to an angiotensin receptor blocker.
(b)  Pump:  The patient had a post myocardial infarction echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 40%.
She was put back on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction which was then changed over to an angiotensin receptor blocker as she developed a cough.
She received regular hemodialysis for management of her volume status.
She did not have any arrhythmia complications.
(d)  Valves:  The patient was admitted with a history of mitral regurgitation.
Her post myocardial infarction echocardiogram showed 2+ mitral regurgitation.
PULMONARY ISSUES:   No active issues.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient with end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
She was also continued on Renagel for her elevated phosphate.
ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient with a history a type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was status post a right femoral-popliteal bypass.
OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with a history of glaucoma and cataracts.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with complaints of fatigue and somnolence.
These symptoms quickly resolved following cardiac catheterization and were thought to be due to her cardiac problems.
She did not have any further episodes of lethargy or other neurological issues during her hospitalization.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient with urinalysis showing asymptomatic bacteruria.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  Proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Urinary tract infection.
