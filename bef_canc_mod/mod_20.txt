Physical Exam: Gen: Well appearing elderly man in NAD Eye: extra-occular movements intact, pupils equal round, reactive to light, sclera anicteric, not injected, no exudates ENT: mucus membranes moist, no ulcerations or exudates Neck: no thyromegally, JVD: flat Cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1, s2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi Abd: Soft, non distended, no heptosplenomegaly, bowel sounds present.

[**2169-12-31**] 6:50 pm URINE     Site: CLEAN CATCH URINE CULTURE (Final [**2170-1-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2169-12-31**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
No significant change in cerebral volume loss and chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Bilateral maxillary sinus disease.
Within this limitation, there is no significant change in the comminuted left humeral neck fracture with approximately 2 cm of foreshortening.
There is no new fracture.
There is subtle soft tissue calcification noted on the second and third images at the level of the fracture which may represent early callous formation.
[**2169-12-31**] RUE Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Exam is limited due to patient-related factors.
[**2170-1-1**] Abdomen upright: IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction; incomplete assessment for free air -upright or left lateral decubitus views are recommended to better assess for perforation.
Innumerable cysts seen within the liver and right kidney.
Focally distended gallbladder at the fundus without signs of cholecystitis.
If clinically indicated, a HIDA scan could be performed to further assess for cholecystitis.
No biliary dilatation and no ascites in the right upper quadrant.
Compared to the prior study, there is increased opacity at the right lung base concerning for infection.
An opacity in the right upper lung is stable compared to prior and may represent a calcified granuloma.
The heart is enlarged and there is a small residual right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left humeral fracture better evaluated on dedicated humeral radiographs.
[**2170-1-3**] Video Swallow: FINDINGS: Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was aspiration with thin consistency.
There is unchanged extent of the bilateral basal areas of opacity.
Moreover, no evidence of pulmonary edema is seen.
Unchanged moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, unchanged position of central venous access line and the right-sided pacemaker.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 75 year old [**Month/Day/Year 595**] speaking male with hx of COPD, CAD, and recent humerus fracture presents with altered mental status and found to have pneumonia and GNR bacteremia on [**2169-12-31**].
While at the CT scanner he had an episode of bloody emesis.
He died within seconds of his CT scan being completed and the scan showed no evidence of bleed or stroke.
He likely did from a GI bleed in the setting of a high INR.
Klebsiella Bacteremia: His blood cx on [**2169-12-31**] were positive for pansensitive Klebsiella bacteremia and he was on cefepime.
# Pneumonia: His CXR showed RUL and RLL PNA.
He had a new oxygen requirement throughout his hospitalization and he was continued on nebulizers.
His blood cx grew Klebsiella as detailed above.
Elevated WBC: His elevated WBC was thought to be secondary to PNA and klebsiella bacteremia.
He was afebrile for several days prior to his death.
His abdominal exam was followed and was benign and he denied abdominal pain.
# Altered Mental Status: His CT scan of his head was negative.
His AMS was likely due to bactermia and PNA.
His mental status improved after he started treatment for his PNA & bacteremia and then again after narcotic medications & clonazepam were discontinued.
On [**2170-1-4**] ortho came to evaluate the patient as his left arm (where he had humeus fracture) looked larger and there was concern that he could be bleeding into it in the setting of his elevated INR.
He had no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.
He was found to be guaiac positive on exam but was having rare bowel movements.
The late morning of his death he had question of coffee ground emesis.

# Humerus fracture: On [**2170-1-4**] ortho came to evaluate the patient as his left arm (where he had humerus fracture) looked larger and there was concern that he could be bleeding into it in the setting of his elevated INR.
He had no evidence of compartment syndrome on exam.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and lidocaine and no narcotics were given since they were thought to contribute to his AMS.
