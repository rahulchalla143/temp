When EMS arrived he was alert and talking and then he started to have a generalized convulsive seizure with witnessed left gaze deviation.
His wife who is at the bedside notes that he was generally healthy and has not been complaining of anything and has never noted any seizure like activity including any behavioral arrest.

Neck: No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: crackles b/l Cardiac: RRR, nl.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Also able to squeeze with his left hand but not show me two fingers.

The restricted diffusion could favor infiltrative lesion with high cellularity such as lymphoma or encephalitis.
Differential diagnosis could also include PML if there is history of immunocompromised status.
Right frontal infiltrative white matter predominant leison without significant increase in FDG avidity as compared to background physiologic [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter uptake, not necessarily excluding neoplasm in the differential consideration.
Given this, no evidence acute injury to the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Large retroperitoneal mass which likely represents lymph node  conglomerate.
Several other prominent nodes surrounding the right kidney and porta hepatis concerning for malignancy.
Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis and possiblyaspiration.
Small amount of material in the trachea consistent with aspirated contents.
No acute fracture or dislocation.
However, other injury to the trachea or esophagus cannot be completely excluded on the basis of this study.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65yo M with hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia who sustained an MVA after not being able to stop from turning left.
Later at the scene, EMS noticed him to have a GTC with left gaze deviation.
A head CT scan at the [**Hospital1 18**] ER showed the presence of a right frontal mass, which was subsequently further characterized on MRI as being FLAIR hyperintense and non-contrast enhancing, and on the differential diagnosis includes primary CNS lymphoma versus a metastatic lesion or gliosis/glioma of some type.
At the same time, a trauma protocol torso CT scan identified a series of nodes in his retroperitoneum concerning for malignancy.
An LP was performed, and on cytological analysis, he was found to have hypercellular atypical lymphocytes that could occur with a number of benign and malignant processes.
Flow cytometry analysis on that sample is still pending.
On discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
His neurological exam was normal, including tests of frontal lobe dysfunction.
He only complained of a sore throat, otherwise he was largely well appearing without any other specific complaints.

We found a large mass on the right side of your brain that likely led to your seizures, and that likely is a malignancy/cancer.
Additionally, we observed a series of enlarged lymph nodes in your abdomen that is concerning for cancer.
You were intubated (breathing tube placed) for one day, and you received antibiotics for a total of seven days for some trauma in your throat that you sustained during that process.
