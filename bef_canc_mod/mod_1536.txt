Hand ([**2-16**]) Xray: PND  EGD [**2-14**]: Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus Blood in the stomach body Dieulafoy lesion in the Anastomotic site (endoclip) Both the limbs were identified and no source of bleeding was noticed in those.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 86 yo F h/o HTN, sCHF, bleeding gastric ulcer s/p partial gastrectomy [**2072**], hematemesis in [**2128**] [**2-3**] anastamotic bleed, afib not on coumadin p/w nausea and vomiting, hematemesis .
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hematemesis/Acute blood loss Anemia:  Patient was initially admitted to the ICU for frequent episodes of hematemesis with stable blood pressures and heart rate in the ED.
Initially Hct was 36 in setting of dehydration and decreased to 26 after fluid repletion.
GI was consulted and EGD was done on day of admission which showed likely Dieulafoy's lesion near anastatmotic site from prior gastric bypass surgery, and three clips were placed.
She was scoped again the following day which again showed bleeding Dieulafoy lesion and 2 clips were placed and lesion injected.
Followup Hct suggested continued bleeding so she was transfused 2 more units PRBC.
Third EGD was done on [**2-16**] which showed no bleeding at anastamotic site and areas suggestive of ischemia around the anastamotic site.
Patient was evaluated by the surgical team who recommended no acute intervention and transfusion goal of Hct >30 and platelets >70, IR was made aware of patient who recommended no acute intervention.
# Afib: Pt history with atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin.
At home she is on rate control with atenolol and on digoxin, however this was held in setting of acute bleed.
#Hand pain/ swelling: Patient has chronic pain at baseline, on [**2-16**] noted to have swollen and tender MCP joints.
Pt with history of sarcoidosis and inflammatory appearance of joints, started short course of prednisone 20 mg x 4 days and standing tylenol.
# Nausea/vomiting/abd pain:  Pt has had episodes in the past of nausea and vomiting usually post-prandial and is on PPI [**Hospital1 **] as symptoms thought to be [**2-3**] GERD or recurrence of ulcers in the past, viral gastroenteritis was also on differential.
It is possible that symptoms were also related to lesion at anastamotic site.
Zofran and IV morphine given with symptomatic improvement.
This was transitioned to oral oxycodone, and then this was weaned because of fall risk.
No fevers during stay in MICU, but was recently treated for cough and fever with amoxicillin.
# Cough: has been ongoing for about 2 weeks, no change with antibiotics and CXR with no acute process making PNA or CHF exac less likely.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to viral bronchitis vs re-occurance of sarcoidosis (had pulmonary sarcoid in the past, follows in pulmonology).
Being worked up as outpatient  # HTN: Held atenolol, lisinopril in setting of acute bleed.
# chronic pain: pt with chronic pain in setting of multiple knee and neck surgeries.
She is on an oxycodone regimen per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] IV morphine in ICU since pt had increased pain and was NPO.
# chronic systolic CHF: She appeared euvolemic on exam.
# depression: continued effexor  # Communication: Patient, daughter/hcp [**Name (NI) **] cell:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 106059**] home: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106060**] # Code status: DNR, ok to intubate   Medications on Admission: alendronate 70 qweek atenolol 25mg qam 50 qpm dig 0.125 qd lidoderm patch for back or knee lisionpril 30mg qday omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] pravastatin 40mg qd ropinirole 1mg qhs effexor 150 mg qd vit d -allergies: ativan, compazine and advair   Discharge Medications: 1. pravastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed due to gastric ulcer Acute blood loss anemia Atrial fibrillation Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a GI bleed with anemia.
In the ICU, you underwent EGD showing bleeding ulcers.
After 6 blood transfusions your bleeding stopped.
You were also found to have mild arthritis in your hand, most likely felt to be "Pseudogout."
