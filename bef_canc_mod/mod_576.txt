# Emesis: Pt admitted with progressively worsening heaving and inability to tolerate po's, regardless of if solid, liquids or softs.
Most recent barium study [**8-/2138**] prior to admission without evidence of obstruction.
Swallowing study as well as EGD were negative for cause of intractable emesis with associated nausea.
Gastric emptying study showed slow emptying of stomach as possible etiology of emesis.
# Aspiration pneumonia: In the setting of frequent vomiting, increased risk for aspiration, evidence of possible pneumonia on chest imaging.
# Hypotension: Appeared to be related to dehydration in the setting of volume depletion due to poor po tolerated r/t severe emesis.
Also r/t atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Hypotension resolved prior to transfer to OMED service, no further episodes during admission.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Initially admitted with symptomatic afib with RVR, resolved after initial treatment at outside hospital with diltiazem and fluid resusitation.
pt remained in sinus rhythm during admission.
No anticoagulation as pt with chronic disease and poor prognosis.
# Dirrhea: Initially worrisome for c.diff due to ?diarrhea, however pt unable to tolerate po's and since esophagectomy with pull through, has had loose stools.
# Anemia: Chronic, consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Pt with some blood transfusions due to low HCT which he tolerated well.
No other acute issues.
# Esophageal cancer: After further discussion, no further treatment and pt was discharged with hospice.
