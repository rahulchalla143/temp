Admission Date:  [**2191-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-5-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-7-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Pepcid / Nitroglycerin / Dicloxacillin / Methylprednisolone / Neurontin / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: 60F with multiple medical problems including DM2, chronic LBP on morphine PCA, lower extrem myelopathy, seizure d/o, chronic UTI, metastatic thyroid CA, s/p recent cholecystectomy h/o line infections initially admitted [**5-15**] with decreased mental status, lethargy, and confusion.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] husband states that she had been doing very well at home until the day of admission, when she awoke from a nap with confusion (baseline mental status is fully responsive and communicative).
She was awake all night with severe leg pain.
Of note, pt had been seen in clinic 3 days prior to this and started on IV vancomycin (administered @ home) for a presumed Portacath line infection (?erythematous overlying skin?).
ROS+ for severe diffuse HA x 24 hrs, which did not respond to acetamin.
She also had 2 episodes of non-bloody, bilious emesis.
Otherwise, on ROS, denies dysuria, diarrhea (has chronic constipation), chest pain, cough, or URI sxs.
Poor PO intake over the past 1 day or so.
SBP remained elevated in ED ranging 157-214 with diastolics 80s-90s.
Pt did not have LP since she has been a difficult LP in the past secondary to spinal stenosis and pt's husband requested to be done by neurology or fluoroscopy.
Given concern for meningitis or meningoencephalitis, pt was initially admitted to floor by NF overnight with empiric treatment with Ceftriaxone (only 1 gm by POE) and Vancomycin.
When team saw this am, pt was diaphoretic and responsive to voice but otherwise not following commands.
MICU consulted initially for concern of mental status and concern for sepsis, but at that time was afebrile.
Through the course of the day, pt spiked temp to 104, HR 130s, SBP persistently elevated above 200s not responding to IV hydralazine and lopressor.
Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (no west MICU beds) for Bblocker drip for HTN and for further w/u & monitoring.

-Blood Cx x2: NGTD -Urine Cx x2: NGTD -UA: unremarkable -LP [**5-18**]: NO PMNs, no organisms -EKG (in ED): NSR@73, poor baseline, normal intervals/axis, no ST/T wave changes, unchanged from prior -CXR (in ED): No acute cardiopulmonary disease -Head CT (in ED): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
-Echo [**2191-5-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: *Altered Mental Status / Fever / Increased Muscle Tone:  Patient was admitted with MS changes, hypotension, severe HTN, rigidity and fevers.
Bedside EEG showed no seizure activity.
SBP remained elevated in the ED ranging 157-214 with diastolics 80s-90s.
Pt did not have an LP since she has been a difficult LP in the past secondary to spinal stenosis and pt's husband requested to be done by neurology or fluoroscopy.
Given concern for meningitis or meningoencephalitis, pt was initially admitted to the floor by NF overnight with empiric treatment with Ceftriaxone (only 1 gm by POE) and Vancomycin.
When the team saw the patient in the am, the patient was diaphoretic and responsive to voice but otherwise not following commands.
MICU consulted initially for concern of mental status changes and concern for sepsis, but at that time the patient was afebrile.
Through the course of the day, the patient spiked a temp to 104, HR 130s and SBP was persistently elevated above 200s not responding to IV hydralazine and lopressor.
Required IV to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (no west MICU beds) for Bblocker drip for HTN and for further w/u & monitoring.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the team was still concerned about an underlying infectious process with primary CNS infection vs. portacth line infection on the differential.
Neuro suggested that [**Hospital Unit Name 23792**] was a recently added medication and could possibly be the source of mental status changes.
The most likely diagnosis was thought to be serotonin syndrome given her high dose Celexa & trazadone as an outpatient and the recent addition of [**Hospital Unit Name 23792**] (non-specific serotonin inhibitor) combined with her sx of fever, rigidity and hypertension.
The LP showed no PMNs or microorganisms, but one WBC was seen.
Pt remained afebrile with decreased rigidity for several days and the initally elevated CK, likely secondary to spasticity, trended down.
Patient was started on a low dose of Celexa, but no other anti-depressants were re-started.
Acyclovir and ceftriaxone were dc'd b/c suspicion of meningitis was low.
However, she had baseline rigidity in her legs prior to admission.
SVT did not resolve with adenosine, but she went into rapid AFib which resolved with IV lopressor.
She had no h/o AFib in the past.
Etiology was thought to be secondary to increased catecholamines prior to LP (pt extremely anxious prior to procedure).
DDX also included increased thyroid hormone (level only 2.5), cardiac ischemia (however no CP or ST-T changes), or PE (however anticoagulated with IVC filter).
EF was >55% and some left ventricular hypertrophy was seen.Patient remained in sinus rhythm since that episode so tele was dc'd.
* Hypertension: Patient had an isolated episode of hypotension PTA but was hypertensive at admission with SBPs 157-214.
The etiology was likely secondary to serotonin syndrome vs known longstanding labile BPs.
She was given Miralax, colace and her Senna was changed to scheduled instead of PRN.
* Headache: Pt c/o frontal headaches, with no nausea or vision changes, but she noted seeing spots.
During this admission she had a head CT and LP which were negative, so could r/o meningitis, acute intracranial process or mass.
Could have been d/t migraine or lack of sleep (which she noted has caused headaches in the past).
* Acute Renal Failure: Patient had ARF on admission ad was thought to be pre-renal azotemia since it improved with hydration.
* Spinal Stenosis: Patient had pain secondary to this and was on IV Morphine at home.
Continued pt on RISS and qid fingersticks.
PCP stated that the pt is very hypercoagulable and has a high propensity for PE if subtherapeutic for even a short period of time.
*H/o CHF: No evidence of failure on exam.
Bedside EEG showed no seizure activity.
