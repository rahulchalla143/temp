Admission Date:  [**2136-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Rofecoxib  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible Sigmoidoscopy  History of Present Illness: 67yo female with uterine CA s/p XRT complicated by procatitis and rectal ulcer.
Pt received multilpe XRT tx for uterine CA in [**2134**] and had subsequently underwent resection (incomplete) for vaginal recurrence.
Pt had initially noticed some rectal spotting as early as [**2134**] subsequent to receiving XRT treatments for her uterine CA, however due to her pressing cardiac issues had not paid it much mind.
The patient underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy in [**2136-7-5**] which showed severe radiation change in rectum and sigmoid and areas of active bleeding within the rectum which were treated with bipolar coagulation of the bleeding.
The patient subsequently underwent another sigmoidoscopy in [**2136-8-5**] which found an area of nodular thickened mucosa on the anterior wall of the rectum about 5-7cm from the anal verge.
The bleeding was thought to be secondary to radiation change and or infiltrating recurrent uterine cancer submucosally and was treated with bipolar coagulopathy.
The patient was in her usual state of health until Thurs, after [**Holiday **], pt had noticed some brisk bleeding from the rectum which were described as bright red clots coming by the handful.
The bleeding was no longer clots but now flowing bright red blood.

There has been interval placement of a bipolar pacer.
The patient is in failure with gross pulmonary edema.
[**2136-12-3**]: A-V paced rhythm 50 bpm Pacemaker rhythm - no further analysis Since pervious tracing, no significant change  [**2136-12-4**]:  Colonoscopy Findings:  Excavated Lesions A large >3 cm ulcer with active oozing of blood was found in the distal rectum.
Hemostasis and tissue destruction were successfully achieved with argon plasma coagulation.
Other Extensive telangiectasis with active oozing of blood was visualized up to 30 cm into sigmoid colon.
Hemostasis and tissue destruction at sites of most active oozing were successfully achieved with argon plasma coagulation.
Ulcer in the distal rectum and extensive telangiectasis with active oozing of blood was visualized up to 30 cm into sigmoid colon.
These findings are consistent with radiation proctocolitis.
Hemostasis and tissue destruction at sites of most active oozing was successfully achieved with argon plasma coagulation     Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67yo female with uterine CA s/p XRT complicated by procatitis and rectal ulcer who now presents with BRBPR.
She did not have any active bleeding and her vital signs and hematocrit were stable.
She underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2136-12-4**] which showed an ulcer in the distal rectum and extensive telangiectasis with active oozing of blood up to 30 cm into the sigmoid colon.
The most active lesions were coagulated with an argon plasma laser.
Post procedure, she passed several clots and hematocrit dropped four points, and this was expected per GI.
She had no brisk rectal bleeding and was otherwise hemodynamically stable.
She was discharged to home with strict instructions to return immediately if she developed further bleeding prior to her scheduled GI appointment.
B)  Pump: The patient also has a known history of CHF with EF of 50% (however with 3+MR).
She then developed shortness of breath with wheezing and was in mild acute heart failure.
C)  Rhythm:  Pt has a history of afib but is currently in NS with a pacemaker.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: staff builders TLC out of [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Radiation induced proctocolitis Radiation induced rectal ulcers Lower gastrointestinal bleeding Congestive Heart failure Coronary artery disease Hypertension Diabetes Mellitus GERD Ovarian Cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable and improved.
She was passing decreasing amounts of clots, and occasional specks of bright blood per rectum.
She was hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit and no brisk rectal bleeding.
She was able to ambulate independently without difficulty.
Call your doctor or return to the emergency room immediately if you experience shortness of breath or if you experience brisk bleeding from your rectum.
You should expect to have a small amount of blood from your rectum after your recent procedure.
