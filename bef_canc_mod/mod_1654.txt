Presented to ED on [**8-29**] w/ complaint of fever to 101 and report of transient to 104.
On floor noted to have elevated temp to 105.6, became mildly hypotensive (systolic to 80s) w/ increasing lactate and elevation in Cr.
intubated for respiratory failure.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: before ICU; No chest pain.
No urinary symptoms.
No N/V at home, but vomitted once on the floor after taking home pm meds.
No abdominal pain.
Chronic loose stools, exacerbated lately by spicy foods, but no real diarrhea.
No edema/tenderness in legs.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:Initially presented in [**1-17**] with lung infiltration causing acute respiratory failure requiring intubation: improved on steroids.
Bx at that time was tentatively read as lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 732**] at the NIH: multifocal, dense, lymphohistiocytic infiltrates composed largely of CD3-positive T cells with a mixed small CD20-positive B cells and polyclonal plasma cells; EBV negative.
She was then treated with CHOP with initial response but progressed after the 3rd cycle.
She was admitted with neutropenic fever in [**7-21**] and stayed in the hospital for 3 months.
No source for fevers ever found despite extensive work-up.
A repeat lung biopsy was c/w T-cell lymphoma.
Repeat CT also showed kidney inflitration.
She  was treated with pentostatin and cytoxan, but develped TTP requiring plasmapheresis.
She also developed ARF secondary to lymphoma and TTP and was started on HD.
She was then treated with Campath which led to resolution of renal failure and she was able to be weaned off her steroids.
Pt was recently admitted at the end of [**4-21**] for fevers and increased diarrhea.
No source of fever found: ?
R trochanteric bursitis 3.
Glaucoma [**12-19**] to ophthalmic steroid use 4. h/o of mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis on TTE and cardiac MRI ; LVEF [**2115-2-8**] - 50% 5. gastritis, diagnosed by EGD in [**12-22**] 6.

Family History: -Her sister died at the age of 22 of lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
-Her father died of CLL after marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia at 62 -Her mother died of stroke at the age of 65.
sclera anicteric.
no photophobia.
CARDIAC: RRR, Nl s1, s2 CHEST: expiratory wheezes with I:E of 1:4 ABD: soft, NT, ND, +BS EXT: no edema, 2+ peripheral pulses, small fingers on left hand  NEURO: A and O x 3, appears midly sedated, but is aware of her history and place LINES: L central line, L hand PIV   Pertinent Results: CT Torso [**2115-8-30**] INDICATION: 38-year-old woman with T-cell lymphoma presents with fevers.
Please evaluate for fever source, compare with previous CT for renal changes seen on prior CT.
This is consistent with patient's known history of multiple bilateral lung wedge resections.
There are no pleural effusions.
No mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.
Again, the differential diagnosis includes hemangioma or possibly focal fatty infiltration.
On the right side, again seen is exophytic hypoechoic lesion measuring 9 mm in greatest dimension relatively unchanged from prior study when it measured 11 mm.
These lesions are too small to characterize by CT, but of note, when seen on MRI performed [**2115-6-19**], these lesions were felt to represent simple renal cysts.
No gross pathology is noted in the rectum, sigmoid colon.
There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
These areas are too small to characterized by CT, but when seen on MRI dated [**2115-6-19**], these were felt to be simple renal cysts.
This could possibly represent a hemangioma or focal fatty infiltration.
FINDINGS:  There is rounded mucosal thickening in the inferior right maxillary sinus.
There is no bony destructive change.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of sinusitis.
Minimal hyperintensity is seen on FLAIR images adjacent to the lateral ventricles.
Located within the midportion of centrum semiovale on the right and extending inferiorly to the lateral aspect of the right lateral ventricle is a small linear area of enhancement, which most likely represents a developmental venous anomaly.
There is no evidence of surrounding edema, or hemorrhage on susceptibility sequences.
Note is made of mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus as seen on the recent sinus CT.
Increased signal is seen on the T2-weighted images within the mastoid air cells, which likely represents partial opacification.
Tiny developmental venous anomaly in right centrum semiovale.
Mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus, right maxillary sinus, and partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.
EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no epileptiform features.

1) sepsis/fevers - Unclear source of the fevers and complicating hypotension.
Pt meet criteria for sepsis with unclear etiology.
Nasal aspirate and nasopharyngeal swab for Influenza/Parainfl/RSV were negative.
High dose stress steroids were also started.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] were d/c and she remained afebrile before d/c.
Her course appears to be consistent with a severe viral prodrome that was otherwise not identified.
2) Respiratory failure- intubated [**12-19**] hypoxic resp failure with tachypnea, thought possibly [**12-19**] worsened metabolic acidosis.
There were no more respiratory issues upon arrival to the floor.
3) Transient auditory hallucinations - patient 24 hours after the ICU stay experienced auditory and visual hallucinations described as hearing 80s music and seeing water running on the wall and on the ceiling.
Imaging studies with CT/MRI and EEG failed to show any pathology.
Patient upon d/c denies any more auditory or visual hallucinations.
5) ARF- Secondary to hypotension.
Patient had prerenal picture progressing to early ATN (FEna 0.57).
With resolution of hypotension.
