New right middle lung opacification most consistent with newly developing pneumonia given acuity of onset (1 month).
Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post right thoracotomy.
[**2181-9-24**]: Portable CXR - IMPRESSION: Minimal worsening of right pneumonia, superimposed upon severe emphysema.
It is difficult to exclude a component of necrotizing infection.
Persistent air collection at right apex, likely due to a postoperative pneumothorax, unchanged since recent radiograph, but worse when compared to older studies from [**2181-7-20**].
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no obvious vegetations seen, but the cardiac valves are not well seen.

Patient was initially treated with high flow face mask of 15 L at 40% with additional NC with saturations varying from 88 to 98%, but with continued frequent coughing which causes desaturations.
