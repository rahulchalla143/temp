History of Present Illness: 82 y/o male with a history of untreated htn presented with complaints of chest pressure starting at 6 AM after climbing a flight of stairs in his cellar on the day of admission.
The chest pressure was associated with diaphoresis but not Dyspnea, Lightheadedness, or nausea.
In the ED, EKG showed ST elevations with Biphasic TWI in V1-V5, Q waves in V1-V3, and reciprical T wave inversions in I, aVL, and V6.
On presentation to the CCU, he was hemodynamically stable and without chest pain or shortness of breath.
Prior to this admission, he has no history of chest pains, shortness of breath, light-headedness, lower extremity edema, syncope, or palpitations.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia Cardiac History: None No history of Percutaneous coronary intervention.
No history of Pacemaker/ICD.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death  Physical Exam: Blood pressure 140/80.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The lungs had faint crackles over the left base, but were otherwise clear to ascultation.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was a right femoral bruit at the site of the catheterization.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LAD was totally occluded at its origin, with faint distal filling via right-left and left-left collaterals.
Limited resting hemodynamics as detailed above showed elevated filling pressures.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x23 mm Cypher stent which was postdilated to 3.25mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by PTCA of vessel with drug-eluting stent.
There is  moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF  30-35%) with extensive akinesis of the anterior/anteroseptal walls, apex, and  distal inferior walls.
No aneurysm, masses or thrombi are seen in the left  ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
Mild(1+) aortic  regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There  is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitralregurgitation is seen.
There is  mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid LAD territory).
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2159-8-30**] CT ABDOMEN PELVIS  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 82-year-old man with ST-elevation MI, status post cardiac catheterization with right femoral AV fistula and hematocrit drop by ten points; evaluate for retroperitoneal bleed.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Investigation of the visceral organs is limited by the absence of intravenous and oral contrast.
There is extensive vascular calcification.
The large and small colon appear normal.
No evidence for mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
No evidence for hematoma in the abdomen.
In the imaged portion of the thorax, there are small pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated atelectasis.
No evidence for hematoma or in the pelvis.
No pathologic lymphadenopathy in the pelvic or inguinal regions.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion seen.
No CT evidence for hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS 82 year-old male with a pmh of poorly documented hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presents with anteroseptal STEMI.
Subsequent echo showed a reduced LVEF of ~30% and apical hypokinesis.
His stay was complicated by a low hematocrit subsequent to melanotic stools as well as formation of a AV fistula in the right external iliac artery s/p catheterization.
CAD-Anteroseptal STEMI: After catheterization with cypher stent to proximal LAD, the patient was hemodynamically stable and without chest pain or shortness of breath .
There was moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%) with extensive akinesis of the anterior/anteroseptal walls, apex, and  distal inferior walls.
No aneurysm, masses or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.
Metoprolol was briefly held upon having significant melanotic stools and a hematocrit drop.
PUMP The patient had a reduced LVEF post-MI&stenting (as described above).
Lisinopril was initially held due to an elevated creatinine of 1.7.
However, with the melanotic stools and hematocrit drop, coumadin was held.
Rhythm The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with elevated ST segments in the anterior leads post-cath.
A CT was negative for abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding.
On discharge, stools were no longer melanotic but still guaiac positive.
#GI Patient denied having a history of dark or melanotic stools.
By hospital day 4, he had two episodes of grossly melanotic stools.
A gastric tube lavage of stomach contents did not reveal active upper GI bleeding in the stomach.
An EGD was done by GI, and found minor abrasions in the upper GI tract, but no signs of active bleeding.
An AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and common femoral vein was found by ultrasound.
There was no evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation, and no signs of lower extremity ischemia were evident.
#Renal Renal Insufficiency: Patient had an elevated creatinine of 1.7 (Baseline 1.1 in [**2157**]).
The elevated creatinine was thought to be due to pre-renal failure.
The oliguria may have included both pre-renal as well as upper GI bleeding etiologies.
Acute ST-elevation MI.
Acute Renal Failure.
Depressed ejection fraction with apical akinesis.
Chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after experiencing a large heart attack.
Given the bleeding you likely had from your stomach, this will help to protect and heal the inflammation.
If you begin to experience chest pains, shortness of breath, increased weight gain, high fevers, nausea, light-headedness, loss of consiousness, swelling in your legs, or any other concernings signs, please contact your physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
