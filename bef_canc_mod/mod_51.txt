Peripheral vascular disease with claudication right     greater than left and right foot rest pain.
Asymptomatic carotid disease with internal carotid artery     80 to 90% left common carotid 68 to 69%, right internal     carotid artery 70 to 79% with a left subclavian steel.
Patient was recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) 116**] for respiratory failure and was discharged in [**2135-4-25**] and spent 2 months in rehab.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Is positive for claudication, right greater than left x4 years, now with right foot pain which has increased since discharge.
He denies any syncope, seizure, amaurosis or hemiparesis, seizures.
He denies prostatism, melena or bloody stools.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
History of coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction x3 with a failed right coronary angioplasty stenting complicated by right coronary dissection requiring intra-aortic balloon support in [**2121**].
Peripheral vascular disease.
Left hip and pelvic fracture secondary to fall in [**2132-2-23**].
Left upper lobe cancer, status post right upper lobectomy with chest wall resection, mediastinal node dissection.
History of type 2 diabetes mellitus on oral agents.
History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of ventral hernia.
History of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma by scalene node biopsy.
History of ventilator-induced pseudomonas pneumonia.
History of congestive heart failure, compensated.
He is limited secondary to his foot pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is alert, oriented, in no acute distress.
HEENT examination: No jugular venous distension.
Carotids are palpable bilaterally 1+ with bruits bilaterally.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
There are no bruits or masses.
No aortic prominence.
Peripheral vascular examination shows the right first and fifth toe with dry gangrenous changes.
The right toes is with ruborous changes.
Pulse examination: There is a left femoral bruit.
He required Neo- Synephrine drip for low urinary output.
He did have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia but they were nonsustained and his Neo-Synephrine dose was decreased.
He was preopped for potential right leg revascularization with a femoral-femoral bypass but developed florid flash pulmonary edema and required admission to the SICU.
Patient was aggressively diuresed and metoprolol was used for his supraventricular tachycardia.
Patient had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed no acute changes.
The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was moderately depressed with inferior and lateral akinesis with anterior and septal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve was mildly thickened with three leaflets.
The mitral valve was mildly thickened.
There was mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient underwent a stress test in which he had no anginal symptoms or electrocardiographic changes from baseline.
A nuclear study demonstrated left ventricular cavity size was mildly enlarged.
The resting and stress perfusion images revealed severe fixed inferior and lateral wall defect.
There was also a moderate reversible apical defect with a calculated ejection fraction of 25%.
These findings were reviewed with his cardiologist.
After a long discussion the cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and the patient determined that he was at very high risk for a perioperative event.
The patient elected to proceed to have surgery on his right leg for his ischemic right rest pain, even with significant increased risk.
Pending this evaluation patient will be discharged when medically stable either to rehabilitation or to home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient should call us if his leg wounds become red, swollen or drain.
Right carotid stenosis.
Arterial insufficiency with right foot pain.
History of coronary artery disease, status post     myocardial infarction x3.
History of left hip and pelvic fracture secondary to     fall.
History of right upper lung cancer, status post right     upper lobe resection with chest wall resection,     mediastinal node dissection, bronchoscopy,     mediastinoscopy and scalene node biopsy.
History of postoperative congestive heart failure.
Compensated history of postoperative blood loss anemia,     transfused.
