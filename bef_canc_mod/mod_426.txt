He comes in today with increasing SOB and leg swelling.
Also c/o extreme fatigue.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes (+), Dyslipidemia (+), Hypertension (+) .
Small pericardial effusion.
Other Past History: -mitral stenosis -Atrial fibrillations s/p pacemaker in [**2102**] and battery change in  [**2110**] and s/p cardioversion -RAS s/p renal stents x3, [**2106**] -non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2077**] s/p splenectomy & chemorad Rx to  chest/neck/abdomen, - Recurrent right sided effusions, loculated hydropneumothorax s/p right thoracotomy, pleurectomy with decortication -cardiomyopathy secondary to chemo and radiation since [**2077**] -B-cell lymphoma with pulmonary nodules s/p CHOP/CVP'[**03**], -Hypothyroidism, -Upper GI bleed x2 -Renal Insufficiency -gout -s/p L carotid endarteroectomy   Social History: Lives with wife, was a silk screen printer for medical devices.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bibasilar crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: b/l LE edema No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2112-3-18**]): The right kidney measures 10.7 cm, the left 10.9 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis or stone.
There is a simple cyst at the lower pole of the left kidney, measuring 1.5 x 1.9 x 1.9cm.
There is a left pleural effusion.
DOPPLERS: There is brisk systolic waveform in the right main as well as the proximal, mid and lower pole renal arteries.
However, although the resistive indicex is normal in the main renal artery on the right, resistive indices range from 0.9 to 1 within the intraparenchymal arteries, with absent diastolic flow.
On the left, there is a tardus parvus waveform, and absent diastolic flow in the main renal artery, with elevated resistive index.
IMPRESSION: Delayed time to peak systole in the LRA suggestive of stenosis on the keft.
Bilateral markedly elevated RIs ( 0.9-1.0 ) may indicate diffuse parenchymal disease bilaterally.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The LV ejection fraction (approximately 40 percent) appears mildly-to-moderately depressed secondaey to inferior posterior hypokinesis (basal segments akinetic).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
All measures of intraventricular left ventricular dyssynchrny are reduced.
Chest X-ray ([**3-25**]): Since [**3-17**], the right axillary pacemaker has been changed or revised.
New left ventricular lead follows its expected course.
Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion are unchanged since [**3-17**].
Right internal jugular sheath ends above the junction with the left brachiocephalic vein.
I doubt that there is any pneumothorax.
CHF exacerbation/cariogenic shock: Patient was started on dopamine for inotropic support.
He was discharged with TEDS for LE edema and lasix 40mg day.
With pre-load dependence was very hard to diurese patient and required lasix gtt then CVVH as well as pressors as above.
The patient was felt to have 2 major issues contributing to his symptoms and frequent relapses: 1. severe AS, and 2. poorly functioning ventricles that were not beating effectively.
The team opted to place a biventricular placer with the thought that this intervention would improve his cardiac output as well as his symptoms of AS.
Therefore, a CVVH line was placed and this was initiated both for volume overload and ARF.
CAD: CAD c/b MI x2 s/p PTCA/stent/CABG.
Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were held in setting of hypotension.
DM2: held glyburide and started RISS # Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine # GIB: continued omeprazole [**Hospital1 **] #.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure Acute on Chronic Renal Disease Coronary Artery Disease Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure and required diuretics and ultrafiltration to remove fluid from your body.
Please put on TEDS stockings during the day if you notice that your swelling in your legs is increasing.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] if you notice more trouble breathing, increasing leg swelling, shortness of breath with activity, increasing cough, fevers, chest pain or any other unusual symptoms.
