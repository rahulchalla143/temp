Admission Date:  [**2140-8-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-5-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Acute pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Reason for Transfer: severe post-ERCP pancreatitis.
The patient is a 25 yo F with post-ERCP pancreatitis transferred from an OSH for further management.
Pt underwent a lap chole in [**3-14**] for her 2 months of abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting.
The pain persisted after the lap chole and her LFTs increased.
One week PTA, the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48587**] for a GI consult, and underwent an outpatient ERCP on [**2140-8-2**] which showed an 8mm dilated CBD and CBD stone.
Later that day, the pt complained of severe abdominal pain and presented to the [**Hospital1 189**] Emergency Room.
She was given pain meds and fluids at 200cc/hr, however, pt continued to complain of pain and she began to third space all fluids.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was complaining of severe pain and her HR was in the 140s.
Over the next two days, she received a total of 12L and her pain was controlled with 1mg of dilaudid every 3hrs.
On night prior to txf back to MICU, pt triggered with acute SOB and HR up to 140s, 92% on 2L.
During her stay on the floor, her fluids were decreased from 200 cc/hr to 75 cc/hr due to increasing concern for third spacing and worsening pleural effusions.
Again, the team tried nebs, ativan and dilaudid, this time with no improvement.
A CXR showed a large gastric bubble, low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions (but unchaged from prior CXR).
On txf back to the ICU, pt was somnolent, answering questions with one-word answers.
She was very tachypneic with a RR in the 40s and diaphoretic.
She denied nausea, vomiting or constipation.
Physical Exam: Upon admission to MICU: VS:  HR 129 BP 90/60 O2 93%2L General - well nourished female lying in bed, mildly sedated from pain medication, but easily arousable and answers questions appropriately.
HEENT - PERRL, no scleral icterus, mucous membranes dry.
Neck - supple, no LAD, no JVD.
CV - tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] appreciated.

Abdomen - tender to palpation diffusely (worse on right and epigastric area).
Ext - no c/c.
Some puffiness around sight of right peripheral IV.
Readmission to MICU: Physical Exam: temp 101.7 --> 99.7 (with tylenol), BP 127/84, HR 178 --> 132, R 27, O2 91% on 2L Gen: somnolent but opens eyes to voice, answering some questions HEENT: MM somewhat dry; pupils dilated CV: tachy but regular, no murmurs Chest: decreased breath sounds throughout, occ exp wheezes Abd: +BS, tense edematous skin; TTP in RUQ, no rebound or peritoneal signs Skin: total body anasarca Ext: 2+ tense edema in all ext, cool lower ext, 2+ DP Neuro: AO x 3   Pertinent Results: [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD WBC-11.3* RBC-5.11 Hgb-14.4 Hct-43.9 MCV-86 MCH-28.3 MCHC-32.9 RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-265 [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD Plt Ct-265 [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD Glucose-135* UreaN-27* Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-5.1 Cl-115* HCO3-20* AnGap-10 [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD ALT-39 AST-40 AlkPhos-60 Amylase-3885* TotBili-0.4 [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD Lipase-1423* [**2140-8-6**] 07:08AM BLOOD Calcium-7.0* Phos-2.4* Mg-1.8  OSH labs: Hepatitis C VL - negative Hepatitis B surface antigen - negative Hepatitis B surface antibody - positive Alpha 1 antitrypsin - negative ceruloplasmin - normal Hepatitis A - negative  [**2140-8-2**] OSH ERCP - 8mm gallstone in the distal common bile duct, status post successful sphincterotomy and balloon extraction.
[**2140-8-3**] OSH CT Abdomen - prominent head of the pancreas with free fluid in the right anterior perirenal space and free fluid within the pelvis consistent with pancreatitis .
New small bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes bilaterally.
[**2140-8-10**] CT Abd/pelvis - Complex collection in the anterior mediastinum measuring 4.7 x 4.0 cm which most likely represents a moderate-sized hematoma.
There is no evidence of compression on the adjacent trachea or vascular structures.
Bibasilar consolidation with air bronchograms which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Large right and smaller left pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Normal appearance of the pancreas without evidence of pancreatitis or pseudocyst.
Diffuse anasarca and mild ascites.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.
Mild symmetric LV hypertrophy.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No tamponade.
[**2140-8-14**] CT abd/pelvis - Stable appearing complex collection within the anterior mediastinum which could represent a hematoma.
An alternate consideration is lymphadenopathy (query history of lymphoma), or thymoma.
No evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, or calcifications.
Slight increase in mesenteric and intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Diffuse anasarca.
Slight decrease in the right pleural effusion.
Right basilar atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Small pericardial effusion.
[**2140-8-24**] TEE - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left  atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect.
No valvular vegetations or paravalvular abscess seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
[**2140-8-24**] CTA - No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief hospital course/MICU course:  # Resp failure Pt developed respiratory failure likely due to volume overload with ?
Pt continued to require elevated levels of PEEP given her significant volume overload as well as ?
ARDS and significant chest wall soft tissue swelling.
She had an episode of tachycardia and anxiety and due to concern for PE a CTA was done that was negative.
The patient was weaned down to 2L NC without desaturation.
# Fever: Pt had developed fevers initially to 103 in the setting of hypotension and septic shock.
Pt was placed on double pressor therapy with levophed/vasopressin along with broad spectrum Abx coverage.
Cultures eventually returned positive for E.Coli bacteremia and Enterococcus urinary infxn.
Re-imaging of CT sinuses and Abd/Chest/Pelvis showed no progression of Pancreatitis or acute processes, and no evidence of abscess or pseudocyst with necrosis.
She was noted to have an anterior mediastinal process c/w a hematoma/teratoma which was stable and deemed clinically non-relevant at the time.
Eventually, her Abx were again narrowed to Levaquin/Ampicillin given a lack of source for her fevers and she completed a 2 week course of [**Last Name (un) **] for her e.coli bacteremia and a 10 day course of Ampicillin for her Enterococcal UTI.
A TEE was performed on [**8-24**] that was negative for any endocarditis or vegetations.
A pelvic w/u for GC/chlamydia was negative as well.
Her central lines were re-sited numerous times (x3) during her MICU stay without any evidence of a central line infection.
On [**8-23**] the patient developed redness of her upper R thigh that was concerning for cellulitis vs drug reaction.
Vancomycin was discontinued (on day 9) as a possible cause for the possible drug rash and zosyn was started for ?
She remained afebrile and recent blood/urine cultures show no growth to date.
# Post-ERCP pancreatitis: Pt initially admitted with a post-ERCP pancreatitis with enzymes in the thousands.
These eventually decreased, and pt would develop intermittant bouts of pancreatitis with flares of her enzymes to the hundreds.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis did not show any development of any pancreatic pseudocysts or necrosis of the pancreas.
* # Tachycardia: Pt with a persistant tachycardia that despite adequate fluid resuscitation did not reverse.
* # Pneumothorax Pt had a CT-guided mediastinal bx that entered into the pleural cavity and created a pneumothorax on [**8-24**].
The catheter was removed sucessfully on [**8-29**] without complication.
* # Volume overload Due to persistant episodes of bacteremia and sepsis along with hypotension, pt was aggressively fluid resuscitated and due to her low albumin, developed an excessive amount of third spacing.
* # Rash On [**8-26**], pt began to develop a erythematous rash over her lower back and down her right thigh.
ID was initially concerned for infectious cellulitis despite being on Vancomycin therapy and Zosyn was added for broader coverage.
The cellulitis was resolving on antibiotics.
