He was most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] between [**2171-5-22**] to [**2171-5-25**] with fevers thought to be due to line sepsis from his hemodialysis line verse pneumonia.

During this time, he was feeling lethergic and fatigued.
He was without significant complaints until yesterday when he developed fever to 101.

CXR [**2172-1-12**]: Layering left pleural effusion which has increased since [**2170**], left IJ in place, no PTX .
Brief Hospital Course: This is 78 year-old male nursing home resident admitted with altered mental status, hypotension, and fevers.
Hypotension/Fevers: The likely source of his fevers and hypotension was urosepsis given his positive urinalysis.
He completed a course of vancomycin, zosyn, and tobramycin empirically for urinary tract infection.
He had a repeat urinalysis that had elevated white cells.
All of his urine cultures were only positive for yeast.
Altered Mental Status: His lethargy and increased confusion where attributed to his underlying infection.
He had a head CT that was negative for mass effect or stroke.
His mental status cleared as his fevers and hypotension resolved.
As his sepsis and mental status improved, he was easily weaned from the ventilator and extubated without difficulty.
End stage renal disease: He has a history of chronic renal disease likely secondary to diabetes with a baseline creatinine of 2.0-2.4.
History of seizure: He has a history of seizure in the setting of sepsis in the past.
6.Coronary artery disease: He had no evidence of active ischemia.
His beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were restarted once he was no longer hypotensive.
Congestive heart failure: He had some evidence of volume overload as evidence by respiratory distress.
Diabetes: He has known insulin dependent diabetes.
Erythematous Scrotum: This is most likely due to a yeast infection from appearance.
Anemia: He has a known anemia, most likely from anemia of chronic disease/CRI.
He also had a right dialysis catheter.
