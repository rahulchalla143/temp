BCX-negative sputum-resp flora .
Again seen is asymmetry and volume loss and opacification of the right hemithorax.
Right hemithorax opacification again likely represents combination of radiation changes and volume loss.
Given differences in patient position, there appears to be slight decrease in the opacification of the right lung.
The left lung is clear aside from mild left base atelectasis.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-1-20**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Status post right upper lobectomy and radiation therapy with expected volume loss and post-operative changes.
More confluent right middle lobe consolidation and persistent but improved nodular opacities in the right lower lobe since [**2178-1-19**], consistent with pneumonia.
New focal opacity in the left base could represent additional focus of infection or inflammation.
Atherosclerotic disease.
Laryngeal penetration is noted with thin liquids, nectars, and pureed solids.
There is no frank aspiration.
Please refer to speech pathology note for further details.
[**2-13**] CXR: INDINGS: Post-treatment asymmetric appearance of the right hemithorax is Preliminary Reportunchanged with upper right rib resection and volume loss with rightward Preliminary Reportmediastinal shift and right hemidiaphragm elevation.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is Preliminary Reportpresent.
Degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 68yo F PMHx prior lung Ca s/p resection, prior laryngeal ca s/p chemo + XRT + resection, recent admission for CAP vs COPD exacerbation ([**Date range (1) 8946**]) treated with 7d levofloxacin and 10d prednisone, represented with increasing SOB without sign of acute infection.
# Hypoxia/dyspnea/acute COPD exacerbation/recent RML PNA - Presented with shortness of breath and cough, O2 requirement; + sick contact at home (son); no radiographic changes on CXR, overall improvement in prior PNA seen on CT scan comparison; thought to have likely COPD exacerbation; underlying trigger may be chronic subclinical aspiration events; given recent prednisone 40mg course, started on prednisone 60mg + azithromycin.
Pt did not have fever or leukocytosis.
There was a RML consolidation noted, but improved from prior images.
Pt also had afib with RVR in the ED which may have contributed to initial dyspnea.
Pt completed 5 days of azithromycin during her hospitalization for COPD flare.
Pt underwent a speech and swallow examination that was not suggestive of aspiration.
Given the RML opacification that was seen on CTA and prior CXR, PT WILL NEED TO HAVE A REPEAT CXR OR CT SCAN TO ENSURE RESOLUTION OF OPACIFICATION GIVEN SMOKING HISTORY AND HISTORY OF MALIGNANCY AND POSSIBILITY OF RECURRENT MALIGNANCY SHOULD OPACIFICATION NOT IMPROVE.
# Afib: CHADS2 of 3, initially with RVR in ED, received 30mg PO dilt and 20mg IV dilt with resumption of sinus rhythm, continued home diltiazem and metoprolol dosing with good rate control (but used short acting agents while admitted).
However, ?unresolving "PNA" and continued dyspnea could be suspicious for recurrence vs. radiation changes.
# CAD: currently stable and patient without chest pain.
No current signs of active bleeding.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -F/U INR, adjust coumadin prn -repeat chest imaging to ensure resolution of opacities given prior malignancy history -consider outpatient pulmonary evaluation  Medications on Admission: - atorvastatin 40mg daily - fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50mcg/dose [**Hospital1 **] - levothyroxine 25mcg daily - aspirin 81mg - diltiazem Extended Release 120mg daily - warfarin 5mg daily - metformin 850mg daily - metoprolol succinate 100mg daily - omeprazole 20mg daily - ranitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] - albuterol prn - ipratropium prn - Tylenol 650mg q6h prn  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: acute COPD exacerbation hypoxemia atrial fibrillation CAD hypothryoidism history of lung and larygneal cancer.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with cough and shortness of breath.
You will need to have a repeat chest x-ray or CT scan in a few weeks to ensure resolution of your lung findings/prior pneumonia.
