On the catheterization on [**7-10**], the patient was found to have restenosed and a second stent was placed to the LAD.
The post cath course was complicated by an upper GI bleed and hypotension requiring transfer to the CCU and support with intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells.

GI was consulted and an upper endoscopy was performed which revealed a small hiatal hernia, non bleeding esophageal ulcers, and blood in the stomach with friable mucosa in the antrum of the stomach which was electrocauterized.
