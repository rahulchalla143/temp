FINDINGS: No intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures is present.
Low attenuation focus in the right cerebellar hemisphere is consistent with a chronic infarction.
Low attenuation areas in the right temporal lobe adjacent to the posterior portion of the sylvian fissure is also consistent with chronic infarction.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic infarcts as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M patient with Afib on coumadin, CAD, CHF, s/p PPM, DM2, w/ known cirrhosis (cryptogenic vs NASH) and multiple admits for hepatic encephalopathy presenting with Altered Mental Status, dehydration, and acute renal failure.
## CONFUSION/ HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:  Altered mental status in patient w/ known cirrhosis (cryptogenic vs NASH) w/ recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.
No clinical or biochemical evidence of infection.
Given his self-administration of medications, there was sufficient concern for a recurrent cycle of hepatic encephalopathy and dehydration.
As such, we felt short term supervised setting is appropriate.
He should be monitored for signs of dehydration with frequent volume loss from stool.
## ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Likely pre-renal azotemia secondary to volume depletion.
Hypovolemic clinically on initial presentation w/ no evidence of CHF.
Initially held Lasix/spironolactone until volume repleat.
Patient will re-initiate these medication on [**2116-1-10**] as he has demonstrated ability to take in adequate po to offset volume losses in stool.
Likely acute on chronic [**1-29**] hepatic failure and altered MS.
No respiratory compromise throughout admission.
His EKG demonstrated Afib with LBBB and intermittent pacing w/o concerning signs for ischemia.
## ANEMIA: chronic dz, iron deficiency.
No evidence of bleed.
Needs close monitoring of fluid balance with goal IN=OUT.
