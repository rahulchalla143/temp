He underwent radiation to a skin cancer on his cheek and has thereafter had very dry mouth and thick sputum he has been unable to cough up.
He denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight-loss, or sick contacts but does report paroxysms of shortness of breath and one episode of dark red hemoptysis this morning.
He denies nausea, diaphoresis, or chest pain.
CXR showed Rt-sided infiltrate so he was started on CTX and azithromycin to treat community-acquired pneumonia.
EKG initially showed NSR with rate 85 and no ischaemic changes.
His hypoxia quickly worsened to requiring 100% NRB and was noted on CXR to possible pulmonary edema with BNP of 1259.
He subsuquently ruled in for MI with CK peak of 211 and CK-MB of 8.5.
He later went into rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 130's-140's and was subsequently placed on a diltialzem and heparin drip.
He was also noted to have acute renal failure with Cr of 3.5 up from his baseline of 2.8. .
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, joint pains, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for mild chest pressure earlier this morning chest pain.
At baseline he has no dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: type I diabetes Transitional cell carcinoma s/p right nephroureterectomy and BCG therapy CRI, baseline Cr 2.8 (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**] primary nephrologist) HTN Hypercholesterolemia h/o A.Fib/flutter s/p Cholecystecomy s/p Achilles tendon rupture .
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 98.6, BP 140/83, HR 95, RR 22, 93 O2 % on 100% NRB Gen: WDWN elderly male in moderate respiratory distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple, JVP difficult to assess due to habitus.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
moderate respiratory distress, coughing.
loud ronchi heard throughout with [**Hospital1 **]-basilar crackles and scattered crackles throughout rt lung.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No ST of T wave changes.
EKG on transfer demonstrated coarse atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 120, normal axis, no hypertrophy, normal intervals.
Non-spesific diffuse ST depression and TWI.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular  filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2198-10-1**], there has been interval development of mild aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy (aortic valve velocity not evaluated on prior study).
Elevated left ventricular filling pressures are now present.
The rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
ETT performed at [**Hospital **] hospital (records not available) on [**2-/2199**] demonstrated:  He exercised for 3 min and 39 sec on a [**Doctor First Name **] protocol achieved a maximal heart rate of 94% with no angina or ischemic EKG changes there may have been a subtle inferior wall defect thought to be artifact.
IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe and right lower lung pneumonia possibly aspiration pneumonia with likely involvement of the left lower lung also.
EGD [**2203-9-23**].IMPRESION:The previously noted mucosal abnormality on the incisura was not noted on this exam.
There is improvement of the vascular engorgement and asymmetric pulmonary edema noted on the prior examinations.
The left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely reflects a small-to-moderate effusion and atelectasis, difficult to exclude pneumonia .

He had presented to an OSH with URI-like symptoms one month ago and been treated for CAP with a course of Azithromycin.
He subsequently decompensated into afib with RVR and when he presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Tn was elevated over 2 and he had prominent airspace opacities on CXR.
The patient was admitted to the CCU for hypoxia assumed to be secondary to pulmonary edema and MRSA pneumonia requiring intubation.
The patient was transferred to MICU care given hemodynamics consistent with sepsis, and eventually initiated on HD for worsening volume status and renal function.
The patient was eventually successfully extubated although noted to develop hypoxia previously while awaiting HD over the weekend, and has now completed 14 day course of Vanc for MRSA PNA.
His course has been further complicated by GIB of an uncertain source while on ASA, with EGD showing abnormal gastric mucosa and esophagogastric erosions.
Additionally, he also had very labile and poorly controlled blood glucose.
On [**2203-9-26**], while on medical floor, the patient developed hyperglycemia into the 600s, uncontrolled with NPH, and SOB for 2-3 hours, with oxygen sats dropping to 88% even on supplemental oxygen.
Due to this hypoxia and hyperglycemia he was transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt, HD, and closer monitoring.
Hypoxemia has responded to one session of HD [**9-28**] with 2kg of ultrafiltration.
Patient was initially admitted for atrial fibrillation with RVR to 140s, which required esmolol gtt and diltiazem gtt.
He converted back to NSR with few recurrent episodes of afib, and is now back in afib.
He has not reached target HR but well tolerates high HRs (90-110) and drops SBP when rate control is very aggressive.
- We held ASA for risk of bleed, and started ASA after his repeat EGD which showed normal gastric mucosa.
- Current rhythm afib on high-dose Metoprolol and verapamil, with SBP maintained in the 110s-130s and HR ranges from 80s-90s.
Recent Echo with preserved EF.
Volume overload was present in setting of ARF, he has had 12# taken off during the course of hospitalization.
# Hypoxia.
Hypoxia during hospitalization was secondary to volume overload and later MRSA PNA (see below).
# Hyperglycemia.
# Pneumonia.
Patient had MRSA Pneumonia, initially treated with Levo/Flagyl, now s/p 14 days Vancomycin/Zosyn without evidence of infection.
- We continued chest PT, incentive Spirometry -He had a low grade temp and a slightly elevated WBC, a repeat CXR showed showed a L retrocardiac opacity that most likely was a small effusion with atelectasis, but could not exclude pneumonia.
# Recent GI Bleed.
Endoscopy (EGD) during admission to CCU revealed no active bleeding, but the presence of abnormal mucosa, possible hematoma.
Previously noted mucosal abnormality was not there.
Patient with chronic renal failure secondary to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy as well as s/p nephrectomy for TCC.
On admission, patient was in acute on chronic renal failure and was oliguric.
Impression was patient had pre-renal ARF from poor forward flow in setting of Afib - HD was inititated on Mon/Wed/Fri  .
