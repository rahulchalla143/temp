[**2179-6-28**]: PICC line insertion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old female diagnosed with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma by wedge biopsy in [**2179-2-26**].
On [**2179-5-12**], she underwent ERCP with stent placement for stenosis of the proximal left intrahepatic duct.
CT chest/abd demonstrated a complicated hydropneumothorax with layering debris and moderate exudate adjacent to a 2.5 cm rent in the right hemidiaphram with collapse of the right middle lobe and pleuritis.

Complicated hydropneumothorax with layering debris and moderate exudate adjacent to a 2.5- cm rent in the right hemidiaphragm.
Underlying pleural enhancement indicates component of pleuritis.
Two hepatic drains visualized surrounding right lobectomy site.
These exit in the right lower quadrant.
Three enhancing lesions within the remaining liver, subcentimeter in size, compatible with metastatic lesions.
No contrast-enhanced images are provided.
There is a medium-sized pneumothorax, mostly located at the right subpulmonic level, with a small component at the right apex.
No obvious pleural fluid is seen.
No fistula or leakage was identified in the opacified bowel loops.
The cecum and ileocecal valve were not visualized, an underlying abnormality at the level of the cecum and right colon cannot be excluded.
[**5-29**] CXR: Small right pneumothorax is unchanged.
Mediastinum midline.
[**5-30**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates three right-sided chest tubes.
There is a small apical right-sided pneumothorax, unchanged.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
No left-sided pleural effusion.
[**5-31**] CXR: Small right apical pneumothorax and tiny right pleural effusion unchanged over 48 hours, two right basal and two right upper chest tubes in place.
Mediastinum midline.
[**6-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No short interval change with persistent small right PTX.
No opacification of the intrahepatic ducts was seen.
Minimal residual right pneumothorax and small amount of residual pleural fluid/pleural reaction.
No drainable fluid collection.
On CXR, she was found to have a large PTX on the right and a large fluid collection with a white count of 66,000.
A CT was also obtained which showed a "large right PTX causing RUL/RML collapse, and compression of RLL.
Feculent material within fluid, consistent with empyema.
No shift of MS structures".
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy.
A JP study was done on [**5-28**] which showed communication with the chest; a gastrografin enemawas then obtained which showed transit to the mid transverse colon and with no leak.
She was started on meropenem and vancomycin for VRE in her pleural fluid on [**5-26**].
On [**5-28**], she was also taken to the OR for a Right empyema and diaphragmatic injury with thoracic surgery; the procedure performed was Right thoracotomy, total pulmonary decortication, diaphragmatic defect repair, pleural flap buttress,  intercostal muscle flap buttress and flexible bronchoscopy.
On [**5-31**], the patient's chest tube (posterior apical) was noted to have bilious drainage, confirmed by sending the fluid for a TBili.
She was hence scheduled for an ERCP on [**6-3**], which confirmed a biliary leak likely due to stent migration.
On [**6-4**], she had a CT chest/abdomen performed which showed improvement of her fluid collections and no new focal collections amenable to drainage.
She also had an unsuccessful PTC on [**6-7**].
Repeat chest and abdominal films on [**6-9**] showed progression of contrast to her distal colon and sigmoid and no new cardipulmonary processes.
Cultures were sent, and a CT was done the following day which showed an undrained fluid collection.
She remained afebrile overnight.
On [**6-16**], she went for a repeat CT-guided drainage which showed adequate drainage of this collection.
Pt's chest tube was noted to have decreased drainage on [**6-18**]; hence, a CXR was done which showed a small amount of fluid within the right lateral basal pleural space, unchanged from prior films.
On [**6-25**], a torso CT demonstrated decreased subhepatic fluid collection with appropriate position of pigtail drain and nearly resolved right medial pneumothorax and foci of loculated air along prior chest tube tract.
Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, increased leg swelling, increasing abdominal pain, increased drainage via drain or chest (empyema) tube.
No showering as long as you have the chest tube.
