PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant only for asthma and GERD.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with 3/6 murmur at the right sternal border.
Abdomen is soft and nontender and nondistended.
Extremities: Warm and well perfused with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Chest CT with ascending aortic dissection through the arch to the abdominal aorta.
No pericardial effusion.
In summary, he had an emergent ascending aorta repair with a #28 sidearm Gelweave graft, as well as an AVR with a #25 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor First Name 7624**] pericardial valve.
However, he had a fair amount of bleeding and required several transfusions of packed red blood cells, as well as fresh frozen plasma.
Additionally the patient suffered from persistent fevers, for which he was pan cultured on numerous occasions.
Eventually the patient grew methicillin sensitive staph from his sputum and was treated with appropriate antibiotics.
However, every attempt to turn down his sedation and remove the paralytics was met with increased hypoxia, as well as acidosis requiring reinstitution of these measures.
On postoperative day 9 the patient was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions.
A right thoracentesis was performed on that day and drained about 600 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
A chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax.
Over the course of the next week, the patient continued to make progress with his vent wean, until postoperative day 24, when the patient was strictly on pressure support, he developed a mucous plug, then became bradycardic and ultimately had a short period of asystole.
However, thoracic surgery was also consulted and a trache and PEG were placed on postoperative day 25, following which the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, from which he was DC cardioverted into a sinus rhythm.
Following trache and PEG placement, the patient continued to make progress with his pressure support weaned, and by postoperative day 30 he was having trache mask trials.
