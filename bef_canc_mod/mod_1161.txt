There is trace pericholecystic fluid.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilation, and the proximal common bile duct measures 6 mm.
Acute cholecystitis with gallbladder stones, thickened and edematous gallbladder wall.
A focal area of gallbladder wall thickening is most likely adenomyoma, but malignancy is a diagnostic consideration.

Note is made of a left phthisis bulbi.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with abd pain s/p fall REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: divertic?
INDICATION: Abdominal pain, status post fall.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
The liver enhances without suspicious lesions.
The gallbladder is distended with gallbladder wall thickening and multiple stones.
The pancreas, spleen, stomach, small bowel loops are unremarkable, and there is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a very mild bowel wall thickening of the colon that is nonspecific, and may be related to its collapsed state.
There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
There is a 4-mm thin rectangular metallic object in the deep pelvis, unchanged.
Bilateral inguinal hernias, the left containing small bowel loops, and the right containing a small amount of free fluid is unchanged.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lesions are identified.
Moderately distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall thickening and multiple gallstones, most consistent with acute cholecystitis.
No evidence for bowel obstruction or traumatic injury.
Bilateral inguinal hernias containing free fluid and small bowel loops.
Small left pleural effusion.
Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response   Read by: [**Last Name (LF) 2889**],[**First Name3 (LF) 2890**] K.    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 59 0 90 444/441.72 0 26 21  PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: r/o Myocardial infarction.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2109-8-30**] 8:45 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval for change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man s/p open CCY w/ acute desaturation.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for change INDICATION: Status post cholecystectomy with acute desaturation.
There is persistence of pleural thickening and atelectasis at the left base.
Linear tubular lucency seen inferior to the heart is compatible with postoperative intraabdominal free air, status post open cholecystectomy.
Retrocardiac opacity and slight left lobe opacity, possibly representing atelectasis/volume loss in a postoperative patient.
Left-sided pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
This image demonstrates opacification of the cystic duct and common bile duct with no evidence of stones, other filling defects, extrinsic compression or structural ductal abnormalities.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2109-8-31**] 6:21 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval for aspiration/pneumonia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man s/p open CCY w/ acute desaturation, now s/p intubation.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for aspiration/pneumonia INDICATION: Cholecystectomy, acute desaturation, evaluate for aspiration or pneumonia.
Abdominal free air remains evident.
There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, similar in morphology to the preoperative examination of [**2109-8-23**], and likely representing pleural thickening.
Persistent mild increase in opacity at the left lung base may represent a mild effusion versus atelectasis.
No new opacities are present to suggest aspiration.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2109-8-26**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
**FINAL REPORT [**2109-8-31**]**     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2109-8-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2109-8-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
An US showed acute cholecystitis with gallbladder stones and a CT confirmed a moderately distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall thickening and multiple gallstones, most consistent with acute cholecystitis.
A head CT was performed due to his fall injury and was negative.
GI: An ERCP on [**2109-8-24**] showed the major papilla appeared patulous suggesting recent stone passage.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
The patient was monitored expectantly until his pancreatic enzymes normalized.
Abd: His abdomen remained soft, slightly tender along the incision line and non-distended.
Pain: He was started on a PCA and his pain was well controlled.
ID: A blood culture on [**2109-8-23**] was positive for ESCHERICHIA COLI and he was started on Levo and Flagyl.
A repeat blood culture on [**2109-8-25**] showed no growth.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day for 2 weeks: Please have your blood drawn and monitor your INR.
