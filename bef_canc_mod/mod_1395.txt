Admission Date:  [**2112-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-11-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: DOE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis Pericardial Drain placment and removal Cardiac Cath   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 81936**] is a 54 yo M h/o esophageal ca (dx [**11-22**], s/p 1 cycle of 5-FU and cisplatin and 6 wks XRT) who is status post esophagectomy on [**2112-5-4**] who was discharged home post-op on [**2112-5-11**] and developed progressive DOE over the next week and half prompting him to present to the ED on [**2112-5-22**].
Notably, patient was seen in thoracic surgery clinic on [**2112-5-19**] at which time he was noted to have a moderate sized left pleural effusion.
He did not have shortness of breath of rest but did experience orthopnea.
Prior to presentation he did not have any chest pain.
He denies any recent fevers, chills, coughing, sore throat or nasal congestion.
On [**2112-5-22**] patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service where he underwentleft thoracentesis yielding 1200 cc of dark serous fluid.
Patient's shortness of breath continued despite this intervention so CTA chest was performed that demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
Similarly, a TTE on [**5-22**] showed moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
He underwent c. cath today that demonstrated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg and near equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with early tamponade physiology.
On arrival to the CCU, patient feels that shortness of breath is much improved.
He denies any groin pain or pain in the region of his pericardial drain.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

========== CYTOLOGY ==========  Pleural Fluid [**2112-5-22**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pericardial Fluid [**2112-5-23**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
POST- INTERVENTION There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-5-23**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and no right ventricular diastolic collapse is present (when compared to pre-pericardiocentesis images).
Large pericardial effusion increased significantly from [**4-8**], [**2111**].
Minimal compressive effect on the right ventricle.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right and associated with the compressive atelectasis/collapse of the left lower lobe.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
Probable Paget's disease of the posterior 5th and 10th right ribs, unchanged.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg.
There was near equalization of diastolic pressures of diastolic pressures consistent with early  tamponade physiology.
The mean RA pressure fell to 5mmHg and a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated near complete resolution of the effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old male with locally advanced esophageal cancer s/p chemo and radiation and more recently s/p esophagectomy who presents with progressive shortness of breath and found to have pericardial effusion and left sided pleural effusion which were drained resulting in improvement of symptoms.
# Pericardial Effusion: On [**2112-5-22**] patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service where he underwentleft thoracentesis yielding 1200 cc of dark serous fluid.
Patient's shortness of breath continued despite this intervention so CTA chest was performed that demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
Similarly, a TTE on [**5-22**] showed moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
He underwent c. cath on [**2112-5-23**] that demonstrated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg and near equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with early tamponade physiology.
Most likely etiologies include reactive effusion secondary to recent esophagectomy vs radiation induced effusion.
Infectious etiology less likely given no history of fevers and no elevation of white count.
Pericardial fluid cytology demonstrated no malignant cells and cultures were preliminarily negative at time of discharge.
He has follow up scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his thoracic surgeon.
Prior CXR showed enlarging moderate left pleural effusion and small right effusion.
On [**2112-5-22**] patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service where he underwent left thoracentesis yielding 1200 cc of dark serous fluid and an exudate.
The cultures were prelim no growth and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
# Esophageal CA: Patient is s/p chemo, radiation and esophagectomy.
# Hypotensive Episode: A few hours following pericardial drain removal patient noted to become diaphoretic and have transient episode of hypotension to 84/51.
Notably, he did not have any further episodes overnight or up until discharge.
# HTN: Initially patient's atenolol 50mg daily was continued, however, given that his SBP's were running in the high 90's to low 100's consistently for 24 hours prior to discharge (while on the atenolol) we decided to have him stop the atenolol and follow up with his PCP within the next week for a blood pressure check.
# Microcytic Anemia: Iron studies indicated an Fe of 17 with normal ferritin and TIBC.
Possible this could be 2/2 blood loss from recent surgery.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were having shortness of breath.
Additionally, there was fluid found around your heart and a drain was placed.
You were also found to be anemic and started on iron supplement.
We suggest that you discuss this anemia with your oncologist or primary care physician.
