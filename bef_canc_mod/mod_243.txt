HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 28-year-old female with SLE/lupus, nephritis, end-stage renal disease status post cadaveric renal transplant [**2175-9-1**], complicated by delayed graft function/ATN, biopsy done intraoperatively during reexploration post transplant for bleeding requiring multiple transfusions.
The patient has had multiple admissions in the past since her transplant for abdominal pain and dehydration.
On [**2175-11-5**], the patient was admitted for respiratory distress.
The patient was found to have agonal breathing/unresponsiveness.
The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of FFP, 1 unit of platelets and bicarb in the setting of severe acidosis.
SLE diagnosed in [**2166**] complicated by lupus/nephritis,     anemia, serositis and ascites, currently in remission.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday     and Friday secondary to lupus.
History of VSD status post corrective surgery at age 13.
Restrictive lung disease noted on PFTs from [**2166**].
In [**2173**]     chest CT was with diffuse ground glass opacities.
GERD in [**2172**].
daily for a left axillary thrombus, Rapamune 6 mg once a day, the patient at that time was on Linezolid because of a gram-negative staph urinary tract infection, and on Coumadin for a non-occlusive thrombus of left axillary vein that was documented on [**2175-10-24**].
CT of the abdomen was performed demonstrating a large right-sided hematoma displacing the transplanted kidney anteromedially and inferiorly.
The hematoma is larger compared to the CAT scan that was performed on [**2175-6-29**], but appears smaller compared to the CAT scan on [**2175-9-11**].
A 3.8 cm heterogenous lesion, likely arising from the uterus and probably a fibroid was noted.
There was also diffuse thickening of small bowel wall with a differential of wide and intramural hemorrhage, and there was massive ascites.
Acute renal failure.
Cultures were obtained on [**2175-11-7**], because the patient became febrile which grew out pseudomonas.
CAT scan was obtained postoperatively on [**2175-11-8**], to evaluate the abdomen and hematoma which demonstrated interval removal of the transplant kidney with extravasation of right extraperitoneal __________ .
At the surgical site remains an ill-defined collection consisting of residual hemorrhage and gas and hyperdense perihepatic fluid probably hemoperitoneum.
There was free air present which may be related to surgery.
According to the radiologist, there was nonspecific cecal thickening, new bibasilar consolidations and new gallbladder distention.
The patient was also continued on a Fentanyl patch for pain control.
Infectious disease was consulted for ongoing fever despite being on multiple antibiotics.
The patient had a radial peroneal abscess that was drained.
Infectious disease closely followed the patient and made recommendations without switching antibiotics.
On [**2175-11-14**], central line change was performed complicated by a large left apical and basilar hemothorax.
Another chest x-ray was performed demonstrating marked decrease of left-sided pneumothorax, residual small left apical and basilar pneumothorax.
The patient had another CAT scan on [**2175-11-16**], because of ongoing abdominal pain.
The patient required another catheter for drainage of collection.
CAT scan demonstrated 1) interval improvement in bilateral basal consolidations, 2) there was a collection along the right flank, decreased in size compared to the prior study with catheter in adequate position, 3) there was reduction of gallbladder distention, 4) stable small collection to the right of the uterus consistent with resolving hematoma, 5) stable splenic infarcts.
The patient did complete a 7-day course for a possible mucocutaneous HSV.
On [**2175-11-20**], the patient needed central venous access, and there was successful placement of an 8.5 French 16 cm long four-lumen catheter via the left common femoral vein.
There were no complications.
On [**2175-11-30**], the patient had an open tracheostomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] because of respiratory failure and failure to wean off the ventilator status post tracheostomy tube with a 7 French non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube.
On [**2175-12-2**], the patient had another CAT scan because of abdominal pain and persistent fever.
The size of the subhepatic fluid collection within an     enhancing wall has decreased slightly since the prior     study.
There was a stable appearance of a cystic collection deep     within the pelvis to the right of the uterus not easily     amendable to percutaneous drainage.
There was bilateral lower lobe consolidation which was     [**Year (4 digits) 1506**].
Another CAT scan was performed on [**12-22**] at 1 a.m. because of abdominal pain, and was documented: 1.
The presence of infection cannot be     excluded.
There was a similar uterine mass.
There was ascites and edema.
Improving bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
The patient continued on antibiotics for pseudomonas coverage and VRE bacteremia related to lines and questionable abdominal fluid collections.
Approximately 40-50 ml of blood-tinged fluid was aspirated.
There were no immediate complications.
On [**2175-12-12**], the patient was evaluated for a Passy- Muir valve evaluation, and it was observed that she did tolerate wearing the PMV for 20 minutes with no oxygen desaturation and was able to speak with a clear voice and intelligible speech; however, she then began to cough at the end of the evaluator's exam suggesting either dryness/irritation or possibility of aspiration secretions.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy met with the patient for evaluation and treatment and definitely felt that the patient needed to go to rehab.
On [**2175-12-21**], the patient had a chest x-ray because of ongoing fevers, and the radiologist documented the chest x- ray report as a long-standing interstitial abnormality in the right lower lobe present since [**5-19**].
This probably represents irreversible changes of previous edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, vascular congestion or interstitial lung disease, not an acute process.
Top-normal heart size and dilatation of pulmonary arteries and left atrium are long standing.
There are no findings to suggest further cardiovascular decompensation or current enterothoracic infection.
No pleural effusion.
Pigtail catheter was removed on [**2174-12-21**], and tracheostomy was downsized, and there were no adverse events over night.
She was afebrile with vital signs stable.
The patient is also on linezolid for enterococcus and history of VRE.
If you have any questions or problems with the appointment please Dr.[**Name (NI) 18625**] office immediately.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  This is a 28-year-old woman with lupus nephritis status post renal transplant on [**2175-9-1**], with acute rejection and subsequent graft rupture.
Left pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement.
Respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.
Intra-abdominal fluid collection status post drainage.
