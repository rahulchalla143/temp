LABS ON DISCHARGE:  [**2152-3-2**] 07:05AM BLOOD WBC-7.7 RBC-3.54* Hgb-11.0* Hct-32.0* MCV-90 MCH-30.9 MCHC-34.2 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-247 [**2152-3-2**] 07:05AM BLOOD Glucose-83 UreaN-17 Creat-0.8 Na-139 K-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-31 AnGap-6* [**2152-3-2**] 07:05AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-3.7 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35984**] is a 50 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for IVDU, chronic pain on suboxone, and hepatitis C now admitted for somnolence and concern for clonidine overdose.
# OVERDOSE/AMS: Given transient hypotension and lack of compensatory tachcyardia, concern for clonidine overdose given that this is a known medication for the patient.
Somnolence and small pupils would also be consistent with this toxidrome.
ECG without evidence of AV nodal block, and nothing to suggest that patient had concomitent AV nodal blockade with a beta blocker or CCB.
Suboxone overdose also less likely as pt given naloxone with no effect.
Serial EKGs did not show evidence of QT prolongation beyond his baseline (obtained as QTc of 479 from [**Hospital1 2177**] EKG in [**2149**]).
Outside records from pain clinic and PCP were obtained, which showed that patient has been on the same medications for months and despite occasional substance abuse (cocaine, barbituates), has been off heroin for 14 months.
# HYPOXEMIA: Patient with new supplemental oxygen requirement.
Likely due to alveolar hypoventilation in the setting of CNS depression.
# RIGHT HAND PAIN: Concerning for fracture, although no overt signs of trauma.
Plain films however showed some swelling, but no fracture, which was reassuring.
No overt signs or symptoms of bleeding.
His HCT remained stable throughout admission, so no intervention done.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 35984**],  You were seen in the hospital for being found confused with low blood pressure and low heart rate.
If you experience any confusion, dizziness or weakness please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Room.
