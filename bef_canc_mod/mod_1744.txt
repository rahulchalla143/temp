Admission Date: [**2194-6-13**]        Discharge Date: [**2194-6-18**]   Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with a history of peptic ulcer disease, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2179**] as well as [**2193**], temporal arteritis, who presented with melenas  and chest pain.
The patient reported melanotic stools times 5 since 4 p.m. on the day prior to admission.
No hematemesis or hematochezia.
The patient had a history of melena in [**2192-5-14**].
The patient initially had an EKG with slight inferior changes while the patient was pain free.
The patient then had an episode of [**9-23**] substernal chest pain in the ED with 3 to [**Street Address(2) 94587**] changes in V3 to V4.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2192-5-14**].
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an ulcer in the pylorus and chronic gastritis, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2179**] and [**2193**], benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of temporal arteritis, pemphigoid, history of anemia, history of small bowel volvulus, status post appendectomies, status post inguinal hernia repair x2, history of colonic polyps, and sigmoid diverticulosis.
ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process, so the patient was admitted to the hospital.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AS FOLLOWS:  GI: The patient was felt to likely have another bleeding ulcer as the etiology of his melanotic stools and anemia.
The patient had a history of Helicobacter pylori in the past that was treated.
The patient was felt to require EGD to evaluate for recurrent infection as well as ongoing bleeding.
The patient was taken for EGD on [**6-13**], which showed a deep antral ulcer, no acute bleeding.
The patient has another episode of melanotic stool.
On [**2194-6-14**], he was taken for another EGD, at that time which showed the ulcer was not bleeding.
Cardiac: Cardiac enzymes had been significant for elevated troponin on admission.
Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] who did not recommend cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient initially received heparin and was restarted on aspirin, which was approved by GI as long as the patient had serial hematocrits.
The patient had a couple of episodes of further chest pain during the admission but had no further EKG changes.
Pulmonary: The patient had some desaturations to 70's and 80's with ambulation without improvement with oxygen with ambulation, but at this time the patient was completely asymptomatic and the patient's oxygen saturation recovered spontaneously to the high 90's on room air with rest.
As a result, this was felt to possibly be not reflective of the patient's pulmonary status, but reflective of some peripheral vascular changes with ambulation.
Hematology: The patient with acute blood loss anemia, received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, had serial hematocrits while on heparin gtt and was transfused to keep the hematocrit above 30.
Musculoskeletal: The patient was restarted on his prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.
Demand ischemia, elevated troponins, and EKG changes in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
