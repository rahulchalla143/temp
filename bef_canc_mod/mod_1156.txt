Per her daughter she has had chronic diarrhea with C diff alternately on and off flagyl or vanco, and has had some abdominal pain at her J tube site since it was placed.
UA was positive, although the patient has a chronic indwelling foley catheter.
Urine, blood and sputum cultures were sent and the patient was given vanco, levo, and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
CXR showed no evidence of acute CP process and CT abd/pelvis showed bowel thickening at the sigmoid-descending colon junction c/w diverticulitis versus c diff.
Notably, the patient's HCP is her husband, who was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is having surgery tomorrow, so he cannot sign for her.
Past Medical History: - temporal arteritis with L eye blindness - hypertension, hypercholesterolemia - polymyalgia rheumatica - laryngeal cancer s/p XRT 20y ago and open tracheostomy in [**11-22**] - CVAs - including pontine, R cerebellar x 2 - sigmoid adenoma resection in [**10-22**] - multiple GI bleeds on anticoagulation - failure to thrive with GJ tube placement in [**1-23**] - hypothyroidism - Afib - MRSA pneumonia in [**11-22**] - appendectomy - hysterectomy for fibroids (age 25) - breast lump excision - R knee arthroscopy   Social History: She currently lives at [**Hospital 745**] Health Care Center.
Physical Exam: 96.9,   104/51,   74,   92% on 12L trach mask, 20 Gen: NAD, somnolent, difficult to arouse, denies pain HEENT: no sinus tenderness, NCAT Cor: decreased heart sounds, s1s2, RRR, no murmur Pulm: CTAB anteriorly, transmitted tracheal sounds Abd: soft, tympanic, distended, decreased BS, NT Ext: no c/c/e, venous stasis changes bilat, PT pulses palpable bilat Neuro: pt somnolent and not cooperative with exam .
Studies: CXR: no evidence of pneumonia, aspiration or CHF .
CT abdomen/pelvis: colonic thickening of sigmoid-descending colon junction possibly consistent with diverticulitis versus colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 80 yo woman with a history of several strokes, dysphagia s/p GJ tube placement, laryngeal cancer s/p tracheostomy who presented from rehab after vomiting tube feeds, temperature as high as 102 and desaturation down to 88%.
She was maintained on an oral Vancomycin dose given CT evidence of focal wall thickening at junction of sigmoid and descending colon and the pt's history of recurrent Cdiff.
The pt was also noted to have an Ecoli UTI.
HYPOXIA: The pt was noted to have hypoxia in the setting of likely aspiration with vomiting.
She was noted to have an opacification the left lower lobe which was noted to resolve on a follow-up x-ray.
The pt's CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia, aspiration, or CHF.
FEVER: The pt was noted to have fever and an elevated white cell count in the setting of sputum and urine cultures that were positive for Ecoli (resistant to Levaquin bt sensitive to Bactrim).
It is possible that the pt may have aspirated while vomiting and that she had a concomitant UTI.
DIARRHEA: The pt was noted to have chronic diarrhea which, per pt's daughter, is recurrent.
The pt underwent a CT abdomen which showed focal wall thickening at junction of sigmoid and descending colon.
These findings were thought to be consistent with acute diverticulitis, or possibly colitis given patient's history of c. diff colitis in past.
PERIRECTAL YEAST INFECTION: The pt was noted to have a perirectal yeast infection in [**Hospital 4171**] setting of frequent soiling seconondary to diarrhea.
Of note, the pt does have a history of GI bleeds while on anticoagulation.
HYPOTHYROIDISM: The pt has a history of hypothyroidism for which she was maintaintained onher out-patient dose of Synthroid.
