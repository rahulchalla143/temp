He tells me that he tripped and fell in the bathroom last night but did not hit his head or lose consciousness.
On arrival to the MICU, he was arousable to loud verbal stimuli and sternal rub.
Half an hour later, he became somnolent and not arousable to verbal stimuli or vigorous sternal rub.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be setermined due to inability to adequately visualize the tricuspid valve and any tricuspid regurgitation that might be present.
The right ventricle was not well-visualized but does not appear to be grossly dilated or hypokinetic.
CXR [**2135-2-8**] IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary vascular engorgement consistent with CHF exacerbation.
CXR [**2135-2-10**] IMPRESSION: Improvement in the mild pulmonary edema and right basilar opacity with a persistent retrocardiac opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 47 yo male with obesity hypoventilation and poorly controlled OSA admitted to the MICU from the [**Hospital1 18**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure [**3-3**] to his OSA and obesity ventilation syndrome in the context of not wearing his CPAP at night.
# Bradycardia and atrial flutter: While in the MICU, the patient was found to have episodes of atrial flutter with intermittent block.
# Hypotension: While in the MICU, the patient was initially hypotensive, which was attributed to hypovolemia in the setting of sedative medications (midazolam and fentanyl).
There was a low suscpicion for sepsis, adrenal insufficieny, and cardiac event, as the patient was fluid responsive.
#Somnolence: While in the MICU, the patient was found to be somnolent overnight, likely due to hypercarbia.
The patient was ultimately intubated (see above), and upon extubation his mental status remained at his baseline, without any further episodes of somnolence.
#Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient has a long-standing history of OSA, which has likely led to pulmonary hypertension.
The patient also has a history of being non-compliant with his CPAP at night, which likely accounts for his repeat admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
#Acute Kidney Injury:  The patient's creat on admission was 1.8, and trended down after getting hydrating, making prerenal azotemia the likely cause of his acute kidney injury.
# diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic CHF, with most recent EF 60% in [**2135-2-11**].
The patient was initially thought to be hypovolemia and prerenal and was hydrated.
He was then diuresed, as CXRs showed evidence of pulmonary congestion.
#Erythrocytosis: Likely due to his chronic hypoxia from his OSA and hypoventilatory disorder.
- TSH elevated to 6.1 with normal T4, likely sick euthyroid in the setting of MICU stay.
