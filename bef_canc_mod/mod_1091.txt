Admission Date:  [**2182-5-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-6-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Rifampin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: septic shock and respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year old man who was discharged after a 3 month complicated hospitalization who presents with hypotension and respiratory failure.
His recent medical problems started after he sustained a C7 vertebral fracture in [**12-21**].
His course was complicated by a CSF leak which was repaired, but then followed by development of MRSA meningitis, cerebritis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis, PE/DVT, NSTEMI, acute interstitial nephritis and hypersensitivity desquamative dermatitis believed secondary to vancomycin or rifampin, respiratory failure from pneumonia, ICU neuropathy/myopathy, candidemia, and mental status changes.
He now presents following an episode of depressed mental status and hypotension at [**Hospital1 **].
He had an ABG of 7.14/74/83 on unknown O2 settings and was found to be satting 91% on NRB mask and have systolic pressures from 40-60, so he was intubated and transported to [**Hospital1 18**].

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-18**], there is no significant change.
Slight improvement of a longstanding left retrocardiac atelectasis (less likely pneumonia) and associated effusion.
New right IJ catheter without pneumothorax.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-5-4**] 3:50 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of new fluid collection seen or an area of new enhancement identified.
Focal increased signal seen within the spinal cord at C7 level which could be secondary to myelomalacia.
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
Continued mild increased signal within the posterior soft tissues at the laminectomy site could be due to inflammatory changes without evidence of focal fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Septic shock with respiratory failure from pseudomonas line infection - Pt was hypoxic and hypotensive on presentation and intubated in the field.
He got >10 liters of fluid and SVo2 was >90% despite fluids, so an echo was done which showed no shunt.
ID was consulted and recommended continuing linezolid and cefepime, and obtaining MRI of the neck area which showed no drainable fluid collection.
His previous neck surgeon was consulted and found no signs of infection in the neck area, so the decision was jointly made not to perform LP.
The next day, cultures revealed pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime.
He will be continued on cefepime for 14 days total, and doxacycline indefinitely for MRSA prophylaxis.
2) Sacral decub - wound care was consulted and noted that his sacral decub ulcer had a black thick eschar on sacral decub 9x13 cm, increased from 2-3 cm on last discharge.
3) EKG changes/demand ischemia - The patient was noted to have new inferior flipped T waves on admission, and slightly elevated troponins in the setting of systolic blood pressures to the 40's.
4) Vancomycin allergy with eosinophilia - The patient had a history of severe desquamative reaction/AIN/hypotension and fevers in recent hospitalization to vanco/rifampin.
He received a dose of vancomycin in ED and developed eosinophila, but no evidence of rash or kidney failure.
5) Acute renal failure - He had acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis, but FENA 3.67 so likely had some ATN in addition to prerenal component.
8) code status - His code status was extensively discussed with his family on admission given his poor prognosis.
He was initially "do not shock, no CPR" but this was changed back to full code after personal phone call from daugter morning of [**5-2**].
