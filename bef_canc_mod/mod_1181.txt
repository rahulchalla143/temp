Imaging: [**5-11**] AP CXR PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart is mildly enlarged.
Multiple sternal wires are again seen.
A previously seen right basilar density has improved.
The central pulmonary vessels remain prominent, with no evidence of overt edema.
There is a retrocardiac left basilar density, likely reflecting atelectasis, however, an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Trace blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a trace effusion.
No pneumothorax seen.
[**5-12**] PA-L FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, right more than left.
The pre-existing small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Differential diagnosis includes thrombus versus vegetation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderately depressed left ventricular function.
Compared with the report of the prior study of [**2148-2-7**], there are now pacing wires in the RA/RV and a mobile echodensity is associated with the right atrial wire.
No evidence of abscess in the chest, abdomen or pelvis, as questioned.
7 cm long segment of abnormal bowel wall thickening involving the midline small bowel, which has a dilated appearance and is adjacent to several prominent mesenteric lymph nodes.
This appearance of aneurysmal dilation of small bowel is concerning for small bowel lymphoma.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Diastasis of the rectus musculature.
[**5-22**] Spirus Enteroscopy: Normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid/distal jejunum with Spirus device.
It is likely that the endoscope did not reach abnormal area noted on CT scan.

# Unresolved leukocytosis: The patient presented with a WBC of 17, which downtrended with blood and was initially attributed to bone marrow stress response but then attributed to infection with resolution of the leukocytosis on both GP and GN/Anaerobic antimicrobial coverage.
The day before discharge, he remounted a leukocytosis, which has been attributed to the enteroscopy performed that day; he remained afebrile and without any changes in clinical status.
# Distal jejunal thickening on CT: See CT for full results.
The differential includes a MALT because of the absence of fat stranding and the presence associated lymph node enlargement.
An attempt was made to biopsy the segment by spirus enteroscopy but the lesion was too distal.
# Lower GI Bleed: Presenting Hct was 18, was transfused 4 units of blood in the ICU, and transferred to the floor after reassuring trends were demonstrated in lactate and pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **]; the floorm Hct remained stable until the end of the hospitalization, when the patient required an additional unit for a Hct of 22 with subsequent Hct appropriately increased and stable on discharge.
Diverticulosis (known history) was also considered as was colonic ischemia (leukocytosis, but not abdominal pain).
# [**Last Name (un) **], nephrotoxic, pre-renal: On the floor developed mild [**Last Name (un) **] that showed a trend of stability on discharge.
[**Last Name (un) **] was attributed to nephrotoxicity from a brief interval on Gentamycin, with urine lytes ruling out pre-renal and the patient being clinically euvolemic thereby lowering the possibility of decreased effective circulatory volume.
# Endocarditis: The patient was found to have an opacity on the RV pacer lead concerning of endocarditis in the setting of a low grade leukocytosis (but no fever) and Staph.Epi bacteremia.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin, Gentamycin, and Rifampin before being transitioned to Daptomycin due to nephrotoxicity of Gentamycin in the setting of a delicate fluid balance.
# GNR, Klebsiella PNA bacteremia: After an interval of sterile blood cultures, the patient grew out one culture of K.PNA and was started on Zosyn before being narrowed to Cipro/Flagyl PO.
The etiology of the GNR is indeterminate but thought to be from the segment of thickened jejunum in the setting of selective gram positive antimicrobial pressure from Vancomycin.
PNA was considered but thought unlikely in the absence of any suggestive findings on CT-Chest.
# RUE DVT: RUE US was performed because of a superficial thrombophlebitis that was found; the patient had no symptoms of edema and the RUE DVT exam was ordered as an adjunct to the forearm US.
# Superficial thrombophlebitis R forearm: Resolved with removal of the line and hot packs.
# Transient Hypotension [**5-17**]: Triggered for SBP in the 70s after being overdiuresed the day prior (had missed the torsemide doses 2 days prior, and received double the dose the day afterwards due to concern for his tenuous volume status).
Sepsis was considered in the setting of GNR bacteremia, prompting Zosyn, as was recurrent GI bleed, with rectal showing melenotic stool, prompting GI re-consult.
The patient's pressure rebounded with small boluses and thereafter remained stable.
CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis showed the jejunal lesion detailed above, prompting enteroscopy.
# Chronic systolic CHF: Remained clinically euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic throughout the hospitalization.
# Cough: Presented with an long standing cough attributed to bronchitis; treated with 5 days of Azithromycin without significant improvemend.
# Chronic Anemia: Iron was held in the acute setting of GI bleed because of its confounding effect on diagosis.
# CAD: Serial Trops flat x 3.
**PCP may consider stopping ASA if the patient continues to re-present with GI bleeds in the future if definitive treatment of the jejunal lesion is deferred by the patient and family.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 39857**] - [**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: -Abnormal jejunal segment of indeterminate specificity -Lower gastrointestinal bleed of indeterminate etiology -Endocarditis of the right ventricular pacemaker SECONDARY: -stable chronic systolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your bleed was likely caused by an abnormal part of your small intestine found on cat-scan.
You were found to have a blood infection, which was treated with antibiotics.
You were seen by the heart doctors [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 68714**] your pacemaker; they examined your heart with a camera inserted into your throat and found possible bacteria on your pacemaker wires.
The cause of the infection is unclear.
For this infection you will need to continue antibiotics after discharge.
You developed a second blood infection that may have come from the abnormal segment of your small intestine.
No changes were made to your medications other than as detailed below: START: -Daptomycin intravenous antibiotics -Ciprofloxacin oral antibiotics -Flagyl oral antibiotics -Colace to prevent constipation -Benzonatate for your cough  Have labwork checked as denoted.
