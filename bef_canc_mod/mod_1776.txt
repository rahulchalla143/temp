No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  CXR - IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with prominent interstitial markings; there may be a component of chronic interstitial disease underlying interstitial edema.
No focal consolidation.
Shrunken and nodular cirrhotic liver without focal lesions.
Mild splenomegaly.
Subacute hematoma that is located between the left external and internal oblique muscles.
No active bleeding is identified.
Two small arterially hyperenhancing lesions are identified at the dome of the liver with questionable washout pattern in one of the lesions.
All these lesions should be further characterized with dedicated MR examination.

Brief Hospital Course: 54M history of alcoholic cirrhosis, HCV (MELD 26), who was initially referred to ER for hyponatremia (Na 125) and acute renal failure (Cr 1.8).
[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and a large rectus sheath hematoma.
Alcoholic cirrhosis: Patient was recently diagnosed with liver disease attributed to alcoholism and HCV.
Childs Class C. It seems as though the patient's liver disease has been managed elsewhere.
Liver disease has been complicated by encephalopathy and ascites.
No evidence of SBP on paracentesis.
RUQ ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver without lesions and evidence of ascites.
The patient had a full set of liver labs sent.
A CT of the abdomen showed two small liver lesions that were concerning for HCC.
Hyponatremia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of liver disease.
Acute Renal Failure: This was most consistent with a prerenal etiology based on urine lytes.
Rectus Sheath Hematoma: The patient had a paracentesis that was complicated by a large rectus sheath hematoma of the left abdomen.
The patient continued to drop his blood counts, so a CTA was done to try to localize an active bleeding vessel.
Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D level low on recent labs for screening for transplant.
Tobacco abuse: Patient in pre-contemplative state of quiting and was advised to quit  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - F/U Hct for hematoma - F/U liver lesions, concern for HCC - Follow-Up with liver clinic - Alcohol relapse prevention  Medications on Admission: Patient did not know full medication list.

During this stay, you had fluid removed from your belly that was complicated by a large bruise of the abdominal muscle.
