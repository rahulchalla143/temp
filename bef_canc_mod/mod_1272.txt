Admission Date:  [**2102-5-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-11-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, worsening oxygen requirement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Dialysis  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 41841**] is a 65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural effusions with associated trapped lung who presented on [**2102-5-27**] with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
The patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for approximately one month.
He presented to [**Hospital6 **] center on [**2102-5-19**] at which times he was diagnosed with a posterior STEMI and underwent thrombectomy to the PDA, and three Vision stents to the PDA.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for persistent dyspnea on exertion.
During that admission he was noted to have persistent large pleural effusions but was not considered a candidate for pleurex catheter placement given his need for aspirin and plavix.
His effusions were felt to be secondary to his diastolic heart failure and volume overload from chronic hemodialysis.
He returned on [**2102-5-27**] with persistent shortness of breath without recurrent chest pain.
Reportedly he had a low grade fever at [**Hospital3 7362**].
Exam was notable for decreased breath sounds at the bases.
There was initially concern for pulmonary embolism but the patient refused heparin gtt and CTA.
He denied lower extremity edema, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
His nephrologists have been aggressively dialyzing him for his pleural effusions and he was at his dry weight.
Although he endorsed a low grade fever in the [**Hospital1 3597**] emergency room he otherwise denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or dysuria since discharge.
Since admission he has had a persistent oxygen requirement ranging from 2 to 4 L nasal canula.
He underwent echocardiogram on [**2102-5-29**] which showed improvement of his ejection fraction to 60%, diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
He underwent right sided thoracentesis on [**2102-5-29**] complicated by the development of a small basilar pneumothorax.
600 cc serosangionous fluid was removed and fluid studies were consistent with transudate.
He was evaluated by thoracic surgery for potential VATS decortication and pleurodesis and was felt not to be a surgical candidate.
He first triggered at [**2026**] on [**2102-5-30**] for hypotension and hypoxia with blood pressure of 88/64 and O2 sats of 86% on 3L.
CXR showed reaccumulation of right sided pleural effusion.
He triggered again on [**2102-5-31**] for hypotension to the 60s systolic and somnolence.
Peripheral dopamine is currently running at 20 mcg/kg/min with blood pressures in the 70s systolic.

Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE, BY PROBLEM: 65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural effusions with associated trapped lung who was admitted to the hospital with NSTEMI in the setting of a recent STEMI with stent placement.
His hospital course was complicated by admission to the MICU for refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement.
Most likely etiology would be pneumonia although blood stream infection was considered.
He had a repeat cardiac echo on [**5-31**] which was compared to his admission cardiac echo on [**5-29**] which did not appear to be cardiogenic shock.
His blood pressures improved on vanco and zosyn and he was weaned off levo without complications.
# Pleural Effusions/Hypoxia: From admission, patient with increasing dyspnea and hypoxia thought most likely related to restrictive disase in setting of chronic pleural effusions and trapped lung.
With abx treatment, his oxygen requirement was weaned down to 3L by nasal cannula and dyspnea is resolved.
#Coronary Artery Disease: s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three vision stents complicated by vfib arrest requiring shocks.
Currently chest pain free.
New echocardiogram without evidence of post-MI complications.
EKG with new TWI but no ST segment changes.
He was continued on ASA, plavix and his statin through his hospital course but his antihypertensives were held after he became hypotensive, and restarted (carvedilol and isosorbide).
# Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: He was continued on carvedilol (at lower dose, prescription provided) once his blood pressures could tolerate them.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient was put on heparin gtt as well as ASA/plavix through his hospital course.
# ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant:  HD started back on [**6-2**] once he was liberated from pressor requirement.
# Gout: Stable.
# Recurrent [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
He was treated with fluconazole without complications.
# Depression: Continued on citalopram, increased to 30mg daily.
