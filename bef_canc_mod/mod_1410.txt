Admission Date:  [**2186-3-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-3-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: In brief, Pt is an 86 y/o with a PMH of afib on coumadin, CHF EF 45%, HTN, recently diagnosed COPD who presented with several weeks of SOB and DOE.
Her breathing has been even worse over the last few days, to the point that she gets short of breath even at rest.
Past Medical History: # HTN # CHF # COPD: recently diagnosed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] # stable goiter # afib on coumadin # ?
aortic stenosis # GERD # osteoporosis # basal cell under left eye # s/p resection of childhood tumor "behind heart"  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 **].
[**3-17**] CXR Mild CHF.
Right paratracheal density/mass.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal/inferior hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is increased pulmonary vascular re-distribution and increased bilateral effusions left greater than right suggesting worsening CHF.
The prominence in the right paratracheal region is again seen and it is unclear if this is due to tortuous vessel versus a mass in this region.
The opacity in the retrocardiac region has also increased and it is unclear if this is due to pulmonary edema or an infectious infiltrate.
Pleural calcifications are again noted.
[**3-20**] CUS IMPRESSION: Bilateral 1-39% ICA stenosis with blunted common carotid waveforms consistent with aortic stenosis.
The thyroid gland extends into the superior mediastinum, resulting in mass effect on the great vessels, particularly the right brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid and subclavian arteries, and brachiocephalic veins.
Furthermore, at least one of the thyroid nodules in the right superior mediastinum contains multiple thin flecks of calcium, concerning for neoplasm.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal nodes are also seen.
Further evaluation is recommended, to evaluate for the possibility of a thyroid cancer.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications, aortic valve and mitral valve calcifications, and aortic atherosclerosis.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Mosaic attenuation in the lungs, possibly related to airtrapping.
L1 compression fracture.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system did not reveal flow limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild disease.
The LCx was small without disease.
Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 25mmHg and RVEDP 24mmHg.
The mean PAP was severely elevated at 62 mmHg.
Severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
EKG with ST depression in V5-6 c/w strain pattern, and CXR c/w pulm edema and LLL infiltrate.
She became hypotensive intermittently to SBP 86/60 and got 250 NS b/c low BPs.
She noted progressive orthopnea and possible PND.
# Hypoxia: The primary cause for her hypoxia was likely pulmonary edema in the settting of critical AS.
There was initially concern for possible PNA given LLL infitrate on initial CXR, however she was afebrile and without leukocytosis.
# Critical aortic stenosis: TTE on [**3-18**] revealed worsening of her critical AS with a valve area of 0.5cm2.
Pt discussed options for treatment extensively with her family, primary cardiologist, and the team, and decision was made to proceed with valvoloplasty instead of aortic valve replacement given higher risks of morbidity and mortality with surgery and with the plan that if this failed to improve her symptoms she could still undergo AVR in the future.
Cath showed 40% stenosis in RCA.
Because of the critical aortic stenosis and preload dependence patient's outpatient ACE inhibitor was discontinued.
Endocrine was also consulted, and advised against FNA/biopsy, as thyroid cancer is unlikely given chronicity of mass and normal TFTs.
She was monitored for signs of thyrotoxicosis after cath.
Pt continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic from the mass on day of discharge.
She was advised to talk to her PCP if future symptoms associated with her neck mass arise.
Patient was not adequately rate controlled however did not have room to increase her beta blocker given low heart rate.
# Hypotension: Pt was transiently hypotensive in ED and responded to a 500cc NS bolus.
ACEI was held in the unit secondary hypotension and was not restarted in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
Once hypotension resolved, was was restarted on low dose beta blocker for afib rate control .
# Osteoporosis: Pt continued on calcium, vitamin D and evista.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO four times a day as needed for fever or pain.
of [**Location (un) 1121**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5cm2)status psot Valvuloplasty with valve area improved to 0.65 Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure .
Secondary: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, shortness of breath improved INR 1.8 [**3-28**] Weight 81.4 kg [**3-28**]  Good, hemodynamically stable, shortness of breath improved INR 1.8 [**3-28**] Weight 81.4 kg [**3-28**]  Good, hemodynamically stable, shortness of breath improved INR 1.8 [**3-28**] Weight 81.4 kg [**3-28**]   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
You were evaluated by an echocardiogram, which showed a very narrow aortic valve, likely contributing to your symptoms.
You were seen by cardiothoracic surgery for valve repair but a valvuloplasty was performed instead as it was thought to be easier to tolerate.
You were seen by endocrine and thoracic surgery who did not feel that your thyroid mass needed to be removed or was affecting other major organs.
New medicines: You were started on low dose Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily to help your heart pump better Your ACE inhibitor was discontinued in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and marginal blood pressure Please continue to take lasix 20mg daily.
If you experience any recurrent shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or have chest pain, dizziness, fainting, or other [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69336**] if you have any questions or concerns about your medicines or discharge instructions.
