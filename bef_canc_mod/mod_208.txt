[**2158-2-13**] CT CHEST: Progression of bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions concerning for progression of pneumonia.

[**2158-2-20**] CT HEAD: Left middle cerebral artery distribution infarction without evidence of mass effect or hemorrhage.
[**2158-2-21**] TTE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (Definity contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used).

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2158-2-22**] CAROTID US: No evidence of stenosis on the right.

Brief Hospital Course: 60 M w/ ESRD [**1-18**] Wegener's granulomatosis s/p kidney transplant [**4-/2154**] on tacro/cellcept, severe CAD s/p five-vessel CABG w/ PFO closure in [**2154-12-17**] and s/p multiple previous PCIs,(most recently in [**2-22**]), sCHF (EF=30%), PAF, HTN/HLD gout, and depression/anxiety p/w 3 weeks of productive cough and SOB.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] was admitted from the ED in respiratory distress w/ increasing O2 requirement, likely [**1-18**] post-infectious bacterial PNA given recent admission for Influenza.
There was also likely a component of volume overload that contributed to his respiratory dysfunction given IVF and antibiotics given in ED in the setting of pt's poor forward flow (CHF w/ EF~30%).
Chest CT on [**2158-2-13**] demonstrated bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions concerning for progression of pneumonia.
As ANCA returned moderately positive (see below), patient underwent bedside bronchoscopy on [**2158-2-17**] to rule out bronchial or alveolar hemorrhage.
Bronchoscopy revealed erythematous airways but no obvious hemorrhages.
Unfortunately, during a speech and swallow evaluation the following day, he had a significant aspiration event, which shortly required reintubation secondary to respiratory distress.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Mr. [**Known lastname 18118**] baseline Cr was 2.4 as he is s/p renal transplant ([**2153**]) and his creatinine slowly increased during his admission, with Cr peak at 5.4.
This was thought to be [**1-18**] ATN from poor perfusion due to hypotension and hypoxemia.
Pt's urine sediment was consistent w/ ATN showing muddy brown casts but no acanthocytes indiciative of glomerular injury.
Due to a reported moderately positive ANCA sent from [**Hospital1 2025**], there was concern for recrudescence of Wegener's granulomatosis and patient underwent urgent bedside renal biopsy on [**2158-2-17**].
Cardiology was consulted to determine whether patient could safely go off [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **] for biopsy but given pt's multiple cardiac risk factors and severe CAD, he was kept on [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **], with only SC heparin being held for the biopsy.
Biopsy was consistent with ATN without evidence of Wegener's or rejection, but final pathology is pending.
He should continue to have creatinine monitored as well as tacrolimus trough (weekly) and should follow-up with renal as an outpatient.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pt has hx paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Prior records show that he was initially anticoagulated on Coumadin until [**2153**] when it was discontinued due to severe epistaxis requiring transfusions as well as difficulty controlling his INR.
Pt's rate was initially controlled on home metoprolol 150mg [**Hospital1 **] but he frequently was tachycardic in atrial fibrillation and required some additional IV lopressor.
# LMCA INFARCT: On [**2-20**] while examining patient to determine mental status for potential extubation, it was noted that patient's affect was abnormal, he did not track past midline and was not following commands.
His right side was noted to be weaker than the left and he seemed to have some right-sided neglect but this was difficult to assess given sedation.
A STAT head CT revealed an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, that was likely several days old per radiology without mass effect, midline shift or hemorrhage.
Neurology was consulted who felt the patient's exam was out of proportion to the size of the infarct and that his mental status changes could be secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
Neurology also recommended repeat TTE w/ bubble study which showed no LV or atrial thrombus and no clear PFO although this was a limited study.
He will be discharged on coumadin with INR goal 2.0 - 3.0 and should continue to have coag panel monitored .
# DIARRHEA: Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] suffered from significant diarrhea while hospitalized.
It was felt that this diarrhea was attributable to his immunosuppressant, Mycophenolate.
#Abdominal Wall Hematoma: On transfer from the unit to the medical floor, it was observed that the patient complained of significant pain on palpation of his RLQ (location of renal graft).
Renal US was performed and was initially read as a renal hematoma w/ concern for ?renal aneursym.
Transplant surgery recommended a CT scan which revealed that the hematoma was actually an abdominal wall hematoma with concern for active bleeding from R inferior epigastric artery.
Due to a drop in Hct, the patient was taken for IR embolization on [**2158-2-28**].
He tolerated the procedure well without complication.
# CHRONIC SINUS CONGESTION: Mr [**Known lastname 18118**] main concern on admission was his chronic debilitating sinus congestion which has been evaluated extensively as an outpatient.
He underwent CT sinus on [**2158-2-13**] revealed sinus air cell tickening.
#CAD/CHF: Patient has extensive cardiac history including 5 vessel CABG and multiple PCI as well as a history of CHF.
Lisinopril was held given his renal issues described above.
The patient has an extensive history of depression in the past and is at risk for post-stroke depression.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Atrial Fibrillation with RVR Stroke acute tubular necrosis pneumonia, post-infections bacterial pneumonia, aspiration  SECONDARY: End stage renal disease s/p transplant Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease s/p cagb and multiple PCI Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing which was likely due to a post-infectious bacterial pneumonia given your recent bout of influenza.
You also had a stroke while you were in the hospital and you were started on anticoagulation medications.
Your renal function worsened and you had a renal biopsy which showed acute tubular necrosis.
You were found to have an abdominal wall hematoma and you underwent an interventional radiology procedure to stop the bleeding.
