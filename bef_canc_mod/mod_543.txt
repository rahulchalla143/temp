female with h/o HTN, CHF (diastolic, EF of 55% and LVH on echo [**11-17**]), hyperlipidemia, gout, sarcoid, ESRD on HD who was admitted for thrombectomy of left AV graft.
She has had persistent fevers and Tmax of 103.4.
Dialyzed [**2-24**] through tunneled R IJ line without complication.
Pt appeared more somnolent and tachycardic, so was transferred to the MICU.
Pt denies CP, SOB, diarrhea, abd pain, chills or confusion.
Past Medical History: - ESRD on HD, right upper extremity AV fistula, hemodialysis on  Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, revision AV limb [**1-20**], thrombectomy [**1-21**], placement of tunneled right IJ - Hypertension, h/o left RAS - IDDM - Sarcoidosis with ocular involvement - gout - CHF Echo [**11-17**] LVEF >55%, LVH, mild AS, pulm art systolic hypertension, [**2-13**]+ MR - h/o knee surgery - CVA ~20 yrs ago w/out residual deficits   Social History: The patient lives with daughter, has [**Name (NI) 269**].
No etoh, tobacco or drugs   Family History: Hypertension and diabetes  Physical Exam: Vitals: T - 101.1 HR 87 BP 134/57 RR 18 O2 sat 98% on 2L NC General : Awake, conversing but sleepy, oriented x 2 HEENT: sl dry MM, anicteric sclera Neck: Supple CV: S1, S2 nl, III/VI systolic murmur heard throughout (documented in previous exams) Lungs: CTA b/l Abd: Soft, NT, ND, hypoactive BS Ext: no peripheral edema, warm extremities, palpable thrill RUE AV graft.
Graft site appears clean, no exudate on recently changed dressing, no erythema.
[**2159-2-24**] CXR: No pulmonary edema or pneumonia or pneumothorax.
[**2159-2-27**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo female with ESRD on hemodialysis, gout, hypertension, CHF, s/p thrombectomy of AVF whom postoperatively was found to have fever, tachycardia, somnolence, GNR bacteremia (proteus mirabilis), treated with Cipro with resolution of signs and symptoms.
The patient's right tunnelled IJ catheter tip was also culture positive for Proteus, and this was thought to be the source.
The bacteria was pan-sensitive, and she was treated with Cipro beginning [**2159-2-25**].
It was decided to defer TEE as the patient was clinically much improved and suspicion for endocarditis was low.
This was felt to be due to the acute infection, and mental status improved with treatment of her bacteremia.
During the remainder of her stay, there were no other mental status changes.
# ESRD  :  She was followed by Nephrology and underwent dialysis under usually weekly schedule (T/Th/Sat).
#  HTN/CAD:  no acute issues.
#  CHF: ECHO performed during this admission (to rule out vegetations) showed no changes from previous, EF > 55% but with LVH.
no acute decompensation.
Continued Irbesartan and Amlodipine for afterload reduction.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Right Arterio-venous thrombosis now s/p thrombectomy Proteus Bacteremia/Septicemia Infected hemodialysis line  Secondary Diagnoses: Congestive heart failure hypertension Sarcoidosis diabetes mellitus type 2 end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted with an infection related to your dialysis line.
If you have fever, chills, shortness of breath, or any other new or concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room for evaluation.
