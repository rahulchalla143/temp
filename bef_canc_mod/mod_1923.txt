[**2166-12-19**]: Atrial flutter, rate 71, nl axis, wide QRS, RBBB, ST depression in I, avL .
TTE [**2166-12-9**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20% %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).

His Lisinopril was stopped on admission and remained off due to acute renal failure.
CORONARY ARTERY DISASE The patient had a history of coronary disease and had ST depressions in leads I and AVL on admission.
He had no complaints of chest pain or SOB and these depressions were unchanged on follow-up ECGs.
He did not experience any chest pain or ischemia during this admission.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE Mr. [**Known lastname **] creatinine was 4.9 on admission, likely from poor perfusion in the setting of congestive heart failure.
