Father died of an MI at 54.
Physical Exam: General: Obese male in NAD Skin: Rubor changes distal LE HEENT: EOMI, PERRL NC/AT Neck: Supple, FROM, -bruit (transmitted murmur) Chest: CTAB -w/r/r Heart: RRR w/ SEM Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, obese, +inguinal hernia Ext: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ edema, L arm AV fistula, -varicosities Neuro: MAE, Non-focal, A&O x 3  Discharge General no acute distress Vitals 98.4 F 79 SR, 18 RR, 94% RA sat 132/72  wt 99.4kg Neuro A/O x3 nonfocal Pulm CTA Cardiac RRR Sternal inc no drainage, no erythema sternum stable Ext warm trace edema   Pertinent Results: Echo [**12-15**]: PRE-BYPASS: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No evidence of any perivalvular leak.
The mitral valve has a persitent level of mild regurgitation .
Head CT [**12-16**]: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and ill-defined hypodensity in anterior left frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to motion artifact, however, cerebral edema in the setting of acute brain ischemia cannot be excluded.
Consider performing MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging or CT perfusion for further evaluation.
EEG [**12-16**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a poorly organized and somewhat slow background with multifocal slow transients.
This pattern is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, and/or anoxic etiology, and can also be seen in patients with significant bilateral or deep midline white matter lesions.
No evidence of asymmetries of voltage or frequency were seen to suggest embolic or cortically-based strokes.
No epileptiform features were seen.
No pneumothorax.
There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectases and a probable small left pleural effusion.
Neuro felt like episode most likely related to opioid analgesics.
He had episode of Atrial fibrillation on this day, beta blockers were increased and Amiodarone was initiated.
He continued to have Atrial Fibrillation during rest of hospital course and was started on Coumadin.
On post-op day seven there was some sternal drainage and he was started on antibiotics.
