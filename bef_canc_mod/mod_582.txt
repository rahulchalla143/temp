HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male who has been known to have aortic regurgitation.
The patient was followed by his personal cardiologist and was complaining of worsening shortness of breath at this time.
The patient was diagnosed with worsening aortic dilation and was subsequently referred for cardiothoracic surgical intervention.
Patient denies neurologic, gastrointestinal or pulmonary problems.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Well appearing 68 year old male in no acute distress.
Skin:  Intact, without lesions or abrasions.
Neck:  Supple, nontender, without jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi appreciated.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, IV/VI systolic ejection murmur appreciated.
On the first postoperative day, the patient had quite labile blood pressures, requiring the use of a Nipride drip in order to manage.
The patient was extubated on postoperative day one without difficulty.
On postoperative day number two, the patient began expressing worsening changes in mental status.
A chest x-ray showed a large right sided pleural effusion, which required the placement of a #28 French chest tube to approximately 13 cm within the chest cavity.
The patient also had the onset of worsening respiratory secretions during this time, requiring aggressive pulmonary therapy and frequent suctioning.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2184-5-23**], which showed minimal secretions deep within the bronchial system, but narrowing of the left main bronchus.
The patient required reintubation secondary to agitation and respiratory secretions.
Gram stain from the patient's bronchial washings showed 1+ gram negative rods and 1+ gram positive cocci, and 4+ polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
These organisms were not speciated as they were felt to be representative of commensurate respiratory pathogens.
The patient was, however, started on intravenous levofloxacin in consultation with infectious disease, for prophylaxis of possible infected pleural effusion.
The patient was noted to have intermittent fevers over the following few days, with a maximum temperature of 101.2.
The patient's mental status continued to wax and wane, with episodes of increasing alertness mixed with episodes of worsening disorientation.
The patient's medications which were thought to be contributing to his mental status changes were discontinued.
Given the negative cultures, it was felt that the patient's mental status changes were most likely representative of Intensive Care Unit psychosis.
The patient was afebrile throughout this time, with a normal sinus rhythm of 80s to 90s and a blood pressure of 120s/70s.
On his last two admission days, the patient showed some sun-downing, in which he became more disoriented during the overnight hours, with difficulty in sleeping.
The patient's Lopressor was also increased to 75 mg twice a day for a mildly increased heart rate.
