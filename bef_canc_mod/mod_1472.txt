She also decribed increasing cough above her baseline that is non-productive.
She has also been feeling that she is weak all over and more confused with some difficulty walking.
She also complains of whole body aches.
She has been having increasing difficulty swallowing per family and coughs frequently when taking PO.
She denies any current CP, HA, brbpr, or hemetemesis, difficulty swallowing/difficulty taking PO.
The patient remained afebrile with HR in the 60s-70s.
Her Blood pressure emained elevated around 150s/80s.
Her initial exam was reportedly notable only for crackles in the lungs, but a repeat exam revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Thus, the patient underwent CT abdomen and pelvis, which did not reveal acute pathology.
She also was felt to have a swollen leg, and so underwent CTA, which did not show PE.
Bedside echo was reportedly without signs of cardiogenic shock.
She was found to have an elevated lactate in the ED, which increased to 5.6 but then began to trend down to 5.0 with IVF (she got 1800cc total).
The patient was noted to also have a normal chemistry otherwise except for her elevated creatinine.
She had a slight leukocytosis with normal differential.
She did have a slight elevation in her ALT and AST, her INR was elevated to 1.4.
In speaking to her daughter, she brought her into the hospital for concern for weakness, deconditioned.

[**2136-10-2**] CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
There is mild left base streaky atelectasis/scarring.
There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2136-10-3**] CHEST X-RAY: IMPRESSION:  Status post right IJ central line placement without evidence of complication; worsening heart failure.
[**2136-10-3**] ECHO: Mildly dilated LA and moderately dilated RA.
LV systoli function severely depressed (LVEF 20%) with akinesis of the apex and distal LV segments and moderate hypokinesis remaining seg.
Moderate LV thrombus seen.
RV mildly dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Mod-severe MR and mod-severe TR.
Severe PA systolic HTN (TR gradient 60).
No pericardial effusion.
No PE or aortic dissection.
Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
Heterogeneous nodule of the left lobe of the thyroid as described above.
Atrophic kidneys with multiple indeterminate lesions, some of which are cysts, but many of which are incompletely characterized, so RCC cannot be excluded; MR may be considered for further characterization.
Descending and sigmoid colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Periportal edema and decompressed gallbladder with wall edema, which is a nonspecific finding and may reflect CHF, hyperproteinemia, or hepatic dysfunction.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, possibly reactive.
Benign-appearing but indeterminate lytic lesion in the right iliac bone without evidence of cortical disruption.
[**2136-10-3**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: Minimal cavernous carotid atheromatous disease, otherwise normal  [**2136-10-5**] CARDIAC STRESS IMPRESSION: No significant ST segment changes or anginal symptoms.
No reversible or fixed myocardial perfusion defects.
Decreased left ventricular function with calculated EF of 24% and diffuse hypokinesia.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo woman with ESRD on dialysis, HTN, admitted for 6 weeks of worsening cough, posttussive emesis, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, found to have elevated lactate as high as 8 and new echo with dramatically reduced EF, 3+ TR/MR, mild RV failure, pulmonary hypertension, and LV thrombus.
# CHF:  Pt was found to have new biventricular heart failure (EF 20%) on echo with LV thrombus.
[**10/2134**] TTE which showed systolic dysfunction with EF of 45-50%.
DDx includes recent silent MI  (unlikely given lack of qwaves) or balanced ischemia from 3 vessel disease since stress MIBI was negative (patient is not a good candidate for CABG per discussion with family, nephrologist), chronic deterioration of hypertensive cardiomyopathy, or amyloid cardiomyopathy.
P-MIBI [**2136-10-5**] showed no reversible or fixed myocardial perfusion defects, diffuse hypokinesia, EF 24%.
Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], congestive heart failure may be due to amyloid cardiomyopathy.
- CT of head was negative for any intracranial process, so patient was given heparin bolus and heparin gtt was started for LV thrombus, until therapeutic on warfarin.
- Continued home valsartan, started metoprolol at decreased dose (25mg TID) then uptitrated as tolerated back to home dose - Cont simvastatin 20 mg PO/NG DAILY - Cannot get spironolactone given ESRD - Continue HD for fluid removal qSaTuThu - Thiamine levels were not drawn prior to starting IV thiamine, empirically treating with daily thiamine supplementation as wet beri-beri is on the differential for cardiomyopathy with elevated lactate.
- Consider outpatient workup of amyloid cardiomyopathy.
If cardiac amyloid were present, most likely this would be from ESRD or senile, but have not yet ruled out light chain amyloid.
# LV thrombus:  Apical hypokinesis and severely depressed LV function likely cause.
- Heparin gtt bridge until therapeutic on warfarin  # Elevated lactate: Rose to lactate of 8 on day of admission and then decreased to 1.8 with HD.
- There has been no known infectious process.
Got Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin for one day but was discontinued on HD2 because no evidence of infection.
Continued azithromycin for 4 days for possible atypical pneumonia vs pertussis given history of 6 weeks of severe cough with post-tussive emesis - HIV pending at time of discharge - Hep serologies pending at time of discharge - CT abd/pelvis negative for bowel ischemia, transplant surgery saw and felt no surgical issues - LV dysfunction without hypotension unlikely to cause this kind of lactate elevation.
- Other etiologies include toxic ingestions:  Patient has arthritis and dementia but does not endorse taking increased amounts of over the counter pain medications such as tyelenol or aspirin.
LFTS only mildly elevated.
Sertraline toxicity has been seen in a case study in rats to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and a lactic acidosis so this is a possibility.
Sertraline was held per toxicology recommendations, but restarted with no new elevation in lactate.
No blood in stool to suggest iron or colchicine ingestion.
# Cough: Cough for a few months with some emesis after coughing fits.
Cough improved with diuresis, most likely etiology is pulmonary edema.
Also possibly viral or pertussis given increased incidence recently.
Sent serum studies for pertussis to state since swab will be negative 6 weeks out.
# ESRD on HD TThSa schedule: When she was admitted she had missed a day of dialysis because of fatigue.
# HLD: Kept on home dose of simvastatin  # Osteoarthritis: Home tylenol was discontinued because of concern for toxicity while in the hospital.
# Depression: Held home sertraline in hospital for concern of toxicity and contribution of lactic acidosis.
Outpatient Lab Work 428.0 Congestive heart failure Please check INR on or before [**2136-10-11**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY:  Congestive heart failure, lactic acidosis, left ventricular thrombus SECONDARY:  Hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hypothyroidism, anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 11622**], It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization for congestive heart failure and blood clot in your heart.
- You may wish to consider outpatient workup of amyloid cardiomyopathy as an outpatient.
