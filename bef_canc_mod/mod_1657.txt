She initially ascribed this to gas, but pain persisted over the weekend.
She was trying to wait out her symptoms given PCP appointment this week.
She developed increased SOB on ambulation the day prior to admission.
CTA chest showed bilateral lobar PE and she was started on a heparin drip.
On exam, mildly tachypneic.
On evaluation in the ICU, she reports her pain is 6.5/10.
Past Medical History: endometrial ca s/p surgery and radiation [**2133**] now in remission.
HTN asthma OSA on CPAP hypercholesterolemia obesity chronic back pain h/o spinal stenosis on chronic opiates diverticulitis stress incontinence   Social History: from [**Location (un) 4708**], no smoking or EtoH, lives with son.
Family History: diabetes, htn in parents.

STUDIES: CTA chest bilateral pulmonary emboli in lobar, segmental and subsegmental vessles.
possible pulmonary infarct at right base, no aortic dissection.
CXR Moderate cardiomegaly and general widening of thoracic aorta.
No locat contour abnormalities of thoracic aorta.
No acute pulm congestive appern , no pleural effusion and no acute infiltrates.
Cardiomegaly and widening of thoracic aorta has progressed moderately since previous exa.
Cardiac cath [**9-9**] no obstructive disease .
Echo [**9-9**] EF 70%, mild LA enlargement, moderate RA enlargement, mild LVH, 1+ AR   Brief Hospital Course: This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with chest pain and found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms.
# Submassive pulmonary embolisms: Patient presented with progressive chest pain and dyspnea over several days.
She underwent CTA in the Emergency Department which revealed bilateral pulmonary embolisms.
She was hemodynamically stable with the exception of significant tachypnea and hypoxia.
In the ICU was found to have evidence of right heart strain on TTE and mild troponin and BNP elevation.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT, eliminating the need for IVC filter.
Echo performed showed no evidence of clot-in-transit.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, due to her supplemental oxygen requirement she spent her first three days in the ICU.
Recommend follow up with Gyn/Onc to evualate status of endometrial cancer as this may be a contributor to the onset of pulmonary embolisms.
# Anemia: Patient appears to have chronic anemia with a history of iron supplementation.
# Low grade fever:  Presumed to be secondary to pulmonary infarct in setting of submassive pulmonary embolisms.
Patient had no evidence of infection on UA or CXR.
# Hypernatremia:  Hypernatremia due to hypovolemia given increased insensible water losses with low grade temps, tachypnea and decreased po intake prior to admission.
# Hypertension: Patient has known history of hypertension.
Significant pain/discomfort on presentation likely contributed to elevated blood pressures.
Patient's blood pressure became better controlled with the increase in HCTZ and with management of her pain and dyspnea.
# Asthma:  Patient reported intermittent exacerbations of asthma symptoms during her admission.
# Degenerative Joint Disease:  Patient's osteoarthritis pain was managed with acetaminophen and percocet.
She states this will not be an issue because her pain is well controlled by taking 1 percocet and 1 acetaminophen together three times a day (total of 2475mg acetaminophen per day).
# Enlarged heterogeneous-appearing thyroid:  Incidental finding on CTA on presentation.
Exam revealed an obese neck without clear evidence of thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.
Would recommend further outpatient workup with thyroid function tests and serial exams.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
