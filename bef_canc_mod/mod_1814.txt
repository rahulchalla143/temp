Per report, she had no h/o CHF or asthma.
No reported fevers.
Unclear baseline mental status.
In speaking with sister, then only thing new was that pt had right side pain that she was receiving ultram periodically for.
On [**2123-5-24**] she was noted to have a large R sided pleural effusion, which was tapped 2 days later revealing 1.4 L of serous fluid, with a pgitail in place initially, but ultimately removed.

Blood cultures ([**5-25**], [**5-22**], [**5-21**]):  NEGATIVE Urine Culture ([**6-1**], [**5-25**], [**5-22**]):  Negative Urine Legionella ([**5-23**]):  Negative RRV Swab:  Negative Stool sample ([**6-6**]) C. Diff NEGATIVE  Imaging:  ECG	Study Date of [**2123-5-31**]  7:56:42 AM Moderate baseline artifact.
Sinus tachycardia, rate 103, with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2123-5-26**] the precordial voltage is much higher and the ST-T wave changes noted at that time are less prominent.
CXR ([**5-31**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild decrease in lung volume.
However, no typical signs of aspiration are seen.
Unchanged minimal bilateral areas of atelectasis, persistent right upper lobe atelectasis and atelectatic opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas.
The presence of minimal bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
No pulmonary edema.
EKG: NSR at 91 bpm, NA, NI, no STTW changes with no baseline comparison  CXR: ET tube 7cmm above carina, OG at GE junction, advance 10cm.
There is an unchanged persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
There is increased opacity within the right upper lobe which may be due to collapse.
There is some volume loss within the right upper lobe.
The opacities at the left lung base have minimally increased, the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The position of the right pleural drain is constant.
CXR ([**5-26**]): Uniform opacification in the right lower lung is probably severe right lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis.
Right upper lobe remains collapsed and right pleural effusion is moderate to large, increasing slowly over the past several days.
Heterogeneous consolidation has developed in the left lower lobe since [**5-22**], probably a second region of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Abdominal Xray ([**5-24**]): No obstruction or ileus.
There is continued opacification in the right upper zone consistent with right upper lobe collapse.
Patchy opacification in the right mid and lower zones is again seen.
Complete right upper lobe collpase, raising question of endobronchial plug or mass.
Perihilar right lung opacity could represent asymmetric edema versus pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 yo F with PMHx of L CVA BIBA from her nursing facility for increasing respiratory distress now s/p intubation for respiratory failure [**1-20**] aspiration PNA.
#Respiratory failure: The patient presented with fever and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration PNA.
CXR supportive of RLL/RML infiltrate as well as left retrocardiac opacity which became apparent as the patient was diuresed and has been stable.
She was initially on Vanc/Zosyn for broad coverage, which was switched to Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] and then transitioned to Vanc/Levo before ultimately being placed on Vanc for a 14 day course in order to treat her MRSA PNA.
The patient also had a large right sided pleural effusion which progressed during her initial hospital course and which was believed to be contributing to her difficulty weaning off the vent.
Pleural fluid showed 4+ PMNs without growth and was negative for malignant cells, consistent with a parapneumonic effusion.
Of note, the patient also has right upper lobe collapse which may be old given history of lung Ca; the patient's records regarding her prior chest CT should be compared to see if there any evidence of change or progression of this collapse.
#Hypotension:  The patient's hypotension was likely [**1-20**] sepsis from aspiration pneumonia.
She initially given significant IVF with good response, and was on pressors which were subsequently weaned when the patient's blood pressure stabilized on antibiotics and with discontinuation of sedation for mechanical ventilation.
Given these findings, in discussion with both the patient and the healthcare proxy, it was agreed to go forward with a PEG tube placement, which the patient underwent without complication on [**2123-6-3**].
The patient should be monitored in the future for possible further trial of S&S as she had had a PEG tube in the past, and her swallowing has improved such that it could be removed.
#Elevated BNP:  Patient's elevated BNP likely [**1-20**] volume overload and acute CHF exacerbation given the significant volume of IVF she received on initial presentation with sepsis.
An ECHO performed in house showed a normal LVEF, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, as well as a small pericardial effusion, which was echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There was no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
On discharge from the ICU, she was noted to be 20 L positive secondary to fluid resuscitation during sepsis; throughout her stay on the floor, she continued to received 10 IV Lasix for diuresis.
Upon discharge, she went home with 40 mg PO Lasix, to be discontinued at such time as her total body edema resolves.
Upon her discharge, her bicarbonate was noted to be trending up, consistent with a metabolic alkalosis from contraction, which should continue to be monitored.
#Rapid Heart Rate:  The patient had an episode of HR 170's, and then episodes of HR 140's-150's on telemetry concerning for SVT vs afib, less likely sinus tachycardia vs accelerated junctional rhythm.
EKGs were only obtained with HR's in the 90's and one EKG with HR 119, and these showed sinus tachycardia vs less likely accelerated junctional rhythm, although somewhat difficult to assess consistently due to low voltages.
#Anemia:  Microcytic anemia has been stable in-house, unclear baseline.
No signs of active bleed, most likely marrow suppression from critical illness vs antibiotics.
Her anemia should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
Hemolysis labs were negative, although the patient was noted to have an elevated LDH.
Her iron studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation.
#Elevated LDH: The patient was noted to have elevated LDH at a peak of 600 at one point during her hospitalization, trending down to the 400s.
In addition, there was concern that this elevation in LDH could represent recurrence of her small cell lung cancer; her CT at Tuft's will need to be reviewed, with consideration towards possible treatment/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
Records obtained from that institution documented small cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe s/p cisplatin 4 cycles in [**2119**].
Question of recurrence based on current CXRs, and reportedly had CT chest at [**Hospital1 3278**].

We found a pneumonia which we think was the reason you were having trouble breathing.
This pneumonia was likely the result of food and fluid which you were swallowing going into the wrong tube and down your lungs; we call this "aspiration."
We treated you for your pnuemonia with antibiotics, and you got better.
