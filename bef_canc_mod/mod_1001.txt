Right posterior thoracotomy with creation of [**Last Name (un) 72968**]     window and primary suture repair of esophagogastric     leak.
He has required 1 prior re-operation for anastomotic dehiscence.
This was repaired primarily, and he has had a long convalescence with both a small esophagogastric fistula as well as a pancreatic fistula.
Most recently, he was re-admitted from rehab with a white count of 20,000 and a fever to 102 with bilious drainage from his residual chest tube.
This suggested a possible osteomyelitis or a sequestrum.
On [**2110-11-7**] pt went to the operating room for bronchoscopy, flexible esophagoscopy, and right posterior thoracotomy with creation of [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window and primary suture repair of esophagogastric leak.
During his hospital course the pt was placed on multiple antibiotic regimens due to spiking fevers, diarrhea, and multiple positive cultures from blood, wounds, sputum and drainage.
Hypercalcemia was present throughout most of his hospital course for which he was followed closely by the endocrine service.
Renal function was variable as monitored by BUN and Cr levels.
Antibiotics were renally dosed and adjusted as necessary for renal function.
The pt continued to require large volumes of both crystalloid and colloid to maintain appropriate cardiodynamics and eventually was placed on pressors.
