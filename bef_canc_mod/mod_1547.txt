She was dischared to LTAC on [**6-25**] and was being actively diuresed there with 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] and having received an additional 40mg IV on [**6-30**] for dyspnea associated with e/o CHF on CXR.
Today she was noted to be in vtach and c/o chest pressure.
She became pulsless and received one synchronized shock at 300 J with prompt return of sinus rhythm and spontaneous ciruculation.
A femoral line was placed (given elevated INR and trach).
A bedside ultrasound by the ED resident was notable for what appeared to be global hypokinesis and a full IVC.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 80 with LVH and <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-V6.
She reports minimal chest pressure which is present chronically.
She denies recent fevers/chills or any other symptoms of note.
She reports that the only significant change was realtively aggressive diuresis with IV lasix over the past day and transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs for anemia with additional lasix.
Patient has had a complicated course recently which began in [**4-/2164**] when she presented to the ED with anginal symptoms.
Work-up at that time revealed 3 vessel disease and 90% in-stent stenosis of LCX.
Pt transferred to CVICU post-procedure with course complicated by a right-sided pleural effusion requiring a thoracentesis and complete reexpansion of her right lung, multiple pneumothoraces and subcutaneous emphysema requiring reintubation, and intermittent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation alternating with periods of junctional rhythm requiring pacemarker placement.
Patient was discharged to rehab and was readmitted on [**6-11**] with loculated left sided pleural effusion requiring left thoracotomy and decortication with hospital course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure thought secondary to pneumonia now s/p percutaneous tracheostomy tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Her active problems there included: --hypokelmia --loose stools on vanc po, cdiff pending --anxiety on ativan prn --supratherapeutic INR, coumadin held --Anemia: ob + stool --metabolic alkalosis --delerium, improved on haldol --respiratory failure with complicated pleural effusions, CXR with bilateral fibrosis, effusions --systolic CHF on aldactone, metoprolol, amio reduced and lopressor increased on [**6-29**] --candidiasis with catheter tip positive on fluconazole --anasarca, albumin 1.8 .
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g Chest: decreased breath sounds at bases with faint crackles, soft rhonchi in low/mid lung fields.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2164-7-7**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
MODERATE GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Dual lead left-sided pacer with lead overlying the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle is noted.
Multifocal patchy opacities are mildly improved, especially in the right lower lung zone.
Small left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and smaller right-sided pleural effusion are stable.
No pneumothorax is appreciated.
IMPRESSION: Mildly improving multifocal parenchymal opacities.
EKG [**7-10**]: Atrial paced rhythm with intrinsic ventricular conduction.
Inferiora and anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Q-T interval prolongation.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo F with recent AFib, CABG in [**Month (only) 958**], s/p trach and PEG secondary to repeated respiratory failure, presented on [**6-30**] s/p pulseless arrest, course complicated by klebsiella and pseudomonas pneumonia.
Pneumonia: Patient became febrile on ICU Day # 2.
Tobramycin was discontinued and she was switched to meropenem 2 g every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours, for pseudomonas and klebsiella pneumonia.
If the patient shows signs of intolerance to high dose meropenem (i.e.
Respiratory compromise: Patient has chronic trach in place, on trach mask with intermittent pressure support ventilation.
*Continue intermittent pressure support for respiratory assitance.
Nausea: Patient began to develop nausea on last several days of admission.
Reactive airways disease / Pulmonary Fibrosis: Secondary to radiation from Hodgkin??????s.
Chronic fibrotic changes radiographically.

Initially, felt to be ventricular tachycardia (VT).
Due to poor PO caloric intake during the day, decided to run the tube feeds continuously at 40/hr.

Following this date, PO vancomycin should be discontinued if there are no signs of symptoms of a C. diff infection.
Chronic systolic heart failure: EF~35%, likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Required IV lasix for several days for pulmonary edema.
Microcytic anemia: Previously work-up consisetent with anemia of chronic disease.

You were seen in the hospital after you had a pulseless cardiac arrest, which was treated with an electrical shock.
You were evaluated by the cardiologists, who induced a rhythm called atrial flutter, which did not warrant an implantable defibrillator.
You also developed a pneumonia.
