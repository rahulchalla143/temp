Admission Date:  [**2146-3-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: scallops  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 72 year old male with past medical history of COPD on 3L home oxygen, hypertension, AAA s/p endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm c/b STEMI requiring BMS LM, RCA as well limb ischemia requiring left femoral endarterectomy on [**2145-5-22**] now presenting with increasing SOB, sputum production x2days.
Patient was in USOH when noted gradual onset increased DOE with moderate increase in sputum production though no change in sputum character.
No recent sick contacts, recent travel.
This morning in setting of worsening SOB with associated wheeze checked O2 on home pulse oximeter and noted to be 87% on home 3L so called EMS.
Patient received levofloxacin 750mg, Lasix 20mg IV, Methylpred 125 IV, 2duonebs in treatment of likely COPD exacerbation as well as mild volume overload.
On arrival to the MICU,  patient reports he is feeling better; though wheezy, shortness of breath had improved and is again without complaints of pain.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - COPD- baseline home O2 3LCN - Morbid Obesity - HTN - HL - AAA - Pulm.
nodule - Edema - S/P abd.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and global systolic function.
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT [**2146-3-21**] As compared to the previous examination, there is slightly improved contrast filling, currently no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but a filling inhomogeneity in the lingular artery.
Bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions, bilateral areas of dorsal and perifissural atelectasis.
No evidence of right heart strain.
No enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
CXR [**2146-3-20**] Mild congestive heart failure with bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.cardiomediastinal silhouette consistent with  CXR [**2146-3-25**] Tip of right PICC terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
Improving bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly due to previously provided diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.
Pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing for incomplete imaging of the costophrenic angle regions.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old male with past medical history of COPD on 3L home oxygen, hypertension, AAA s/p endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm c/b STEMI requiring BMS LM, RCA as well limb ischemia requiring left femoral endarterectomy on [**2145-5-22**] now presenting with increasing SOB, sputum production x2days with e/o hypoxic, hybercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure.
Different diagnosis included acute COPD exacerabtion, heart failure, PE, pneumonia.
History was most consistent with acute COPD flare with increased sputum production/change in character as well as increasing dyspnea.
Exam with poor air movement, diffuse wheeze.
No clear viral or bacterial URI as nidus to infection, however bilateral opacities R>L concerning for infection.
CXR with increased interstial markings which raised the question of volume overload; TTE in [**1-17**] with preserved RV and LV function and patient without worsening edema, orthopnea, PND.
Pulmonary embolus was thought unlikely.
He was treated with azithromycin for possible infection and anti-inflammatory properties.
He was diuresed with IV lasix in case of a component of acute on chronic CHF.
He was treated for a COPD exacerbation with methylprednisone, then converted to PO prednisone.
# Positive blood culture: patient had a positive blood culture and was started [**3-23**] on vancomycin.
# Hypotension: [**3-24**] the patient had an asymptomatic, transient episode of hypotension that may have been due to over-diuresis.
He continues to be total-body fluid overloaded and the furosemide can be restarted at rehab.
# Lower extremity edema.
Appears to be a chronic problem as documents in several previous notes including DC summary from [**1-17**].
# CAD s/p STEMI.
Patient without complaints of chest pain.
9. ipratropium-albuterol 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute on chronic diastolic heart failure secondary diagnosis: coronary artery disease hypertension hyperlipidemia morbid obesity   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had difficulty breathing but you improved with removal of excess fluid and with breathing treatments.
