Admission Date: [**2169-8-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2169-8-25**]   Service:   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old man with a history of CAD, CHF, and AFib who presents with increased shortness of breath and a cough over the last week.
At baseline, he has shortness of breath with minimal exertion; just walking to the bathroom.
In the last week his shortness of breath has increased even at rest with positive orthopnea.
He has had a nearly constant cough with productive white nonpurulent sputum.
He notes increased edema in his lower extremities bilaterally.
He complains of mild chest discomfort only with coughing; nonradiating and very difficult from his prior anginal/MI pain.
No dysuria but has had increased frequency of urination on Lasix.
AFib; status post pacemaker placement in [**2168-7-26**]; off    Coumadin secondary to GI bleed.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of    2.0 to 2.5).
Renal artery stenosis.
Carotid artery stenosis; status post CEA in [**2163**].
Pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Chest revealed bilateral crackles halfway up the base.
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
The extremities revealed 3+ edema bilaterally in the lower extremities up to the knees.
No erythema or warmth.
A catheterization from [**2167-7-27**] shows 1-VD, status post RCA stent, severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
A chest x-ray from [**2169-8-17**] shows vascular redistribution in the upper zones consistent with edema; and no effusion.
EKG reveals AFib, V paced at 75 beats per minute, no concordance or ST elevations over 5 mm.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 82-year-old man with a past medical history of CAD, CHF, AFib, and chronic renal insufficiency who presents with worsening heart failure.
The patient was believed to be a [**State 531**]    Heart Failure class 4 given his shortness of breath at    rest.
The patient's dose of Lasix was titrated up, but the    patient only responded minimally.
A repeat    echocardiogram was performed which showed an EF of 30% and    an increased TR gradient up to 60; representing worsened    pulmonary artery hypertension.
Also, he was started on    Aldactone for class 4 heart failure.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient ruled out for a MI    and had no significant EKG changes.
He was not felt to be a candidate Coumadin    given his past history of GI bleeds.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: The patient stabilized his    creatinine at 3.1.
