Admission Date:  [**2185-11-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Ciprofloxacin / Ertapenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Status post airway intubation (performed at outside hospital, extubated here) PICC placement [**2185-11-17**]   History of Present Illness: Hepatologist:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman with h/o Hepatitic C Cirrhosis with portal hypertension s/p TIPS, MELD score 23, who presented to an OSH with altered mental status.
Her father found her on the morning of admission with her legs hanging over the side of the bed.
Otherwise, ROS significant for some nausea.
She was intubated because of failure to protect her airway.
Labs were notable for K of 6.2 and non-gap acidosis with HCO3 of 14.
WBC elevated at 16 with Hct and Cr at baseline.
UA significant for large leukocytes and negative nitrites.
CT Head without contrast revealed vague area of low attenuation in the lft frontal region, ?
related to small vessel ischemia.
There was no evidence of bleed, mass, or midline shift.
CXR revealed vascular congestion.
ROS:  unable to obtain   Past Medical History: Hepatitis C, Genotype 1: Diagnosed in [**2185-1-8**] with last VL 263,000 in [**8-/2185**] Cirrhosis (Methotrexate and Hepatitis C Induced) Portal Hypertension Chronic Kidney Disease with baseline Cr 1.8-2.0 Diastolic CHF: Grade I diastolic dysfunction [**7-17**], EF 75% Ascites Diuretic-Resistant Esophageal Varices per report; however, EGD [**7-/2185**] reports normal esophagus Psoriasis with Arthropathy - s/p Methotrexate x 15 years (MTX d/c in 12.07 when patient developed ascites and now uses halobetasol cream) Anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 Thyroid nodule 2.2cm identified on ultrasound [**9-16**], needs Bx (has f/u in Thyroid nodule clinic) Admission [**Date range (1) 92102**]:  for elective TIPS, also had UTI Admission [**Date range (1) 92103**]:  for hyponatremia and ARF Foot drop from peroneal nerve injury during TIPS procedure (per DC summary) Hyponatremia with baseline Na 128-130 .
No alcohol problems, no drugs.
Face symmetric, mucous membranes moist.
Neck: supple, small thyroid nodule in mid-left thyroid.
CV: S1, S2, regular tachycardia with I/VI systolic murmur at LUSB, non-radiating.
Lungs: clear b/l, no crackles appreciated.
umbilical veins prominent.
Large skin tear on right calf.
Violaceous plaques on chest and raised subcutaneous areas on her right arm.
2+ edema of LE b/l.
Neuro: No asterixis when hands are extended at wrists.
[**2185-11-16**] CT Head without constrast:  No acute intracranial process .
No contrast was administered due to the patient's inability to further cooperate and the marginal renal status.
There is no evidence of infarction.
The MRA demonstrates a dominant and patent right vertebral artery with a tiny, but apparently patent left vertebral artery, and patent internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
The remainder of the study, although limited, demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or other abnormalities.
No evidence of hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Cirrhotic liver, with signs for portal hypertension with a large amount of ascites.
Consolidation within the lower lobes of the lungs bilaterally, most likely represents atelectasis.
However, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Patent TIPS with abnormally high velocities within the mid and distal aspects of the shunt, similar to the previous exam.
Limited evaluation of the left and anterior right portal vein although suggestion of abnormal directionality of flow within the left portal vein is compatible with shunt dysfunction.
Cirrhotic liver with moderate-to-severe perihepatic ascites and cholelithiasis.
[**2185-11-24**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-27**], no major change is evident.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mental status in the setting of Hep C cirrhosis.
# Altered Mental Status: Given her hx of hep C cirrhosis and recent TIPs procedure, her AMS was thought to be most likely due to hepatic encephalopathyy.
She was reported to have a hx of poor compliance with lactulose at home.
Of note, she has not had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.
Given her leukocytosis on admission, infection, particularly SBP or pneumonia, were also considered.
She underwent a paracentesis to eval for SBP, which had a negative gram stain and culture.
Given her AMS, she was considered high risk for aspiration, and she was started on empiric treatment with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin (allergic to cipro and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA vs SBP.
On exam the pt had some focal findings of persistent right-[**Hospital1 **] and downward deviation of her eyes, with inability to track past midline.
She had a repeat head CT and an MRI/MRA which were both without evidence of significant pathology.
Pt seen by Neurology, but had already had significant improvement and no focal findings.
Her CXR here suggested a possible aspiration pneumonia, which could have been [**3-12**] to her AMS.
Bullae, blisters/breakdown, and a  diffuse maculopapular rash on proximal legs and trunk.
The blisters and bullae were thought to be [**3-12**] trauma in the setting of coagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin.
Urine Porphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in the setting of Hep C liver disease and were negative.
The diffuse maculopapular rash appeared to be new, and looks more like a hypersensitivity reaction, likely to ertapenem.
She was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rash on abdomen and lower extremities (avoiding folds), and hydrocortisone 2.5% cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin.
Also, the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt's legs, arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound care as recommended by our wound care team and plastics.
# Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C: Pt was treated as described above with lactulose and rifaximine as well as a PPI, and was followed by Hepatology.
# VRE: Pt had blood culture [**11-16**] which grew VRE sensitive to daptomycin and linezolid in [**2-11**] bottles.
TTE showed no vegetations on [**11-24**].
# Sinus tachycardia: Pt was likely intravascularly dry on admission given Hct above baseline, poor urine output, and tachycardia above baseline, although some level of tachyardia appears to be chronic in her.
Also may be exacerbated by acute illness.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Appeared hypovolemic admission, her diuretics were held as above.
# Chronic Kidney Disease:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0, Cr on discharge 1.5, urine output initially poor on admission, but improved after fluid challenge.
# Thyroid nodule: Should be followed up as outpatient.
# Hyponatremia: Pt has chronic hyponatremia seen on past admission with baseline 128-130.
# Hypercalcemia: Pt had transient hypercalcemia to 10.8 this admission thought to be [**3-12**] Calcium and vitamin D use at home.
# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with thrombocytopenia this admission thought [**3-12**] chronic liver disease.
Please NOTE: patient has changing renal function.
Clobetasol 0.05 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for psoriasis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus Bacteremia Encephalopathy Traumatic Skin Rash Hyponatremia  Secondary: Hepatitis C Cirrhosis Chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, stable, ambulatory.
This was likely due to encephalopathy which cleared with lactulose, and an infection that was found in your blood.
Continuing issues include hyponatremia, which should be managed initially with fluid restriction.
She has had chronic hyponatremia with baseline 128-130 on previous admission here.
Her course has also been complicated by easy bruising and blistering which has necessitated a dermatology consult.
Of note, the patient was hypercalcemic, and found to have elevated PTH level.
