She was subsequently re-admitted on [**2205-7-29**] with on-going left hip pain and underwent debridement and irrigation of a left hip abscess, removal of arthroplasty hardware components, antibiotic spacer placement, with VAC application for wound closure on [**2205-7-30**].
Tissue cultures at that time again noted S.lugdenesis and coagulase negative Staphylooccus.
Her post-operative course was complicate by delirium, hypotension and acute renal failure and episodes of coffee-ground hematemesis without decreased hematocrit (treated for H. pylori infection) and she was discharged to rehab on IV Vancomycin for 6-weeks (on [**2205-8-9**]).
Her most recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was on [**2205-8-12**], at which time she returned from rehab with a decrease in her hematocrit to 22% and evidence of sanguinous drainage from her left hip.
Tissue cultures from her prior debridement had speciated Staphylococcus lugdunensis (similar to her prior hip infection) and her blood cultures from [**2205-8-12**] speciated two species of Staphylococcus epidermidis.

No pneumothorax or other complications are seen.
There are slightly smaller lung volumes on this exam than on previous exam which may account for the slight increase in vascular crowding.
There is also some decrease in the distinctness of vascular vessels which could be consistent with vascular congestion or low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 76F with a PMH significant for coronary artery disease (4-vessel CABG), critical aortic stenosis with bovine AVR (s/p re-do sternotomy for wound dehiscence with rib plating), s/p carcinoid tumor resection, obstructive sleep apnea (on 2L NC at nighttime), history of deep venous thromboses (IVC filter currently not on anticoagulation), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic systolic heart failure (LVEF 40%) and anemia of chronic disease who has a complicated surgical history after a left subtrochanteric femur fracture repair in [**2197**] with subsequent operative site infection, debridement and irrigation of a left hip abscess with hardware removal and antibiotic spacer placement ([**2205-7-30**]) followed by repeat washout and antibiotic spacer exchange for on-going left septic hip joint ([**2205-8-15**]) now presenting from her rehab facility with persistent left-sided hip pain, spacer dislocation and evidence of a larger draining open wound.
Her post-op course was complicated by hypotension with BPs 85/50 requiring phenylephrine and transfer to the TICU from [**Date range (3) 98334**].
She had 750cc blood loss from wound VAC in the PACU and was transfused 3 units PRBC and given IVFs with minimal improvement in pressures.
Her wound VAC was not hooked up to suction, due to a large hematoma and concern for continued bleeding from wound She went back to the OR on [**2205-9-16**] for repeat washout and her post op course was again c/b by hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.
Her wound cultures grew Serratia marcens and E. Coli, for which she was initially treated with Zosyn and subsequently narrowed down to IV ciprofloxacin.
There was concern for possible bacteremia given the patient's hypotension, however her blood cultures were negative.
#Chronic Sacral and right heel decubitus ulcer- The patient was evaluated by the Wound Care Team, and their recs were implemented.
Waffle boots  Site: Coccyx Description: Pressure ulcer, unstageable, slough at wound base Care: Irrigate wound w/commercial wound cleanser, pat dry, apply a thin layer of DuoDerm Gel to the wound bed, cover with Mepilex Sacral Foam dressing; Change dressing every 3 days or prn displacement  # ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY/ CORONARY DISEASE/CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF ( LVEF 45% FROM [**2205-7-28**]) -Continue home meds: ASA 81 mg PO, atorvastatin 20 mg PO QHS.
She did not show signs of volume overload.
#INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS - the patient achieved optimal glycemic control on 6 units NPH at breakfast and 8 units at dinner with an insulin sliding scale.
#HISTORY OF DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS - The patient has a history of deep venous thromboses in the lower extremities in [**2176**] occurring two times(completed 6-months of Coumadin and had repeat DVT occurrence off anticoagulation).
Now she is s/p IVC filter placement with no chronic anticoagulation needs since [**2197**].
Given her high risk for recurrence and immobilization with her hip surgery she was maintained  on Heparin 5000mg TID for DVT prophylaxis and this should be continued for 4 weeks following surgery (last date [**2205-10-17**]).

You were admitted for a left hip infection and you were taken to the operating room for washout and removal of hardware.
Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out at your 2-week follow up appointment.
No dressing is needed if wound continued to be non-draining.
- You have been given medication for your pain control.
As your pain improves please decrease the amount of pain medication.
This medication can cause constipation, so you should drink 8-8oz glasses of water daily and take a stool softener (colace) to prevent this side effect.
