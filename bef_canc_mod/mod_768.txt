Left groin exploration with left common femoral artery arteriotomy and thrombectomy of left superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris artery with bovine pericardial patch angioplasty.
Left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78 year old male with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG x 4/MV repair in [**1-/2133**], 7 cm infrarenal AAA, s/p EVAR in [**2129**], c/b migration of his Endograft with a large type 1 proximal endo leak found incidentally on CTA at the time of CABG.
While awaiting a scheduled repair of the endoleak, in [**2-/2133**], patient developed rupture of the aneurysm and emergent endovascular repair using a uni-iliac graft with occlusion of the contralateral left iliac artery and subsequent right to left fem-fem bypass graft with 8mm ringed PTFE.
He was transferred from [**Hospital3 24768**] for an evaluation of painful left lower extremity concerning for ischemia.
The LLE became incredibly painful at around noon time on the day of admission.
There is no dopplerable PT and DP signal or popliteal signal on that side.
Patient reports significant amount of nausea and persistant severe pain.

EXT: Left lower extremity incisions healing well, no erythema or discharge.
He was ultimately transferred to the medical service for placement of a tunneled line and initiation of long term dialysis.
The coumadin was continued throughout his hospitalization to prevent LE thrombosis and to prevent complications from the patient's paroxismal afib.
He ended up growing E coli from his sputum and ultimately completed a course of cefepime.
Due to persistent confusion TF were continued through POD 15.
The renal team felt that the elevation was due to [**Last Name (un) **] superimposed on chronic renal insufficiency and recommended backing off of the IVF the patient was making good urine.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV V/Z for a possible aspiration PNA.
Pt grew out Ecoli and was switched to a full course og cefepime.
The patient had persistent leukocytosis and loose stools during this hospitalization and blood, urine, and stool cultures were checked, all of which were negative.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, and tolerating a renal diet.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 39721**] Health Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Ischemic Left lower extremity Renal failure Atrial Fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 39719**], it was a pleasure to help take care of you while you were in the hospital.
You came to the hospital because there was an artery in your leg that was blocked.
While you were here, you developed renal failure which required that you start renal replacement therapy (dialysis).
