Admission Date:  [**2179-4-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-10-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male who was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2179-4-15**] for evaluation of a basilar artery aneurysm.
The patient has a significant history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve regurgitation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke, as well as a history of rectal cancer (status post resection and colostomy).
The patient was at his Winter home in [**State 108**] when he experienced two weeks of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest pain.
Because his family lives in [**Hospital1 3494**], [**State 350**] the patient requested transfer to [**Hospital6 2561**] for mitral valve surgery.
As part of his presurgical evaluation, the patient underwent a head computed tomography which was worrisome for fusiform basilar artery aneurysm which was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography to be 1.3 cm X 2.1 cm in diameter aneurysm.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of burns as a child; he has had bilateral upper extremity with skin grafting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Head and neck examination demonstrated normocephalic and atraumatic.
The neck was supple with proptotic eyes.
The lung examination demonstrated good air movement with bibasilar crackles.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended with a functional colostomy noted in the left lower quadrant.
Old burn injuries were noted in both bilateral upper extremities.
Shortly following angiography to fully study the extent of his basilar artery aneurysm on hospital day two, the patient experienced an episode of acute respiratory distress requiring emergency reintubation and was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2179-4-17**].
The patient was successfully extubated on [**2179-4-18**] and continued to demonstrate improving failure signs with aggressive diuresis.
An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained given reports of a positive catheter tip culture at [**Hospital6 2561**] which reportedly demonstrated Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli, as well as a reported recent history of Clostridium difficile colitis.
Although no evidence of bacteremia was noted at that time, the patient was prophylactically begun on perioperative Flagyl for Clostridium difficile prophylaxis beginning on [**2179-4-19**].
A cardiac catheterization conducted on [**2179-4-22**] demonstrated elevated left-sided and right-sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac output.
In addition, moderate pulmonary hypertension with large V waves and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing was noted.
Nonselective renal angiography demonstrated only mild bilateral stenosis (less than 40%).
Following stabilization of the patient's respiratory status, extensive conversations were held with the patient and his family with regard to the risks of additional cardiac surgery given his fusiform basilar artery aneurysm.
The patient was initially weaned and extubated shortly following his procedure; however, he required reintubation for respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation on postoperative day one.
A follow-up chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of volume overload with questionable acute respiratory distress syndrome.
An Infectious Disease consultation obtained at that time recommended starting the patient on empiric Zosyn coverage in addition to his standing Flagyl dosage.
Further consultation with Pulmonary Medicine resulted in continued aggressive diuresis of the patient with good effect.
Further evaluation of the patient's chest film demonstrated the presence of bilateral pleural effusions with increasing evidence of underlying newly diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis.
Intermittent temperature spikes resulted in the addition of vancomycin to the patient's antibiotic regimen with continued aggressive respiratory care.
A screening transesophageal echocardiogram obtained on [**5-5**] demonstrated no evidence of endocarditis as a potential source of the patient's elevated temperature.
Following extubation, an oropharyngeal speech and swallowing study was obtained which cleared the patient for oral intake on [**5-6**].
The patient continued to demonstrate an improving clinical examination and diminishing signs of respiratory distress through postoperative day 13 ([**5-10**]), at which point he was transferred to the floor and admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
A follow-up chest computed tomography demonstrated no evidence of a pulmonary infectious process; however, it did demonstrate evidence of progressive pulmonary fibrosis; right greater than left.
On postoperative day 17 ([**2179-5-14**]), the patient was being planned for transfer to rehabilitation when he demonstrated an episode of tachypnea with associated diaphoresis.
An electrocardiogram and chest x-ray at this time demonstrated no evidence of acute myocardial event or flash pulmonary edema.
On further review, the patient described a history of intermittent left facial ticks; however, a head computed tomography was obtained at this time under the advice of the Neurology Service which demonstrated no evidence of acute cerebrovascular injury.
The patient was noted to demonstrate increasing respiratory status once again with aggressive diuresis and was subsequently cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on [**2179-5-15**].
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further care and management with instructions for followup.
