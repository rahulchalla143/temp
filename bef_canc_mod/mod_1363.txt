**FINAL REPORT [**2114-1-15**]**    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2114-1-15**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Studies: [**2114-1-13**] Chest x-ray - Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is most likely atelectasis, however early developing pneumonia not entirely excluded.
[**2114-1-13**] EKG: NSR, vent rate 100s, nl axis, nl intervals, no significant ST-T changes compared 11/[**2108**].
Bilateral dense lower lobe pneumonias with small reactive pleural effusions (consolidation is denser on the left, however effusion is slightly larger on the right).
Additional scattered more ground-glass opacities as noted above, which may also be infectious or represent regions of alveolar edema in this patient with mild interstitial septal thickening suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Scattered small right middle lobe nodular densities measuring up to 5 mm.
No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
T wave abnormalities.
Since previous tracing of [**2114-1-13**], heart rate slower, and T wave abnormalities less.
[**2114-1-15**] TTECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2114-1-15**] Chest x-ray - IMPRESSION: Increasing right pleural effusion.
Essentially unchanged left lower lobe consolidation and associated effusion.
[**2114-1-16**] Chest x-ray, lateral decubitus - IMPRESSION: Bilateral small pleural effusions.
The right-sided effusion is less than that matches the small amount of pleural effusion demonstrated on chest CT performed on [**2114-1-13**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old female who was admitted with shortness of breath and fatigue and found to have pneumonia and anemia.
# Pneumonia - In the ED the patient was ruled out for a PE with a CTA given her Aa gradient.
CTA showed an impressive bilateral pneumonia.
She was continued on levofloxacin 750 mg for community acquired pneumonia and continued to improve clinically.
She also had an ECHO to evaluate for CHF given an elevated BNP on admission.
Her ECHO was largely unremarkable except for an elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, likely secondary to pneumonia.
The patient had an episode of acute chest pain during/immediately after the ECHO.
Her chest pain was most likely a result of movement and pleural irritation from her pneumonia.
She was given morphine IV, tylenol, and ibuprofen with resolution of her chest pain and no further episodes.
As a result of this episode, consideration was given to tapping her pleural effusions to rule out empyema and AP and decubitus chest x-rays were performed, however, it was felt that there was too little fluid to tap, the patient's chest pain resolved, and she continued to improve clinically.
Given the severity of the patient's pneumonia, it is recommended that she have a follow-up chest x-ray in two months to evaluate for resolution.
# Anemia - On arrival to the MICU, the patient received 2 additional units of blood and her hematocrit increased appropriately to 20 and she remained hemodynamically stable.
The anemia was also evaluated with haptoglobin (nl), nl folate, nl B12 and reticulocyte count which was appropriately elevated.
Iron studies demonstrated iron deficiency anemia but with an elevated ferritin.
The patient has never had a colonoscopy previously and they recommended a colonoscopy as an outpatient given trace guaiac positive stools in the ED and the uncertainty around the acuity of the patient's anemia, though she denied melena or BRBPR.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**2-1**]  Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing for 4 weeks.
Pneumonia 2.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and anemia.
You were given an antibiotic for the pneumonia and five red blood cell transfusions because of the anemia.
You will also need further evaluation of your anemia as an outpatient.
You were also given a prescription for an inhaler to help with shortness of breath and wheezing.
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you develop fevers, worsening shortness of breath, worsening cough, chest pain, or orther concerning symptoms.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**] and ask for a fellow booked procedure.
