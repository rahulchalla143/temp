Admission Date:  [**2202-8-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-10-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2163-8-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: CC: fever, mutism  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis [**2202-8-6**] Lumbar puncture [**2202-8-10**] Cardiac catheter [**2202-8-31**] Paracardiocentesis [**2202-9-1**]   History of Present Illness: 38yo M w/ ESRD on HD, h/o PTLD, bipolar disorder, and recent bout of sepsis and Cdiff, p/w fevers and altered mental status.
Husband notes that she was exhibiting "fleeting clarity", as if she were delirious with changed sleep patterns and increasing anorexia.
On the day prior to admit, she saw her psychiatrist who recommended admission given changing psychiatric picture and continued low grade fevers.
Overnight she had fever to 100.6 and the morning or admit she states that she felt SOB and had a cough.
At the ED she complained of abdominal pain, but denied nausea.
Work-up revealed a new LLL infiltrate on CXR and resolving colitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.
She specifically denies pain everywhere, except for her stomach.
Of note, pt was just discharged on [**2202-7-28**] after a week long hospital course that was notable for sepsis, requiring a central line, fluid resuscitation and IV pressors in the ICU and complicated by C.Dif colitis.

No etoh, no tobacco.
Sclera anicteric.
III/VI systolic murmur throughout the precordium.
No wheezing or rhonchi.
No rebound or guarding.
No appreciable hepatomegaly.
2+ pitting edema up to mid shin bilaterally.
STUDIES: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:10 PM There is a posterior segment left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
No effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.
Nonetheless, finding is consistent with remote head MRI dated [**2196-11-12**].
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  W/O CONTRAST; Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM As best can be determined due to limitations in technique, no significant interval change with the exception of likely improved wall edema suggesting healing colitis.
Given lack of source for fever, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis cannot be excluded.
There has been interval worsening of body wall edema and anasarca.
Improvement of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
Subpulmonic effusion vs ascites.
Moderate to large pericardial effusion with thickened and questionably hyperenhancing pericardium as detailed above.
Slight increase in size in right-sided pleural effusion.
Pericardial tamponade.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-9-6**] 6:01 PM Interval increase in size of left pleural effusion and decrease in the right pleural effusion.
Right lower lobe atelectasis and left retrocardiac opacity.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-9-7**] 9:29 AM No acute intracranial abnormalities, although the evaluation is limited due to the lack of gadolinium.
ECHO Study Date of [**2202-9-9**] Small echodense pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2202-9-21**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process with near complete resolution of previously identified effusions.
Diffuse soft tissue swelling.
Cardiac transthroacic echo [**2202-9-22**]: Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 38 year old female w ESRD on HD, history of PTLD, bipolar disorder, and recent hospitlaziation with of sepsis and C difficile, now presented fevers and altered mental status.
# Altered mental status: Patient presented to the hospital with a slow mental decline since the previous admission.
There were not focal findings on neurological examination.
LP performed on the patient was also unrevealing for a source of her mental decline.
They suggested the use of IV ativan might help a patient with catatonic depression.
Ativan was titrated to 1 mg po TID with great improvement in speaking, however she continued to be confused and agitated.
Repeat MRI on [**2202-9-7**] confirmed global atrophy inconsistent with age, but no other identifiable abnormality.
# Atrial fibrillation - During the patients hospitalization, she had an episode of tachycardia to 180s on [**2202-8-12**] [**2-19**] Afib with RVR.
An echo performed after the episode was normal and did not show any structural heart disease.
She had no further episodes until [**2202-8-30**] when she went into atrial fibrillation while being evaluated for large pericardial effusion and concern for tamponade.
She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and started on amiodarone and spontaenously converted to sinus tachycardia.
Since that time she has been hemodynamically stable and in sinus rhythm without further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
She was given 325 mg of aspirin but no anticoagulated given her low risk of embolic event.
Aspirin was discontinued after she had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation for one month, and the reason for her atrial fibrillation appeared clear, due to the effusion, which had resolved upon repeat echo on [**2202-9-24**].
# Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion - on [**2202-8-31**] pt referred for pericardiocentesis of a large pericardial effusion in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
On [**8-31**] the patient became progressively hypotensive requiring pressors and urgent pericardiocentesis.
Pt had a successful pericardiocentesis with aspiration of 480 cc of bloody fluid.
Work-up failed to reveal a cause for the pericardial tamponade.
# Fevers - Upon admission to the hospital, the patient reported a history of fevers.
A large workup for the source of her fevers was completed in house.
A chest xray performed on admission, showed a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Despite obvious source, she intermittently had low fevers during her admission.
Paracentesis performed on [**8-6**] was unrevealing for source of fevers.
LP also did not show any evidence of infection.
There were no localizing findings on physical exam and the patient did not complain of any specific symptoms.
Hematology and oncology was consulted to evaluate for evidence of a return of her lymphoproliferative disease.
On [**2202-9-8**] she did have a positive C. difficile culture and was treated with an extended course of flagyl.Patient continued to have low grade fevers, usually post-dialysis, however developed a higher fever on [**2202-9-21**], with lower than usual blood pressures.
She was transferred to the MICU and her urine cultures grew citrobacter freundii complex at that time.
Erythema noted on one leg was thought to be possibly cellulitis, so she was also treated for cellulitis with a course of vancomycin.
At time of discharge, after returning from HD pt had a transient temperature to 100.4 which resolved without intervention.
#Pneumonia - Seen on inital chest xray.
All antibiotics were discontinued after a 14 day course without return of pulmonary infiltrates on repeat CXR.
# C. Difficle:  Patient had been on treatment for Cdiff with flagyl since previous hospital admission.
She was not having diarrhea upon admission but the flagyl was continued as originally prescribed at last discharge.
Her stool was serially monitored for C.dif given intermittent diarrhea and she did have a positive c. difficile culture on [**2202-9-8**] and was again started on flagyl.
Given her difficulty with repeated infections, and recent antibiotic use, she will continue on flagyl until [**2202-10-26**].
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine at 125mcg PO QD (new dose per endocrinologist).
TSH was mildly elevated at admit at 5.3, but given recent change in medication, she was continued on her outpatient dose and TSH was monitored.
# ESRD: Pt has history of ESDR [**2-19**] lithium toxicity, with history of failed renal transplant.
At times during dialysis, the were unable to remove fluid from her because of low pressures, thought to be secondary to continued poor oral intake.
On [**2202-10-8**] transplant surgery placed an AV fistula in the right upper extremity.
After the procedure the pt some overlying erythema which resolved with elevation.
# POST-TRANSPLANT LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER: Discussed with hematology and oncology team during admission as a possible source for her fevers and new onset pericardial effusion.
They believed it was highly unlikely that her lymphoproliferative disease was recurring.
Known history of ITP, as well as on several psychoactive medications and a PPI with possible contribution of platelet suppression.
All medications were continued given that the potential harm of discontinuation did not outweigh the benefit of increased platelets given she was never low enough to require transfusion or be at risk for spontaneous bleeding.
# Elevated PTT: Pt was noted to have an isolated elevation in PTT in the week prior to discharge.
Consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and complicated by ESRD status.
During her hospital stay ([**2202-9-10**]), her TIBC, iron and ferritin were evaluated and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
She was noted to have guaiac positive stools occasionally which was attributed to small ammount of blood loss with chonic diarrhea of C. Diff colitis.
# Leg edema: Patient had marked leg edema secondary to large amounts of fluid given while in MICU and CCU to support pressure, in addition to poor nutritional state with low albumin.
The edema was improving at time of discharge, and patient wore compression stocking and kept legs elevated when possible.
# Mobility and conditioning: Physical therapy worked with patient to increase her mobility and maintain and increase her endurance.
