He also has a h/o intermittent anemia believed to be [**3-16**] GI blood loss with EGD in [**2100**] and colonoscopy x2, most recently in [**2101-4-12**].
On [**9-5**], the patient was noted to have passed moderately sized clots per rectum and had BRB in her stool.

Patchy opacity at the right lung base may be due to atelectasis, although an aspiration or focal pneumonia cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
R Foot Xray [**9-6**]-IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic radiographs due to profound diffuse osteopenia and flexion deformity of the digits.
Within those limitations, however, there is suggestion of changed and abnormal morphology involving the second middle phalanx which may be due to underlying osteomyelitis.
Please note, not mentioned above, severe degenerative change is again evident at the first interphalangeal joint similar to the prior exams.
CT C/A/P [**9-6**]-No acute intra-abd or pelvic process, specifically no e/o diverticulitis or obstruction.
Bibasilar consolidative opacities could be atelectasis, but infection or aspiration also possible.
[**9-7**] Duplex LE US FINDINGS: PVRs were obtained throughout the right lower extremity.
[**9-8**] KUB:  no air under the diaphraghm.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: The patient is an 82 y/o male with multiple medical problems including h/o anemia likely secondary to slow GI bleed who presents with BRBPR and hematemesis.
Most likely UGI source given presence of hemoptysis and coffee-ground material on G-tube lavage.
GI Bleed-The patient presents with clots per rectum and small amounts of hematemsis.
Hemodynamically stable but found to have coffee-ground material on G-tube lavage.
Medium internal hemorrhoids were noted on colonoscopy [**5-/2101**] and Colonoscopy [**10/2100**] showed adenomatous polyp in the sigmoid colon as well as diverticulosis of the whole colon.
Patient had upper endoscopy preformed by GI which showed Thin layer of old blood present over stomach.
However, this was thought likely secondary to remnants of his recent GI bleed since his HCT remained stable at 31 range.
Healthcare Associated Pneumonia - Mr. [**Known lastname 26237**] was found to have right lower lobe consolidations on CXR upon admission.
Started on ceftriaxone in the ED, but there was concern for Hospital acquired pna as patient was arriving from a nursing home.
He had no fevers or cough several days prior to discharge and was sent to rehab after completion of 6 days of IV antibiotics.
Bacteremia- Contaminant:  patient's blood cultures from addmision grew out GPC in clusters in [**2-15**] bottles this was felt to likely be contaminent, since no other blood cultures returned positive.
A transthoracic ECHO was obtained which did not show evidence of vegetations.
Right toe ulcer: Patient was noted to have a eschar on the 2nd distal phalangial joint of the right foot.
Given history of previous amputations, PVD with stenting vascular surgery and podiatry were consulted.
Duplex ultrasound of right lower extremity was preformed which showed significant outflow arterial insufficiency at the level of the mid calf.
Patient's plavix was held in setting of GI bleed (in addition, it was noted that he has not been taking plavix at rehab).
Xray of the foot on [**9-6**] did not show evidence of osteomyelolitis and podiatry did not request further imaging.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 1.5, up from baseline 1.0-1.1, likely in setting volume depletion.
Patient was volume resuscitated with total 5 units packed red cells and crystoloid fluids with an improvement in creatinine to 1.1-1.3 at time of discharge.
# Rash:  Patient was noted to have an errythematous rash on his abdomen surrounding the site of his PEG tube.
Appeared to be superficial candidiasis improved with topical miconazole cream.
Patient became tachycardic to the 140s and was restarted on his home dose of 50 mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] with an improvment in his heart rate to the 80s.
Pending: Blood cultures from [**9-8**], 7/29/ [**9-10**], [**9-11**] pending  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1)  patient had stents placed in his right lower extremity in [**2100-5-13**].
Plavix is currently being held in the setting of his GI bleed.
Should continue daily and fu with GI outpatient.
4) Right lower extremity: pt will follow up with both podiatry and vascular for his arterial insuficiency.
