Admission Date:  [**2148-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-4-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Zosyn / Morphine / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: ascending cholangitis pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2148-1-24**] ERCP   History of Present Illness: 65M with alcoholic focal pancreatitis in [**2143**] with suspicious vessel invasion, atypical cytology with distal CBD stricture, sphincterotomy and wallstent placement [**4-/2143**] with last ERCP [**11-16**] for stent occlusion admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with Increased LFTs, abdominal pain, nausea/vomitting, chills, and BCx growing strep (?pneumonia).
Has had four hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis.
Transferred on lovenox and clears from [**Hospital1 **]   Past Medical History: Pancreatic CA s/p metal stent placement [**2145**] HTN Asthma Diabetes Cholecystectomy Esophageal stricture  Social History: retired maintenance technician for the [**Company 2318**].
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Upon Discharge: VS: 98.9, 97.4, 62, 112/70, 22, 93 GEN: WEll, NAD, Alert HEENT: NCAT CV: RRR LUNGS: CTAB ABD: SOFT, NT, ND EXT: No edema   Pertinent Results: CT TORSO [**2148-1-22**]: 1.
Bilateral multifocal ground glass opacity which appears new from same day chest radiograph.
Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, atypical infection, or aspiration.
Biliary dilatation in the context of a metal stent.
There are also multiple discrete hypoattenuating lesions within the liver parenchyma.
Interestingly, extensive peripancreatic soft tissue abnormality present that has mostly resolved.
There are no focal bone lesions.
The fact that the patient originally presented in [**2143**] with pancreatic abnormalities and there has been no progression of disease would argue against the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
As such, given the presence of cholangitis, the discrete hypoattenuating lesions in the left lobe of the liver could represent small microabscesses.
No significant intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
XRay L ankle [**2148-1-27**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse abnormalities which could reflect Charcot foot related to a systemic neuropathy or could potentially be the sequelae of old injury with secondary arthritic changes.
No definite superimposed acute fracture is identified, but a subtle injury would be difficult to detect given the diffuse abnormalities.
With this in mind, correlation with any previous outside radiographs would be helpful to assess for interval change.
A CT of his torso was obtained, which was consistent with ascending cholangitis and pneumonia.
A speech and swallow eval was obtained who recommended 1:1 monitoring and small amounts of thin liquids.
Atrial Fibrillation: On HD 4, the patient went into atrial fibrillation and he was rate controlled medically.
He again went into a-fib on HD 7 and was seen again on the floor by Cardiology who recommended using 50mg metoprolol q8hrs and increasing ammounts as tolerated for tachycardia providing his BP is stable.
However, given his upcoming operation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-8**], it was decided to hold coumadin and anti-coagulate the patient with heparin or lovenox.
Left Ankle Pain / Poor ambulation: The patient has a history of Charcot arthropathy, and developed worsening ankle pain on HD 6.
An ankle xray was performed showing chronic changes withouth evidence of accute injury.
He was seen for fitting of an ankle brace by NOPCO, but he refused the brace.
