Pt has a [**4-10**] month h/o worsening CP and dyspnea on exertion, even occuring with slight exertion over the past week.
Pt had a CABG in [**3-/2171**] and was doing well without any CP or SOB on exertion until 4 months ago when he began to develop worsening CP/SOB on exertion.
Pt now having CP/exertion with slight exertion including several steps, or 1 flight of stairs.
Pt had a P-Mibi today which a showed reversible, moderate to severe apical defect involving the LAD territory along with septal akinesis and an EF of 62%.
CAD s/p MI in [**2153**] s/p CABG in [**3-/2171**] (SVG -> distal RCA, SVG -> LAD, SVG -> OM1).
ETT today with reversible apical defect in LAD territory (see full report below).
HTN 3.
Bladder CA s/p excision 9.
No elevated JVP.
No s3 or murmur.
EXT: No edema bilat.
Pertinent Results: [**2172-12-22**] 05:20AM BLOOD WBC-5.8 RBC-3.34* Hgb-10.6* Hct-30.0* MCV-90 MCH-31.7 MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-219 [**2172-12-22**] 12:15PM BLOOD PT-12.6 PTT-26.9 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2172-12-22**] 05:20AM BLOOD Glucose-121* UreaN-29* Creat-1.5* Na-142 K-3.9 Cl-105 HCO3-28 AnGap-13 [**2172-12-22**] 03:36PM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.3 [Hgb]-DONE [A1c]-DONE  Brief Hospital Course: Following a Persantine MIBI that showed a reversible, moderate to severe apical defect, he was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for hydration prior to cardiac catheterization.
Selective coronary angiography on [**12-22**] revealed a right dominant system with severe three vessel including left main disease and occluded vein grafts.
The LAD had severe diffuse disease with a 90% ostial stenosis and a 80% stenosis in the mid LAD after a large D1.
The LCx had a 70% ostial stenosis with diffuse disease in the proximal and mid portions.
The RCA had 70% ostial stenosis with a 40% stenosis in the mid vessel and diffuse 0% stenoses in the PDA.
An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function(greater than 55%) with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
The aortic valves were mildly thickened with only mild aortic insufficiency.
A carotid ultrasound showed mild to moderate stenoses of both internal carotid arteries, measuring between 40-59%.
Due to severe adhesions from prior operation, incomplete revascularization was performed.
This was decided prior to the operation with near future plans for percutaneous intervention.
He experienced episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics.
On postoperative day three, he returned to the cardiac cath lab for percutaneous intervention.
Successful stenting of the left main, circumflex, first diagonal and right coronary artery was performed without complication.
