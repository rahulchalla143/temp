Found to have a right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Then, on [**2178-1-17**] at about 10 p.m. he developed severe bilateral lower abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum times three at home and times two in the Emergency Room.
He denies nausea but vomited once after GoLYTELY in the Emergency Room.
He had no change in shortness of breath.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**1-/2175**] complicated by the PA laceration.
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy six years ago but has had recently increasing prostate specific antigen and was scheduled for an outpatient bone scan.
History of perioperative pulmonary embolism.
Atrial fibrillation sinus rhythm with Amiodarone.
Hypertension but has recently been hypotensive.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease and negative history for peptic ulcer disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea but does not tolerate continuous positive air pressure.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
Trach placement for suctioning and oxygen requirement in 07/[**2176**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with coronary artery disease.
In general, he is well developed, well nourished male; awake, alert, and oriented times three; in no acute distress.
Oropharynx is slightly dry; no lesions.
Neck is supple; no lymphadenopathy; trach catheter in place; no jugular venous distention.
Chest:  With referred breath sounds on the right; left with firm rales, no wheezes.
Heart is regular; normal S1, S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended; positive tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant severely and tender to palpation generalized throughout.
Positive bowel sounds; no rebound or guarding; guaiac positive with red stool.
EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline; no other ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on [**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum and anemia.
Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and polypectomy.
Patient had a negative EGD and then had a colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of previous polypectomy.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright red blood per rectum was noted.
Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright red blood per rectum.
q. day regimen which he continued even as an outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as in his previous admission.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's respiratory status was stable and at baseline.
Patient was eventually able to have a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony changes.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in [**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting disease.
Patient's aspirin was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted [**2178-1-27**].
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a history of [**Location (un) 260**] filter and right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
His hypercoagulable state is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper and right lower extremity.
Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.
Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.
The right upper extremity did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but no progression or change from previous studies, and this otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.
Blood loss anemia.
History of deep venous thrombosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post prostate cancer.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good; patient ambulating with 2 liters oxygen requirement at home; patient with stable hematocrit of 31; no further events of bright bleeding per rectum; pain well controlled.
