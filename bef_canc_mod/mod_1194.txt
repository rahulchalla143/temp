Also noted to have altered mental status and rigors, so was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
Wife has noted increased confusion from baseline (typically mild cognitive impairment and confusion when he moves from [**State 108**] to [**State 350**]) x 1 week.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was admitted to the ICU for further workup of AMS, rigors, and low grade fevers (100.8).
Initial concern for UTI given recent instrumentation of the bladder (bladder tear s/p repair in [**State 108**] recently) and dirty UA, but UCx was negative.
Patient noted to have elevated AP, as well as biliary sludge on Abd U/S and ?obstruction on CT abdomen, concerning for cholangitis, started on Zosyn for empiric coverage.
Hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was complicated by hypotension (SBP 90s), for which the patient was given some gentle IVF with improvement of pressures.
He developed flash pulmonary edema and responded well to Lasix 20mg IV x1.

- Pus, sludge, and debris was seen coming out of the bile duct after stent removal.
- Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
- Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
- There were possible filling defects suggestive of sludge and debris in the bile duct.
[**2128-4-20**] CT head Technically limited study.
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect .
Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Mild to moderate cardiomegaly with aortic and mitral valve, coronary artery calcifications, and calcification along the inferior myocardial wall of the left ventricle.
Pneumobilia with double pigtail biliary stent with one end of the stent appearing to open within the duodenum and the other appears to end in the common bile duct.
Dilated pancreatic duct up to the ampulla with ill-defined soft tissue around the pancreatic head, unclear if this is secondary to technique or due to recent procedure; however, recommend dedicated imaging to rule out presence of pancreatic mass such as multiphasic MR if the patient is able to optimally breath-hold versus consideration of dedicated multiphasic CT.  5.
Aortobifemoral stent with occlusion of the native aorta and common iliac arteries.
Worsening vascular congestion, with possible mild edema.
Moderate right pleural effusion with right basal atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old man with h/o CAD s/p MI [**2095**], Afib on Coumadin, CMP EF 45%, s/p AAA repair, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, cognitive impairment, HTN, HLD, biliary obstruction s/p biliary stent placement and revision in [**2126**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with altered mental status and fevers.
Ascending cholangitis: This was the most likely cause of his sepsis, altered mental status, and fevers.
He had elevated AP and e/o biliary sludge and possible obstruction on abdominal imaging.
During ERCP, a previously placed metal stent was removed; pus, sludge, and debris was seen coming out of the bile duct after stent removal.
As below he was transitioned back to zosyn when his mental status worsened, concerning for active infection.
Acute renal failure: Cr 1.6 upon admission, up from baseline 1.0.
Likely prerenal in etiology, but possible ATN from recent hypotension as well.
Patient only given small boluses of iv fluids given report that he developed flash pulmonary edema with gentle hydration at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
Altered mental status: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, with agitation at OSH requiring ativan and haldol.
Likely multifactorial etiology in an elderly patient with mild cognitive impairment at baseline - infection, ICU delirium.
Per family report, he has had delirium at home, with falling asleep mid-sentence, etc.
Physical therapy evaluated patient and determined he would benefit from short term rehab.
Patient was noted to be confused, lethargic and minimally responsive.
The patient was also noted to have a new leukocytosis concerning for infection.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
UA was concerning for UTI which was the presumed source of his confusion.
Mental status improved and leukocytosis resolved.
# Pancreatic mass: CT of the patient's abdomen and pelvis was concerning for a possible pancreatic mass vs changes consistent with his previous ERCP.
Acute on chronic CHF: Pt flashed after small fluid bolus at OSH.
After receiving IVF, pt was found to have some intravascular cogenstion on CXR.
Coumadin was held for procedure, was restarted thereafter at a decreased dose of 1mg by mouth daily given history of supratherapeutic INR and concominant treatment with augmentin.
CAD/PVD: Patient was off ASA since [**3-4**] for hematuria and bladder tear.
However, given his severe vascular disease, benefits of ASA likely outweigh the risks.
Continued BB and held Lisinopril initially given recent low BPs and [**Last Name (un) **].
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an cholangitis, which is an infection in your bile duct.
When this is scheduled, someone from the GI department will call you with an appointment.
