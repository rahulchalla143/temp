The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Pulmonary hypertension cannot be reliably assessed given degree of TR.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
CT HEAD: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial mass effect, edema, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct, or acute hemorrhage.
Hypodensities are present in the supratentorial white matter and the inferior right lentiform nucleus, likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
Intracranial vascular calcifications are seen.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is marked cardiomegaly.
There is no pneumothorax or consolidation.
Opacity in the left lung base may represent atelectasis, pleural effusion or penumonia.
There is no free air in the abdomen to suggest a bowel perforation.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is a moderate amount of ascites fluid within the abdomen, which measures up to 20 Hounsfield units in density.
The fluid could be proteinaceous or serosanguineous given this density.
Marked atherosclerotic disease involving the abdominal aorta and extending into the SMA.
Marked cardiomegaly and a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 22924**] is an 81 yof with h/o DM2, CHF, CKD, AF (on coumadin), p/w unresponsiveness and found to be hypoglycemic (BG<20).
Her MICU course was significant for diuresis and treatment of UTI (CFX).
# CHF/tricuspid regurgitation/pulmonary HTN - Based on patient's report, her CHF had been exacerbated over the past few months, with an increase in weight and swelling of her LE/abdomen.
The history of her heart failure is not completely clear from history, but is likely a longstanding issue.
Echo from [**9-19**] revealed dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction, preserved left ventricular global and regional systolic function, severe tricuspid (+4) regurgitation, and small pericardial effusion.
# DM: Pt.
with episode of hypoglycemia precipitating admission, with acute mental status changes.
Unclear as to why patient became hypoglycemic - poor po intake, change in medications, CHF exacerbation, etc.
Now with elevated glucoses post-extubation, presumably from improving renal function and increased clearance of insulin.
# CKD - Patient's baseline Cr is 1.6 to 2.2, and it has been elevated upon admission, trending downward with diuresis and equillibration of fluid status.
# AFib - Patient is on Coumadin (2mg MWFSat, 1mg TuThurSun), with target [**1-16**] INR.
Also on Metoprolol for rate control.
Her INR became elevated to 5.
# Anemia ??????
GI was consulted for possible colonoscopy, but as her INR was elevated and her HCT stabalized they opted to wait until her INR came down.
Did not want to give FFP in setting of diuresing for heart failure.
# Hypernatremia - Na has been elevated, 149 to 142 on am of transfer, with this am at 145.
Patient has had minimal PO intake and was initiated on D5W@125cc/hr by MICU team.
# UTI - +proteus UTI, cipro resistant, completed course of ceftriaxone.
# AMS ??????
# Gout/RUE pain and weakness - Per family, the pain is old.
The patient is reporting an increase in weakness since this hypoglycemic episode, but it does not seem to be worsening.
She was not having any symptoms in house.
