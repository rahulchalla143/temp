Over the past few months she has had pain at the site of her decubitus which has escalated.
She reported no chest pain, pleuritic pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
She has a recent admission at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 17594**] with SOB after [**Date range (1) 2286**].
She also had left shoulder pain which was diagnosed as supraspinatus tendonitis which was treated with prednisone and dilaudid.
Of note: Her CXR was unchanged from prior studies, and a CT ABD, Pelvis demonstrated air tracking from her decub site.
She had an episode of hypotension (SBP 80's, baseline 90s) which was treated with IVF fluids.

Restrictive lung disease  Social History: Lives at home with husband and 16 year old son.
Family History: Brother with SLE and DM  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Gen: Uncomfortalble, sensitive to touch in lower legs.
Swollen face with cachectic arms and legs.
No hepatosplenomegaly apprecated.
L Bandage across lower leg.
Swollen lips, with periorbital swelling.
No rubs or murmurs.
Shallow breaths, with basilar crackles but no rubs or rhonchi.
Slight distention of abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Mobile fluid above knee with tender quadriceps tendon.
Point tenderness over the medial and lateral aspect of the elbow.
There is generalized marrow signal abnormality throughout the pelvis and heterogenous marrow re-conversion sparing the epiphyses and apophyses, related to the patient's debilitated state.
Even allowing for this background abnormal marrow signal, there is focally increased marrow signal on fluid-sensitive sequences at the sacrococcygeal junction, especially at S4-5 and the proximal coccyx (9:30).
There is also fluid surrounding the sacrococcygeal junction, with pre-sacral fluid in contiguity with background ascites also seen on recent CT. Diffuse anasarca, and soft tissue edema are also again seen.
The vertebral discs demonstrate slight degenerative signal and endplate irregularity at the lumbosacral junction.
Sacral decubitus ulcer with gas in the gluteal muscles and possible right paramedian sinus tract.
Sacrococcygeal junction marrow abnormality and overlying edema without osseous erosion, but highly concerning for osteomyelitis.
CT LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.
INDICATION: 32-year-old female with left elbow joint effusion and left lateral elbow pain.
There is no definite fracture and no dislocation, bone erosion, or focal osteolysis.
There is an equivocal subtle lucency through the anterior aspect of the radial head, extending to the articular surface, likely representing a nondisplaced fracture, best seen on the sagittal series 702A images 106-111.
No other fractures are seen, generalized osteopenia limits evaluation.
There is generalized soft tissue edema, consistent with anasarca.
Subtle nondisplaced radial head fracture.
Findings of fracture were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17595**] on [**2180-7-3**] at 12 p.m.  MMD  Addendum [**2180-7-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - There is possible linear lucency, but no definite fracture and no displaced fracture.
Demonstration of a possible nondisplaced fracture is markedly limited by the surrounding osteopenia.
LEFT KNEE MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17596**]  INDICATION HISTORY: A 32-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, lupus, on hemodialysis, with severe knee pain and limited flexion.
Evaluate for quadriceps tendon pathology or rupture.
There is a large joint effusion, with evidence of synovial proliferation, indicating presence of synovitis.
There is trace bone marrow edema in the lateral femoral condyle (3:18), likely subchondral reactive change suggesting overlying cartilage abnormality versus small contusion.
There is markedly abnormal signal in the bone marrow of the femur and tibia, which does not extend into the epiphyses, demonstrating high T2 and low T1 signal.
Similar changes were seen on the MR of the pelvis on [**2180-6-29**].
There is marked soft tissue edema in keeping with anasarca.
Large joint effusion and synovitis.
Diffuse soft tissue edema which is nonspecific, but consistent with anasarca.
Articular cartilage abnormalities, as above, with adjacent subchondral edema versus small contusion in the lateral tibial plateau.
Diffuse bone marrow signal abnormality.
The differential is extensive, but given the multifocal nature of the abnormality, it may represent changes of renal osteodystrophy Discharge Labs: [**7-5**] WBC 7.7, Hct 34.3, Plt 157 [**7-4**]: 134/4.5/94/27/45/5.9<103 Ca 6.7, Mg 2.4, Phos 6.0 [**7-5**] CK 22   Brief Hospital Course: 32 y/o female with complicated past medical history with SLE with decubitus ulcers admitted for fever and pain control.
Hypotension: She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and potential sepsis.
Her basline blood pressure typically is SBP ~ 90's.
Stage IV decubitus sacral ulcer:  After exploration of her wound, there was fibrinous tissue and sacral bone.
There was concern for osteomyelitis based upon an elevated ESR and MRI imaging.
Wound cultures grew out E. coli and Enterococcus.
She had several low grade temperatures on the floor, but never developed hypotension.
L Knee: MRI demonstarted a joint effusion with synovitis.
L CT Elbow CT scan: Concern for non-displaced fracture at radial head.
Ortho was consulted for possible brace, however they felt there was no need at this time for intervention or stabilization.
Her pain continues to improve on her current regiment.
Her current regiment of Fentanyl Patch 75 mg q72h, Dilaudid 8 mg q4 PRN pain allows her to rest comfortably without oversedation, or hypotension.
For wound changes in the hospital she received Dilaudid 1-2 mg IV.
Recently her Calcitrol dose was changed from 0.25 to 0.5 mg, due to a PTH level of [**2176**] and CT findings consistent with osteopenia.
Her calcium level has remained low so she was not restarted on her cinacalcet.
Due to her infected decubitis ulcer, we opted to treat her synovitis with local steroids.
Seizures: Per her old records she has tonic clonic seizures.

PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for Constipation.

[**Month/Day (2) **] to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for wound care to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17597**] [**Name (STitle) 1007**] [**Doctor Last Name **]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Stage Four Decubitus Ulcer  Secondary Diagnosis: ESRD Oteopenia R Knee Synovitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for low blood pressure and the ulcer on your back.
You were evaluated by several surgical specialists as well as infectious disease physicinas who felt that your ulcer would heal with proper wound care and antibiotics.
You also were evaluated for knee pain and L elbow pain.
Your knee pain was due to inflammation surrounding the knee.
Your elbow pain was due very weak bones.
