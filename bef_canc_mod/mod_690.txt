2)BILAT UP EXT VEINS US ([**11-26**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left upper extremity.
There are stable areas of low signal in the left frontal and right occipetal/temporal lobes.
Interval resolution of previously noted posterior white matter abnormalities.
Stable prior areas of hemorrhage within the left frontal and right occipital/temporal regions.
Brief Hospital Course: 24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension who presented with abdominal pain and headache and was admitted for hypertensive urgency.
EKG showed no change from prior, and Abd x-ray showed a suggestion of RLL/R diaphragm haziness.
The patient had no symptoms of end-organ damage.
Hypertensive Urgency: Pt had had hemodialysis one day prior to admission, so unlikely that she was volume overloaded.
Unclear what precipitated this episode of hypertensive urgency, although suspect secondary to abdominal pain leading to an anxiety which then precipitates hypertension.
Per renal team recs, labetalol was increased to 800mg TID due to poor blood pressure control.
Pt had recent CT scan during prior admission which did not show source of abdominal pain.
On admission, LFTs were normal except for slightly low albumin, lipase was slightly elevated and KUB was negative for free air or evidence of SBO.
Peritoneal fluid was negative for malignant cells but showed reactive mesothelial cells, macrophages, eosinophils and lymphocytes.
Negative gram stain or peritoneal fluid cultures, excluding SBP as a cause of the abdominal pain.
Pt was continued on PO dilaudid 1-2mg Q6h and pain resolved.
She denied N/V/diarrhea or constipation.
Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and could have very well been the etiology of this admission.
Although pt stated she was taking her current medications, she did report increased anxiety which can lead to medication non-compliance and hypertension.
Headache NOS: Pt complained of R-sided HA for several weeks, radiating to R jaw where patient had previous tooth extraction.
Right upper extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.
She did not have any focal neuro findings, no visual deficits.
It was felt by the pain service that her HA did not fit migraine, tension type HA or rebound HA.
MRI/MRA showed interval resolution of previously noted posterior white matter abnormalities and stable prior areas of hemorrhage within the left frontal and right occipital/temporal regions, but very limited MRA as above.
No evidence of acute bleeding.
