REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for PE or other pulmonary pathology CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM, [**2185-1-9**]  INDICATION: 51-year-old male status post intubation, with hypercarbic respiratory failure, with new significant A-a gradient and failing to wean from ventilator.
Assess for pulmonary embolism.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 2.5 mm axial images were obtained from the lung base to the apex following the administration of 150 cc intravenous Optiray bolus per CT pulmonary angiogram protocol.
FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison.
Study is somewhat limited secondary to patient's body habitus.
Central filling defects are identified within the left descending pulmonary artery (series 2, images 55 through 57), compatible with pulmonary emboli.
There is no dilatation of the thoracic aorta.
There are no enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals bibasilar consolidation, as well as partial consolidation within the right middle lobe.
Findings could represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No discrete pulmonary nodules or mass lesions identified.
Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals degenerative change of the thoracic spine.
Filling defects within the left descending pulmonary artery, compatible with pulmonary emboli.
Consolidation within bilateral lower lobes, and the right middle lobe.
Considerations include atelectasis and/or pneumonia.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.3 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Aorta - Valve Level: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.5 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 240 msec  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-1-13**] 10:07 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o SAH  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with h/o pituitary tumor, recent PE on heparin (therapeutic) now with severe L sided HA, no neuro deficits appreciable.
INDICATION: History of pituitary tumor with severe left-sided headache, no neuro deficits.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient is status post pituitary tumor removal with a large postoperative sellar lucency.
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
There is copious fluid within the left frontal, left maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses.
Copious fluid in multiple left-sided sinuses including maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid.
Admitted for respiratory failure, likely [**2-10**] PE exacerbating baseline poor function.
Pt also has obstructive sleep apnea, Pickwikian syndrome/Obesity Hypoventilation (on CPAP & supplemental O2 at home).
- maintained on CPAP at night and periodically during the day; did well on the floor with no additional episodes of respiratory compromise after extubation - anticoagulated (see below) .
Acute Renal failure - improved with hydration.
Headache/Sinusitis: On the floor complained of HA pain and congestion with facial TTP concerning for sinusitis.
Dry cracked feet & toenails: At risk for infections & deterioration given borderline diabetes and habitus.
Low MCV and iron studies c/w Iron deficient -- On iron -- no record of colonoscopy - should have one as outpatient (malig can even explain a hypercoag state leading to PE).
9.FEN: Seen by Nutrition, given recs for weight-loss/DM/cardiac diet.
Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) ML PO Q8H PRN as needed for cough for 1 weeks.

Notify a doctor or nurse in case of chest pain, difficulty breathing, weakness, numbness, tingling, lightheadedness/loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or other concerns.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Hospital6 1129**], Wednesday, Febraury 8th at 3:30pm; we recommend you discuss with him getting a colonoscopy if you have not had one, as you had blood in your stool at one point during your hospitalization.
