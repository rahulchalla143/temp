At rest he did not have any symptoms, but yesterday his headaches were significantly more pronounced and he had nausea/vomiting.
He went to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an approximately 4 x 5 cm left cerebellar mass with resulting effacement of the fourth ventricle and enlargement of lateral and third ventricles.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin on right side, slightly slower on left upper and lower extremities  On Discharge: Neurologically intact, no focal deficits, denies HA.

Differential diagnostic considerations include hemangioblastoma, hemorrhagic ependymoma or a vascular lesion likely cavernoma.
Head CT [**11-9**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no interval change in the size and mass effect of the complex, multilocular and hemorrhagic left cerebellar hemispheric mass measuring 3.5 (AP) x 5.1 cm (TRV).
No definite new focus of bleeding is noted.
The degree of mass effect and effacement of the 4th ventricle, as well as the secondary hydrocephalus is unchanged, and there is no transependymal migration of CSF.
Left cerebellar mass, unchanged.
No evidence of high flow feeding vessel to the mass, but there is a possibility that the mass effect of the hematomas are compressing these vessels.
These findings together are suspicious and merit investigation with catheter angiogram.
The spectroscopy failed due to susceptibility artifact from hemorrhage within the lesion.
While there is no increased flow on perfusion imaging, this may be due to tamponade effect of the hemorrhagic components.
Recommend conventional catheter angiography to rule out a high flow lesion prior to surgery.
Brief Hospital Course: 25M admitted with large L cerebellar mass with obstructive hydrocephalus.
On [**11-9**] he had a third ventriculostomy which was done without difficulty.
Neurologically the patient was stable and does not have any deficits.
