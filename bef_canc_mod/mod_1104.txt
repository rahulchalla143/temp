Admission Date:  [**2157-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-8-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-1-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish / Flexeril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**] Chief Complaint: # Lethargy # Confusion # Hyponatremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: # MICU intubation # L arm PICC placement # Bedside [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube placement # Fluoroscopy-guided [**Last Name (un) **]-jejunal tube placement   History of Present Illness: 48F h/o Hep C cirrhosis c/b ascites, encephalopathy and BLE edema, presented to clinic with lethargy, Na = 113.
Pt denied any recent alcohol or drug intake, and reported that she had a productive cough with somewhat yellow sputum.
In the ED, she was oriented x 2, with positive asterixis.
On first arrival to the floor, pt denied fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, bloody stool, joint pain, muscle pain, sore throat, or changes in vision.
It was unclear whether pt endorsed or denied nausea as her account changed, and she was not focused during the interview.
# Tobacco: Past [**Month/Day (2) 1818**] with 10 pack-year history # Personal: Single with one child.
Family History: # Mother, 60s: DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia # Father, d. 51: COPD, alcohol-induced cirrhosis # Brother  Physical Exam: VS = T 97.1, BP 106/50, HR 83, RR 26, O2 96%, FS 148 GEN: Tremulous in bed with covers pulled up and eyes closed throughout the interview HEENT: Scleral ictera, MMM, CN II-XII grossly normal CV: RRR, S1S2, III/VI SEM, no r/g PULM: CTA @ L, decreased breath sounds at R base, no rales/rhonchi/wheezes ABD: BS+, soft, NT, protuberant, no rebound.
# CXR [**2157-7-9**]: Multifocal patchy opacities seen in the left upper and lower lung zones, with cardiomegaly.
This may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, aspiration/pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Minimal intra-abdominal ascites.
Persistent bilateral patchy opacities more confluent in the bases, greater on the right side.
Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant interval change.
The diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs are grossly unchanged.
The left patchy opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
A persistent right pleural effusion is noted.
The study is limited secondary to patient's inability to breath-hold.
There is a large right pleural effusion.
Color flow imaging demonstrates a patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow though velocities cannot be measured secondary to respiratory motion.
There is trace ascites in the pelvis, but inadequate for paracentesis.
Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 48F h/o HCV cirrhosis, admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 with hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and questionable respiratory symptoms.
# PNA: As pt reported syptoms of productive cough, admission CXR was obtained which demonstrated RUL infiltrate suspicious for infection.
To cover the possibility of aspiration PNA as pt's hepatic encephalopathy persisted, abx were broadened to vancomycin ([**7-9**])/pip-taz ([**7-9**])/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 11067**]).
Serial chest xrays every other day showed gradual interval improvement.
On [**7-9**], HD#3, patient c/o increasing SOB, with RR = 30, PaO2 = 61 on 4L NC, PCO2 = 33, pH 7.44.
Repeat CXR demonstrated new L upper and lower lung infiltrates and likely volume overload.
Pt's acute respiratory compromise was considered to be possibly multifactorial, with contributions from asthma exacerbation, PNA, fluid overload, and possible TRALI.
TTE performed in the MICU demonstrated hyperdynamic EF, enlarged LA, and no evidence of pulmonary HTN.
# Adrenal insufficiency [**1-7**] liver failure: Pt was initially maintained on her home regimen of prednisone 5 mg daily.
Upon transfer to the MICU, stress dose steroids were administered in the setting of infection, respiratory compromise, and pt's background adrenal insufficiency.
# HCV cirrhosis: On admission, pt's MELD was 27.
On [**2157-7-21**], pt was removed from the transplant list given respiratory compromise but was relisted after transferring back to the floor.
# Hepatic encephalopathy:  Pt was given regular doses of rifaximin, lactulose PO, and lactulose PR, titrated to achieve four bowel movements daily.
Pt was placed on pureed foods with sips of thin liquids only after a bedside speech and swallow noted no active aspiration, but the need for precautions.
Pt was noted to become hypernatremic (Na = 155) in the MICU after aggressive diuresis, and therefore NGT free water was given with normalization of Na.
# DM2: Pt's blood glucose was controlled with HISS, with home regimen of glipizide first reduced and then ultimately held out of concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of hepatic dysfunction.
Pt was placed on glargine 12 units at bedtime to provide basal glucose control, which was subsequently increased to 17 and then 20 on day of discharge to better control her glucose.
# Anemia: Hct was noted to drift downwards to a low of 20.9 on [**7-8**], and pt was therefore transfused 1 unit PRBC.
On [**7-9**], pt was noted to have severe respiratory insufficiency, with PaO2 = 61, requiring transfer to MICU.
There, pt was noted to have guaiac-positive stool in the setting of known hemorrhoids, no esophageal varices.
# Hematuria: Pt presented with gross hematuria on [**7-11**], with INR = 3.4.
Hematuria was considered to be due to spontaneous bleeding in the bladder given supratherapeutic INR and possible irritation from foley catheter.
# UTI: Pt was noted to have entercoccus in urine culture on [**7-9**], treated with vancomycin.
Urinalysis on [**7-29**] grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella, and has been receiving a course of Ciprofloxacin, to complete on [**8-8**].
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: # Hyponatremia # Hypernatremia # HCV cirrhosis # Hepatic encephalopathy # Pneumonia # [**Female First Name (un) 564**] overgrowth # Adrenal insufficiency .
Secondary diagnosis # Asthma   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had a very low sodium level, and you were confused.
We found that you had pneumonia and started antibiotics for you.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection, and are currently on antibiotics for that.
You should return to the hospital or contact your primary care physician if you experience worsening concentration and mental status, increased bleeding, fever > 101.4 degrees F, worsening shortness of breath, or coughing up blood.
