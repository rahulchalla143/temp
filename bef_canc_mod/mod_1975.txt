Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old female with history of urostomy, recurrent UTIs, ERCP in [**Month (only) 116**], GERD, [**Month (only) 54422**]/pseudoseizures who presented with abdominal pain, decreased PO intake, nausea and vomiting, s/p cholecystectomy for cholecystitis c/b post-op hematoma:  # Abdominal pain: Abdomen initially diffusely tender, however as admission progressed, worst pain was in the RUQ/epigastric area.
Patient with poor PO intake.
Patient was initially treated for a UTI, as UA was suggestive of infection and patient had similar symptoms with UTI on past admission in [**Month (only) 205**] which were successfully treated with Aztreonam due to her extensive list of drug allergies.
However, she was persistently afebrile with normal white count.
Urine culture showed mixed bacterial flora.
A non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no acute changes.
Symptoms improved slowly with antibiotics, so RUQ ultrasound was done, which showed cholelithiasis but not cholecystitis.
Her omeprazole dose was also increased, as there was some concern for gastritis vs. peptic ulcer disease and an H. pylori antibody assay was sent, which was negative.
GI was consulted, and at their recommendation a HIDA scan was done which showed delayed gallbladder visualization suggestive of chronic cholecystitis.
Surgery was consulted, and patient had an laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**10-6**].
Days later, she sustained a 10-pt hematocrit drop and CT of the abdomen showed a perihepatic and anterior abdominal wall hematoma around the cholecystectomy site.
Given poor IV access, she was emergently transferred to the MICU for central line placement and pRBC transfusion.
She began to spike fevers and there was a concern for an infection of the hematoma itself.
She was taken back to the OR for evacuation of the hematoma (500cc).
CT abdomen and pelvis was done, which showed interval resolution of hematoma and no signs of active bleeding.
Urine culture also showed recurrence of infection, initially covered with daptomycin and aztreonam for history of VRE and prior infection.
Culture grew vancomycin sensitive enterococcus and she was subsequently treated with IV vancomycin and completed a 10 day course.
She continued to be mildly hypotensive throughout her stay, initially felt to be sepsis, but persisted after appropriate treatments and asymptomatic.
Per the surgical service, she could continue to have residual irritation from bleed for weeks following surgery.
She also developed constipation late in her hospitalization, which was likely contributing.
KUB on [**10-22**] showed no signs of obstruction or ileus and she was treated aggressively with laxatives.
# Malnutrition: Patient had poor oral intake for an undefined amount of time prior to admission, and was unable to tolerate oral intake throughout much of her hospitalization, leading to low albumin (2.2 on [**10-10**]), coagulopathy (INR of 1.6 which resolved after starting supplemental nutrition) and hypoglycemia.
This was initially attributed to infection, as platelets dropped into the 70s during admission in [**Month (only) **] and then rebounded with UTI treatment.
Peripheral blood smear showed no signs of schistocytes.
Drug effects considered, but no major recent changes.
Heme/onc consulted, saw no signs of consumptive process on peripheral blood smear, attributed thrombocytopenia to infection.
Head CT done [**10-1**] showed no acute changes.
Patient did have some episodes which appeared to be her pseudoseizures (see below), but nothing that appeared epileptic in nature.
Chronic issues: # depression: stable on home meds  Transitional issues: - monitor patient's oral intake and nutritional status.

Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO DAILY:PRN constipation hold for loose stools   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: UTI Chronic cholecystitis Perihepatic hematoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and inability to eat.
Your pain did not improve, and you were diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis (inflammation of your gallbladder).
You had internal bleeding after the procedure and a second surgery was performed to remove the blood and make sure the bleeding had stopped.
You were also diagnosed with a second urinary tract infection and were treated with a second course of antibiotics.
Changes to your home medications include: -START clotrimazole cream, Domeboro powder and hydrocerin for skin care -START prochlorperazine 10mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea -For pain, you can take acetaminophen.
Your pain should be improving, so you should require less medication over time.
Followup Instructions: Please call your primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 798**] to schedule a follow-up appointment after discharge from rehab  Please call the surgery clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 376**] to be seen in 2 weeks for post-operative assessment.
