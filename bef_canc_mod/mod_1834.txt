Sius tachycardia at 131 bpm.
TWI in R, L, V1.
ST depressions in V4.
CXR ([**2174-10-14**]): Interstitial infiltrative abnormality, most pronounced in the lower lungs accompanied by probable small right pleural effusion has worsened since [**10-11**], probably pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
CXR ([**2174-10-16**]): Persistent bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
No definite change.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent bibasilar opacities, which could be related to pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.
Diffuse smooth septal thickening with ground glass opacity mostly in upper lobes, suggestive of pulmonary edema, which could be due to volume overload, CHF, or non-cardiogenic, drug-induced edema.
Mild centrilobular emphysema.
Top normal mediastinal lymph nodes could be reactive or edematous.
Severe fatty liver.
Atrophic partly calcified pancreas is probably due to chronic pancreatitis.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-10-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 62 yo female with history of polysubstance abuse, DM2, admitted with hypoglycemia and NSTEMI in the setting of cocaine abuse.
1) Respiratory Distress: The patient was in mild respiratory distress upon arrival to the emergency room on [**2174-10-9**].
At that time, CXR showed a new left lower lobe opacity that was consistent with early bronchopneumonia.
In light of this respiratory distress, CXR finding, and fever of unknown source the patient was started on empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.
Upon transfer to the MICU, the patient developed increased respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation.
CXR at that time showed resolution of the LLL opacity and some increased interstitial markings felt to be pulmonary edema.
The patient was diuresed on lasix as needed and responded appropriately with resolution of her respiratory distress.
Her oxygen requirement decreased from NRB to 2L NC.
However, on [**10-14**], the patient was found to again have an O2 requirement of 4L NC at baseline and 5L NC when the patient was ambulating.
She was febrile and complained of having a dry cough.
Differential at this time included pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pulmonary complications in the context of her chronic cocaine abuse.
CXR showed a new RLL opacity c/w pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
At this time, the patient was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
CT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions which was consistent with pulmonary edema and some haziness in the RLL suggestive of a pneumonia.
These findings were felt not be related to her chronic cocaine abuse.
She was agressively diuresed with IV lasic and her respiratory distress improved.
Her antibiotic regimen was changed to Levaquin x 5 days and her fever eventually defervesced.
2) Diabetes:  Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be hypoglycemic in the setting of cocaine use, poor PO intake and glargine use.
While on the medicine floor, the patient continued to have hypoglycemia into the 60-80s especially at night without any symptoms.
3) NSTEMI: The patient was noted to have lateral ST depressions in leads V3-V6 upon arrival to the ED.
She developed chest pain and SOB both of which resolved on nitroglycerin x 3 and ativan.
Upon arrival to the medicine floor, she began to complain of difficulty breathing on [**10-14**] and developed a new O2 requirement.
In the context of this new O2 requirement, suspicion for pulmonary edema, and recent NSTEMI, the patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed good cardiac function (EF = 55%) with  prominent and more severe mitral regurgitation (from previous study on [**2174-9-7**])and inferior and anteroinferal systolic wall motion.
4) Hypertension:  The patient's Nifedipine was held due to concern for tachycardia in the setting of an NSTEMI.
5) Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: The patient was stable and continued on her pancrease enzymes.
Disp:*12 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus Type II, uncontrolled with complications Myocardial Infarction, non-ST elevation Pulmonary Edema Community Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Chronic Kidney Disease stage III Substance Abuse Chronic Pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: 1) You were admitted to the hospital with low blood sugars.
2) You were also evaluated for a heart attack.
3) You were also evaluated for shortness of breath.
This was evaluated with a chest x-ray and a chest CT scan which showed that you may have a pneumonia as well as pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs).
4) You were additionally started on a) Albuterol inhaler for wheezing/shortness of breath and b)We also increased your aspirin from 81 mg daily to 325 mg daily and modified your insulin dosing as noted in the discharge instructions.
You have been started on the following new medications: - Hydralazine - Isosorbide - Lasix - Levofloxacin to treat your pneumonia (as above) - Your dose of Verapamil was increased - Your dose of Aspirin was increased - Your dose of Lantus has been modified and the insulin sliding scale has been modified.
8) Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, weight increase > 3 lbs, fevers and chills, nausea and vomiting, loss of conciousness, or any other concerns.
