No evidence of hepatic or intra-abdominal abscess.
New bilateral lower lobe consolidation in addition to previous atelectasis.
No change in adrenal and renal lesions.
Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Nonobstructing renal calculi in the right kidney.
Comparison to the [**2147-3-15**] CT, there are multiple bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi which were not visualized in this examination.
The liver is normal in echogenicity without evidence of focal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation.
There is new right pleural effusion.
New right pleural effusion.
New right lower lobe opacification, suspicious for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Adjacent small right pleural effusion.

There is no focal liver lesion in the transplanted liver.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation.
There is a ring-like echogenic structure at the portal vein anastomosis.
There is an anechoic tubular two-compartmental structure, which initially appeared to be bile duct, however, further scanning revealed it to be fluid accumulating along the porta hepatis at real- time scanning.
There is a small amount of right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation in the transplanted liver.
Tubular [**Hospital1 **]-lobed fluid tracking along the porta hepatis.

Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo man with hx EtOH/HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT in [**5-3**], CMV donor +, recipient -, now admitted with abdominal pain, fever, myalgias, headache, cough and found to have CMV viremia with evidence of liver involvement course complicated by recurrent HCV seen on biopsy, multifactorial acute renal failure, microabscesses on biopsy concerning for ascending cholangitis.
# CMV Viremia  Original CMV VL [**3-15**] 95,800 at that time started on oral valganciclovir, biopsy results on [**3-17**] confirmed liver involvement and he was switched to IV ganciclovir and completed a 2 week course.
Of note he had a negative opthalmologic examination for retinitis done by opthalmologist.
# Transplanted liver  Biopsy shows trichrome stain demonstrates increased portal fibrosis with septa formation and foci of early bridging fibrosis (Stage 2-3).
Additionally, marked centrivenular fibrosis without luminal occlusion is seen, indicative of a component of chronic venous outflow obstruction.
Moderate portal and lobular mixed inflammation consisting of mononuclear cells and focally prominent neutrophils (some in association with bile ducts), with microabscess formation and foci of extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, predominantly involving zone 3.
Scattered viral inclusions morphologically consistent with cytomegalovirus are identified within hepatocytes and rare bile ductular epithelial cells (confirmed by immunostain for CMV, with satisfactory controls).
Recurrent viral hepatitis C, difficult to grade in this sample.
Diagnostic features of acute cellular rejection are not identified.
Biliary findings are also likely a result of the CMV and/or cytokine-mediated, but a concomitant bacterial infection, sepsis, a drug effect or biliary obstruction remain within the histopathologic differential.
Given rising alkaline phosphatase concern for cholestatic fibrosis was high, he may need repeat liver biopsy in the near future given his stage 2-3 fibrosis this early into his transplantation.
# Acute kidney injury  Multifactorial etiology in this patient with a baseline 1-1.2, he had component of cryoglobulinemia given positive cryos on [**3-15**] and [**3-27**] with 3 an 2 percent crycrit respectively.
His urine did not reveal proteinuria and had nonspecific granular casts.
His creatinine peaked at 2.1 and decreased, at discharge his creatinine was... Of note he did receive fluid challenges with no improvement in renal function given that his PO intake was poor.
# Superimposed bacterial infection  Had recurrent fevers while on treatment for CMV, biopsy revealed microabscesses concerning for ascending cholangitis.
Patient had recurrent headache for which he had a negative lumbar puncture, all other cultures were negative.
# Normocytic anemia  Multifactorial due to chronic disease, likely small oozing from CMV colitis (not biopsied or colonoscopy), had EGD showing gastric erosion consistent with gastritis, no CMV.
# Inflammatory arthritis  Seen by rheumatology who tapped his swollen right knee, there was no evidence of infection and the fluid was inflammatory.
# Hypertension  His metoprolol was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect.
