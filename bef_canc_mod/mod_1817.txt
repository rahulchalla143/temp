HOSPITAL COURSE # HYPOTENSION/SEPTIC SHOCK:  Pt met multiple SIRS criteria (hypotension, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis) with suspected GI source given her abdominal pain & diarrhea.
Pulmonary source was considered but no signs or symptoms of PNA, clear CXR.
Low suspicion for urosepsis as pt without dysuria and urinalysis not c/w infection.
Initially c/f gram negative bacteremia as she was at high risk for GI translocation.
She states that she has had multiple family members who have had symptoms consistent with viral GE recently.
# Acute Gastroenteritis: The patient presented with BRB via her ostomy site (see GIB below) and abdominal pain, c/f infection vs chrohns flare vs ostomy trauma.
Some purulent drainage around the ostomy site which was sent for culture.
No scope was felt to be necessary at this point.
She completed a 5 day course of Cipro/Flagyl, though this was likely an acute viral illness.
- C. diff PCR and Norovirus serology PENDING at discharge .
HCT was slightly decreased from baseline on admission and dropped further with aggressive IV hydration.
There was no further evidence of bleeding .
# COAGULOPATHY: Pt with INR 8.3 on admission despite taking regular warfarin dose, likely due to her acute infectious process.
# Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine 2.1 on admission from baseline of approximately 0.6.
FeNa 0.21%  Felt to be likely prerenal or possibly ATN in setting of hypotension.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Diltiazem and metoprolol initially held in setting of sepsis with hypotension.
# Asthma: No evidence for acute exacerbation, although slight expiratory wheeze at bases.
# HTN: hypotensive on admission and home antihypertensives were held and then restarted at lower doses, see Afib above.
# HLD: Continued statin.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an acute diarrheal illness which caused low blood pressure.
The GI service evaluated you and felt this was most consistent with a viral gastroenteritis and NOT due to Crohn's.
You were also found to have a hernia around your ostomy.
Finally, your INR was found to be high on admission, likely due to your acute illness.
