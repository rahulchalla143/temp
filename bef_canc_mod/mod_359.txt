# PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 25% in [**10-1**].
Upon arrival to the CCU patient with persistent low dose requirement.
Per outpatient cardiologist and patient he tolerates SBPs in 80s with minimal orthostasis.
Pt seems to be in class III NYHA heart failure at home, with worsening at home lately resulting in this presentation.
Initially held ACE inhibitor in the setting of hypotension was restarted once pressures stabilized.
Atenolol was lowered given low blood pressure.
# CORONARIES:  Known CAD, with occluded vein grafts, RCA.
Pt's worsening symptoms potentially in setting of in-stent stenosis.
Initially beta blocker held in the setting of hypotension restarted on discharge.
Patient is not on anti-coagulation as an outpatient even with history of atrial fibrillation and low ejection fraction.
# COPD: On home 02, per report has fairly severe disease, and has a history of RUL lobectomy for lung ca.
Patient not on long acting anti-cholinergic as outpatient, would consider outpatient addition of long acting anti-cholinergic.
# Gout: Pt complaining of increased pain similar to his gout pain in R foot.
Normally takes Indomethacin at home, but holding in setting of recent cath.
Patient was given Tylenol as needed to improve pain, but pain persistented.
