Irregularly irregular rhythm with considerable artifact may be atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent and QRS voltage is diminished.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
TRACING #1  [**2180-3-13**]: chest x-ray:   IMPRESSION: Bibasilar bronchovascular opacities likely due to bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis.
Bowel wall thicking involveing the descending and sigmoid colon without pneumatosis or significant fat stranding.
This appearance may be seen with  infectious vs ischemic colitis.
Extensive atherosclerosis  [**2180-3-15**]:  chest x-ray:  Small bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left and mild pulmonary edema worse in the lower lobes in the presence of a moderate cardiomegaly, probably due to worsening cardiac decompensation.
No pneumothorax.
Pneumonia could be missed in the lower lungs.
[**2180-3-18**]:  chest x-ray:   Mild pulmonary edema which developed between [**3-13**] and [**3-15**], subsequently improved, is minimal, unchanged since [**3-17**].
Bilateral infrahilar consolidation is probably atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Pleural effusion is small on the left if any.

Upon admission, she was made NPO, had intravenous fluids, and imaging studies of her abdomen which showed bowel wall thickening suggestive of ischemic colitis.
Her post-operative  course was monitored in the intensive care unit where she required an additional  blood transfusion for a decreased hematocrit.
Shortly afterward, she developed pulmonary overload and required lasix and albumin to improve her pulmonary status.
She developed a fever on [**3-16**], had blood cultures drawn,  and was started on zosyn which was discontinued in 5 days.
She was noted to have erythema at the incisonal site and the staples were removed on [**3-22**]  with a large amount of rust colored drainage.
The wound was left open and she has been ordered for dressing changes.
She will follow up with the Acute care service in 1 week for her wound assessment.
