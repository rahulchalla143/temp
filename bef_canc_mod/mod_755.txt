CHF exacerbation.
This presentation and admission was similar to the patient's prior admissions for pulmonary edema.
There was not clear etiology for her CHF exacerbation.
The patient ruled out for MI (she did have a small troponin leak in setting of CHF).
CXR on admission showed frank congestive heart failure.
The patent had to be intubated for impeding respiratory distress in the ED and then was transferred to the CCU.
Her beta blocker, Imdur and ACE inhibitor were held because of hypotension.
She was on dopamine briefly for BP support (the hypotension was felt to be secondary to aggressive diuresis).
She was slightly hypotensive after that (systolics in the 80s) and was placed on dopamine for a day Once the dopamine was discontinued, her regular medications were slowly restarted.
She ruled out for MI during this admission.
Her troponin was mildly elevated on admission likely in the setting of CHF.
She was continued on Aspirin, Ticlid (cannot take Plavix), simvastatin (LFTs normal in [**9-11**] and were not rechecked given likely elevation in the setting of hepatic congestion).
The patient was monitored on telemetry and had no events.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Likely reactive in the setting of acute illness.
Patient with h/o elevated platelets in past to 800's now over 1000.
The patient has chronic anemia.
Iron studies were suggestive on anemia of chronic disease with low normal serum iron, high ferritin, low TIBC and TRF.
CXR negative for infiltrate.
Likely secondary to irritation post-intubation.
On Ms. [**Known lastname 42105**] prior admissions here, the patient seems to have indicated that she wanted to be a DNR/DMI, but this was reversed while she was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Congestive heart failure 2.
Coronary artery disease 3.
Mitral Regurgitation 4.
Anemia of chronic disease 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency    Discharge Condition: Maintaining oxygen sats in mid 90's on room air.
Tolerating diet and ambulation without difficulties.
