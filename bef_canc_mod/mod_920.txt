Admission Date:  [**2202-4-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-2-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**] Chief Complaint: referred for right renal artery stenting and coronary angiography  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Renal artery stenting Cardiac catheterization with BMS placed in LAD, two overlapping BMS's placed in proximal LCX   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 22627**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic stenosis s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion, HTN, GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for elective coronary and renal angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **] and is transferred to the CCU s/p cath for hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient was referred for renal angiogram after a recent hospitalization for claudication work up that revealed bilateral superior femoral artery disease and right renal artery stenosis >95%.
Of note, she has been having episodes of chest burning for the last 2 months described as "heartburn" that occurs primarily at rest and often when laying in bed after a late night snack.
This pain lasts 30 min and is intermittently and inconsistently associated with bilateral arm and jaw pain, and always self-resolves without intervention.
She initially complained of epigastric tightness radiating to her chest and EKG showed no acute ST changes.

Functionally limited by pain from sciatica and DJD, but denies exertional chest pain or exertional dyspnea.
Mom with HTN and possibly AF.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
GIII holosystolic murmer at apex, GII holosystolic murmer at LSB, GII systolic murmer at RUSB.

No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
2+ pitting edema at ankles.

+S3, no S4 Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Rales at bases b/l and decreased breath sounds, no wheezes or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no abdominal bruits, no HSM Ext: No c/c.
1+ pitting edema to ankles b/l Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas .
The LCx had a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 162 mmHg.
Renal artery angiography demonstrated a recanalized total occlusion of the right renal artery.
4- Successful revasculrrization of a chronically occluded (recanalized) right renal artery, stented with a 5.0x18 mm Genesis Aviator stent with excellent result.
Moderate systemic hypertension 3.
Return to cath lab for LCX intervention on Thursday [**2202-4-29**] after hydration  CXR AP [**2202-4-27**]: IMPRESSION: New left mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
Right lower lobe atelectasis and bilateral effusions.
Recommend followup radiograph in 4 weeks following treatment to assess for resolution.
3- Staged PCI of the mid LAD (+/- re-attempt to open the OM2) 4- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated  systemic arterial hypertension (154/68 mmHg).
Staged PCI of mid LAD 5.
Normal-sized kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
A likely dilated or calyceal diverticulum in the right kidney which contains milk of calcium.
Heart remains enlarged, and there is bilateral asymmetrical perihilar alveolar pattern, which has improved on the left, but is newly developed on the right.
This is likely related to the patient's known multifocal pneumonia, but coexisting edema is also possible.
Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right retrocardiac opacity is not substantially changed.
Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly changed in distribution but is probably similar in overall size.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 F with HTN, mechanical AVR, A fib s/p cardioversion, PVD admitted for coronary and renal angiogram.
Hospitalization complicated by NSTEMI, acute renal failure, pneumonia, GI bleed, and hyponatremia .
Coronaries/NSTEMI:  Patient with non-exertional epigastric tightness radiating to the chest, found to have 90% occluded left circ on cardiac angio on [**2202-4-26**], but was not intervened upon because of poor renal function.
Patient had chest pain following renal stenting, found to have new ST depressions on EKG and rising cardiac enzymes consistent with NSTEMI.
Patient was brought for cath on [**2202-5-3**], where she underwent a staged PCI of the mid LAD, following which was directly transferred to CCU for closer monitoring.
Overnight in the CCU the patient had more chest pain and concerning EKG changes which prompted a second cardiac catheterization on [**2202-5-4**] where she underwent a [**Hospital1 2177**] also placed in the LAD.
The patient had no further episodes of chest pain.
# Anuric acute on chronic renal failure: In the CCU, the patient developed anuric ARF after her 3rd catheterization on [**2202-5-4**] with a peak creatinine of 6.5.
The etiology was thought to be contrast-induced ATN as well as likely embolization from recent renal artery revascularization.
Unfortunately, the patient developed hyponatremia thought to be secondary to diuresis from lasix and this was discontinued.
Patient will follow up with nephrology as an outpatient  # Hyponatremia: Nadir down to 118, thought to be secondary to free water excess in the setting of ATN.
Pt remained largely asymptomatic except for a headache and nausea which self-resolved briskly.
# Hypoxia: Thought to be secondary to multifocal pneumonia and moderate and loculated (on 1 side) pleural effusions.
Pulmonary edema was also thought to be a contributing factor.
Pt remained hypoxic at a 5L O2 requirement throughout most of her CCU stay.
The effusions were thought to be most likely secondary to CHF given the lack of fevers or white count even after antibiotics.
IP was consulted to tap the effusions to r/o parapneumonic effusion, however given the aspirin, plavix, heparin, thought it would be too high risk and risk of parapneumonic effusion was low.
# GI Bleed: On [**2202-5-11**] pt passed a small red clot of blood in stool.
No endoscopy or colonoscopy in our system.
She continued to have guiaic positive stool, but no longer had any overt blood.
TTE on this admission shows regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, probable severe mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
Following chest pain, patient found to have new S3, crackles on lung exam, concerning for heart failure.
Rhythm:  Patient with h/o Afib s/p cardioversion.
Pneumonia/?sepsis - found to have left midlobe pneumonia.
Had one episode of hypotension and was febrile for one night.
Patient was treated with 7 day course of vancomycin and cefepime with no further fevers.
Infectious workup was concerning for a pneumonia, which was treated with IV antibiotics.
Renal Artery Stenosis:  Patient with severe 95% R renal artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**].
No eosinophils in urine, less suggestive of cholesterol emboli to kidneys.
Peripheral neuropathy/Restless legs:  started on ropinirol .
