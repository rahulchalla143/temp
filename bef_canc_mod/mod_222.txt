Admission Date:  [**2134-4-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-4-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-8-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain and hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 69 year old male with multiple medical problems, who was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2134-4-15**], with the complaint of abdominal pain, hypotension and respiratory failure.
CT scan of the abdomen at that time showed a dilated [**Year (4 digits) 499**] and no other pathology.
Initial blood and urine cultures were positive for E. coli in the urine and the patient was subsequently treated with Levaquin while on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for urosepsis.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which showed patent airways, scant foamy secretions bilaterally.
[**Name (NI) **] was extubated on [**2134-4-20**] without difficulty.
The GI Service was consulted and on that date, the third out of third stool for Clostridium difficile came back positive.
three times a day for C. difficile colitis and the Levaquin which the patient was being given for the urosepsis was discontinued.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for increased oxygen requirement which resolved with chest pulmonary toilet, mobilization and mobilization of secretions.
The volume of diarrhea subsequently significantly decreased after day four of ten of the Flagyl for C. difficile colitis and the patient was then transferred to the Medical Floor for further management.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction; ejection fraction of approximately between 45 and 50 percent with a negative bubble study in [**2134-4-23**], to evaluate for cause of hypoxia.
Renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy in [**2128**].
Pituitary adenoma status post pan-hypopituitarism.
History of deep vein thrombosis with recurrence, on Coumadin.
Diabetes mellitus.
Atrial flutter status post DC-cardioversion.
History of lower gastrointestinal bleed secondary to a rectal ulcer.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
E. coli sepsis in [**2134-1-29**].
History of right groin hematoma secondary to a femoral line.
ALLERGIES:   To Lasix, to which apparently the patient gets a rash.
There was no jugular venous distention; oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy and no accessory muscle use.
Chest examination showed decreased breath sounds at the left base, clear on the right.
No wheezes, no crackles.
There was a sternal wound defect from his prior surgery.
Heart:  Regular no rubs or gallops.
Extremities showed two plus pitting edema on the right greater than the left up to the knee.
No clubbing, no cyanosis.
TSH was 0.4  Portable imaging:  The patient had a portable abdominal film which showed that they could not evaluate for placement of the nasogastric tube but there was a dilated sigmoid [**Hospital 499**].
Nasogastric tube fluid in the left hemidiaphragm which may in the fundus but left chest opacity obscured it.
Pulmonary:  Initially, while the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit the thought was that the hypoxia may have been due to congestive heart failure.
The patient already had an echocardiogram with bubble study to evaluate for left-to-right shunt for his hypoxia.
It was felt that part of the O2 requirement may have been due to atelectasis versus mucus plugging.
Chest CT scan showed a new small left pleural effusion with adjacent left lower lobe and lingular opacity which may reflect pneumonia or atelectasis, dependent atelectasis within the left upper lobe, a heterogeneously appearing thyroid gland with multiple low attenuation foci probably due to goiter, stable appearing cystic lesions within the upper pole of the right kidney.
At the time of dictation, Pulmonary consultation was pending to give advice regarding possibly tapping the effusion as well as treating for a pneumonia versus bronchoscopy to further evaluate for the patient's persistent hypoxia.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was treated with a ten-day course of Flagyl for Clostridium difficile colitis.
He continued to have less stool output and started to have small formed stools during the patient's stay on the Floor.
The patient was not started on any further antibiotics for pneumonia at the time of dictation given his history of C. difficile colitis.
Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, it was felt that he may benefit from an ACE inhibitor.
three times a day, which the patient tolerated well with a slight bump in his creatinine to 0.8.
Gastroenterology:  The patient was treated for C. difficile colitis for a total of ten days with Flagyl.
The patient was continued on Protonix throughout the hospital stay for GI prophylaxis as well as for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Subsequently, the patient underwent a video swallowing evaluation which showed appropriate transport of fluid bolus and initiation of swallow.
There was an incomplete evaluation of the larynx during swallow and a small amount of penetration without aspiration of all consistency liquids and mid-swallows followed with a neck inflection did not prevent penetration.
There was delayed relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle but no stricture seen on the AP views.
It was felt that the patient had a functioning swallow with penetration but no aspiration of all consistencies of liquid.
The patient did not have any problems with aspiration when he was allowed to eat, however, the advice was given with Speech and Swallow pathologists, that the patient should have only small sips of liquids when he drinks.
For the patient's diabetes mellitus, the patient's NPH was increased to 18 twice a day given the fact that the patient had persistently high sugars.
Renal:  Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's creatinine was actually improved from what apparently was his baseline.
Hematologic:  The patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis.
Initially the Coumadin was held as per GI recommendations for the C. difficile colitis and the guaiac positive stools.
Aspirin was not restarted given the patient's history of rectal ulcer and lower gastrointestinal bleed.
Musculoskeletal:  The patient had a history of a T10 compression fracture.
Physical Therapy was advised that the patient needed to wear a brace when he was ambulatory for his history of compression fracture as well as rib fracture.
It was felt that the patient probably should not be getting a lot of chest PT as well, although that would probably help out with his secretions, it may worsen the patient's rib fractures and T10 compression fracture.
