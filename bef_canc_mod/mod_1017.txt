Yesterday [**9-30**] she presented to an OSH in [**State 1727**] with acute abdominal pain and reported one having bright red blood per rectum and diarrhea.
The patient also reports falling in the bathroom on [**9-30**] and complains of right shoulder and abdominal pain.
She has a history of AAA with s/p repair in [**2130**] followed by explant in [**2130**] for [**Year (4 digits) **] infection with subsequent aorto to right common iliac artery [**Year (4 digits) **].
She presented to an OSH in [**State 1727**] with acute abdominal pain and reported having bright red blood per rectum.
A non-contrast CT showed fluid in the pelvis consistent with blood.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) 7622**] for concern of leaking aortic [**Location (un) **] and taken directly to the OR for exploration.

Family History: Positive for renal cancer and rheumatologic disease in her mother, lung disease in three uncles.
There is no contrast opacification of the left common iliac artery, unchanged from [**2132-5-18**].
The distal aortic aneurysm sac is only slightly enlarged compared to [**Month (only) 116**] [**2132**], but contains no acute hemorrhage.
There is no definite evidence of endoleak or active extravasation.
There is large amount of acute intraperitoneal hemorrhage, with the largest amount and with the highest density in the RLQ around the cecum.
Slightly lower density blood tracks towards the aortic bifurcation (aorta-right iliac bifurcation).
There is no evidence of active extravasation in the RLQ; however, dense foci are seen at the cecum, which might represent contrast in an abnormal ileocolic branch.
There is stable stenosis at the takeoff of the celiac artery trunk.
The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] does not fill with contrast as seen on previous examinations.
There are moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the native aorta.
BONES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is mild intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation consistent with a history of cholecystectomy.
There are no obstructing renal stones.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is slight dilatation of small bowel loops in the left mid abdomen, likely due to a mild reactive ileus.
There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
Moderate to large amount of acute lower abdominal intraperitoneal hemorrhage, with the largest amount and with the highest density in the RLQ around the cecum, but no definite evidence of active contrast extravasation.
The distal aortic aneurysm sac is slightly enlarged compared to [**2132-5-18**], but contains no acute hemorrhage, and there is no definite evidence of endoleak or active extravasation.
Source of intraperitoneal hemorraghe remains uncertain, but either the aortic bifurcation at the aorto-right iliac [**Year (4 digits) **] or the ileocolic artery appear most likely.
If indicated, conventional angiography or repeat CTA with delayed phase imaging should be considered.
[**2133-10-1**] CT HEAD FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Periventricular and subcortical low-attenuating regions appear consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no evidence of large acute major vascular territory infarction.
Bilateral mastoid air cells and visualized maxillary sinuses are clear.
Minimal mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells.
No acute intracranial pathology.
Age-related involutional changes.
Periventricular and subcortical low-attenuating regions appear consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Ethmoid sinus disease.
Right ventricular function.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-4-28**], the current study is very limited in nature (poor image quality (body habitus)), but no major changes are appreciated.
[**2133-10-11**] Abdominal plain film  The patient is after recent abdominal surgery.
No definitive dilatation of bowel loops is demonstrated.
[**2133-10-12**] ABD  SUPINE/ERECT FINDINGS:  Supine and lateral decubitus views of the abdomen demonstrate mildly dilated, air filled central small bowel loops, which may represent early or small-bowel obstruction, given relatively normal caliber of the colon.
No pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
There is mild diffuse osseous demineralization as well as mild multilevel lumbar spondylosis and bilateral hip osteoarthritis.
IMPRESSION:  Findings may represent early or partial bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73-year-old, unfortunate female who has had multiple complications that relate all back to a prior endovascular aneurysm repair.
This initial management repair was done in [**State 108**], and subsequent problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] limb occlusion and infection resulted in left above knee amputation, removal of an infected femoral- femoral bypass [**Name2 (NI) **], and ultimately removal of the infected main body of the endovascular device.
She did remarkably well after this and had no evidence of recurrent [**Month/Day (2) **] infection for 2-1/2 years.
She returned to the hospital with hemoperitoneum with unclear bleeding source.
There was no CT evidence of recurrent [**Month/Day (2) **] infection.
She was explored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16471**] of the Acute Care Surgery Service, who found a large amount of acute blood clot in the pelvis with evidence of inflammation in the retroperitoneum overlying the [**Last Name (STitle) **].
A perigraft abscess was found without evidence of ongoing bleeding; but a high index is suspicion that the distal anastomosis was the source of her hemoperitoneum bleeding.
She was  treated with a covered stent [**Last Name (STitle) **] R iliac anastamosis.
She was having some difficulty with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Plain films were taken which were concerning for possible early small bowel obstruction however the pt seemed to improve on her own.
