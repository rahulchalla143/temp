Admission Date:  [**2171-3-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-3-27**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 80 year-old male referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for outpatient cardiac catheterization due to unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dr. [**Known lastname 3088**] is status post an anterolateral myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis in [**2154-6-7**].
Catheterization revealed moderate to diffuse three vessel disease with twin left anterior descending coronary artery systems.
Repeat catheterization done a week later showed mild systolic ventricular dysfunction with two vessel coronary artery disease and mild to moderate left anterior descending coronary artery and diagonal disease, moderate left circumflex disease.
Catheterization done in [**2158**] showed three vessel disease with mild diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and an EF of 67%.
The patient had no complaints of angina or no ST segment changes were noted.
Imaging revealed mild inferior wall perfusion abnormality with partial reversibility and mild inferior wall hypokinesis with an EF of 71%.
In [**2170-4-7**] the patient had an ultrasound to evaluate for abdominal aortic aneurysm, which revealed no evidence of a abdominal aortic aneurysm, although it did show several bilateral renal cysts.
Over the past two months Dr. [**Known lastname 3088**] has reported chest pressure and shortness of breath with minimal exertion.
He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness, edema or claudication.
Inferior myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytic therapy.
Peptic ulcer disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Total prostatectomy with secondary bladder dysfunction.
On [**3-19**] the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 90% left main, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery with another 80% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, D1 is large and diffusely diseased.
Circumflex 70% osteal lesion, 60% proximal lesion, right coronary artery 70% osteal lesion with an 80% posterior descending coronary artery.
On postoperative day two the patient was noted to have episodes of atrial fibrillation.
He was started on beta blockers and Amiodarone at that time, however, he continued to have periods of atrial fibrillation and therefore was kept in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day three the patient remained in atrial fibrillation and the Electrophisiology Service was consulted.
On postoperative day four the patient remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation with ventricular response rate of 88.
He was transferred back to the floor for continuing monitoring and postoperative recovery.
Extremities are warm and well perfuse with trace edema.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Status post total proctectomy with secondary bladder dysfunction.
