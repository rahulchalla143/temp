Admission Date:  [**2190-9-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-9-13**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 78-year-old male with a complicated medical history, status post three myocardial infarctions with multiple interventions, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, and hypercoagulable state, also chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who was unable to sleep last night because of his "angina," stronger than usual.
He described the pain as an ache across the chest, no nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
The pain did not radiate.
The pain was relieved temporarily with a sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient came to the Emergency Room when the chest pain persisted after three nitroglycerin tablets.
The patient was taken straight to the cardiac catheterization laboratory when the pain persisted after nitroglycerin drip and heparin drip in the Emergency Room.
At catheterization, the patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal posterior descending artery with 40% residual and loss of a posterolateral branch without symptoms or ST changes.
The patient was without complaints at the time of examination on the floor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Coronary artery disease with non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2190-1-28**], [**2190-2-28**], and [**2190-6-30**].
The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed in [**2188-10-29**] and [**2190-2-28**].
In [**2190-2-28**], the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastric varices and Grade I-II esophageal varices and gastric ulcers, status post laser cautery.
He also has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.8, mild congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50 to 55%, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy and CMML diagnosed in [**2188**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29050**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Synthroid 50 mcg by mouth once daily, Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three times a day, Epogen 40,000 units weekly with hematocrit is less than 36, aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily, Prilosec 20 mg by mouth twice a day, and Augmentin 500 mg twice a day for a urinary tract infection started on the [**3-2**].
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was lying flat in bed, resting, in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI crescendo/decrescendo systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
There were 2+ distal pulses, with good capillary refill.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST/T changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 78-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including multiple myocardial infarctions with interventions in the past year, who was admitted with unstable angina.
At this time, he had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to his posterior descending artery, however, this was complicated by loss of a small marginal branch.
The patient did not have chest pain or ST changes during the catheterization, however, on the floor in the evening, he again had chest pain similar to his chest pain that brought him into the Emergency Room, although less severe.
The chest pain was associated with electrocardiogram changes consisting of ST depressions of 1 mm in Leads V3 through V6.
The chest pain and the electrocardiogram changes resolved after two sublingual nitroglycerins.
He had one more episode of chest pain with similar electrocardiogram changes on the [**9-5**], and on the 8th, he returned to the catheterization laboratory, where it was found that the left anterior descending had a 50% stenosis just beyond the stent, and 90% D1 origin and a 70% mid-diagonal as well as a left circumflex 40% LMI and right coronary artery 40% crux and 40% posterior descending artery.
The diagonal was then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied, leaving 30% residual, and finally the D1 origin was percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied, leaving 30 to 40% residual with a hazy defect which remained stable during 20 minutes of observation.
The patient was sent down to the floor, however, the Angioseal failed, and the patient did develop a large right hematoma in his thigh.
He did have a second hematocrit drop from 35.3 to 30.7 on the [**9-8**], however, his hematocrit was then stable afterwards until discharge.
While the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit, he did have one episode of chest pain on [**9-7**], with lateral ST depressions, similar to previous episodes, which were again relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
He did not have any episodes of chest pain for the rest of his hospital course.
We attempted to increase his Lopressor from 25 mg by mouth twice a day to 50 mg by mouth twice a day, however, the patient did have an episode of bradycardia which was symptomatic with nausea, vomiting and hypotension to systolic blood pressure of 65.
The patient quickly recovered with 1 liter of fluid resuscitation, and had no further episodes of bradycardia or hypotension after his Lopressor was again put back to 25 mg by mouth twice a day.
The differential on his white blood cell count had a monocytic predominance.
The patient has chronic anemia and does get Epogen 40,000 units weekly when his hematocrit falls below 36.
The patient has an underlying diagnosis of a hypercoagulable state with a history of multiple thrombotic complications.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
He was guaiac positive during his hospital stay, however, had no bright red blood per rectum nor episodes of melena.
Renal:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.1.
The skin overlying the patient's right thigh hematoma was noted to be very red and erythematous and warm.
At the same time, the patient had an elevated white count from his baseline 15,000 to 29,000, and also had a low-grade fever of 99.6.
Because we were concerned that the patient may have a cellulitis developing over the skin over the hematoma, he was started on oxacillin 2 grams intravenously every six hours.
The patient remained afebrile once antibiotics were initiated, and his white count dropped down to his baseline between 15 and 19,000.
The patient is ambulating well with physical therapy, but does need some help transferring from bed to chair due to pain in his right leg.
