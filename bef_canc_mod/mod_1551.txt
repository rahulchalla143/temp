Status post liver transplant with patent hepatic vasculature.
No definite focal liver lesion seen; however, multi-phase MRI/CT are more sensitive for focal liver lesions and can be obtained if clinically warranted.
No pneumothorax.
Given the patient's history and response to IVF, the cause was most likely  hypovolemic shock given GI losses and poor PO intake.
Also considered (given immunocompromised host) were infections, as well as adrenal insufficiency and cardiogenic) cuases.
Patient was continued on vancomycin and zosyn since the ED, with metronidazole added for empiric coverage of c. difficile and anaerobic organisms (seems unlikely to need coverage for MSRA given lack of indwelling lines, no pulmonary/skin symptoms).
The patient remained hypotensive throughout the stay.
He was asymptomatic overnight.
Diarrrhea, nausea, vomiting Patient had long history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (for about 3-4 weeks prior to admission).
Initially felt to possibly be viral gastroenteritis versus symptoms from methadone withdrawal.
Previous imaging showed evidence of jejunitis.
Liver doppler was negative for focal lesions.
Diabetes Mellitus Continued on home regimen of insulin.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS PRN () as needed for back pain.
