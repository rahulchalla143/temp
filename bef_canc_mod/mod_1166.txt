Stable dilated intrahepatic ducts and pneumobilia, predominantly in the left lobe of the liver.
[**2117-9-20**] Abdominal Ultrasound Thin pockets of ascitic fluid are seen in the lower quadrants bilaterally adjacent to bowel loops without sufficient quantity for safe paracentesis.
9/20/11EGD: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Varices at the fundus Food in the fundus Ulcer in the antrum Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  [**9-15**] EGD Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Varices at the fundus Food in the fundus Ulcer in the antrum Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  [**2117-9-21**] EGD Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Gastric varices were seen on retroflexed view in the gastric cardia.
There was no evidence of bleeding.
There was a single overlying ulcer visualized on the mucosal surface.
Mild portal hypertensive gastropathy was seen.
[**9-21**] Colonoscopy Large rectal varices were seen in the distal rectum.
Solid stool was encountered in the descending colon.
There was no evidence of blood     Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo M with hx of hep C cirrhosis s/p transplant who presents with worsening fatigue and weakness found to have anemia from gastric variceal bleed.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Gastric Variceal Bleed: The patient had 4 EGDs.
On the initial EGD the source of active bleeding was injected with epinephrine however the patient's HCT continued to drop.
Later in his hospitalization he developed marroon stools with a subsequent hct drop.
He underwent a colonoscopy and endoscopy which showed no sources of active bleeding.
He was continued on his octreotide which he completed 72 hours of, without any further episodes of hematochezia or melena.
Unclear etiology but thought to be either prerenal given blood losses and poor po intake or secondary to tacrolimus toxicity.
# Hep C s/p liver transplant: most recent viral load 13,900,000 IU/mL on [**8-24**].
Most recent bx c/w chronic rejection vs cholestatic variant of Hep C. Patient was continued on cellcept and prednisone.
Patient was also volume overloaded [**1-27**] cirrhosis with ascites and lower extremity edema.
Diuretics were not initially started in the setting of GI bleed and later held because of worsening renal function.
He became more short of breath following his blood transfusions and received lasix which some improvement in his breathing, he never had an increased oxygen requirement.
Patient had multiple paracenteses, none of which showed evidence of SBP however with his low total protein he was started on cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
# Dermabond Pulmonary Embolisms: After the patient's dermabond procedure a CXR showed multiple opacities that were consistent with dermabond pulmonary embolisms.
# Elevated INR: Improved from 2.2 to 1.2 after vitamin K IV 5mg X 2.
Likely a combination of synthetic dysfunction with vitamin K deficiency given longstanding poor PO intake.
Unlikely to absorb PO vitamin K given severe cholestasis.
# Diabetes: Started on home dose of NPH however was still having very elevated sugars.
# Hyponatremia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from liver dysfunction.
# HIV (last CD4 count of 97 in [**8-5**]).
Initially restarted on HAART regimen, however held in the setting of elevated tacro levels.
Wound care saw the patient and made the following recs: - Cleanse wound with wound cleanser then [**Date Range **] dry - apply aloe vesta as needed to moisturize dry skin - apply Xeroform dressing to provide antimicrobial coverage and dry out wound, place under pt - no need for additional dressing or securement.
change daily and prn - Can use critic aid clear barrier ointment as well if pt becomes incontinent of stool .
# Hypothyroidism: continued synthroid .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Caregroup VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Gastric variceal bleed -Hepatitis C cirhossis -Tacrolimus toxicity -Acute renal failure -Diabetes  Secondary: -Human immunodeficiency virus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The bleeding was stopped with an endoscopic procedure.
Your blood levels continued to decrease after this, but subsequently stabilized and you have no further bleeding that was seen.
Your blood sugars were also very high, and we have increased your insulin doses.
PLEASE call your doctors if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] experience any of the symptoms listed below.
