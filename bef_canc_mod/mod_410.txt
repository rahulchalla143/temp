Admission Date:  [**2108-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-10-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, persistent chest pain, presented from OSH to r/o ACS   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, s/p MI '[**84**], s/p LAD and mid-RCA stent placement in 7/99 with cardiac cath in [**2106-10-12**] which revealed a right-dominant system, LMCA with no angiographically apparent disease, LAD with mild luminal irregularities, patent stents and mid-vessel 50% stenosis, LCx with proximal 50% stenosis, RCA with 90% ostial in-stent restenosis with moderate luminal irregularies, s/p successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA.
The cath also revealed normal right-sided filling pressures, low-normal left-sided filling pressures with a depressed cardiac index and elevated systemic vascular resistence.
He also has PMH of CHF s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD placed about 9 years ago.
At [**Location (un) 11790**] OSH, patient presented with chest pain and was treated with morphine and nitro gtt, which reportedly dropped his SBP to 80s-90s and only converted his chest pain to a [**6-17**] (previously [**11-17**]) and was r/o'd for MI.
He was also treated as an acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation and diuresed by IV lasix.
Today, patient developed substernal chest pressure, diaphoresis, received nitro and morphine which dropped his blood pressure, not given aspirin or heparin.
Was transferred here, had continued chest pain en route, but resolved upon arrival.
Since arrival here has been chest pain free.
On review of systems, patient has a history of hematuria, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,pulmonary embolism, bleeding after surgery,cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: CHF- EF 30% by report, s/p biventricular ICD in [**2102**] Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin due to risk for fall and history of hematuria CAD, s/p MI in [**2084**], s/p stents to RCA and LAD with the last one placed in ostial RCA in [**10/2106**] Prostate cancer, s/p XRT, now with radiation cystitis Gait instability Presyncope Ulcerative colitis, stable GERD Restless leg syndrome Pernicious anemia   Social History: He is married and is primary caretaker for his wife who has Alzheimer??????s.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Tiny bilateral basal pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
EKG ([**9-29**])- Ventricular paced rhythm and intermittent intrinsic A-V conduction in the context of background atrial fibrillation  ECHO ([**10-1**])- Severe regional hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
Calcified aortic stenosis with aortic stenosis - the gradients are likely low due to poor LV systolic function.
EF 15%   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with Afib, CAD s/p MI with stenting to RCA, LAD, h/o CHF with biV ICD and EF 15-20% on latest Echo who presented with chest pain taken to cath on [**9-29**], on [**9-30**] patient developed multiple episodes of chest pain which were relieved by nitro SL, overnight patient continued to have chest pain.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with chest pain with suggestion of ACS on EKG.
CEs on arrival CK=360, MB=57, trop=0.67; repeat CK=635, MB=103, trop=1.63 with suggestion of ST elevation in precordial leads but difficult to interpret in the setting of his LBBB.
The LMCA had a mild diffuse 40% stenosis distally.
The proximal LAD had 50% in stent restenosis which was not flow-limiting.
The LCx had a proximal 60-70% stenosis which was unchanged from the prior catheterization.
The RCA had an ostial 60% stenosis in the stent and a 50% distal lesion.
Previous cardiac cath in [**10/2106**] showed right-dominant system with three-vessel coronary artery disease (90% RCA ostial in-stent restenosis, 50% proximal LCX stenosis, 50% mid vessel LAD stenosis).
Chest pain was relieved after cath but he then experienced multiple episodes of chest discomfort the next day.
Denied any radiation, jaw claudication, shortness of breath, and dizziness.
Patient started on heparin gtt and was given .3mg SL nitro PRN for pain relief- which worked each time.
Had another episode of chest discomfort on morning of [**10-1**].
Continued to have this discomfort but it became more mild.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: presented to OSH on [**2108-9-25**] for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
Pt appears euvolemic today with no crackles on exam no O2 requirement, no sig SOB with ambulation and no significant peripheral edema.
Pt should have daily weights with instructions to call provider if weight gain more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
# RHYTHM: underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation with LBBB morphology, now with biV ICD, rate has been 50's-60's SR with few episodes of NSVT.
was changed to H2 blocker due to plavix use, then changed again to PPI because of persistant pain during meals.
# Hypotension ??????
# h/o PAF - underlying rhythm is permanent afib.
# Pernicious anemia - Hct stable at 36.4.
# Ulcerative colitis - stable.
# Prostate CA s/p XRT, radiation cystitis: Currently has no hematuria despite multiple anticoagulants.
