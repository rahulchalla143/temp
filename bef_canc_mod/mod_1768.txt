No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or small bowel obstruction.
Chest x-ray [**2146-2-24**]: Relatively stable examination with improved aeration at the right lung base with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm across multiple prior studies.
Question of vague ill-defined densities in the lateral aspects of both mid lung zones may be microatelectasis.
If indicated, consider CT to assess for underlying occult nodules.
Ultrasound [**2146-2-26**]: Focal thrombus within the right common femoral vein.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is mildly thickened but without discrete vegetation.
There is mild to moderate [[**11-26**]+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe.
Multifocal peribronchial and mostly peripheral nodular opacities, could be due to multifocal pneumonia or septic emboli, should be followed.
Almost complete collapse and consolidation of the right lower lobe, and right middle lobe atelectasis, at least mostly in part due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the right.

DISCHARGE LABS: - CBC:5.3/9.2/28.0/453 - CHEM 7:  138/4.3/105/24/17/0.5/135  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 47 year old female with a medical history significant for [**Location (un) **] syndrome status-post colecomty and multiple small bowel resections now with short [**Location (un) **] syndrome on TPN and multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia presents with fevers and hypotension.
She has had multiple admission for sepsis secondary to line infections, most recently coag negative Staph treated with linezolid and Klebseilla pneumoniae with ceftriaxone.
The patient also has chronic LLQ pain.
Infectious disease was consulted and patient was ultimately treated with iv ampicillin and fluconazole as outside hospital cultures grew out enteroccus and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Ophthalmologic evaluation was limited as the patient refused dilation, however did not show evidence of fungal sequalae.
# Venous Thromboembolism:  Patient developed hypoxia and was found to have a DVT.
Cannot be on oral anticoagulation secondary to short [**Hospital1 **] syndrome.
# Chronic Hypotension:  Baseline blood pressures in 80-90's systolic.
# Back Pain:  Has known discitis at L4-5.
Is s/p biopsy [**9-/2145**] with no organisms.
Fentanyl patch was increased to 75mcg as patient's back pain was not adequately controlled.
If pain persists, would recommend increasing fentanyl patch.
# Anemia:  Iron deficency an anemia of chronic disease.
# [**Location (un) **] syndrome status-post colectomy and multiple small bowel resections, now with short [**Location (un) **] syndrome.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from an outside hospital to the ICU because of sepsis from an infection from your groin line.
This controlled your pain well while you were in the hospital.
Additionally, you were found to have a clot in your lung.
If you have fever or chills, shortness of breath, severe abdominal or back pain, chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness or any other concerning symptom, please seek medical care immediately.
