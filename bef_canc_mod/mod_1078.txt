Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.
cachethic, jaundice  HEENT: Sclera icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear without exudates or lesions Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi, decreased bs at b/l bases CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Midline incision from previous ex-lap well healed, abdomen non-tender though distended with full flanks, tympanitic with bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, dressing in place over right perc drain/tube without surrounding tenderness, erythema GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, 1+ bilateral edema  Pertinent Results: TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension .
CTA (prelim): - bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right, small on the left with adjacent compressive atelectasis - massive simple ascites, new compared to prior study - Focus of arterial hyperdensity noted in distal esophagus (4a:231, 4b:231, 600b:38) expanding on delayed phase imaging concerning for active extravasation in pt with prior [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.
on limited view of chest, no pneumomediastinum evident.
no pneumoperitoneum  - Hemiclip noted at GE jx at site of reported bleed on EGD report- no active extravasation noted in this area.
Other abdominal arterial vasucalture is patent and without evidence of dissection, or stenosis - the hepatic veins are patent though diminutive - portal veins and major tributaries are patent - redemosntration of single loop of non-dialted bowel with minimal bowel wall thickening- of unclear significance - may be related to third spacing - PTBD is stable in position - atrophic residual pancreas - stable splenomegaly - diverticulosis without colonic bowel wall thickenign to suggest diverticulitis - L sacral bone island.
Arterial enhancement which expands on progressive images at the distal esophagus approximately 7 cm above the GE junction consistent with a site of active extravasation.
No evidence of brisk bleeding at the clip locations at the gastroesophageal junction.
Mild wall edema within the bowel may be secondary to third spacing or edema related to hypovolemia.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Mild prostatomegaly.
Multiple subtle arterial enhancing foci within the liver.
KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel perforation or dilation .
Stomach:  Mucosa: At the time of scope withdrawal on retroflexion, active bleeding and a large blood clot was seen at the site of his prior bleed at the GE junction.
Diffuse angioectasias were noted with no bleeding in one intestinal limb.
APC was applied for eradication of angioectasias An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied to multiple erosions in the duodenum consistent with his prior radiation duodenitis.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum (thermal therapy) Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (injection) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2156-9-19**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2156-9-19**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Brief Hospital Course: 57M with pancreatic ca s/p Whipple with SMV reconstruction ([**4-/2155**]), chemoXRT with course c/b XRT-induced strictures, recurrent upper GIB presenting for elective EGD found repeat upper GI bleed.
# GIB/anemia.
Patient with known erosive gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears.
Patient without recent hx or current hx of hematemesis, melena, hematachezia.
Patient presented for surveillance EGD during which scope withdrawal on retroflexion, demonstrated active bleeding and a large blood clot was seen at the site of his prior bleed at the GE junction.
Current presentation likely reflects recurrent bleed from vascular source/[**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
CTA obtained which revealed active bleed at distal esophagus.
Surgery consulted and after review of case and imaing no intervention deemed necessary.
# New Ascites/Elevated LFTs.
On admission exam notable for full flanks and distended abdomen.
CT with massive ascites.
Question if new ascites/mildly elevated LFTs is due to complex biliary situation (ie worsening strictures, cirrhosis secondary to high portal pressures) vs portal vein thrombosis vs potential malignancy recurrence with malignant ascites vs right heart failure.
CT without evidence of cirrhotic liver.
TTE with nl systolic and diastolic function.
Ascitic fluid negative for infection.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Follow-up ascitic fluid cytology.
# Acute on chronic anemia.
Chronic microcytic anemia secondary to angioectasias scattered throughout colon + degree of malnutrition (albumin 2.7).
Admission drop likely secondary to visualized upper GIB.
CT abdomen does demonstrate considerable fluid ?
Due to homogenous character and lack of peritoneal signs which would be expected if blood were present in the peritoneum acting as a causatic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] this collection is thought to represent new ascitic fluid rather than blood.
# Elevated INR.
Synthetic deficit vs malnutrition.
Likely secondary to malnutrition in the setting of chronic disease with an albumin of 2.7.
Though LFTs uptrending low suspicion for synthetic dysfunction though possible.
# Stage IIB pancreatic adenocarcinoma (T3N1M0) s/p whipple, chemoXRT; recent imaging without evidence of recurrence.
You were admitted for bleeding ulcer with a drop in your hematocrit (blood level).
You were treated endoscopically and had multiple blood transfusions and medications to help stabilize the bleed.
If you have any signs of bleeding or feel lightheaded, dizzy, SOB, or chest pain you should go to the hospital immediately for evaluation.
During this admission you were also found to have new ascites (fluid on your belly).
You had a paracentesis (procedure to remove the fluid from your abdomen) which is undergoing testing.
Please call or return to the hospital at any time if you have any signs of bleeding increased shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, expansion of your abdomen, or any other symptoms that concern you.
