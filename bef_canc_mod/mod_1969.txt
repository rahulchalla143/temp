Admission Date:  [**2202-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-12-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Nitrate Analogues  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 109788**] is a pleasant 84yo, Spanish-speaking female with a history of coronary artery disease (s/p RCA stent [**2191**]), severe TR, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, DM2, HTN who presents with acute on chronic dyspnea.
She occasionally gets pain in the sternal and lower neck area over that same time period, but it is unclear if she is interpreting that symptom as shortness of breath.
She has worsening edema of the lower legs as well, with a departure from her dry weight of 200 to 210.
She denies exertional chest pain or pressure.
Labs notable for elevated BNP to 2654, and Ddimer>1000.
She did not get CTA due to renal failure, which is chronic.
CXR showed pulmonary vascular congestion, which is chronic.
She has minimal shortness of breath right now, and no chest pain or pressure.
She complains of general weakness and malaise.
Notably, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-/2202**] with toe pain due to ingrown nail, and had a course complicated by hypoxia and hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating MICU transfer.
She has had multiple admissions for CHF according to her cardiologist.
Efforts to reduce lower extremity edema and mild dyspnea with exertion are thwarted by worsening renal performance, and she is allowed to remain modestly overloaded at baseline.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive otherwise for constipation.
Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin 3.
Coronary artery disease s/p stent to the RCA 09/[**2191**].
PUD and gastritis 10.
abnormal pap smears 11.
Low back pain 13.
Chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine 1.3-1.9 diastolic CHF       Social History: Patient lives with her husband in [**Location (un) 686**], daughter lives nearby.
No CAD or COPD.

CXR [**2202-7-31**] There are low lung volumes.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.
Mild pulmonary edema is increased from prior.
There is no pneumothorax.
If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no evidence of lobar pneumonia.
No effusion or consolidation.
Scattered pulmonary nodules and ground glass opacities requiring follow-up chest CT in 6 months.
Mild lower lobe bronchial wall thickening could reflect a chronic small airways disease.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with prominent coronary artery  calcifications.

# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: likely related to obesity hypoventilation and sleep apnea complicated by decompensated heart failure.
# [**Hospital1 **]-VENTRICULAR HEART FAILURE: Pt presented with worsening dyspnea over several days.
ACS ruled out:  troponins negative x2, EKG unchanged from prior, and symptom onset was insidious, and the patient says her chest pain is close to baseline.
Likely SOB [**1-7**] acute diastolic heart failure, with superimposed COPD component.
The patient had a persistently altered mental status on the floor, with increased sleepiness and confusion from baseline accoringing to discussions with her family.
PO torsemide was decreased from 80mg to 60mg daily as she developed acute kidney injury and hypotension.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Pt had elevated cr to 2.7 from baseline of 1.5.
Most likely secondary to venous congestion.
Creatinine rose again in the setting of aggressive diuresis and hypotension, but improved upon discharge after gentle bolus (500cc) of IVF.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: On admission, pt had supratheraputic INR to 6.2 and coumadin was held.
Pt's carvedilol was held for hypotension in CCU and uptitrated to home dose as BP tolerated, then changed to metoprolol to minimize bronchospastic component.
Lisinopril held in setting of hypotension and elevated cr, restarted at 20mg, but ultimately discontinued because she became hypotensive to as low as 80/palp.
Lisinopril initally held, restarted at 20mg on [**8-10**], discontinued because she became hypotensive.
HYPERTENSION: - Continued clonidine at reduced dose - Changed carvedilol to metoprolol for redued bronchospasm in the setting of reactive airway disease - Torsemide dose decreased - Lisinopril held on admission, attempted to restart on [**8-10**] at 20mg (half of home dose), but pt developed symptomatic hypotension, so it was discontinued indefinitely HYPOTENSION:  Normotensive on discharge.
Developed hypotension [**2202-8-10**] in setting of restarting [**12-7**] of home lisinopril 20mg and increasing torsemide to 80mg.
- No evidence of infection to suggest septic shock - developed mild transient leukocytosis to 12.1, which resolved the follwowing day.
# FEVER of 100.5: The patient had a low grade fever on the floor initially.
Has had some urinary symptoms, and was post void bladder scan showed 400 ccs of urine, so Foley was placed.
The patient also says she has had some cough recently but none has been noted yet by staff on the floor.
UCx on admission showed no growth.
CHRONIC ISSUES # DM2: Continued NPH, QACHS Humalog SS.
# PARKINSONS: Continued Sinemet.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole.
# Seizure disorder: Continued Keppra.
# Sleep: Continued trazadone.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Follow-up chest CT in 6 months - pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities - Outpatient pulmonary function tests - Outpatient sleep study - DRY WEIGHT:  84.3kg - [**Month (only) 116**] consider tapering off clonidine as tolerated  MEDICATION CHANGES - STOP fluticasone inhaler, being replaced with Spiriva and Advair inhalers - START spiriva 1 inhalation twice a day - START advair inhaler - DECREASED clonidine from 0.3 to 0.1mg twice a day - DECREASED torsemide from 80mg daily to 60mg daily - STOP carvedilol, being replaced with metoprolol - START metoprolol succinate 200mg DAILY  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
BiPAP Home BiPAP 10/5 with heated humidification Indication/Diagnosis:  Hypoventilation leading to hypercarbia   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Multicultural VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute on chronic biventricular heart failure (hypertensive cardiomyopathy, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension) SECONDARY: Obstructive sleep apnea, obesity-hypoventilation disease, reactive airway disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 109788**], It was a pleasure caring for your during your hospitalization for shortness of breath.
You were cared for by lung and heart specialists as your shortness of breath is likely due to a combination of heart failure, lung disease, and sleep apnea.
