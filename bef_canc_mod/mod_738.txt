He had elevated biomarkers at the outside hospital; the decision was made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
ECG without ischemic change.
He was also complaining of back pain, and an MRI showed compression fractures that will need neurosurg evaluation.
Past Medical History: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] CAD s/p CABG [**2091**] Hypertension Dyslipidemia Atrial flutter Diabetes Mellitus   Social History: Quit tobacco [**2094**]; rare drink; lives with his wife; currently on disability.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: CTA, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: obese; [**5-15**] inch ventral hernia - easily reducible, nontender; Soft, NT, ND.
[**2107-12-19**] ECG: Atrial flutter with variable A-V block.
Non-specific diffuse ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated native 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis in the OM.
The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 17mmHg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Native 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
Mildly elevated left sided filling pressures.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved overall preserved biventricular function.
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 63 male patient with a history of CAD, now s/p CABG, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], atrial fibrillation / flutter, diabetes, who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital after he was found to have an NSTEMI.
He had been noting exertinal dyspnea and chest discomfort.
He had elevated biomarkers there, and on arrival he was taken to the cardiac cath lab, where a cypher DES was placed to SVG to D1.
He also had disease in his LCx/OM, and this was planned to be intervened on in a staged fashion later in the week.
He developed a lot of bleeding at this site.
IT was felt that the bleeding could not be controlled due to damage to the femoral vessel sustained during catheter insertion.
The bleeding was significant, and eventually required three units of PRBC.
He was taken to the operating room that night and had an emergent right common femoral artery injury repair with evacuation of hematoma.
His groin had a JP drain for 24 hours after the surgery, which had minimal drainage and was removed by the vascular surgery team.
Due to the complication with the groin bleed, as well as the guaiac positive stools taht will be discussed later, the decision was made to not pursue the second catheterization during this admission.
Prior to being transferred, and once during the admission, he had a dark brown, guaiac positive stool.
He likely has some element of gastritis / PUD on chronic prednisone therapy.
He was not in clinical heart failure during the admission.
He did develop some LE edema, which he says is not abnormal for him.
He was re-started on PO lasix, and was instructed to resume his home regimen until his swelling resolves.
He was also transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on levaquin for question of a lingular pnuemonia.
GIven a relative leukocytosis (not expected to still be this elevated after such chronic steroid use), it was continued to complete a 7 day course.
Lasix 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for swelling.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease, s/p drug eluting stent Atrial flutter Right femoral artery injury, s/p surgical repair Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile, tolerating PO diet,   Discharge Instructions: If you experience any chest pain, difficulty breating, bleeding, lightheadedness, or any other concerning symptom, please seek immediate medical attention.
Please resume your lasix (one tablet daily) until your swelling is improved.
