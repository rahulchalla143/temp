There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, however, the kidneys were atrophic bilaterally.
In the MICU, the working diagnosis was prerenal azotemia versus ATN.
The Renal service was following the patient while in the MICU, and felt that there was no indication for dialysis.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was feeling well, denying any acute complaints.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine varying between [**2-22**].
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
History of right upper extremity DVT.
Peptic ulcer disease.
History of right Staghorn calculus.
Status post TMA in [**2184-9-20**].
HEENT was notable for dry mucous membranes.
No CVA tenderness.
There is no evidence of infection upon changing of the dressing.
Urinalysis notable for moderate blood, 500 protein, negative nitrites, glucose and ketones, small leukocyte esterase.
CT of the pelvis:  4.5 x 2.3 cm Staghorn calculus in right renal collecting system, no hydronephrosis.
Bilateral atrophic kidneys.
Multiple gallstones within the gallbladder without any evidence of inflammation.
Chest x-ray:  No effusions or infiltrates.
The patient's creatinine and BUN improved dramatically post IV fluid hydration likely secondary to prerenal azotemia versus ATN.
However, there was no evidence of an inciting infection or medications which could have caused ATN.
Other possibilities included patient's longstanding history of diabetes as well as hypertension.
Hypotension:  Patient's hypotension resolved post IV fluid hydration.
Infectious disease:  There was no evidence of sepsis, although the patient was intermittently hypotensive upon presentation as well as hypothermic.
Cardiac:  Patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction on presentation.
There is no evidence of an acute bleed.
Thought this may have been related to hemodilution versus renal failure.
Her left foot wound was postoperatively checked without any evidence of infection.
Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Atrial fibrillation status post biventricular pacer.
Peptic ulcer disease.
