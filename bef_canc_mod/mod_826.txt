At OSH ED he was briefly intubated via trach, found to have a signficant amount of mucus plugging which was recovered with trach suctioning, after which pt rapidly improved.

Of note, at OSH, also noted to have R elbow pain and found to have joint effusion over R elbow.

[**2161-8-18**] R ELBOW XRAY: joint effusion about elbow, suggestive of ocult radial head fracture, although no definitive fracture line is seen.

# respiratory distress - pt with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] induced BOOP, initially transferred to OSH [**1-9**] being found unresponsive, however apparently due to mucus plugging, and resolved quickly after suction.
CXR on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated no obvious infiltrate.
ABG obtained showed increasing CO2 (66, and worsening respiratory acidosis).
Given ongoing secretions and worsening acidosis and patient's history of multiple drug resistent organisms in sputum, decision made to start pt on 10d course of meropenem and vancomycin for ongoing PNA vs tracheobronchitis (day 1 [**8-24**]).
# cirrhosis - pt with h/o hepC/etoh cirrhosis, s/p liver transplant, on prograf, and cellcept, h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] induced BOOP.
Pt was discussed with the liver service, and felt stable for discharge.
He will need to have daily prograf levels drawn, with levels faxed to his hepatologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1582**], fax=([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48518**]), so that these can be adjusted (pt has a history of mild rejection).
# ARF/CRI - baseline creatinine unclear (was 1.6-1.7 per OSH consult report).
At time of admission, pt's creatinine 1.5, where it remained during hospitalization, this was felt to represent his baseline.
# elbow effusion - right radial head fracture of R UE, nondisplaced, seen by orthopedics at OSH who recommended a sling, no other intervention.
Repeat films here showed no fracture, and pt denied elbow pain.
# anemia - baseline hct ~27-30 over past 6 months, though normal in [**12-14**].
# Leukocytosis - initially presented with WBC 11.8, felt likely [**1-9**] resolving PNA, though ongoing pulmonary secretions.
Pt was treated for ongoing PNA as above with meropenem/vancomycin based on previous sensitivities.
# cardiac - no known h/o cad, though h/o ?heart block.
intermittent heart block when placed on beta-blockade in past, remained in NSR on telemetry this admission.
Plan was to avoid beta blockade and CCB given h/o "heart block."
Given recent renal failure, plan was to avoid ACE/[**Last Name (un) **], though these would be reasonable agents in future once creatinine is stable at baseline.
He continued to have elevated blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.
# psych - pt on nortryptiline, trazadone, clonazepam qhs at home, which were continued here.
Per discharge summary, he refused PEG at OSH after failing a speech and swallow evaluation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 29393**] - [**Location (un) 2251**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: pneumonia .
secondary: cirrhosis s/p liver transplant acute renal failure hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a pneumonia/tracheobronchitis and increased secretions.
You were started on antibiotics to treat this and suctionng requirement improved.
Followup Instructions:  please continue to have daily prograf levels drawn, and faxed to your hepatologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1582**], fax=([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48518**]), so that the dose can be adjusted accordingly (pt has a history of mild rejection).
Continue antibiotics for pneumonia/bronchitis to complete a course of 10.
