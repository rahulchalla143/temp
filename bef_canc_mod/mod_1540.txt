Admission Date:  [**2202-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-12-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-7-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2202-11-25**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy  History of Present Illness: 57 y/o female s/p redo-sternotomy, mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair, with prior admission for GI bleed and hematocrit of 13 with elevated INR from [**11-4**] to [**11-16**] who presented to ED with lightheadedness and a hematocrit of 12 and INR 5.1. .
Last admission she had guaiac + stool in the setting of high INR and she underwent an EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] which was relatively unrevealing for a source of GI bleeding.
She was discharged home in a stable condition after receiving PRBC and FFP with no signs of continous bleed.
Last admission, she underwent a TTE to assess for integrity of the artificial valve site and revealed trivial paravalvular mitral leak with a normally functioning mitral valve and aortic bioprosthesis and tricuspid ring.
Past Medical History: Mitral regurgitation and Tricuspid Regurgitation s/p Redo-Sternotomy w/ Mitral Valve Replacement and Tricuspid Valve Repair [**2202-10-11**], s/p Aortic Valve Replacement, Systemic Lupus erythematosis, Hypertension, Pulmonary Hypertension, Raynaud's disease, s/p cholecystectomy, Lupus nephritis, Rheumatic heart disease, Portal hypertension, Anemia  Social History: Patient is married with one son, denies tobacco, minimal EtOH.
Physical Exam: Gen: No acute distress, pale Heart: Regular, rate and rhythm with + mechanical valve click Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended Ext: Warm, well-perfused -edema Skin: Sternal wound clean/dry/intact and well-healed  Pertinent Results: [**11-25**] Echo: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
============================ EGD: Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI Ms. [**Known lastname 9996**] presented to the ED with lightheadedness with HCT of 12 and INR of 5.1.
EGD revealed no sources of bleeding and she then underwent a capsule study.
=========================================== Pt was subsequently transferred to the medicine service for further work-up of her anemia and atrial flutter:  1.
Anemia: This is the pt's second admission for a markedly low Hct.
Haptoglobin added to admission labs was 20 suggesting hemolysis, but LDH and bili should have been elevated if hemolysis was cause of Hct drop to 13.
Pt states that stools are chronically dark as a consequence of iron supplementation, but that her stool leading up to this hospitalization was somewhat darker than usual.
Given labs atypical for hemolysis, GI bleed was felt to be more likely cause of her anemia.
No bleeding sources were found on two EGD's and a colonoscopy, promptimg a capsule endoscopy which showed a non-bleeding ulcer.
This needs to be very closely followed as outpt given significant bleeds occuring when slightly supratherapeutic and significant risk of thrombus formation with mechanical mitral valve if subtherapeutic.
Lupus: Pt states that she developed joint pain last time she discontinued hydroxychloroquine.
Anemia 2.
Atrial flutter status post cardioversion  Secondary: 1.
Mitral regurgitation and Tricuspid Regurgitation status post Redo-Sternotomy with Mitral Valve Replacement and Tricuspid Valve Repair [**2202-10-11**] 2.
Hypertension 5.
Rheumatic heart disease 10.
Portal hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, no [**Month/Day/Year **] blood in stools, no dizziness/lightheadedness, medically stable for discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with anemia thought due to a gastrointestinal bleed.
The source of the bleeding remains unclear, however, you had a capsule endoscopy during admission, the results of which are pending.
During admission you developed an irregular heart rhythm called atrial flutter.
Please contact a physician or report to an emergency department if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, black stools or blood in your stools, or any other concerning symptoms.
