Bilateral pleural effusions are small, decreased since the prior study related to recent thoracocentesis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of new consolidation to suggest interval development of infectious process.
Left ventricular function.
Shortness of breath.
Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Left pleural effusion.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with prominent trabeculations and mild-moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
In the absence of a history of myocardial infarction, non-compaction would be included in the differential diagnosis.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

On the next day after holding coumadind she had bilateral thoracentesis with a total of 1.7 L of serous fluid removed and then was extubated without complications.
Her diuretics were adjusted with fluid balance negative and her chest xray revealed small bilateral effusion with no increase in size on discharge.
