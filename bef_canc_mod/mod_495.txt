The ED noted him to be in CHF, JVP to jaw and lat ST depressions (which are old).
Past Medical History: Type I diabetes mellitus, dx in [**2105**] complicated by: - peripheral neuropathy - retinopathy - nephropathy Hypertension Aortic Stenosis Chronic renal insufficiency Spinal spondylosis Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy BPH Compression fracture C4-5 Bone cancer in childhood  Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] lives with his son and his son?????
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.6 HR 92 reg BP 158/63 RR 22 Sat 85% RA --> 91% 5L Gen: Pleasant man in bed in moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Neck: JVP to angle of jaw.
DP 2+ b/l, no femoral bruits.
Small left pleural effusion may be present.
Greater opacification of the retrocardiac lung is probably due to atelectasis at both lung bases, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax.
No evidence to suggest ischemia or infarction.
Severely enlarged left ventricular cavity size, increased from prior study.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color   Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi  are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free  wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-1-2**], severe LV systolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and afib are new .

Repeat echo done on [**8-4**] (albeit done shortly after going into AF) notes a much lower EF of 25% with diffuse wall motion abnormalities.
On his second hospital day, he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (he had no symptoms even with a HR to 160's).
The differential diagnosis for his diffuse cardiomyopathy was ischemia versus a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
On his third hospital day, he developed hypotension and required transfer to the CCU.
Heparin drip was started for the atrial fibrillation and after transfer to the CCU, the patient developed an upper GI bleed.
His hypotension on the floor was later attributed to his upper GI bleeding.
2) GI For his upper GI bleed, this came on in the setting of initial anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
He had a positive NG lavage x1liter.
3) Renal For his renal failure, he had a fistula placed to his right arm in late [**Month (only) 216**] prior to this admission.
4) ID The patient had a productive cough, and an abnormal chest exam.
Given its QT prolonging effects, and a rising white blood cell count, this was changed to cefepime.
5) Nutrition Renal diet.
1500cc fluid restriction.
