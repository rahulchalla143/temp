Admission Date:  [**2108-1-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy, colonoscopy, right and left cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG (SVG-D, SVG-RCA and LIMA-LAD SVG-RCA which was occluded on [**12/2107**] catheterization), diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation/flutter, type II diabetes presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea over one day.
Since that time the patient has developed worsening shortness of breath over several weeks associated with non-productive cough.
He denies any chest pain, or fever.
He could only move a few feet before becoming short of breath.
He was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation.
The patient had a leukocytosis to 20,000 but this was not commented on in the notes.
There was some concern for abscess and mention is made of obtaining MRI, per the patient this was not done because of his heart monitor.
He denies any chest pain and feels his breathing is improved.
ROS: Chronic back pain since [**Month (only) 359**].
No nausea/vomiting, but he did have some diarrhea this morning.
No abdominal pain except with coughing.
No dizziness, weakness, imbalance, loss of continence.
Past Medical History: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] CAD s/p CABG [**2091**] Hypertension Dyslipidemia Atrial flutter/fibrillation Diabetes Mellitus Ventral abdominal hernia s/p MVA in [**2092**].
Lower back pain, has l-spine compression fractures GI bleed   Social History: Quit tobacco [**2094**]; rarely drinks alcohol; lives with his wife; Currently on disability, former director of an exercise company  Family History: Grandmother with pacemaker, no other known heart disease  Physical Exam: T 98.6; HR 60-65; BP 112/62; RR 19; O2 99% on 4L Gen: Obese male Caucasian, no acute distress.
Distant heart sounds.
Lungs: Fair air movement, occasional crackles, no wheezes.
CXR: OSH (image unavailable) no pulmonary edema, "R lower lobe opacity" [**Hospital1 **] (my read) mild pulm congestion, R costophrenic angle missing, no focal infiltrates seen, no effusions.
[**2107-2-1**] echocardiogram 1.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
Blood flow images show no sites of abnormal radiotracer uptake.
Dynamic blood pool images show no active gastrointestinal bleeding.
IMPRESSION:  No active gastrointestinal bleeding after 2 hours.
Blood flow images show a normal pattern of tracer distribution.
Dynamic blood pool images show somewhat heterogeneous blood pool throughout the abdomen, most prominent in the left lower quadrant.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of GI bleeding.
Stomach:   Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the stomach body and antrum.
Duodenum:  Protruding Lesions A single small non-bleeding polyp was found in the second part of the duodenum.
Impression: Erythema in the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis Polyp in the second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  [**2108-2-10**]: Colonoscopy: Findings: Contents: Red blood, with some clots was seen in the whole colon.
Flat Lesions Many angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the cecum.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole colon.
No active bleeding was seen in the diverticuli.
There was no blood in the ileum.
Impression: Blood in the whole colon Diverticulosis of the whole colon Angioectasias in the cecum (thermal therapy) Polyps in the cecum Few small ulcerations were seen in the ileum.
There was no blood in the ileum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (diastolic) and atrial flutter/fibrillation who presented to an outside hospital for dyspnea and found to be hypoxic on room air.
He was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation and this improved after diuresis.
He was transferred here for CHF management and for repeat catheterization.
He did have some jugular vein distention, scattered rales and LE edema.
Of more importance was that his troponin was noted to trend upward and he ruled in for MI.
Subsequent to this the patient was noted to have brown, guaiac positive stools with his HCT trending downward.
His hematocrit trended further downward and the patient developed BRBPR, melena was not noted.
On HD [**4-12**] patient had multiple episodes of BRBPR; however his hematocrit remained stable.
At this time when the patient became tachycardic to the 130's with SBP to 70's after another episode of BRBPR.
NG lavage was negative and stat blood draw revealed no change.
EKG revealed ST depressions in inferolateral leads consistent with posterior.
Posterior lead EKG was also consistent with posterior territory ischemia  The blood pressure spontaneously trended to the 90's range systolic.
It was believed the hypotension was secondary to posterior ischemia given the anatomy of his CAD and his EKG changes .
Importantly, the pt was found to have a melanotic stool movement the prior night and had an additional melanotic movement the afternoon after catheterization.
Upper endoscopy revealed gastritis but no active source of bleeding.
He continued to have melanic stools, and his HCT continued to trend down although vital signs remained stable.
It also showed diverticula and AVMS (which were cauterized) although no active source of bleeding was noted.
He was continued on aspirin and plavix given recent MI and s/p cardiac cath with stent placement which likely contributed to persistent bleeding.
Eventually, the melanic stools and BRBPR resolved and HCT remained stable.
b) PUMP:  CHF, diastolic, initially presented with volume overload and responded to diuresis.
Daily weights, O2 sats and symptoms improved.
c) Rhythm:  Atrial fibrillation/flutter, the patient had episodes of PAF and atrial flutter and responded to metoprolol.
He is not on anticoagulation given history of groin hematoma and GIB.
## Leucocytosis, noted at OSH but no action taken.
Likely secondary to long term steroid use.
The patient had previously been on cell cept instead of prednisone for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] but due to insurance coverage issues, cellcept was discontinued.
Given the increased risk the prednisone has on heart disease, GIB and diabetes (all of which the patient suffers), we contact[**Name (NI) **] his insurance company regarding the need for cellcept coverage.
## Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Glyburide was initially held for elevated creatinine and he was covered with insulin.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Congestive heart failure exacerbation gastrointestinal bleeding .
Secondary diagnosis: Coronary artery disease hypertension diabetes mellitus myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] atrial fibrilation/flutter dyslipidemia   Discharge Condition: Good, respiratory status stable, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please call your primary care doctor or return to the Emergency department if you experience weight gain greater than 3 pounds, shortness of breath, chest pain, blood in your stools, light headedness, dizziness, feeling faint.
Additionally you should discuss imaging for your lower back pain, including MR for further evaluation.
