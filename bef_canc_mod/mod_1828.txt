Because of the positive margins and relatively few lymph nodes, he was treated for a high-risk stage IB with adjuvant chemoradiation (concurrent 5-FU followed by two cycles of 5-FU from [**2120-12-14**]-[**2121-4-15**]).
He presented in [**2122-10-15**] with jaundice and an elevated bilirubin.
He presented on [**2122-12-8**] with fever, abdominal pain, and elevated liver function tests, and repeat ERCP was required to replace the stent.
He was placed on antibiotics for Klebsiella bacteremia, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed on [**2122-12-11**].
It should be noted that cytology from the ERCPs on [**2122-12-8**] and [**2122-12-12**] were negative for malignancy.
A CT scan of the abdomen on [**2122-12-16**] demonstrated intrahepatic biliary dilatation, although the biliary stent and pigtail catheter within the fundus of the collapsed gallbladder were in the expected position.
He had no evidence of a portal mass or evidence of metastatic disease.
It should be noted that he has a Billroth II reconstruction.
Past Medical History: - ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: partially obstructing gastric cancer after presentation with nausea/vomiting, epigastric discomfort, intolerance of solid food and a 30lbs weight loss - Diagnosed with gastric antral adenocarcinoma s/p subtotal gastrectomy with a Billroth II anastomosis, omentectomy, and radical lymph node dissection of left gastric area ([**2120-10-1**]) s/p adjuvant chemo [**12-21**] to [**4-22**] - Pathology revealed a exophytic (polypoid), infiltrative, annular 4.5cm, pT2b, G3, pNO with 0 out of 9 lymph nodes involved.
Because of the positive margins and relatively few lymph nodes, he was treated for high risk Stage IB with adjuvant chemoradiation (concurrent 5FU followed by two cycles of 5FU)([**12-21**] to [**4-22**]).
Repeat endoscopy and CT imaging negative for recurrence in [**2122**] - Found to have rising total bilirubin, jaundice, and worsening pruritis, s/p ERCP [**2122-11-19**] (unsuccessful) and subsequently on [**12-3**], at which time a biliary stent was placed under general anesthesia  Social History: He lives in [**Location 669**] with his wife and has an 11 year old son.
