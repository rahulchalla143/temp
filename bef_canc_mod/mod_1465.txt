HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 75 year old male with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted in [**2111-4-4**], to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for lobar pneumonia, who presents to the Emergency Department with acute shortness of breath.
The patient was admitted at the end of [**Month (only) 956**] with ischemic cerebrovascular accident which was consistent followed by pneumonia.
Sputum grew out E. coli and Pseudomonas.
The patient did well and was sent home on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular accident.
A follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram did not reveal intra-cardiac thrombus.
Lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2100**].
Chronic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Atrial fibrillation with transesophageal echocardiogram negative for thrombus on [**2111-4-3**].
History of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two; the last myocardial infarction in [**2106**].
Colon cancer in [**2096**], status post colectomy with ostomy.
Congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Oropharynx with no hemorrhages.
Neck:  Cannot assess jugular venous distention given respiratory distress and retractions.
Pulmonary:  Left coarse rales throughout without wheezes.
A chest x-ray was performed which showed left lower lobe consolidation.
An electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression and no Q waves but ST depressions in leads I, II, V4 through V6.
Given the above the patient was sent for CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism.
While in the CT scanner, the patient had increasing respiratory distress and was intubated.
While these decisions were being made, the patient began to become more hypoxemic with decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate and bleeding through his endotracheal tube.
The presumed cause of death was respiratory failure due to combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia which were both evidenced on his CT angiogram that had since been performed.
