Per family, was in their ICU for "breathing not well and low oxygen level" but was not intubated.
He was given 6u PRBC's for post-op bleeding.
In the rehab, was given Lasix for volume overload and Oxycodone for pain control; both of which the pt's family feel were given but not monitored much.
Medics noted him to be moving all extremities, without focal weakness and gave him 250 cc NS en route.
He had a CT head which showed no acute hemorrhage but with small hypodensity in R putamen new from [**2108**], and possibly small interval lacunar infarct.
CXR's had to be done a couple times due to poor imaging, but eventually showed opacity at lung bases, L>R called as PNA vs atelectasis.
Past Medical History: - RCC s/p nephrectomy [**2085**] with dural infiltration s/p decompression laminectomy at C2-3 in [**10/2107**]; s/p upper cervical spine irradiation completed in [**11/2107**] -> being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] - CAD s/p MI ~20 yrs ago and not currently active, family denies CABG or caths - CRI, with baseline Cr 1.2-1.6 - Complex infrarenal aortic aneurysm, s/p EVAR in [**7-/2111**] - Left hip dhs [**4-/2106**], complicated by failure of fixation, converted to a left bipolar arthroplasty on [**5-/2106**], then revision arthroplasty of the left hip and removal of a left femur blade plate [**9-14**] - R hip surgery in [**6-/2112**] for displaced R femoral neck fracture - H/o falls and gait disturbance - MRSA bacteremia [**2112-7-17**]   Social History: Patient was living in [**Location (un) 55**] before the R hip replacement with wife of 60 years, but was discharged to [**Location (un) 55**] [**Hospital1 599**] after.
1 ppd x60 yrs and was smoking up until 4 wks ago, drinks 1-2 drinks of vodka (1 oz) daily, no illicits.
He looks lethargic and ill, but not frankly toxic and not in distress.
Poor to fair air movement with light sounding paninspiratory "dry" sounding crackles at the bases, very light RRR without AS type murmur overlying S1, but with present S2.
Abd soft NT ND, benign Bilateral hips are normal appearing no erythema, warmth, swelling, TTP Upper LUE with large ecchymoses on medial aspect.
BLE with 1-2+ pitting edema to mid shin.
Extremities are all warm, well perfused, no mottling.
L heel with an unstageable ulcer with a black eschar overlying, and surrounding area of erthythema.
NAD AAOx3 HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, MMM, oropharnyx clear NECK: Supple, no JVD or LAD HEART: II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard diffusely across precordium RESPIRATORY: Non labored, speaking in full sentences with 2LNC.
No HSM or masses noted.
EXTREMITIES: +1 pitting edema rt leg up to knee.
Left heel ulcer unchanged: 1x2 cm closed lesion with eschar with surrounding erythema.
Rt hip without pain with passive flexion to 90 degress with internal and external rotation.
No gross sensory or motor losses, although patient requires assist out of bed to chair.
Source of infection was sought, but could not be definitevely determined.
Right hip aspiration yielded small amount of fluid which was not infected by either gram stain or culture.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr 2.2 on admission was above baseline 1.6-1.7.
MRI was performed and did not show evidence of osteomylelitis.
Arterial duplex showed evidence of PVD and vascular surgery felt that he may benefit from revascularization.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**7-20**].
ANEMIA OF INFLAMMATION: His Hct on admission was 25-30, but drifted down during his stay.
This is likely due to frequent phlebotomy and poor production due to inflammation and CKD.
NSTEMI: In the unit, he had non-specific ST segment changes that were likely rate related compared to prior EKG.
Echo was done to evaluate for valvular infection and for LV function which was suboptimal due to habitus.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS  1.
Graft noted to be stable on multiple radiographic studies.

We found out that you had a serious infection in your blood caused by MRSA.
This infection was likely coming from the ulcer on your left foot, but we can't be 100% sure.
We tried to get an ultrasound of your heart to evaluate if your had an infection of your heart valves, but we couldn't get a good picture.
Additionally, we will have you follow up with the vascular surgeons to make sure you have enough blood flow to your left heel to fight the infection.
Also, while you were here we noticed you have an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
We can control the rate of your heart with medicines, but you do have an increased risk of stroke.
Finally, on the day of your discharge, we noted that your blood count was below the value recommended for someone with heart disease.
START Coumadin 2.5 mg daily and then as instructed by your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9766**] to 81mg daily INCREASE Metoprolol to 100mg daily  No other changes were made to your medications.
