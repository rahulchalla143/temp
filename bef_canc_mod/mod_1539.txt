She was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent a redo sternotomy with a mitral valve replacement using a 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve and a tricuspid valve repair/annuloplasty.
She was AV paced due to underlying complete heart block.Within 24 hours she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
On POD 3 she was in sinus rhythm with first degree block in the 50s and stable.
Diuresis was continued, to remove fluid overload that existed preoperatively as well as secondary to the surgery.
She developed atrial flutter subsequently.
Her weight fell with diuresis and edema improved.
