No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2).
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Small central leak.
There are very small bilateral apical pneumothoraces, slightly larger on the right than left.
The right pneumothorax measures approximately 12 mm and the left approximately 7 mm.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Chest CT from [**11-23**]- per verbal report: no official reead at this time.
Right upper lobe opacity measuring 16x2cm likely hematoma but cannot be sure.
Substernal fluid collection measuring 6x2cm likely normal post-op changes Recommend: followup CT in 6 weeks   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from outside hospital after several TIA's.
She had known mitral valve mass vs vegetation and was preop for redo mitral valve replacement.
She initally had moderate amount of bleeding and required products, she began to manifest tampanade physiology, an echo was performed which confirmed tamponade.
She returned to the operating room for exploration and removal of clot and correction of coagulopathy.
Her bleeding resolved and she was extubated on POD#1 without difficulty.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Low dose Beta blocker was initiated at first due to bradycardia and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD7 the patient was ambulating with assistance the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
