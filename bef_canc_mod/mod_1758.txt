She then developed fevers to 101 and a cough productive of sputum.
She developed shortness of breath on minimal exertion.
Patient noted decreased po intake in the two days prior to admission.
She presented to her primary care physician on the day of admission complaining of shortness of breath with a respiratory rate in the 40s and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air.
Patient notes that her grandson was [**Name2 (NI) **] approximately one week prior to her admission with a cough and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy (Stage 3, T3N1M0).
Pneumonia complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome in [**2105-1-28**].
Ejection fraction greater than 60%, mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension on an echocardiogram from [**2105-1-28**].
Patient is in mild respiratory distress.
There is no scleral icterus.
There is no lymphadenopathy in the head or neck.
There is no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The lungs have crackles at the bases, [**1-30**] of the way up the back.

There is a left atrial enlargement.
There are no ST-T wave changes.
Chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates in the lingula, left lower lobe, right lower lobe with baseline in interstitial pattern.
There are no pleural effusions.
A pulmonary consult was obtained as the patient's chest x-ray was suggestive of an interstitial pulmonary process and possibly interstitial lung disease.
The patient had improved when she was started on antibiotic, however, at the same time, she was also given a few days of steroids to treat her adrenal insufficiency.
