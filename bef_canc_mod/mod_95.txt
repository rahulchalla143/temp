ASSESSMENT:  77 year old male with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and blood throughout, including intra ventricular blood in fourth ventricle; cluster of blood around the left carotid artery.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12184**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3903**], nurse practitioner, examined the patient and spoke at length with family of subarachnoid hemorrhage and possibility of an aneurysm.
Cervical spine films to rule out fractures.
ADDENDUM:  Mr. [**Known lastname 12183**] has a 6 mm left internal carotid artery aneurysm at the bifurcation of MCA by radiology.
Will bring to angio suite in a.m. for diagnostic carotid artery angiogram with possible coiling.
Discussed subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysm at length with the family.
Will continue to rule out laboratory studies.
CTA showed a complicated fusiform aneurysm and left internal carotid artery.
He was to go to angioscopy today for a diagnostic and possibly coiling angiogram.
The patient was taken to the angioscopy suite and underwent placement of a right ventricular drain for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The procedure went without complication.
Endocrine was consulted to deal with his thyroid problem.
There was a question as to whether he had suffered an ischemic result.
Electrocardiogram was unlikely to be myocardial ischemia, elevated troponin may represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.
Back rupture myocardial infarction was extremely unlikely.
However, he did show spikes of fever on the 12th and was cultured.
He had blood cultures done and cerebrospinal fluid cultures done.
