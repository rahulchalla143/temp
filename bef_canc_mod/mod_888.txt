Stopped working after his heart attack.
No murmurs were appreciated.

The urinalysis was significant for 21-50 white cells.
He was originally given amps of D50 with difficult control.

These medications may have longer half life in the setting of acute renal failure and, therefore, the patient's blood sugar was difficult to control.
The Metformin was held and will not be restarted due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency on acute renal failure at this admission.
CARDIOVASCULAR, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient is status post CABG with significant coronary artery disease.
The patient had enzymes cycled times two, first set being at the outside hospital and one set here, both of which were negative as a cause for congestive heart failure.
