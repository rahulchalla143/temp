Evaluate for acute process.
Lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis.
The lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation or pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
Scattered bibasilar atelectatic change without acute pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with Mast Cell Degranulation presented with recurrence of MCD in setting of R wrist pain and swelling, with worsening airway edema.
# Mast Cell Degranulation: The patient's symptoms were similar to prior episodes, some of which have been associated with infections, but worse airway edema than she normally had so she admitted first to the MICU and was intubated for airway stabilization.
The pt described Mast Cell Degranulation attacks as always treated with IV Dilaudid, Lorazepam and Benadryl and when these medications were tapered to PO dosing the pt complained that her pain was not being treated appropriately.
