History of Present Illness: Patient is a 52 year old male with past medical history of throat and neck cancer status-post trache and PEG, cirrhosis, and recent septic arthritis, who presents with several days of diarrhea and inability to maintain intake via PEG.
His wife relates that starting on Saturday evening ([**11-6**]) patient began to have some diarrhea.
He then developed mild abdominal cramping, but this progressed to more constant abdominal pain, especially in the epigastric region, over the last two days.
After the emesis, and due to his pain and inability to tolerate PO's via his PEG, he sought medical attention.
His wife reports that he has mainly had watery diarrhea with some mucous, no blood.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports that his pain is much improved and minimal at present.
He did have one more episode of emesis which the patient denied leaving through his trach tube.
Squamous cell cancer vallecula/tonsillar, X 2, s/p trach, peg, XRT, chemo,  possible recurrence noticed on recent PET, but decision to wait until [**8-30**] for further eval given good functional status at present.
Liver cirrhosis secondary to EtOH, complicated by splenomegaly, esophageal varices (last EGD [**11/2188**] with grade 1 varices) with prior bleeding.
Reported history of portal vein thrombosis, though I can not find when this happened.
Chronic pancreatitis secondary to EtOH.
History of multidrug resistant Klebsiella, MRSA 9.
Former alcohol use, no tobacco.
Family History: brother died of MI at 34.
No oral lesions.
No scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor.
No wheezes, rales.
Mild tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastric region.
No rebound tenderness, no guarding, no distension.
No shifting dullness.
Subtle wall thickening of the transverse and descending colon, which may be due to hypo-albuminemia versus early colitis.
Cirrhosis with inhomogeneous liver enhancement, can not exclude underlying liver lesions.
New small amount of perisplenic fluid.
Splenomegaly and esophageal varices consistent with portal hypertension.
CXR: [**11-8**]: New density in the left lower lobe is suggestive of a focus of pneumonia.
CXR: [**11-9**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-8**], there is again small area of increased opacification at the left base that could represent a developing pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Patient is a 52 year old male with past medical history of throat cancer and cirrhosis who presents with several days of loose watery stools and inability to tolerate PO's.
# Diarrhea: Resolved.
Initially, his differential included a viral gastroenteritis, c. difficile given recent antibiotic use for extended period, obstruction, ischemic,  among other causes.
He did not have significant RUQ tenderness to suggest cholangitis, or RLQ tenderness to suggest appendicitis.
Since his admission he did not have any diarrhea.
Of note, the pt had crampy abdominal pain on admission.
We consulted Hepatology to see if his cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis could be contributing to his pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
They suggested that this likely represents gatroenteritis and recommended bowel rest.
If the diarrhea and vomiting were not to improve they suggested an EGD and colonoscopy.
# Lung opacity: No history of worsening secretions, cough, rigors.
Suspect that patient likely aspirated in setting of emesis, as wife reports emesis in patient's mouth as well as in trache.
No rales or significant areas of dullness on lung exam.
In retrospect, a lower lobe aspiration pneumonia could cause upper GI symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
His initial SBP was in the 150s-170s, but a large degree of this was secondary to pain and discomfort.
When his pain and gastrointestinal symptoms resolved, his BP hovered in the 110s-130s.
Of note, when he was fluid restricted overnight, he had an episode of hypotension to 90s/60s, which resolved with one 500cc bolus of NS.
# Hyponatremia: Patient's sodium at admission was 126 (with a baseline appears in the low 130s)  Initially, we thought that this could be due to dehydration [**1-23**] to emesis and diarrhea and history of stopping his tube feeds.
However, on HD#2, his Na was 122 and the pt had one episode of hypotension as stated above.
Therefore, he could have been dehydrated in the setting of underlying SIADH.
Hyponatremia resolved over the ensuing days and was in the normal range at time of discharge .
No fevers or significant ascites to suggest SBP, but this would be consideration if he were to have developed a fever.
We continued nadolol given history of varices.
Abdominal pain improved since admission.
Abdominal pain continued to improve after transfer to the floor and at time of discharge the patient had no abdominal pain.
# Seizure disorder: We continued home medications of keppra and neurontin.
# Hypothyroidism: His TSH was elevated on admission.
# FEN: Hyponatremia as discussed above.
Hospital Summary from [**2190-11-12**] through [**2190-11-15**] Mr. [**Known lastname 10378**] was transferred to the East surgical service on [**2190-11-12**] when a CT scan of his abdomen show minimal free air under the left hemidiaphragm and pneumatosis of the right colon.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
He had no complaints of abdominal pain and was nontender on physical examination.
He continued to remain pain free and nontender on examination over the next 3 days.
On [**2190-11-14**] he developed profuse epistaxis that resolved with packing and compression.
He was sent to angiography where his bilateral internal maxillary arteries were both coiled.
His bleeding subsequently stopped and he was transferred to the ENT service for further management as his abdominal issues had resolved.
It was felt that the etiology of his clotting disorder was multi-factorial and likely related to a combination of underlying liver disease, antibiotics, pneumonia, and nutritional deficiency.
The patient was kept in the ICU overnight for observation to assure he had no rebleeding.
His lytes, CBC, and coags were checked frequently to assure that he had no continued issues.
He was transferred to the floor 24 hours after having the epistats removed.
The patient had no reoccurence of his acute bleeding and his lab values were at unchanged since his transfer from the ICU to the floor.
He continued to expectorate a small amount of rust colored sputum from his tracheostomy, but did not require more than 1 or 2 suctions a day.
At the time of discharge, the patient was administering his own bolus tube feedings, ambulating without assistance, voiding without difficulty, using humidified oxygen via his trach mask, and his pain was well controlled via narcotics administered via his G-tube.

Disp:*300 mL* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare at Home Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis Pneumonia Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal Pneumatosis Epistaxis   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, tolerating tube feeds, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a complaint of vomiting and diarrhea.
These may have been caused by a viral gastroenteritis or as a consequence of a lower lobe pneumonia.
You were also observed for a lower sodium level.
During the admission we increased your dose of Levothyroxine to 50mcg every day since we felt that you levels of thyroid hormone were a little low.
Epistaxis (nose bleeding): you had a large amount of bleeding from your nose that was stopped using a combination of intranasal packing and also embolism of the bleeding arteries by our interventional radiologists.
This was felt to have contributed to your bleeding and you were given blood products to help treat the clotting abnormalities.
You may also notics a some small blood streaking in your mucous.
If you start to have larege bleeding of bright red blood again, Spray both nostrils with Afrin and hold pressure for a few minutes to see if the bleeding stops.
Please return to the emergency room if you develop a fever >101.5, have severe vomiting or diarrhea, increased shortness of breath, chest pain, increasing abdominal pain, inability to tolerate your tube feeds, or for any other symptoms that concern you.
