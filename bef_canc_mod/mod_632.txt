# Hypertensive urgency: This is a chronic issue related to ESRD.
Head CT was negative for intracranial bleed.
She then developed hypotension in the setting of poor PO intake during her SBO.
# Abdominal pain/UGIB: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with previous negative workups.
At first the pain resolved and she was continued on her outpatient regimen of: 2-4 mg po dilaudid q4 h as needed.
GI was c/s re: abd pain and rec CTA-abdomen to eval for mesenteric ischemia vs. partial SBO, however with ESRD did not initially want to get CTA so KUB was ordered.

She then developed a third type of pain associated with a burning sensation in her chest.
A few hours later she had 3 episodes of coffee-ground emesis.
Afterward the pain resolved and her hct remained stable.
