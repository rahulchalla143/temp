History of Present Illness: 23 year old woman with ESRD, SLE, recently placed PD catheter who presents with periorbital swelling and Hypertensive urgency.
She had been on both an ACE, [**Last Name (un) **] and DRI at home, which she has been taking for many years.
Patient states that the tongue swelling is most likely due to a sardine allergy.
The ACE, [**Last Name (un) **] and DRI were held on the day of admission for ?angioedema but restarted on day of discharge without incident so she was discharged on them.
She returned to the ED [**5-24**] with acute onset bilateral eye swelling since night of [**5-23**].
Notes pain in abdomen 7.5/10 related to PD catheter placement (has had since then), improves with morphine.
Also notes swelling in eyes/face since last night (has had in the past but never this severe, always goes away on its own).
Has baseline constipation (takes stool softener), last BM 2 days ago (normal), no melena, brbpr, diarrhea.
She notes episode of throat swelling over weekend resolved, seemed to be related to sardine eating (not new for her).

Occlusion of the right internal jugular vein below the mandible which communicates with external jugular and subclavian vein.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
Limited study which demonstrates a chronically occluded and completely atrophic left brachiocephalic vein.
Right internal jugular vein not identified, likely chronically occluded.
Left internal jugular vein is very diminuitive as before.
Occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein at the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular with extensive collateral formation consistent with chronic obstruction.
Patent left brachial, axillary, subclavian, and distal internal jugular vein.
Unsuccessful attempt to recanalize the left brachiocephalic vein using a catheter and guidewire technique.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 23yo woman with a history of SLE, ESRD and HTN who presented with acute onset bilateral facial swelling and hypertensive urgency, which developed into L sided facial, L arm and L breast swelling throughout her stay.
# L facial/arm and breast swelling: Initially this presented only as facial swellingand ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were held for possible angioedema, however holding medications nad giving benadryl failed to relieve symptoms.
We then suspected possible venous thrombus with occlusion leading to edema.
US of upper left extremity failed to show evidence of acute occlusion, but showed R IJ occlusion consistent with prior studies.
Repeat MRV suggested chronic occlusion of the L brachiocephalic vein.
The primary team, renal team, [**Month/Year (2) **] team and hematology team suspect that the most likely etiology of her swelling is an acute-on-chronic (now occlusive) thrombus of the L brachiocephalic vein.
Per consult with hematology the patient is to remain on this regimen for at least 6 months, and will then revisit as an outpatient the question of possible lifelong anticoagulation.
Although her clots seem to have all occured in the setting of lines, her continued thrombosis is likey due to hypercoagulability from her lupus (in absence of lupus anticoagulant).
It will be especially important that her coumadin be well titrated given her risk of intracranial bleed with hypertension.
# Hypertension: The patient has chronically labile hypertension, with frequent episodes of hypertensive urgency over systolic 200, as well as lows as far as the 80s during this admission.
The importance of BP control, especially in the setting of new anticoagulation, was discussed extensively with the patient.
# ESRD: The patient has ESRD due to lupus nephritis.
PD catheter was placed before admission and the patient received morphine prn pain at her catheter site.
She was treated for hypocalcemia as well as hyperkalemia.
She has no symptoms of acute SLE flare, so her nephrologist and outpatient physicians may attempt to wean this down as an outpatient.
# abnormal pap smear: The pt is noted to have an abnormal pap and colpo two years ago with CIN 2 and high risk HPV.
Finally, the patient was given an appointment with ob/gyn to have a follow up pap smear, as her last pap and colpo two years ago showed CIN 2 with high risk HPV and this has not been followed.
Benadryl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every six (6) hours as needed for itching.

Outpatient Lab Work Please have blood drawn on Monday [**2141-6-12**] for PT/INR and twice per week thereafter until told by coumadin clinic that you can decrease lab draws.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Malignant Hypertension (Hypertensive Urgency) Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Left Brachiocephalic vein occlusion Anemia  Secondary Diagnoses: SLE ESRD Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted and treated for an acute exacerbation of a chronic left brachiocephalic vein occlusion (a chronically obstructed large vein closed off entirely) and hypertensive urgency (very high blood pressure).
You have been started on long-term Coumadin (also called warfarin) therapy to prevent future blood clots and to allow natural dissolution of your current blood clot.
There were many changes and it is very important that you stick to the medication list as you have large, life-threatening swings in the blood pressure when not taking consistently.
We also treated you for high potassium levels and anemia, and low vitamin D and calcium levels, which are related to your kidney failure.
Please have your blood drawn on Friday [**6-9**] for PT/INR and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 434**].
After that, please have your blood drawn on Monday [**6-12**] for PT/INR and faxed to the [**Hospital1 18**] coumadin clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 434**].
