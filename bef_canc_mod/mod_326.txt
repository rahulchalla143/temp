The patient had been transferred after lengthy admission at OSH for Left prosthetic knee infection with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans (fluc sensitive) and CoNS; subsequently had removal of hardware.
The patient had multiple abdominal fluid collections (?
pancreatic pseudocysts); when one collection reached abdominal fascia, he developed fasciitis and required emergent radical debridement of his abdominal wall.
Each of the other fluid collections were subsequently drained percutaneously, and each was found to have Citrobacter as well.
The patient was returned to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2200-11-18**] with three days history of fever (to 103) and diffuse abdominal pain.
He also noted some swelling over his left eye.
The patient reportedly had a positive C difficile assay.
CT scan shows thickening of the entire colon.
He is readmitted on [**2200-11-30**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and a rise in his WBC to 26.1.

right lower extremity with erythema and swelling > left.
While the majority of the pancolitis previously noted in [**Month (only) 1096**] has resolved, the segment of bowel feeding the cecostomy site which transverses the majority of the anterior abdomen continues to demonstrate mild wall thickening and surrounding inflammatory change.
No pericolonic fluid collections/abscess is detected.
No significant change in three intraabdominal fluid collections aside from mild decrease in perihepatic collection.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 32 year old male  with complex recent medical history involving Citrobacter fasciitis and infection of multiple abdominal fluid collections who had recent history of severe C. diff.
Fever and Leukocytosis: Suspect the etiology of his decompensation is a line infection from his right subclavian.
- Other etiologies beside line infection are joint infection or persistent abdominal abscesses.
He continue IV Flagyl and PO vanco for suspected C diff colitis.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
His WBC and fevers defervesed after pulling the line.
If still having symptoms of C.diff after [**2200-12-21**], he could continue PO Flagyl.
He has refused Foley removal in the past, but he agreed to Foley removal and he voided without difficulty.
