The patient described shortness of breath for several weeks and chest pain with exertion.
He says that he has had no chest pain since discharge from [**Location (un) 2725**].
CAD, status post CABG in [**2178**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, status post a non-Q wave MI in [**10-27**] with an ETT MIBI that showed a questionable ischemia.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline elevated creatinine.
Anemia of chronic disease with transfusion requirements.
Diabetic diet.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General:  The patient was an elderly man lying in bed, comfortable, in no acute distress.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases, right greater than left with bibasilar crackles to a quarter of the way up, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Distant heart sounds.
No murmurs appreciated.
No splenomegaly appreciated.
Extremities:  There was 3+ pitting edema bilaterally, Guaiac positive.
He was transferred to the MICU and urgent endoscopy showed clots, small bleeding, with friable and granular antrum of the stomach.
The patient was aggressively resuscitated with 6 units of packed red blood cells, vitamin K, and fluid boluses for decreased urine output.
The patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN from hypotension and contrast.
In light of the patient's poor EF and increasing volume overload the patient was started on urgent hemodialysis.
With his increased urine output, his creatinine trended down.
The patient started complaining of increasing pain at the site of his hemodialysis catheter; cross-cover noted the patient to have a bruit at the site.
The patient was noted to still have persistent AV fistula at the site and will need a follow-up ultrasound in one months time.
In this setting, he had increasing pedal edema formation from 1+ to 3+.
At the time of discharge, the patient still had 3+ pitting edema, however, the patient was felt stable for discharge to home as he was able to ambulate without dyspnea and maintained high 02 saturations.
During the hospital course, the patient had slightly elevated liver enzymes to the 100s.
His alkaline phosphatase remained slightly elevated in the 300s.
The patient showed no signs of encephalopathy during the hospital course.
The patient's diabetes was controlled with a diabetic diet and a regular insulin sliding scale.
Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of ramus intermedius.
Acute renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis.
Residual AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
Hepatic insufficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his cardiologist tomorrow for a recheck of his BP and laboratories and determine what dose of Lasix and BP medications the patient should be on.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] needs a femoral ultrasound in one month to evaluate for resolution of his AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
