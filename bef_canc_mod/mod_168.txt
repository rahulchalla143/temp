The patient initially had generalized myalgias with URI symptoms along with decreased PO intake about 4 days prior to admission.
Three days ago, the patient began having repeated episodes of vomiting revealing bilious fluid over several hours.
However, after continued retching, she began to have coffee ground emesis associated with severe epigastric pain radiating to her back and subsequent melena, but no BRBPR  The patient had continued episodes of this hematemesis overnight on [**2124-2-8**], and then decided to go to the ER.
She then got a CT scan which showed no free air, no free fluid, no evidence of pseudocyst, and the pancreas unremarkable.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to her DKA with a initial sugar in the 400s with associated metabolic acidosis and intermittent hypotension ( in the 70s/30s).
At 11/8, at 2am, her insulin drip was discontinued and she was controlled with RISS, and her hypotension improved to the 110s/80s on IVF (her intake was 9 liters over 24 hours and her output was 25-40 cc/hr)  She was then trensferred to the floors once she was hemodynamically stable, her crit stabilized, and there were no signs of active GI bleed.

ECG: 120, sinus, nl axis, nl intervals, LVH, J pt elev in v2-v5, unchanged from [**5-7**]   Brief Hospital Course: 43 y/o AAF with a history of hereditary pancreatitis, poorly controlled diabetes, and peptic ulcer disease, admitted for upper GI bleed as seen with her coffee grounds emesis and melena.
She also had associated epigastric tenderness with a h/o pancreatitis with calcifications seen on the CT in the ER.
1) GI bleed:  Pt had coffee grounds emesis after several episodes of bilious vomiting, + melena with the emesis.
Possible sources of bleed included [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, esophagitis, gastritis, or hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
CT scan with PO contrast showed no evidence of free air/fluid or any other intrabdominal process.
2) Diabetes: Most likely developed DKA originally from h/o poor glucose control HbA1C at 18% two years ago) and previous URI symptoms before her N/V.
Her sugars were then controlled with NPH insulin and eventually [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 18 units due to some high glucose levels throughout her course.
CT scan showed evidence of calcification in the head of the pancreas.
She had the typical boring epigastric tenderness radiating to the back with only moderately elevated amylase at 64 and a normal lipase.
This however is consistent with a chronic pancreatitis picture.
Once her symptoms declined, she was discontinued off the ABX and simply had pain control, including a pain consult in which she was placed on Dilaudid PCA for 2 days and then was resumed on her outpatient pain medications oxycodone and 150mcg of fentanyl.
