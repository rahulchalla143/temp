Per EMS notes, last night they were called to patient's house for difficulty breathing which had been ongoing for 45 minutes.
Pt was hospitalized at [**Hospital6 **] [**Date range (1) 56565**] for shortness and breath and COPD exacerbation.
Most recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **] was in [**2181-12-20**] for when he had a pneumothorax from his severe emphysema.
Prior to that, in [**2181-9-19**] patient was in the ICU at [**Hospital1 **] for MRSA and psedomonal pneumonia.
The patient received linezolid for a 21 day course for MRSA PNA and cefepime for 21 day course for pseudomonas.
This was all in the setting of a three week prior hospitalization for COPD/PNA with sputum growing MRSA and pseudomonas treated with bactrim and levaquin.
Non-small cell lung cancer, s/p R upper lobectomy, partial R  fifth rib resection c/b chronic pain.
No chemo or radiation.
COPD w/ severely reduced DLCO, FEV1 42%, and FEV1/FVC ratio 59%; stage= moderate IIB 3. h/o MRSA and pseudomonas PNA 4  Ulcerative colitis - s/p multiple surgeries, most recently in late 80s.
Steroid induced hyperglycemia 6.
PFO 7. h/o cardiomegaly 8. h/o depression 9.
Worked as a paiting contractor, retired after lung cancer surgery.
Sclera anicteric.
No JVP at 30 degrees.
No M/R/G Lungs: diffuse rales and rhonchi bilaterally anteriorly.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2182-3-27**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
[**2182-3-26**]- urine culture- no growth [**2182-3-28**] blood culture x 2- No growth  _______________________________  Radiology:  Echo [**2182-3-28**]  Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.3 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.6 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.67 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 151 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *40 to 45 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Cardiac silhouette appears larger than on the prior study and is accompanied by engorged pulmonary vessels and perihilar haziness, attributed to either CHF or volume overload.
These findings are superimposed upon extensive emphysema, post-operative changes in the right upper lobe, and extensive areas of parenchymal scarring.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Small left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
Malpositioned nasogastric tube.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan: 62 yo male with COPD on home O2 (3L), history of lung cancer, history of multiple PNAs (including MRSA) who is a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for respiratory failue and intubated.
Respiratory failure- Pt with severe emphysema/COPD.
CXR with showed a possible RML opacity and left pleural effusion.
We initially started patient on vancomycin for possible MRSA and cefepime to cover GNR and pseudomonal species.
Sputum culture grew out MRSA (moderate growth) and pseudomonas (sparse growth) resistant to fluroquinolones (see attached micro data).
Additionally, blood cultures from [**Hospital6 **] grew out 2/2 bottles of streptococci pneumoniae sensitive to levaquin and penicillin.
After extubation, patient was able to get to 6 L of NC and satting in low-mid 90%.
It showed moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension but no right-to-left shunting at the atrial level.
He received a 10 day course of vancomycin (last day was day of discharge) for MRSA in sputum (?
He has severe emphysema by DLCO.
Hypertension- initially on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] pt was hypotensive and required fluid boluses, though never required pressors.
Chronic pain- patient has a history of chronic pain, mainly in lower back (also right ribs.
He required IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
