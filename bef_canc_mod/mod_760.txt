Admission Date:  [**2126-8-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ativan / Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Fever, new-onset rash  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 63 yoF with history of CAD who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in [**2126-8-19**] for fevers to 103 and new onset rash that was concerning for Sweet's syndrome.
An LP had demonstrated few WBCs and the patient was treated with a course of steroids and ceftriaxone for presumptive Lyme disease which he completed on [**8-14**].
The patient then noticed the development of a papular, mildly pruritic rash one week prior to admission that originally began on his thighs but soon spread to his trunk and upper extremities.
He also deceloped fevers to 103 and was taken to as OSH on [**8-18**].
Past Medical History: - HTN - Hypercholesterolemia - CAD s/p MI [**2114**] s/p angioplasty, had stents [**2119**] - Kidney stones removed [**2120**]   Social History: Lives with wife, retired corrections officer; tob [**3-23**] ppd x 25yrs, no etoh, no drugs.
No other strokes, sz, neuro d/o incl MS, MG, no blood/clotting d/o, and no other autoimmune d/o.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.6 BP 145/72 HR 93 RR 17 O2sat 99%RA General: Pleasant, comfortable, in no acute distress HEENT: Anicteric, MMM, OP without lesions Neck: Supple, no JVD Heart: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: +bs, soft, NTND, no HSM Extremities: No c/c/e Skin: Multiple 0.5-1 erythematous/violaceous pustular and papular lesions/erosions worst on thighs, also on lower legs, upper extremities, chest and trunk with relative sparing of face and back Neurologic: AAOx3.
Marked papillary dermal edema and dermal eosinophilic infiltrate (see note).
Note:  A neutrophilic infiltrate is not seen, arguing against a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome.
The presence of numerous dermal eosinophils raises the possibility of Well's syndrome.
Additional diagnostic considerations include a bullous drug/hypersensitivity reaction or, less likely, an immunobullous disorder such as bullous pemphigoid.
Intraepidermal pustules, subepidermal edema, and dermal eosinophilic infiltrate.
Note:  A few clusters of bacteria are seen within the pustule and likely represent surface 'colonization'.
The presence of an intraepidermal pustule raises the possibility of Sweet's syndrome with eosinophils, a histologic variant that has been noted by some authors in the literature.
Multiple brightly enhancing but nonpathologic inguinal lymph nodes.
No pathologic adenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis.
Multiple small hypodense liver lesions, too small to characterize.
5mm nodular opacity left lower lobe, likely atelectasis.
If there is high suspicion, a one-year follow-up can be performed to ascertain resolution/stability.
There is no pleural abnormality or change in hilar or mediastinal contours to suggest progressive adenopathy.
Lateral view shows moderate degenerative change in the mid and lower thoracic spine.

The etiology of the rash remains unknown.
Dermatology felt that while the biopsy and clinial presentation were not pathomneumonic, the case likely represented an atypical eosinophilic presentation of Sweet's syndrome.
Most likely, the presentation was secondary to Sweet's syndrome in the setting of previous infection, most likely viral or Lyme; Lyme titers sent on previous hospitalization were negative and repeat Lyme titers were sent on this hospitalization and were pending upon discharge.
Wound culture from the original biopsy was positive for MRSA, and the patient was placed on contact precautions.
Disseminated herpes zoster was originally in the differential diagnosis, but the direct antigen test for varicella zoster virus was negative.
The patient originally presented with fever and neutropenia.
The neutropenia resolved the second day of admission and the patient's neutrophils remained stable throughout hospitalization.
The patient's differential showed bandemia early during the hospitalization, which was believed to be consistent with marrow reaction to neutropenia.
The etiology of the neutropenia remains unclear, but most likely represents a reaction to ceftriaxone or acute illness.
The patient had a normocytic anemia.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease.
The patient remained asymptomatic and had no changes on EKG.
As above, would culture from skin biopsy [**2126-8-19**] was positive for MRSA, and the patient was placed on contact precautions.
