Admission Date:  [**2179-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**] Chief Complaint: lethargy, shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, COPD with a home 2 L O2 requirement, complicated by pulmonary hypertension and RV failure who presents with a syncopal episode 1 day prior to admission.
He was also recently admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] for an unresponsive episode which led to a short period of intubation secondary to respiratory distress.
Currently he lives in a rehab setting and was previously on symptom-focused care for management of his end-stage RV disease and COPD.
One day prior to admission, he had witnessed syncope at his nursing home in the morning while moving his bowels.
No fevers or hypotension were noted.
He was brought to the ED given his persistent lethargy and recent syncopal episode.
Chest-xray revealed pulmonary edema and he was given a dose of lasix.
Felt short of breath.
CXR confirmed pulmonary edema so he received Lasix 60mg IV as well as Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone (no infiltrate but had leukocytosis and elevated lactate).
He is admitted to the MICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress; VS prior to transfer were HR 72, BP 195/119, RR 25, POx 90%4L NC.
Past Medical History: - ACS s/p CABG - Prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b residual incontinence, condom cath qhs - Severe Right Sided Systolic Failure - Severe pHTN (on 2-3LNC) - OSA on home BiPAP - Mult CVAs w residual R-sided weakness and R-facial droop - Recurrent syncope of uncertain etiology (potentially [**3-11**] cough) - DM2 - HTN - DVT - Depression - Mild Dementia - s/p cataract surgery - Internal hemorrhoids  Social History: Married with 5 children, admitted to [**Hospital3 **] home for syncopal episodes and rehab.
Is in the hospice section because "the doctors told [**Name5 (PTitle) **] his heart is endstage" and for insurance reasons, but is still full code.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [[**3-12**]+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is evidence of chronic pulmonary hypertension, indicated by the dilated right ventricle and right atirum.
There is RV pressure and volume overload.
LV systolic function is borderline normal.
A band-like opacity projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.
More generally, there is mild increased opacification with indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion without definite focal opacities.
Calcified pleural plaques are suspected.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
[**2179-3-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-18**]:  Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and hilar vascular engorgement are chronic, consistent with global heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
I do not think there is acute pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumonia.
Asbestos-related pleural calcifications noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  84 year old male with a history of OSA, COPD and RV failure presents with syncopal episode in setting of having a bowel movement.
# Syncope - Occurred in the setting of a bowel movement, so this most likely represents a vasovagal episode.
# Altered mental status - The patient's altered mental status was likely due to a UTI.
# Respiratory distress - The respiratory status was due to volume overload.
Given his right sided heart failure, imdur is a poor choice in medication and was stopped.
# Hypertension - At home is on ACE inhibitor, metoprolol, and imdur.
He was also volume overloaded and he was aggressively diuresis and his blood pressure improved.
He was normotensive on metoprolol and lisinopril 10mg (lower dose) was restarted at discharge since his kidney function was near baseline (1.8, baseline 1.6-1.7)  # Urinary tract infection - Significant pyuria on admission.
Grew >100,000 colonies of pan-senstive pseudomonas.
# Renal failure - Decreased renal function was likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of RV failure and volume overload.
# Dementia - Continue aricept, ropinarole, and celexa throughout hospital course    Medications on Admission: Aspirin 325 mg daily Lisinopril 40 mg daily Isosorbide mononitrate ER 30 mg QPM Torsemide 60 mg daily (and additional tablet if weight >255lbs) Metoprolol succinate ER 75 mg daily Potassium chloride ER 10 mEq [**Hospital1 **] Ferrous Sulfate SR 325 mg daily Aricept 5 mg QHS Ropinirole 2 mg QHS Celexa 20 mg daily Omeprazole 40 mg daily Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] Senna 8.6 mg QHS Brimonidine 0.15 % one drop in each eye [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications:   1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
The fainting was likely due to a condition called vasovagal syncope.
We have started medications to soften your stools and stopped the iron supplements, which can make you constipated.
We also found that you had too much fluid in your body, which was caused by your heart failure.
