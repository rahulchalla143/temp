He is a 24 year-old previously healthy male who was well until after returning from the Caribbean at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] when he developed right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting and anorexia.
He have increased liver function tests, right pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites.
The right pleural effusion was found to be transudative.
He became short of breath and hypotensive during that hospital stay.
CT angiogram showed a pulmonary embolus and he was started on heparin and transferred to [**Hospital3 **].
He was in the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, pulmonary embolus, pleural and increased liver function tests.
His echocardiogram on [**6-15**] showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and a large pericardial effusion with right ventricle diastolic collapse consistent with tamponade physiology.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a patent hepatic and portal veins and he underwent a pericardiocentesis and drain on [**6-15**].
His MICU was significant for temperature spikes to 102.8 and he was treated with intravenous Vancomycin for three days.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for diabetes, father passed away of lung cancer, however, no liver or clotting diseases were noted.
Neck, no JVP, no lymphadenopathy.
Chest with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Positive for egophony and dullness to percussion.
Loud S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities trace to 1+ lower extremity edema more so on the left then the right.
Respiratory:  The patient had large bilateral pleural effusions and was being treated for a pulmonary embolus.
Throughout the course of his stay his effusions were subsequently drained by interventional radiology and ultrasound guided thoracentesis.
He was found eventually found to be positive for factor V liden deficiency and he was continued on heparin and is was discussed with the patient that he will need life long anticoagulation therapy.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no significant reaccumulation of fluids and no cardiothoracic surgery was deemed necessary.
Infectious disease:  He had temperature spikes to 102.8 in the MICU.
He was given Vancomycin for a three day course and low grade temperatures after this antibiotics course was considered secondary to atelectasis.
Hematology:  He was anemic at times throughout his stay, however, this resolved prior to discharge.
Gastrointestinal:  His high liver function tests were considered likely secondary to his hepatic shock and congestion and they eventually returned to [**Location 213**] and he also was given Colace for constipation.
Status post pericarditis, pulmonary embolus and hypercoagulable state secondary to factor V liden deficiency.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Return for a fever greater then 101, increased pain, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations or shortness of breath.
