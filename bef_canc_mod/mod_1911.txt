On the day of presentation he woke up with significant pain in his right knee with swelling.
He also experienced non-bloody emesis x 1 on the day of presentation.
He had had multiple admissions in the past for dizziness and melena.
An old facial droop on the right was noted.
On admission the floor the patient was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s with altered mental status.
He was not noted to have any melena or hematochezia.
He received a liter of IVF, one unit of O negative blood while awaiting type and cross with subsequent improvement in his blood pressure and mental status.
Also found to have hemarthrosis of the left knee which was not felt to be contributing significantly to his decreased hematocrit.
Small bowel enteroscopy showed no active bleeding or AVMs, only small erosion in antrum.
Of note he also developed laboratory abnormalities consistent with low grade DIC with thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen at 64 and elevated fibrin degredation products of 160-320.

Melena or guaiac + stools appear ~2 days later.
He also noted that pt has known severe DJD/arthritis of knees and stated that if knee effusion was asymmetric then most certainly sustained trauma to knee although has close to 24hour supervision.
Pt has underlying dementia w/waxing & [**Doctor Last Name 688**] change in AMS.

KNEE (2 VIEWS) LEFT  [**2185-4-5**] 12:48 AM There is severe tricompartmental joint disease with osteophyte formation and loss of the normal joint space in addition to regions of subchondral sclerosis.
The severe underlying degenerative changes limits the ability for subtle fractures; however, no obvious displaced fractures are identified.
There is a slight irregularity in the region of the tibial tubercle and at the insertion of the quadriceps tendon.
Marked vascular calcification is noted, and there is a moderate-to-large a suprapatellar joint effusion.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Brief Hospital Course: 88 year old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement, GI bleeding, prostate cancer MGUS and chronic renal insufficiency who presented from home with left knee pain and syncope.
Syncopal episode:  The patient has a history of multiple syncopal episodes.
The event happened while the patient was sitting on the comode which argues for a vasovagal etiology.
Hypovolemia also likely contributed as on presentation the patient had evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
On presentation he had evidence of confusion which improved dramatically once he was resuscitated with blood products for his bleeding.
At the time of discharge he denied lightheadedness or dizziness.
He was monitored on telemetry throughout his stay with evidence of atrial fibrillation which was well rate controlled.
Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of 6 prior episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding from small bowel AVMs.
His most recent bleeding episode occurred three months ago.
His hematocrit was within his baseline on presentation but dropped 10 points within the first 24 hours of this admission with associated hypotension to the 60s systolic and altered mental status.
He was transferred to the MICU where he underwent small bowel enteroscopy which demonstrated AVMs but no active bleeding.
Left Knee Effusion:  On presentation the patient was complaining of left knee pain with associated knee swelling.
Xray from the emergency room showed a large effusion with evidence of osteoarthritis.
He underwent arthrocentesis which showed evidence of hemearthrosis.
He subsequently underwent hip and femur films which were negative for fracture.
He did not receive NSAIDs given his history of gastronitestinal bleeding.
It was not thought that the bleeding in his knee was sufficient to account for his decreased hematocrit and hypotension.
The etiology of this finding on presentation is unclear but there was concern for low grade DIC.
He had a low fibrinogen at 64 and fibrin degredation products of 160-320.
Atrial Fibrillation/Sick Sinus Syndrome:  The patient has evidence of an irregular, wide complex rhythm and is status post-pacemaker placement.
He has known atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome and is followed here by electrophysiology.
He also has known MGUS with concern for decreased marrow production.
He also likely has chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from AVMs.
Further workup for his gastrointestinal bleeding would be limited to a double balloon enteroscopy vs. allowing for periodic transfusions.
Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease: the patient's baseline creatinine ranges between [**2-13**].
In the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding his creatinine increased to 3.6.
Dementia:  No active inpatient issues.
Hyperlipidemia - The patient has an allergy to simvastatin reported in the online medical record.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gastrointestinal Bleeding Left Knee Effusion Atrial Fibrillation Sick sinus syndrome Chronic Anemia Acute on chronic renal failure  Secondary: Aortic Insufficiency MGUS Encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for your knee pain and your lightheadedness.
It was thought that this was secondary to osteoarthritis.
You also had a low blood count and underwent upper endoscopy.
Please take tylenol 325-650 mg every six hours as needed for pain  Please keep all your follow up appointments.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening abdominal pain, black or red stools, falls at home or any other concerning symptoms.
