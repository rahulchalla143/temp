IMAGING: CXR ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CT Head ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The maxillary sinuses are incompletely imaged, and no fluid is detected in the included portions of them.
However, there is an apparent inferior and medial left orbital blow out fracture, of uncertain chronicity.
Elements of it appear new since the study of [**2180-5-10**], but the absence of ethmoidal or maxillary hemorrhage argues against an acute fracture.
Bilateral LENIs ([**1-10**]): IMPRESSION: Essentially occlusive thrombus throughout bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins as well as greater saphenous vein.
Extensive new intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left posterior parietal cortex since [**2181-1-8**], extending into the subdural space along with the falx and tentorium cerebri.
No intraventricular extension or midline shift.
No evidence of herniation.
Unchanged old right thalamic lacunar infarct.
The position of the tip is not consistent with a central intravenous location.
It could be in a small vein, or a pleural space.
In the absence of pulmonary hematoma it is unlikely to be in the lung, though the new right pneumothorax projecting over the pleural sulcus and a small right pleural effusion suggest that the lung may have been engaged during the line placement.
Leftward mediastinal shift probably a function of new right pneumothorax and pleural effusion.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to poor echo windows/intubation.
No cardiac source of embolism seen.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Carotid Series ([**1-12**]): IMPRESSION: Minimal focal scattered calcific plaque, no associated ICA or CCA stenosis however.
EEG ([**1-13**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations or electrographic seizures.
No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background did reach a normal alpha frequency during wakefulness, although through most of the day's recording slower background activity was suggestive of excessive drowsiness or a mild encephalopathy.
Hemorrhagic infarction of the left superior parietal lobe and small infarction of the right parietal area secondary to thrmbosed meduallry veins.
Diffuse thrombosis of the sinuses including transverse, sigmoid, straight, superior sagittal.
Opacification of mastoid sinuses bilaterally.
Imaging of the basilic vein could not be performed due to overlying bandaging material.
Unchanged large hemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal and parietal lobes.
Recanalization of the straight sinus, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and the imaged upper portion of the right internal jugular vein.
Persistent, but somewhat less prominent hypoattenuating left lateral liver lesion probably indicating focal fat.
Additional hypoattenuating liver lesion not appreciated on prior non- contrast study in segments II/III of the liver anteriorly, also somewhat concerning but probably representing focal fat.
Loculated-appearing right pleural effusion, with subsegmental atelectasis.
Subsegmental atelectasis on the left.
EEG ([**1-28**]): Impression: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured 4 pushbutton activations without clear electrographic correlate.
On video, the patient appears to have focal tremor or shaking of the left hand and arm.
One automated seizure detection captured focal slowing over the left central and parietal leads with spread to the left hemispheric leads.
This was correlated with a brief episode of right leg tonic clonic movements, suggestive of an electrographic seizure.
Automated and routine sampling also was showed significant slowing predominantly over the left central and parietal leads, consistent with a focal area of subcortical dysfunction and potential seizure focus.
EEG ([**1-29**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured 2 events with rhythmic activity seen over the right hemisphere and one event with generalized rhythmic activity.
The first 2 events likely represent seizure activity accompanied by the behavioral changes described above; however, the EEG was significantly obscured by artifacts.
The last event is consistent with a seizure with more generalized activity during which the patient had head and mouth tremor.
Interictal sharp and slow wave complexes were seen in the right frontal region.
EEG ([**2-2**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations, but did capture numerous periods of rhythmic theta activity seen broadly over the right hemisphere, and with extension to the left frontal region as well.
This activity correlated with rhythmic tremor of the left hand, arm or shoulder, and impaired responsiveness.
These findings are consistent with ongoing seizure activity.
The background was for a substanial period of time obscured by artifacts but showed a slow and disorganized background suggestive of encephalopathy.
EEG ([**2-3**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured 4 pushbutton activations for episodes of left arm shaking, sometimes accompanied by unresponsiveness and rhythmic movements of the mouth, with no clear EEG correlate.
There was one event when the patient turned to the left and the EEG showed semi-rhythmic right frontal delta frequency activity for about 50 seconds.
The background activity showed focal slowing in the frontal regions bilaterally, right temporal region, and bursts of generalized slowing were also seen.
Interictal sharp waves were seen in the right temporal region.
EEG ([**2-11**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG in the awake state due to possible sharp features seen in the right frontal area suggestive of cortical irritability in that regiona.
In addition, the background activity was slower on the left suggestive of significant structural subcortical abnormality in the left hemisphere.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Continued evolution of left parietal infarct .
There is persistent consolidation in the right middle lobe, as before.
Patchy opacities are also seen in the left base.
There is a small right pleural effusion, unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
There is evidence of remote/healed fractures of the right proximal humerus and a right lower rib.
Persistent right middle lobe and left basilar opacity, possibly reflecting aspiration or infection.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2181-1-8**] after being found on his porch with an unwitnessed seizure with bowel and bladder incontinence.
He had minimal access (R hip IV) and had B femoral line attempts unsuccessfully for ?
CT head was negative for acute bleed but did show an orbital fracture that was felt to more likely chronic without surrounding hemorrhage.
Upon admission to the MICU, he became "unresponsive for approximately 8 minutes while experiencing bilateral upper extremity tonic-clonic jerking."
He had another episode of "tonic UE and eye rolling" on [**1-9**] or [**1-10**], for which he was given Ativan 2 mg IM with ressolution in 10 minutes.
On the floor, he was found to have extensive B LE clots.
He was also discovered to have an infrarenal IVC filter in place.
He had recurrent seizures on the floor treated with IV ativan.
On [**1-11**], patient noted to have further seizing with gaze preference, nystagmus, and was unresponsive with flaccid paralysis of RUE.
At that time he also had respiratory arrest.
CT head at that time showed new intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left posterior parietal cortex and code stroke was called.
Neurology felt this was most c/w an MCA ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation.
At 4:45 pm, the medicine attending evaluated the patient and found him to be less responsive with left gaze preference.
Upon re-evalution he was concerned that the patient had developed a right hemiparesis with flaccid tone in the RUE.
NEUROLOGY:  The L MCA territory was likely from hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke or from venous sinus thrombosis.
Repeat CT scans showed stability of his hemorrhage with expected progression of infarction.
Deficits include expressive aphasia, RUE weakness with intermittent strength upto anti-gravity, and L gaze preference and intermittent nystagmus.
With regards to his orbital blow out fracture seen on CT head at admission, it appeared chronic.
No further intervention needed at this time as at least >5 days out from injury and no evidence of decreased eye ROM, impingement of EOM, or other concerning findings.
Regardless, would be poor surgical candidate.
With regards to his seizures, patient had a h/o childhood seizures and EtOH withdrawal seizures.
Unclear etiology of initial seizures on admission.
However, following hemorrhage, he had recurrent seizures where were felt to be due to irritable focus from hemorrhage as well as new stroke.
He had multiple dilantin loads until his corrected dilantin level was in therapeutic range of 15-20.
Typical seizure activity was LUE rhythmic shaking, sometimes with jaw twitching and L superior gaze preference.
At times his seizure would become more generalized and he would have alteration of his mental status.
His keppra dose was uptitrated with decreased frequency of seizures.
He is currently on Keppra 2g [**Hospital1 **], Phenytoin 200mg TID, Zonegran 200mg/500mg, and Trileptal 1200mg [**Hospital1 **] plus standing Ativan but continues to have intermittent clinical seizures responsive to 2mg to 6mg of IV Ativan or 10mg IM Diazepam.
He was discharged on Diastat 15mg per rectum as needed for seizures.
His altered MS/agitation was likely due to stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, recurrent seizures, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection, prolonged hospital stay.
HEMATOLOGY:  With regards venous sinus thrombosis, it is likely due to underlying hypercoaguable state.
Anticoagulation complicated by poor access and difficult blood draws.
He was initially treated with heparin but due to difficult blood draws this was transitioned to lovenox.
Ct venogram showed partial recannalization of thromboses suggesting response to anticoagulation.
However, due to extremely difficult blood draws and poor access, the decision was made to continue long term lovenox therapy.
If worsening density despite calcium and vitamin D, could consider addition of bisphosphonate or transition from lovenox to fondaparinox or coumadin.
Hematology was consulted and of the labs ordered, he does have elevated anticardiolipin antibody.
His hypercoaguable state as evidenced by multiple clots in LEs and diffuse venous sinus thrombosis as well as suspected ischemic stroke all suggest hypercoagulable state.
He has an infrarenal IVC filter in place which was old, likely placed for chronic LE clots.
Factor V Leiden was also negative but anticardiolipin ab positive although not conclusive for antiphospholipid syndrome as noted above hence will follow-up in Heme [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient.
PULMONARY  In the setting of acute ICH and status epilepticus, he had an aspiration pna s/p multiple intubations and multiple central line attempts without success.
R subclavian CVL attempt failed and was complicated by a pneumothorax.
Last CT was removed [**1-19**] without evidence of recurrent pneumothorax on repeat CXRs.
Following completion of his treatment he had no fevers, leukocytosis, or other evidence of pneumonia.
His hypoxia with O2 requirement likely had multiple potential etiologies including emphysema, recent pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, and possible PEs given suspected thrombophilia.
As mental status improved, he passed a swallow evaluation for a modified diet with supervision.
