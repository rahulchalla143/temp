Admission Date:  [**2147-9-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-9-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-5-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  C-MED Blue  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient comes in with chest pain.
He took two sublingual nitroglycerin tablets, and the pain resolved.
The pain returned in 30 minutes again.
No nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath.
He received three sublingual nitroglycerin in the ambulance and some morphine, and there was no resolution of the pain.
In the Emergency Department he was given a nitroglycerin drip and heparin drip and had resolution of his pain.
He has been pain free since.
He has no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Coronary artery disease with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft back in [**2135**].
He also has had prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy which had led him to have consistently guaiac-positive stools.
He also has elevated cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
His brother had a myocardial infarction in his 60s and died.
There is also hypertension in the family.
His neck revealed there was no jugular venous distention.
His neck was soft and supple, and there were no bruits.
On examination, the patient (Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**]) did have a 2/6 systolic murmur in his right upper sternal border.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
His genitourinary examination showed guaiac-positive stool.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory values on admission showed a first set of creatine kinases were actually negative at 45, troponin of less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block, ST depressions in V4 to V6 which were new.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes, and he was subjected to a Persantine thallium test which showed a moderate reversible inferior wall defect with an ejection fraction of 65%.
The patient was then taken to catheterization on [**9-21**] which showed 2-vessel disease with left main coronary that was normal.
Again, his second catheterization totally occluded saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal and third obtuse marginal at the site of prior intervention earlier that day.
Echocardiogram at this time showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, and echocardiogram on the next morning in the Coronary Care Unit showed no additional effusions.
The patient continued to do experience chest pain which he has had since his second intervention.
Enzymes drawn that day showed evidence for a myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase of 1211, 97 MB fraction 8%, and the next subsequent creatine kinases were 1065, 1213.
The patient also demonstrated ST elevations in his electrocardiogram.
His electrocardiogram actually showed over time evolving anterolateral non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
The patient's creatine kinases continued to trend down from the time of his admission starting on [**9-22**] after his myocardial infarction.
On [**9-23**] it was noted that his hematocrit had dropped from the lower 30s to 24%, and the patient also complained of new onset left shoulder pain; so, the patient underwent a CT angiography which showed no dissection.
The aorta and a CT of his abdomen and pelvis showed no retroperitoneal bleeds, no femoral bleeds.
He was guaiac was actually negative indicating no evidence for severe gastrointestinal bleeding.
Moreover, his hemolysis laboratory workup did not show evidence of intravascular hemolysis.
It was determined later that his shoulder pain which was ruled out for aortic dissection turned out was probably related to a fall which he had not reported against the side wall.
There was no loss of consciousness at the time, and his pain improved with treatment with Tylenol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE/STATUS:  Given that the patient's course improved after the myocardial infarction with continuing trending down enzymes, electrocardiogram resolving, and the patient's overall clinical picture improved, he was discharged on [**9-27**] in improved status to the [**Hospital3 2558**] Rehabilitation facility.
Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in the anterolateral region.
Coronary artery disease.
