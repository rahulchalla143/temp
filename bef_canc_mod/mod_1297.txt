Over the past 1-2 days, the patient has noted increasing dyspnea upon exertion, previously able to climb approximately one flight of stairs, and now with shortness of breath with minimal level ground ambulation.
At a routine ophthalmology appointment today she was found to have marked dyspnea and referred to the emergency room.
In the ER the patient received an EKG demonstrating low voltage, and CXR demonstrated a grossly enlarged heart.
Bedside echo demonstrated large cardiac effusion, and the patient was transferred to CCU for further management.

No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-2**], the pericardial  effusion is slightly larger.
Echo [**2114-4-2**] There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.

Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Poor R wave progression.
Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes .
The initial pericardial pressures were elevated with significant respiratory variation.
A post-procedure echocardiogram demonstrated a moderate residual effusion and successful [**Date Range 99607**] of large pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2114-3-30**] The cardiac shadow is again grossly enlarged, however, there has been interval decrease in size.
There is left lower lobe atelectasis, which in retrospect, was previously present.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
The pericardial drain tip can be seen over the left superior cardiac border.IMPRESSION: Interval placement of pericardial drain, without pneumothorax; drain appears to be quite advanced along the superior aspect of the heart.
Persistently enlarged but decreased cardiac shadow.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
The cardiac silhouette is grossly enlarged with extension beyond the aortic knob, concerning for pericardial effusion.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.impression: Grossly enlarged cardiac silhouette concerning for pericardial effusion/tamponade, much less likely multichamber cardiac enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old female with increasing dyspnea upon exertion, found to have large cardiac effusion on CXR and echocardiography.
At presentation in the ED, the patient had elevated pulsus paradoxus (20 mm Hg), but no echocardiographic or electrocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
There was estimated 1-2 L of pericardial fluid present with severely dilated right atrium and ventricle, suggestive of a chronic accumulation process.
The morning after admission, the patient underwent [**Year/Month/Day 99607**] without complication at which time a drain was placed.
Over the next 2.5 days, about 2-3L of serous fluid was eluted.
Drain removal was required to prevent infectious complications and 3 days of kefzol was given for prophylaxis.
She was afebrile without leukocytosis.
Fluid analysis revealed a transudate without evidence of infection or malignant cells.
Other possibilities include idiopathic, collagen vascular disease related (h/o inflammatory arthritis but [**Doctor First Name **] negative), drug induced, or  metabolic (thryoid function within normal).
No recent trauma.
Chest xray did not suggest presence of parechymal disease.
Echocardiogram at admission demonstrated a large effusion approx 3cm in diameter,  EF>55% with normal LV function, global RV hypokinesis & dilation as well as LA/IVC dilation.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 99607**], the pericardial effusion  was "small" by echocardiogram on [**4-2**]; however, the RA/RV/IVC dilation and valvular dysfunction remained.
Per report, echo in [**2109**] had 4+TR, mod MR, moderately dilated RV with moderate hypokinesis, and a minimally dilated LA.
LV size and function was normal; no effusion was seen.
Medical management for heart failure included metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvastatin.
If evidence of significant accumulation of pericardial effusion, the patient should be quickly referred for cardiothoracic surgery evaluation for possible pericardial window procedure to reduce risk of tamponade.
Also, screening of 5HIAA level to rule out carcinoid as a cause for effusion was still pending at discharge.
Anemia -For chronic anemia and history of iron deficient anemia, the patient received 2 units PRBC at admission that raised her hematocrit from 24 to above 30 where it then remained stable.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency and retic count was appropriate.
She did not have B12 or folate deficiency.
Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2792**] in [**2106**] revealed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
Dementia - The patient was consistently disoriented to place and time, displaying severe defects in short term memory.
For chronic, severe sundowning with risk to safety, the patient was treated successfully with standing olanzapine.
History of asthma - No wheezing occurred during the hospital stay.
The patient routinely had dyspnea on exertion thought secondary to the heart failure.
If needed, therapy using atrovent, but not albuterol, is recommended with the heart failure condition.
Chronic hyonatremia - Her sodium ranged in the high 120s and was thought chronically reduced in the setting of loop diuretic use and possibly SIADH after analysis of urine electrolytes and osmolality.
Fluid restriction was recommended for both hyonatremia and heart failure.
Prophylaxis ??????
Since you have chronic pericardial effusion, it is important to monitor your symptoms.
Call your doctor of go to the ED if you have worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, palpitations, or other concerning symtpoms.
For congestive heart failure, follow a low <2g sodium diet and weigh yourself daily.
For weight increased above 2kg, call your doctor.
For disorientation and dementia, consider outpatient psychometric testing.
Anticoagulation is not recommended for atrial fibrillation due to fall risk.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need a follow up echocardiogram to check for recurrence of pericardial effusion.
