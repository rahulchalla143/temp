Admission Date:  [**2137-3-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2137-3-29**]   Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman presenting to the Emergency Department for right hip pain with difficulty ambulating times a week.
Denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or trauma.
In the Emergency Department, patient became tachypnea requiring more O2 requirement and was nasotracheally intubated secondary to pending respiratory distress.
The patient then experienced an episode of hypotension down to 75/48, fluid responsive.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Patient also had a fever of up to 101.8 degrees and was empirically started on ceftriaxone 2 grams IV.
Coronary artery disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
Is retired and no recent travel or sick contacts, nonsmoker and no alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  By review of systems, the patient came in with a fever of unclear etiology, but blood cultures grew out Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, coag positive, and suspected to have an infected endocarditis.
On transthoracic echocardiogram was not shown to have any vegetations.
On transesophageal echocardiogram, 5 mm vegetation was found on the aortic valve on both sides of the leaflet without any abscess in the aortic root.
However, we also considered other possible sources of infection to be considered meningitis, and he was empirically started on ceftriaxone, consider chest x-ray which did not reveal any acute consolidations.
On genitourinary examination, he had a right inguinal hernia that was examined by surgery and felt to be reducible and nonincarcerated.
Another source of possible infection is right hip possible osteomyelitis given the initial hip pain as well as urine.
Once the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus, sensitivities came back, he was switched to oxacillin and gentamicin.
In terms of his infective endocarditis, he was also started on Xigris given multiorgan dysfunction.
In the middle of his MICU course, he did have some low grade spiking temperatures.
A lumbar puncture was performed and did not reveal an infection in that system, no meningitis.
There is debate whether there was some component of cardiogenic.
Given the positive blood cultures, it was confident that it was sepsis, however, he had a depressed ejection fraction on echocardiogram again likely secondary to sepsis.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
He had a fever all suggesting to septic shock.
He was treated with Xigris and antibiotics with underlying source.
In terms of cardiac issues, in the initial presentation, he had ST depressions that resolved on repeat electrocardiogram.
He had an elevated troponin over 50.
It was thought that this was secondary to demand ischemia from his hypotension and sepsis picture.
It was felt by ID and cardiology that repeat transesophageal echocardiogram was not necessary unless he had persistent fevers or blood cultures.
After being extubated for 1-2 days, he had another episode of tachycardia with rate- related hypotension and ST chagnes.
Hip:  He had a MRI that showed bony destruction of his right hip likely osteomyelitis.
In terms of his inguinal hernia is reducible.
He had a Foley in, and one issue with in terms of renal, he had episodes of hematuria with clots that formed blocking the Foley catheter.
They placed a 24 French catheter, irrigated, and had a significant amount of clots, replaced with a three-way Foley with continuous bladder irrigation.
