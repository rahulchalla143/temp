# Mast Cell Degranulation: Pt's symptoms were classic for a flare (CP, SOB, ha, n/v).
On day 2 of admission, she reported increasing difficulty breathing and her tongue was moderately edematous and erythematous.
She requested an epi pen, which was given with no effect as well as supplements from her cocktail.
After an hour she still exhibited signs of acute respiratory distress and she requested prophylactic intubation.
Per anesthesia, there was no sign of laryngeal edema and intubation was easy.
However, anesthesia team noted that prophylactic intubation is necessary in this pt given her cushingoid habitus and difficult intubation if laryngeal edema was present.
# Chronic pain - after pt's extubation, pt demanded IV Dilaudid and threatened multiple times to leave the hospital AMA.
She complained of headache and chest pain.
At this time, she had no shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**], wheezing, pruritus, neuro sx, or any other symptoms.
# Chest pain/SOB - While sx were classic for flare, CXR was obtained to r/o infx which showed no signs of pna or congestion.
LDH was not checked due to chronic elevation.
Pt's allergist at OSH was also contact[**Name (NI) **] re:PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim but allergist never responded.
Per providers at [**Hospital1 18**], PCP prophylaxis has been discussed without resolution.
# diarrhea - pt complained of diarrhea on admission, but did not supply stool sample until day prior to discharge.
Given pt's recent exposure to antibx (z-pack as outpt), C dif was checked and was negative.
# anemia - HCT 30, MCV 86; baseline HCT 30-35.
Per pt, has been told she has iron deficiency in the past.
# chronic steroids/iatrogenic [**Location (un) **] - per pt, is on steroids >50% of year.
Pt has very cushingoid appearance that per multiple providers, has increased over the past year.
# Depression/anxiety: - team discussed contribution of severe anxiety to her flares.
# Osteoarthritis:  - pt continued home Plaquenil .
She reports her breathing is uncomfortable and worrisome, but not yet at the point of intubation.
Day of transfer to the MICU, patient complained of worsening SOB without concomitant CP.
Patient was intubated by anesthesia on the floor without complication and transported to the MICU for further management.
# Shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**]:  This represented the 4th intubation for the patient.
Per the intubating anesthesiologist, there was no evidence of tracheal or laryngeal edema.
Of not the patient was without desaturation by pulse-oximetry or ABG.
Thus, not truly hypercarbic or hypoxic respiratory failure.
The patient was subsequently extubated without complication.
# Mast Cell Degranulation: Pt initially stated that her presenting symptoms are consistent with her flairs.
