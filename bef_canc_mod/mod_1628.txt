Additional bursts of beta activity were seen in the cardiac monitor which, at times, correlated with left frontotemporal beta activity likely due to artifact.
There were no clear electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2118-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, which are much more prominent than the previous day's recording, with occasional brief periods of generalized suppression.
These findings are indicative of a severe encephalopathy which could be due to ischemia, infection, or toxic/ metabolic disturbances and medication effects, among other etiologies.
It is also abnormal due to occasional sharp and slow wave discharges in the frontal regions and, at times, with a generalized appearance which can represent potentially epileptogenic cortex.
Generalized superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a  medication effect, most commonly from benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
There were no clear electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2118-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, similar to yesterday's recording with occasional brief periods of generalized suppression.
These findings are indicative of a severe encephalopathy, which could be due to ischemia, infection, or toxic/metabolic disturbances, and  medication effects, among other etiologies.
It is also abnormal due to rare sharp discharges in the frontal regions, L>R, which can represent potentially epileptogenic cortex.
There was a breach rhythm over the left frontal leads which can occur with a skull defect.
Generalized superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a medication effect, most commonly from benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
There were no clear electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2118-7-8**]: PENDING  EEG [**2118-7-11**]: PENDING  CT-Head [**2118-7-4**]:  Slightly limited study secondary to patient motion, nevertheless with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
Lung volumes are low and note is made of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
No obvious focus of abnormal enhancement in the left parietal parasagittal surgical resection cavity to suggest recurrent tumor.
A tiny focus of enhancement in the left frontal parasagittal location in the white matter was seen on the earlier studies and may represent a slow flow vascular lesion such as capillary telangiectasia or related to a tiny focal enhancing lesion, nature of which is uncertain.
However, there is no gross change noted in the size and appearance compared to the prior studies of [**2117-10-6**].
No acute intracranial process on CT. 2.
Stable area of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter in the left frontoparietal area, likely encephalomalacia, at site of remote resection site of left parafalcine meningioma.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known firstname 14611**] is a 68-year-old woman, status post resection and radiation of an atypical meningioma who presents with seizures and was intubated for a total of 10 days for airway protection.
While in ICU her course was complicated by delayed waking raising concern for anoxic injury.
EEG showed diffuse encepahlopathy (though initially concern for persistent seizure) and after a prolonged trial after propfol the patient awoke.
She has been maintained on levetiracetam, phenytoin, and dexamethasone for seizure prophylaxis and has not been noted to have further seizure activity.
Also had a fever in the ICU during prolonged intubation so was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
(1) Seizures and Altered Mental Status:  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with seizures thought to be secondary to subtherapeutic levels of levetiracetam, however serial EEGs showed no electrographic evidence of seizure.
Patient was intubated for several days for altered mental status and seizures.
She was weaned off of sedation and was extubated  (2) Health Care Associated Pneumonia:  Cefepime/Vanc started on [**2118-7-9**] due to leukocytosis, fever, and question of infiltrates on chest radiograph leading to presumed diagnosis of health care associated pneumonia.
(3) Meningioma:  There was no acute issues other than above.
We will defer to Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] from neuro-oncology for further management  (4) History of DVT:  She is status post 6 months of effective anticoagulation with warfarin.
There was no bleed on current imaging.
(5) Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] for management of her meningioma and seizures.
