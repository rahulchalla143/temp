There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferoseptal, inferior, inferolateral, and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pericardial effusion.
CT Chest Limited examination due to respiratory motion artifacts.
Suspicion for increased tracheobronchial collapsibility.
Several partly ill-defined parenchymal opacities in the periphery of the right upper lobe, the left lower lobe and the right lower lobe.
The morphology of these opacities suggests chronic post-infectious changes, supported by areas of bronchiectasis and small calcifications.
The largest of these lesions is located in the right upper lobe and is visualized on the chest radiograph.
No evidence for malignancy.
Small pleural effusions.
Moderate coronary calcifications.
Segmental widening of the esophageal lumen.
Minimal axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Evidence of mild chronic airways disease.
KNEE XRAY No abnormalities are seen at the amputation site that suggest osteomyelitis.
There are no stones or signs of hydronephrosis or any perinephric fluid collections seen.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of stones or fluid collections.
Normal-sized kidneys, but increased echogenicity consistent with some form of diffuse parenchymal disease, unchanged since [**2111**].
Brief Hospital Course: 39F h/o cocaine/opiate abuse, recent [**Hospital1 2025**] admission for PEA, NSTEMI in [**12-11**], systolic CHF, DM1 c/b b/l BKA amputations, admitted to ICU for DKA now resolved, with klebsiella UTI on [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and HTN urgency in context of poorly controlled stump pain.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis/DM1: anion gap on admission which closed with insulin and IVF.
# UTI: UCx with Klebsiella, less extensively resistant than [**2113-3-6**] isolates at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of pyelonephritis.
# Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure was up to 190s systolic in the ED and required three doses of IV labetalol to bring the BP down to 160s systolic.
# Phantom Limb Pain: Patient reporting [**11-12**] bilateral limb pain during admission.
Of note, her gabapentin had initially been held in the setting of altered mental status.
Her pain was treated with opiates and her gabapentin was restarted.
Her pain was significantly better controlled towards the time of discharge.
# Right BKA stump.
The patient's right BKA stump has a small area of discharge.
# Systolic CHF: EF 40% for several years.
The etiology of her heart problems are likely a combination of her cocaine use, hyperlipidemia, and poorly controlled type 1 DM.
# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 32.5.
Felt appropriate for further outpatient evaluation and management.
# Altered mental status: Thought to be secondary to combination of DKA, opiates, and urinary infection.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Wound care consulted and recommendations followed.
# Polysubstance abuse.
