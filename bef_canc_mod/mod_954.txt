He subsequently [**First Name3 (LF) 1834**] a right sided hemi-craniectomy for hematoma evacuation.
About one month later, he developed significant hydrocephalus and a VP shunt was placed from the left on [**4-25**].
Was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2109-5-6**] for leukocytosis of unknown origin.
There fore had CT which showed right hemispheric bleed he was then transferred here  Past Medical History: # Right hemicraniectomy in [**3-6**] - struck as a pedestrian and sustained a closed head injury resulting in SAH, SDH, epidural hemorrhage, sagittal sinus laceration and fractures requiring right-sided hemicraniectomy, evacuation of hematoma, and dural repair of the superior sagittal sinus by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# Superior saggital thrombosis # From hospital admission in [**2109-2-28**] 1) Fevers likely secondary to: 2) drug hypersensitivity with Dilantin 3) Chemical pancreatitis (likely secondary to #2) 4) Transaminitis/hepatitis (likely secondary to #2) 5) Thrombocytosis - likely secondary to #2 + s/p CNS injury/surgery 6) Moderate malnutrition 7) Anemia of inflammation, no evidence for hemolysis, with some  mild blood loss - trace occult blood positive stools 8) Hypertension 9) Elevation of alpha-1-antitrypsin - query significance - would repeat when acute inflammatory state subsides # IVC filter place [**3-19**] # S/P PEG # S/P VP shunt on [**2109-4-25**] for hyrdrocephalus # Central apnea - uses BIPAP   Social History: Married with involved family, patient now resides at [**Hospital1 **].

However, the shunt has been over shunting and the patient presented with progressive decline in mental status with a CAT scan showing severe midline shift towards the left side and intracranial hemorrhage.
Based on that, we decided that the patient was over shunted and that was creating negative pressure which has as a result the midline shift and the pressure and the hemorrhage in the patient's brain.
He was monitored in the ICU for 4 days with a poor exam, he developed a right non reactive pupil on POD#1 and his exam was consistent with posturing.
His CT did show some improvement in midline shift for 48 hours but then later worsened on post op day 3  The degree of inward deformation of the right frontal-temporal convexity cortex is unaltered.
No apparent extension of the hemorrhage seen along the posterior margin of the craniectomy defect is apparent.
