**FINAL REPORT [**2110-1-13**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2110-1-13**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Large hematoma in the left upper quadrant.
Findings are consistent with a large perisplenic hematoma, with extension into the intraperitoneal cavity, with blood in the paracolic gutters and around the liver.
Additionally, there is a smaller component within the left nephrectomy bed.
Post-surgical changes from recent surgery are again seen in the abdominal wall.
Because the patient had a splenectomy, he received a Haemophilus, pneumococcal, and a meningococcal vaccine.
Due to his foley catheter which had been in place since his previous surgery, the patient developed an E. coli urinary tract infection and was treated with Cipro for this.
A CT cystogram was obtained on [**2110-1-16**] which showed no bladder leak.
During his admission, the patient had complaints of some mild shortness of breath with rhonchorous breath sounds and tachypnea.
On discharge, the patient was oxygenating well on room air and was not complaining of shortness of breath.
The patient's previous symptoms were likely due to his COPD, atelectasis, and fluid overload for which he was receiving Lasix.
