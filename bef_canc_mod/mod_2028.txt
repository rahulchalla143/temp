Portal mesenteric vein thrombosis - As mentioned in previous discharge summary, the patient was managed conservatively in the unit with intravenous antibiotics which were discontinued on the day of transfer to the floor, [**2146-4-19**], heparin drip with transition to Warfarin, serial abdominal examinations.
The cause of the patient's thrombosis is unclear.
her initial abdominal computerized axial tomography scan was consistent with cirrhosis but this is not noted on the subsequent ultrasound dated [**2146-4-14**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will also require screening for metastatic disease as a possible cause for hypercoagulability including mammogram and colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Abdominal pain - The patient's abdominal pain was most likely secondary to post ischemic inflammation.
The patient's liver function tests were not elevated suggesting that cholelithiasis or cholecystitis was unlikely.
The patient's lactate had normalized by the time she was transferred to the General Medical Floor making continuing mesenteric ischemia less likely.
At the time of discharge, the patient's abdominal pain had nearly completely resolved and she was tolerating a solid diet without difficulty.
Diarrhea - The patient's diarrhea noted in the unit and following transfer to the General Medical Floor is likely secondary to prior mesenteric ischemia.
Congestive heart failure - As mentioned previously, the patient's ejection fraction was noted to be 20 to 30% on echocardiogram.
Her lung examination and weight will need to be monitored on a regular basis as an outpatient to ensure that she is adequately diuresed to prevent congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Leukocytosis - The leukocytosis noted in the Intensive Care Unit was likely secondary to stress response, recent steroids, versus infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and interim abdominal infection).
The patient's chest x-ray was not suggestive of pneumonia and her urine culture and blood cultures were negative at the time of dictation.
Hypertension - The patient had alternating hyper and hypotension in the unit.
However, given that her blood pressure was stable and in order to achieve maximal control of her congestive heart failure, the patient was started on Metoprolol and an ACE inhibitor as well as Lasix.
Coronary artery disease - Although there is no documented history of coronary artery disease, the patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with evidence of focal wall motion abnormalities on her echocardiograms.
Her outpatient primary care physician may consider [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress test for further workup of possible coronary artery disease.
Given the patient's history of guaiac positive stool and the fact that she is currently anticoagulated, an aspirin was not given.
Anemia - The patient's hematocrit was stable at the time of discharge.
She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and is currently on iron.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please follow up with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers, chills or increased diarrhea.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertension, hyperlipidemia and anemia.
Outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for evaluation of iron deficiency and guaiac positive stools.
Outpatient coronary artery disease evaluation for depressed left ventricular function and focal wall motion abnormalities.
Outpatient age-appropriate cancer screening and thrombophilia workup for spontaneous mesenteric thrombosis.
4-6 hours prn for fever or pain.
prn diarrhea 14.
