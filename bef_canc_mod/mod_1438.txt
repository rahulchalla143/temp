Pt has been maintained on mesalamine and prednisone  Has a recent submassive PE last month with thrombolytics and placement of IVF filter.
Had tagged RBC initially that showed diffuse bleeding ("findings consistent with intermittent active bleeding likely within sigmoid colon").
Then had sigmoidoscopy on [**2195-8-28**] which showed friable colon, diffuse bleeding c/w Crohn's; biopsies were taken.
Past Medical History: Type 2 Diabetes Obestiy Crohn's disease, with history of GI bleed Hypertension Diverticulitis s/p Partial Colectomy x 2 s/p Multiple Herniorraphy's Arthritis   Social History: After discharge in [**2195-7-25**].
Family History: No family history of blood clots, malignancy, or sudden cardiac death.
No family history of Crohn's disease.
Thickening of the transverse colon, and mild thickening of the terminalv ileum, most likely related to the patient's known Crohn's disease, although infection is an additional possibility.
Large right spigelian hernia, with some ascending colon outside of the field of view.
Small ventral hernia containing a small bowel loop, without evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of abscess or abnormal fluid collection.4.
Right basilar airspace opacity most likely infectious, or less likely, the sequelae of prior pulmonary embolus.
CXR ([**8-26**]):  No focal consolidation identified.
Bleeding Study ([**8-27**]):  Findings consistent with intermittent active bleeding likely within sigmoid colon.
GI Biopsy: Colon, biopsy: - Chronic active colitis.No dysplasia or granulomas identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 56 yo male h/o Crohn's, diverticulosis s/p hemicolectomy, with recent hospitalization for bilateral PE discharged on warfarin anticoagulation who was readmitted for lower GI bleeding.
# GI Bleeding secondary to Crohn's flare/Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Pt was admitted to the hospital after he noticed a small amount of blood in his bowel movements.
Pt was recently admitted with a gi bleed and during admission developed pulmonary emboli necessitating intubation in the intensive care unit.
Overnight the patient developed multiple bloody bowel movements.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable however had a significant drop in hematocrit necessitating one unit of packed red blood cells and transfer to the ICU.
Labeled red blood cell scan showed bleeding in the sigmoid colon.
Colonoscopy was consistent with severe Crohn's disease.
After patient's Crohns Disease is better managed pt may then be a candidate for anticoagulation.
# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli/s/p IVC filter: On admission anticoagulation was reversed given GI bleed.
# Type 2 Diabetes, poorly controlled, no complications: Pt was continued on lantus with sliding scale insulin.
# Depression: Pt reports major social issues after discharge from hospital.
No active suicidal ideation per patient.
Psych recommended increasing citalopram to 30mg monitoring for mania given patients hx of aggression.
