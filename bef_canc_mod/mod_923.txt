Physical Exam: Physical exam: T Afeb  HR 88  BP 150/87  RR 14  Sat 96% on RA ) GEN 	sitting in chair, leaning to the right side, asleep HEENT 	NCAT, MMM, OP clear, +~1.5cm skin-colored fleshy, irregular lesion beneath right eye Chest 	CTAB CVS 	irregular rhythm, no m/r/g ABD 	soft, NT, ND, +BS EXT 	no rash, weak distal pulses   Pertinent Results: [**2199-5-8**] INR 2.6  [**2199-5-7**] 02:20AM BLOOD  WBC-6.2 RBC-3.15* Hgb-9.5* Hct-28.0* MCV-89 MCH-30.3 MCHC-34.1 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-167  [**2199-5-7**] 02:20AM BLOOD  PT-23.5* PTT-36.1* INR(PT)-2.3*  [**2199-5-7**] 02:20AM BLOOD  Glucose-136* UreaN-25* Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-4.3 Cl-108 HCO3-25 AnGap-9  [**2199-5-7**] 02:20AM BLOOD  Calcium-8.0* Phos-2.0* Mg-2.0  [**2199-5-4**] 08:22AM BLOOD  Lactate-1.0  [**2199-5-2**] 10:22PM BLOOD  Glucose-100 Lactate-2.3* K-3.4* Cl-125*  EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed on VICU 11.
He did follow one step commands, though inconsistently, with a delay and with visual cues/modeling.
Pt's speech was intelligible and fluent, but responses were very limited.
Teeth: Edentulous Secretions: Mild amount of thick, clear, sputum was stranding from the hard palate to the tongue.
Palatal elevation was symmetrical.
SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT: PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, cup), purees ( tsp x2), and nectar thick liquid (tsp, cup).
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation, though he swallowed multiple times per bolus.
Overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration.
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids, but more significantly is refusing all po's, despite maximal encouragement.
Unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 9:13 PM  Interpretation: There are several areas of hyperintensity on the diffusion weighted images.
These are located in the right frontal and left occipital lobes with questionable involvement of the left frontal lobe.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect.
The vessels appear unchanged, with a large right A1, and no detectable left A1 branch of the anterior cerebral artery.
Impression: Several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting recent infarction.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 2:36 PM  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Chronic right frontal and parietal lobe infarctions are again noted.
Marked periventricular white matter hypodensity is again seen most consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
There were numerous prominent vessels, arterial and venous, and no explanation for the hemorrhage.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-4-25**] no major change.
Argatroban was administered intra-operatively  Prolong intubation in SICU / requiring pressure support / metabolic acidosis  On [**5-2**], there was a period of hypotension to 90s/50s requiring pressor support, but this was transient.
Pain is currently being managed with Dilaudid PCA and Bupivacaine epidural.
Epidural DC by pain service  Pt has been somewhat difficult to arouse with limited speech output and eye rolling during morning rounds [**5-4**], prompting consult for seizure evaluation from Neurology  CT scan / MRI done - no acute process.
Final neurological - toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative medications (Dilaudid) being used for pain control  Pt received fundaperinox from transition to coumadin for Afib.
Pt with difficulty swallowing / G tube / pt on TF.
AAA was diagnosed when pt was admitted [**12-12**] s/p right parietal subacute infarction as well as right intraventricular hemorrhage.
Post op, neurology was consulted as the pt was somnolent with decreased speech output.
Neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative medications being used for pain control.
PMH includes: s/p right parietal subacute infarction and right intraventricular hemorrhage,  Seizure disorder, Abdominal aortic aneurysm, Atrial fibrillation, Hypertension, COPD, CHF, Pulmonary hypertension,Benign prostatic hypertrophy, T2 compression fracture found [**2199-1-7**], s/p MRSA bacteremia [**1-13**], s/p heparin induced thrombocytopenia, s/p cholecystectomy [**1-12**],(+) UTI.
That study revealed a mild-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time.
After fatigue, he demonstrated reduced A-P tongue movement, moderate oral cavity residue, moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngeal valve closure, moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriform sinus residue.
Because pt's oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly, he was at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over the course of an entire meal.
He did follow one step commands, though inconsistently, with a delay and with visual cues/modeling.
Pt's speech was intelligible and fluent, but responses were very limited.
Teeth: Edentulous Secretions: Mild amount of thick, clear, sputum was stranding from the hard palate to the tongue.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT: PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, cup), purees ( tsp x2), and nectar thick liquid (tsp, cup).
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation, though he swallowed multiple times per bolus.
Overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration.
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids, but more significantly is refusing all po's, despite maximal encouragement.
Unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology.
