2) New gliosis in the portion of the left frontal lobe which herniates through the craniectomy defect.
MRI may be helpful to evaluate for cerebritis or another possible cause.
3) Increased gliosis in the right frontal lobe and in the superior anterior left frontal lobe.
Herniation of the left frontal lobe through the left craniotomy defect also appears little changed compared to prior study.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Again seen is evidence of repair of right orbital floor fracture, as well as multiple fractures involving the right maxillary sinus and nasal bones.
IMPRESSION: No significant change is seen compared to prior study, with persistent hydrocephalus, herniation of the left frontal lobe through the craniotomy defect.
Unchanged gliosis and extra-axial collections.
