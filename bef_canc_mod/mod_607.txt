Upon presentation, pt denied complaints, but was noted to be in complete heart block with a wide complex escape rhythm (RBBB pattern) at 40 bpm.
Known to have second degree AV block on EKG prior.
Carotid sinus massage and exercise were performed with no prominent effect on AV nodal conduction.
As a pacemaker was recommended, ID was consulted due to recent infection/bacteremia.
A TEE was performed and did not reveal any vegetations.
He was afebrile with negative Blood cx's since [**2-22**], maintained on Abx  at dialysis.
Past Medical History: -Diabetes mellitus 2 -chronic kidney disease stage 4 on HD MWF -Ulcerative colitis: no flares x 25 years -Right adrenal adenoma.
-Remote history of nephrolithiasis.
-Hypertension -Peripheral vascular disease s/p left [**Doctor Last Name **]-dp bypass -carotid stenosis -infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm -deep venous thrombosis in [**2195**] -iron deficiency anemia -recent episode of aphasia which resolved - ?
TIA  Social History: Quit smoking at age 73.
No alcohol or illicit drug use.
Father and mother had cerebrovascular accidents.
Echo [**2200-3-7**] No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or peri-valvular abcesses seen.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mildly depressed left ventricular and moderately depressed right ventricular systolic function.
Complex plaque in descending aorta and aortic arch.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**2200-3-8**] - IMPRESSION: Evidence for mild vascular congestion and very small pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M w/ PMHx of HTN, DM, and ESRD on HD who was known to have second degree AV block on prior EKG noted on admission to have deteriorated to complete heart block.
Altered Mental Status: His course post PM placement was complicated by delirium, in the setting of hypoglycemia to 17.
In addition to the hypoglycemia, he may have been particularly sensitive to sedating medications, and there may be some metabolic component given his ESRD although his electrolytes were not markedly abnormal.
Complete heart block s/p Pacemaker: He had a [**Company **] DDD pacemaker placed set at 60-120.
Carotid stenosis /Infrarenal AAA/PVD: He was continued on asa, simvastatin, lisinopril.
Complete heart Block S/P pacemaker placement  Secondary End Stage Renal Disease Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented to person, place and time.
Mildly confused.
You were found to have complete heart block on EKG, a condition where the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart do not communicate electrically.
For this reason, you had to have a pacemaker placed.
