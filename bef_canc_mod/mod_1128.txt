Admission Date:  [**2107-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-6-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial drain placement and removal PEG placement PICC placement Intubation/extubation, mechanical ventilation Thoracentesis X2 (bilaterally)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70 yo man with ho DM2, HTN, and recent diagnoses of AFib who was transferred from OSH on [**2107-1-10**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion.
Around [**2106-12-17**], pt had CHF-like symptoms, and he was started on diuretics.
Four days prior to admission patient had  new onset Atrial flutter and was started on Coumadin.
On [**12-27**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] for a worsening dyspnea over  4 weeks.
Then pt had AMS, thought to be metabolic and had a CT-chest showing  a large pericardial effusion and bilateral upper lobe and RML air space disease.
He underwent a TEE with attempt to cardiovert, but he was found to have an atrial thrombus, so this was not attempted.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and possible pericardiocentesis since effusion appears to progress.
At OSH he also had ARF, hematuria, and anemia (hct 24).
On transfer his echo showed tamponade changes and he was transfered to the CCU for pericardial drainage.
Due to his garbled speech and dysphagia, neurology was consulted and felt he had a left parietal cardioembolic stroke (h/o A. fib).
He was also found to have a pneumonia, so is being treated with Zosyn.
On the floor he has had more agitation and has been given haldol 1mg and zyprexa 5mg.
He was transfered to MICU for airway concern and hypercabic resp failure.
He had some transient runs of bradycarida that quickly recovered to 90s without intervention.

PERICARDIAL FLUID:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Lymphocytes, monocytes, and mesothelial cells.
Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocensis showed elevation and equalization of diastolic filling pressures (20-22mmHg) that were similar to the opening pericardial pressure (19mmHg).

Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
A CT showed a pericardial effusion and RML PNA.
After extubation, he had AMS with a notable Wernicke's aphasia with preserved repetition and limited but largely intact comprehension and direction following.
In the interim, patient was found to have a pneumonia and was started on Zosyn.
He then became somnolent, hypercarbic and acidotic and was transferred to the MICU where he did not tolerate BiPap, so he was intubated.
Upon intubation, large amounts of tube feeds were found in his throat, so that his acute respiratory failure was felt due to his chronic large bilateral pleural effusions in conjunction with an aspiration event.
# Altered Mental Status/CVA/Thrombocytosis: The patient has had AMS, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium, since extubation at OSH.
EEG was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out (normal folate/B12).
An urgent head CT was ordered that did not demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process.
Carotid U/S demonstrated <40% stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient could not tolerate MRI without sedation.
Of note, patient was found to have a right atrial thrombus on OSH imaging and MRI/MRA once patient was intubated confirmed periventricular and supratentorial white matter abnormalities suggestive of cerebroembolic event; this was consistent with Neurology's findings on physical exam.
Patient also had markedly elevated platelets, which in the setting of pneumonia can result in a hypercoagulable state (Arch Neurol.
At the same time, he has thrombocytosis (Platelets between 760-960), possibly myelodysplastic in origin, which could also cause a thrombo/embolic CVA.
The workup of essential thrombocytosis was not pursued inpatient since it is very low yield (JAK2 mutations being positive in no more than 50% of ET cases) and the damage (stroke) had already been wrought.
# Respiratory Distress/Pleural effusions: Patient's initial hypercarbic, respiratory acidotic episode was felt likely due to the exacerbation of his pulmonary status with the large pleural effusions by aspiration of food contents.
Diagnostic thoracentesis showed exudative processes.
Patient was extubated on [**1-22**] after Lasix diuresis but developed hypercarbic, respiratory acidosis 10 hours later.
Etiology unclear - ?flash pulmonary edema as patient was hypertensive to SBP190s during this vs. tiring off the ventilator vs. continued significant pleural effusions.
All the fluid studies came back suggestive of exudative processes.
Rheumatology was consulted in the setting of significantly elevated ESR and CRP but did not feel the patient had an underlying rheumatologic processes.
Repeat CT chest & a CXR performed on the day of discharge did not show signs of infection, malignancy or reaccumulation of fluid.
Etiology for patient's large pleural effusions remains unclear but the patient may benefit from anti-histone serology or cardiac MRI for further work-up if his effusions recur.
Patient also noted to have multiple apneic episodes as long as 20 seconds at a time.
Pulmonology was consulted and felt that the patient's apnea was likely secondary to both a central and obstructive process.
Pericardial effusion:  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
Pericardial drain was placed, and bloody effusion was noted.
No microorganism was isolated.
Repeat ECHOs showed no reaccumulation of pericardial effusion and patient's physical exam remained benign.
The etiology of his pericardial effusion remained unclear, possibly due to a viral syndrome given his concurrent pleural effusions.
Repeat ECHO on [**1-28**], after removal of large pleural effusions (and pericardial effusion), showed global biventricular systolic function was less vigorous (now low normal), consistent with a diffuse process.
If patient's hypertension has not been long-standing, amyloidosis is on the differential and may explain both the pericardial and pleural effusions (per cardiology).
A CXR on [**2-1**] did not demonstrate evidence of pericardial or pleural effusions.
Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of multifocal PNA on a CT dated [**1-9**].
CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions consistent with overload, but no obvious consolidation.
Patient did not spike during this admission, but temperatures and WBC remained mildly elevated before normalizing.
Patient's EBV/CMV were also negative for acute infection.
Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was initially in atrial flutter, but later during this hospital stay, he was in and out of atrial fibrillation.
Patient had a number of bradycardic episodes initially while in the MICU that Cardiology felt was due to a vasovagal response to ETT placement.
Patient may benefit from discussions with EP as an outpatient regarding need for ablation for his AFib or pacer placement if he has recurrent episodes of bradycardia.
?s and electrolytes supported a hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Once the PEG tube was placed, the patient was continued on small volumes of free water flushes with good effect.
Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine increased at the OSH from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive diuresis.
Hematuria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH while on anticoagulation, and there was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking.
Anemia: Patient with an anemia on admission.
Fe studies showed 19% saturation, Fe 43, and Ferritin 1190, consistent with ongoing inflammation and possible mild Fe deficiency.
# Dysphagia:  Patient developed dysphagia, likely secondary to stroke.
