Admission Date:  [**2134-3-2**]       Discharge Date: [**2134-3-16**]   Service:  HISTORY:  This is an 84-year-old right handed man with mild dysplasia with thrombocytopenia formerly on steroids, hypertension, intermittent claudication of the right calf, idiopathic nephropathy now presents with two weeks of symptoms culminating to progressive weakness in the right lower extremity over the last three days.
The patient notes he was in his usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when he seemed to have some tingling sensation in the fingertips.
He was seen by his PCP and had an Magnetic resonance scan of the cervical spine which was reportedly unchanged from previous.
About a week prior to admission he had the onset of paroxysms of shooting pain across his chest from the front to the back encompassing around T4.
He recalls four days prior to admission he was weight lifting while working out and he had sudden musculoskeletal pain in his lower back however, he said the pain may have been different.
About three days prior to admission he had the insidious onset of right lower extremity weakness.
He also states he had some dysesthetic pain in the lower extremities and this has worsened.
Additionally he has not been ambulate for the last three days with the progressive weakness in his right leg.
He had no problems with [**Name2 (NI) 7809**] or bladder.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he is afebrile and vital signs are stable.
No apraxia or neglect.
His motor strength showed normal bulk and tone with no drift and no asterixis.
He had diffuse fasciculations with no tone.
There is no facial weakness.
He had no lower extremity reflexes.
Sensation was decreased in joint position sense in the ankles, decreased vibration in the same distribution, no obvious sensory level.
He did have decreased pinprick bilateral extremities.
He is areflexic with pain and weakness and however, the asymmetry could be consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
The unusual feature was diffuse fasciculations however.
We at this felt after the results of his lumbar puncture is most consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
He received plasmapheresis and seemed to do better, his pain was improving and his strength returned somewhat.
On [**2134-3-4**] he did have an episode of hypotension with lightheadedness on the day prior during his phoresis however, this responded well to normal saline bolus and he did well after holding his Lisinopril, we changed his Atenolol to Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day and watched the blood pressure closely.
His blood pressure normalized and he had no further problems with this.
On the 28th he was on Morphine 3 to 4 mg q four hours for pain and also increased his Gabapentin for his neuropathic pain.
On exam that day we noticed that he had left sided facial droop as well as left upper facial weakness.
This was consistent with a seventh nerve peripheral neuropathy on the left side.
We decided to watch him extremely closely and perform vital capacities to monitor his respiratory status.
He continued to do well over the weekend with no difficulty.
He had no short of breath and no other complaints.
Pain was responding to Morphine and his weakness was somewhat improving.
We decided to watch him closely however, he complained of blurriness in his left eye we were unsure if this was due to dryness from his peripheral 7th nerve difficulty and decreased blinking.
Visual acuity was approximately 20/400 on the left however, we decided to consult Ophthalmology and at first they felt that this could be consistent with a optic neuritis however, later this is not felt to be the case.
He had some difficulty with elevating his blood pressure and had an episode where his systolic went to the 60's and due to his hypotension and acute renal failure we decided to admit him to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit service for close follow-up.
We had arranged emergent plasmapheresis that night and used Dopamine for blood pressure support.
His hypotension was likely dysautonomia secondary to Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome was controlled on pressors.
In the literature there has been described acute renal failure due to severe Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome and this was the likely etiology for this.
We continued to watch him closely in the Intensive Care Unit, his renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Differential diagnosis included ATN from decreased blood pressure verses intrinsic renal disease or possibly from he Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
It did show evidence of generalized sensory, motor polyneuropathy with moderate severity, demyelinating in character although axonal features was present.
It was felt by the neurovascular team that this presentation was most likely consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] illness however, the asymmetry was atypical.
The basis for reaching the diagnosis at that point was the subacute history of progressive weakness including hypo/areflexia predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy, electrophysiology and an albuminocytologic dissociation of cerebrospinal fluid.
Labile blood pressure may have in fact reflected the involvement of autonomic fibers.
Etiology of the renal failure did remain unclear somewhat.
He had no problems with his respiratory status however, he still needed pressors to help with his pressure.
We continued phoresis during his Intensive Care Unit stay and he continued to do well.
He was able to be transferred to the floor on [**2134-3-12**] off Nipride times 24 hours with diminished pain.
We had some problems at first controlling his pain since he was requiring Dilaudid and we consulted the Pain Service.
They felt that if his pain did not improve otherwise we could try a Fentanyl patch.
they felt that his ongoing anemia may be in part due to recurrence of ITP verses medication induced as Lisinopril has been indicative of cause of thrombocytopenia however, the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] is not new.
They told us to check Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibiotics and this is pending at the time of discharge.
They also felt we should use Sulfonate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as we should avoid PPI as he has had a history of PPI related thrombocytopenia.
We continued all meds as previous and continued checking vital capacities and these were all normal.
His chest x-ray was done on [**3-13**] which showed mild cardiomegaly with interstitial edema.
The cerebrospinal fluid protein remained elevated at 117 and his glucose was 69.
There was no oligoclonal banding seen.
