The patient noticed increasing burping approximately 3 days prior to presentation.
The patient denies experiencing nausea and has had no episodes of emesis.
He reports one bowel movement since discharge which was described as decreased in volume without color or consistency changes.
He denies heartburn, difficulty or pain with swallowing, fevers, chills, or sweats.
There is mild right-upper quadrant pain which can be exacerbated by palpation.
Past Medical History: Zollinger-Ellsion Syndrome, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, coronary artery disease s/p angioplasty, atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.
Past Surgical History:  Excision of gastrinoma including antrectomy with Billroth-II repair, open cholecystectomy, duodenectomy, and regional lymphadenectomy of the portal lymphatics performed on [**2191-9-8**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.
Comfortable-appearing gentleman lying in a bed in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention noted.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without evidence of wheezing, rhonchi, or rales.
No evidence of murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
There are dry dressings over incision in the right periumbilical area.
Abdomen is soft with mild tenderness of the right upper quadrant.
Subcostal incision site is nontender with no evidence of erythema, edema, or warmth.
There is no evidence of distention.
Bilateral lower extremities are nontender, warm, well-perfused, and without evidence of pitting edema.
Mild gastric distension in addition to these findings suggests an element of impedance of emptying.
Unchanged appearance of bilateral renal hypodensities.
No active disease in the chest.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2191-9-28**]  8:06:32 AM Probable supraventricular tachycardia at rate 170 with right bundle-branch block and non-specific inferolateral repolarization change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-9-18**] normal sinus rhythm with borderline first degree A-V block has given way to supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia and the rate has increased from 63 to 170.
Right bundle-branch block persists.
Although there is no evidence of abnormal dilatation of the afferent or efferent limbs of the gastrojejunostomy, the majority of the oral contrast was still in the stomach at the time of the study.
There is some edema along the jejunostomy.
Slight increase in edema in the hepatic flexure.
Mild fat stranding in the mesentery and omentum is again noted, consistent with recent surgery.
Bilateral renal hypodensities are unchanged.
Radiology Report PUNC ASP ABS HEM BUL CYST Study Date of [**2191-9-30**] 8:27 AM IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided needle aspirations of right upper quadrant fluid collection with recovery of a total of 40 cc of pus.
Stomach:  Lumen: Evidence of a previous Billroth II was seen in the stomach body.
Minimal edema at the anastomotic site which is not stenotic.
Duodenotomy with excision of two lesions for gastrinoma.
A CT showed Slight thickening of the afferent/efferent limbs at the gastrojejunostomy junction.
Mild gastric distension in addition to these findings suggests an element of impedance of emptying.
On HD 6, he triggered for acute atrial tachycardia to 180's with hypotension.
He did have fevers to 101.6.
He was pan-cultured and ultimately blood cultures from [**9-28**] grew out ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Repeat CT scan demonstrated small intra-abdominal fluid collections.
He went for CT guided aspiration on [**9-30**] of right upper quadrant fluid collection with recovery of a total of 40 cc of pus.
The aspirate ultimately grew out pan-sensitive E.Coli.
He did have several more episodes of self limiting bursts of rapid atrial tachycardia and had occasional fevers.
He required IVF bolus for hypotension on several occasions.
GI: An EGD was performed on [**10-7**] and showed open and patent limbs with mild residual edema.
There were no ulcerations.
