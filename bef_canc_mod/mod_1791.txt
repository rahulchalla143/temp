Admission Date:  [**2131-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-7-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levofloxacin / Cefazolin / Coreg / Dopamine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**] Chief Complaint: foot infection, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L toe ulcer debridement thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] is a 66 y/o male patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with diabetes c/b peripheral neuropathy, ulcers, and amputation, a history of a pro-coaguable disorder requiring chronic prophylaxis with enoxaparin and a neuropathic heel ulcer presents with a week of fever, malaise, nausea/vomiting, and change in mental status.
The following day he went to [**Hospital3 **] but again had nausea and emesis.
Two nights PTA the patient began to have worsening of his great toe ulcer with redness and drainage.
In addition he developed a low grade temperature and increase malaise.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient was slightly lethargic but alert & oriented x 3.
An arterial line was placed, and the patient was noted to have monomorphic ventricular tachycardia on an EKG, during which the patient dropped his blood pressures.
They isolated three pockets of pus and cultures were sent.
Past Medical History: DMII CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20% Afib s/p ablation, pacemaker SMA thrombosis with small bowel and large bowel infarcts status   post small bowel and large bowel resection and resulting short    gut syndrome Bacterial peritonitis PVD s/p R BKA Hypercoagulable state, DVTs Peripheral neuropathy Plantar fasciitis CVA PV Nonhealing anal fissure   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 21212**] is a retired systems programmer for a management consulting firm.
He is married with no children.
Prior 3 yrs of tobb abuse.
CV: RRR Chest: CTA bilaterally on anterior exam other than slight crackles at right lower base.
There is now a small soft tissue defect at the tibial (medial) aspect of the plantar soft tissues, overlying the base of the 1st distal phalanx.
However, this does not appear to reach bone on either view, with no subjacent subcutaneous emphysema or retained radiopaque foreign body.
There is no evidence of periosteal reaction, cortical erosion or medullary lucency in subjacent bone to specifically suggest osteomyelitis, and the appearance of the remainder of the foot is unchanged, including vascular calcification and prominent dorsal calcaneal enthesophyte.
IMPRESSION: Known ulcer in the plantar soft tissues of the 1st digit does not reach bone, with no radiographic sign of osteomyelitis.
Moderate cardiomegaly, reaccumulation of an asymmetric large right pleural effusion, and associated right perihilar hazy opacity are suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema, and represent decompensated mitral valve regurgitation.
No discrete focal airspace consolidation is identified.
The bony thorax again demonstrates an S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Asymmetric right-sided largely parahilar airspace disease and re- accumulated large pleural effusion, as on previous episodes.
This may represent "atypcial" edema related to decompensation of known mitral regurgitation; alternatively, a pneumonic process cannot be completely excluded.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-24**] 3:36 AM Allowing the difference in position of the patient, large right pleural effusion.
There has been interval increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
Mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, greater on the right side, is stable.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-25**] 3:36 AM In the interim, there is severe worsening of a right extensive pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and airspace disease in the collapsed right lung.
There is also worsening of perihilar airspace disease in the left lung.
Small left pleural effusion is also new.
The heart size is mild-to-moderately enlarged, but stable.
Severe worsening of right pleural effusion with almost collapse of the right lung.
Bilateral airspace disease in both lungs, worsening on the left lung, likely edema.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o male with diabetes, cardiomyopathy, foot ulcer presenting with toe infection, septic physiology, and ventricular tachycardia.
Hospital course by problem:  # Sepsis/Toe Wound: Patient's exam was consistent with infected L 1st toe ulcer and leg cellulitis and he was hypotensive.
Zosyn was changed to unasyn, but the patient clinically worsened and with concern for an undetected element of the likely polymicrobial sepsis which started his course, unasyn was discontinued and zosyn restarted.
Of note, no pseudomonas grew out at any time in his wound or blood cultures.
Eventually, zosyn was discontinued and unasyn was restarted, with no ill effects.
There was some concern, particularly from the infectious disease service (which had been consulted, and which had followed the patient in the past for recurrent C. diff) that he would not be able to endure a six-week course of antibiotics because of his short gut, past history of recurrent C. diff, and that an operation might be superior.
Given his high risk of recurrent C. diff and his short gut, and the potentially dire consequences for this patient of not being able to tolerate a long course of antibiotics, and in consultation with the infectious disease service, we took the unusual step of treating C. diff empirically despite negative toxins.
The total course of antibiotics will be six weeks, with day 1 of effective antibiosis = [**5-29**].
In detail, starting dates were: Zosyn and vanco: [**5-23**] (on admission) Zosyn replaced with unasyn: [**5-26**] Flagyl: [**5-26**] (pt has had recurrent C diff as above) Unasyn stopped and replaced again with Zosyn: [**5-27**] Vancomycin stopped [**6-3**] Zosyn stopped and replaced with Unasyn: [**6-3**] Ending dates for Unasyn and Flagyl: [**7-10**] and [**7-17**] respectively, as above.
# Chronic systolic heart failure and cardiomyopathy: In the MICU, the patient had an increased O2 requirement, 93% on 6L NC O2, with large R sided pleural effusion.
He had an US-guided thoracentesis on [**5-25**] (therapeutic and diagnostic) which revealed a transudative sterile fluid which carried signs of neither infection nor malignancy.
He has a lasix requirement at home and ultimately as sepsis and hypotension resolved, he was started back on lasix, first prn, and then 40 [**Hospital1 **] (his home dose); on [**6-9**] this was changed to 60 [**Hospital1 **].
He had several incidents in which he more acutely desaturated, each of which was solved by extra doses of lasix.
He did continue to have an oxygen requirement, associated with what appeared to be his fluid status, but was stable.
In light of his continuing renal insufficiency these were not restarted though the lisinopril in particular should be given consideration for restarting at the earliest opportunity.
Earlier in admission transudative effusion c/w heart failure when tapped, with large drainage.
Pain control was adquate with Oxycontin, Oxycodone, and Dilauidid for breakthrough pain.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Early in the admission, the patient had one episode of asymptomatic VT that developed in the setting of dopamine and low Mg, and in the setting of the immediate post-sepsis period.
This resolved with no further episodes while on the floor, until [**6-11**], when he had a series of runs of NSVT in the morning.
He does not have an ICD in place but given that he is being treated for infection, EP felt it would be better to keep him on telemetry but defer ICD placement if indicated.
# Renal Failure: Acute on Chronic.
Acute from CHF hypoperfusion and contrast interaction and chronic from diabetes.
Early in the admission, Mr [**Known lastname 21212**] had elevated creatinine as far up as 1.9 on [**5-24**] in the context of his early sepsis and MICU stay, which had trended down.
Although it likely had the effect of raising the Cr, we continued to give lasix, feeling that it was likely best to support renal perfusion, and because it was necessary for respiratory function.
The patient has not had any signs of ototoxicity.
Following this change, LUE edema decreased significantly.
# Hypercoagulability: The patient has had disastrous sequelae of clotting in the past including ischemic bowel and resulting short gut, and stroke; thus anticoagulation was scrupulously maintained.
The patient was kept on a heparin sliding scale for much of the admission in order to preserve operative options while also continuing anticoagulation which is provided by lovenox as an outpatient.
# Depression: citalopram was continued.
He likely also has some element of depression and perhaps small cognitive losses from past stroke.
# Leukocytosis- most likely secondary to a myeloproliferative disorder, previously characterized as polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
