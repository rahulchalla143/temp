HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female with severe bilateral lower extremity inflow and outflow disease who was scheduled for an aorto-bifemoral bypass on [**3-25**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with prior three-week history of left foot pain with ambulation.
Prior to that, she ambulated independently without claudication symptoms.
There was a painful cut on the left lateral foot which progressed to weeping and pain over the last three days.
The patient also has a history of carotid disease and stated that she was to have carotid endarterectomy prior to her aorto-bifemoral.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of Hodgkin's lymphoma 13 years ago.
History of asthma; she has not been intubated, no history of hospitalizations, or steroid use for her asthma.
Status post cerebrovascular accident without residual.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
General:  This was a pleasant but difficult to understand white female in no acute distress.
She had a left carotid bruit.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation but diminished throughout.
There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Abdomen:  Nontender and nondistended.
There was a well-healed median abdominal incision.
No abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The left foot with diffuse streaky erythema and edema.
There were small fissures along the lateral aspect of the left foot near the heel.
There was no drainage or active bleeding.
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC with a white count of 19.2, hematocrit 40.9, differential with polys of 74, lymphs 17, no bands; electrolytes with a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.0, potassium 4.9, glucose 129.
Chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary disease.
There was a small mediastinal irregular opacity without change from prior chest x-ray.
Other studies included an arteriogram which showed extensive infrarenal aortic disease, left common iliac occluded, left internal iliac reconstructed by right collaterals from the external iliac, left common femoral profunda with multifocal SFA disease proximally, distal SFA and popliteal were patent, there was disease of the tibial, proximal posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, the left AT is in major runoff vessel but diseased proximally and mid portions.
There was two-vessel runoff via the posterior tibial and the dorsalis pedis on the right.
A MIBI stress test on [**3-17**] showed no wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction was calculated at 54%.
The ultrasound of the carotid showed left internal carotid artery stenosis of 85-90%, right internal carotid stenosis of 60-70% at the origins, right internal carotid artery subvalvular stenosis of 85% 2 cm above the bifurcation.
The ultrasound of the carotids showed a 70-79% bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis with nonvisualized left vertebral artery.
Vancomycin 1 g IV q.12 hours was begun with peak and trough levels with third dose.
There was no hematoma.
Her exam showed bilateral lung wheezing with generalized edema.
and required decreased dosing strength secondary to bronchospasm.
Her chest x-ray showed mildly improved interstitial edema.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 33.2, although her white count remained elevated at 24.
Sputum culture from [**3-28**] showed greater than 25 polys, with 40 epithelials, but 1+ ................. consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Urinalysis C&S was no growth.
The blood cultures were no growth.
The abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver with moderate distended gallbladder with no stones, no wall thickening, no dilated ducts.
Chest x-ray showed resolved congestive failure with a left lower lobe atelectasis.
The foot film showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
She was begun on Ceftriaxone for her left lower lobe infiltrate, and she was continued on Oxacillin.
She did have some end expiratory wheezing, but otherwise the lungs were unremarkable.
Groin was without hematomas bilaterally, and she had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right and Dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the left.
The right groin was mildly erythematous.
There was no hematoma.
The left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial remained Dopplerable.
Bilateral carotid disease status post left carotid endarterectomy.
Left foot ischemic ulcerations with cellulitis, status post axillo-bifemoral bypass.
Asthma with exacerbation, treated.
