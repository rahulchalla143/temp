History of Present Illness: 67F with h/o obstructing sigmoid mass of indeterminant pathology s/p chemo/rads and resection of mass with transverse colostomy ([**9-20**]).
She has developed a ventral hernia at the site of her old diverting colostomy.

INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a recent CT scan in [**Location (un) 620**] showing a chronically obstructed left kidney.
There is a possible calculus along the route of the left distal ureter, however, this is beyond the level of obstruction.
A #8 French tapered catheter was gently inserted into the left distal ureteral orifice and 5 cc of contrast dye was injected which revealed a distal ureter with complete retrograde obstruction.
Beyond the level of obstruction, was a very faint calcification, roughly 5- 8 mm in diameter, possibly consistent with the calcification seen on CT scan.
At this point the decision was made to abort the stent placement rather than continued attempts at the wire placement or ureteroscopy without wire access which can result in ureteral rupture.
PLAN:  The patient will likely require a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube and possible antegrade wire access which may allow retrograde access to the stricture and possibly the stone.
INDICATIONS:  This patient had either diverticulitis or an obstructing carcinoma of the rectum which we could never get close enough to do a valid biopsy.
We never found any carcinoma in the specimen and she did have evidence of diverticular disease.
She underwent resection and then a protective colostomy because of the fact that the anastomosis never seemed to heal and indeed the most recent barium enema revealed that she did not have adequate healing and as a matter of fact had several leaks, probably disruptive of the anastomosis either because of tension, which I had doubted, or because of the previous radiation.
We opened up the left paramedian incision and were able to free-up of lysis of adhesions in the pelvis which were extensive and which required extensive revision starting with the ligament Treitz taking down the previous feeding jejunostomy, but in fact we were able to get the entire pelvis freed up without any difficulty.
There was only one area where there was ballooning out of the serosa which was later repaired with interrupted 5-0 Prolene and we were then able to go to work on the previous rectosigmoid which required rectosigmoid resection in order to get an adequate connection with the anastomosis on the bottom.
There was a stricture at the previous anastomosis.
There was an abscess which was then drained and irrigated with gentamicin.
Finally after mobilizing the splenic flexure, a 2-layer silk anastomosis was carried out with some difficulty but finally a good anastomosis was obtained and reinforced with the appendices epiploica.
A closure of the hernia was done internally first with approximating the fascia from within with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures and then closing the peritoneum under it with a #1 Vicryl suture.
The wound was closed in layers.
We decided not to do a feeding jejunostomy because there was no anastomosis between the mouth and the transverse colostomy.
The wound was closed in layers with #1 chromic catgut on the peritoneum.
The following day she underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, and repair of ventral hernia.
She was tachycardic and had periods of O2 desaturation.
Chest xray showed bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
She remained tachycardic despite beta blockade.
WBC remained elevated at 19.9.
AT POD 6 she was made NPO due to nausea and +gastric distention per KUB.
Cardiology was consulted for persistent tachycardia.
CT cystogram and CT urogram were completed which showed large left retroperitoneal uroma which appeared to leak from distal left ureter.
CT scan of abdomen/pelvis/chest showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis; abdominal and pelvic ascites and focal fluid collections in the left abdominal and pelvic retroperitoneal regions; and active extravasation of contrast suspicious for ureteral injury.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There was no evidence of communication of the fluid collections and the bowel.
CXR showed bibasilar pleural effusions and linear opacities.
WBC count was 14.7 At POD 15 a repeat CT scan was completed showing continued abdominal fluid collection.
At POD 16 she was afebrile and doing well.
She continued to have a moderate amount of biliious drainage from the pigtail drain.
Urine cytology was sent which was negative for malignant cells.
The scan showed no new fluid collection with marked resolution of drained collection.
At POD 36 she was afebrile and doing well.
She had no problems with voiding independently.
The pigtail catheter drainage was decreased to ~50ml per day with increased ostomy output.
She remained NPO with TPN for nutritional support.
A repeat CT scan showed no residual fluid in the area of the pigtail catheter.
The pigtail continued with low output.
She was afebrile and ambulatory.
WBC was  12.6, but repeat CT scan showed no new fluid collection and no interval change in the drain site.
Monitor for signs of infection or misplacement.
