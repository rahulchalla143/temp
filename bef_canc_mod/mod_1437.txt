Admission Date:  [**2195-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-1-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Azithromycin / Metformin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL placement Midline access placement Intubation Thrombolysis of submassive PE EGD and Colonoscopy IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: 56 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] male with Crohn's disease, diverticulosis s/p hemicolectomy times 2, type 2 diabetes, and obesity who initially presented to OSH for shortness of breath of one week duration and found to have bilateraly submassive PEs and intubated for respiratory failure.
After the heparin gtt was initiated, pt developed maroon stools mixed with BRBPR, thought likely secondary to underlying crohn's disease.
GI was consulted and pt underwent upper endoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.
In the ICU, patient underwent colonoscopy, showing diffuse crohn's disease consistent with a flare but no intervention was warranted.
IVC filter was placed on [**2195-8-4**], should the patient require emergent cessation of anticoagulation secondary to large GI bleed.
Denies lightheadedness, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, acute change in abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: Type 2 Diabetes Obestiy Crohn's disease, with history of GI bleed Hypertension Diverticulitis s/p Partial Colectomy x 2 s/p Multiple Herniorraphy's Arthritis   Social History: Patient is not married but lives with significant other (female) and lives in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**].
Family History: No family history of blood clots, malignancy, or sudden cardiac death.
No family history of Crohn's disease.
Pulm: CTA B with no w/r/r.
Abd: obese, midline scar and lateral scars on left and right with herniations visible.
Right femoral site has dressing from IVC placement - c/d/i.
Ext: ecchymosis noted on the arms bilaterally, no pedal edema, no calf tenderness, no palpable cord.
Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
TTE ([**2195-7-29**]): IMPRESSION: RV strain c/w acute pulmonary embolism.
Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the bilateral main pulmonary arteries with extension through to the lobar, segmental, lower lobe subsegmental branches bilaterally, as above.
Associated findings of right heart strain.
No evidence of acute aortic injury.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis/aspiration.
Small left-sided ventral abdominal hernia containing non-obstructed loop of small bowel.
Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific T wave changes.
ST segment depression is less pronounced and the ventricular rate is slower.
Sinus rhythm.
The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
There is no change in the cardiomediastinal contour with the mediastinal widening being due to extensive mediastinal lipomatosis.
Bibasilar atelectasis have developed in the interim, new, but note is made that the lung bases cannot be entirely evaluated since they were not entirely included in the field of view.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Non- visualization of right posterior tibial veins, can not exclude thrombosis within these veins.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity.
Possible left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-8-5**] there is no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with DMII, HTN, crohn's disease on steroids, diverticulosis s/p colectomy X 2, who was admitted to the MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE.
# Pulmonary Embolism.
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have submassive clot burden on CTA with significant hypoxia (PAO2 only 130 in spite of 100% oxygen).
He required intubation for respiratory failure and also had evidence of right heart strain from bedside echo.
Shortly after the initiation of heparin, pt developed maroon stools with BRBPR and required transfusion of 4 u PRBC.
GI was consulted and pt underwent upper endoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.
Patient was called out to the floor on [**2195-8-2**], but given persistence of maroon stools with BRBPR, patient returned to the MICU the following morning for bowel prep for anticipated colonoscopy with close monitoring of vitals and hematocrit.
He underwent colonoscopy and was found to have evidence of active Crohns disease, though no active bleeding was identified.
Vital signs remained stable without any requirement for supplemental oxygen.
Patient never developed hypoxia and never complained of shortness of breath on the floor.
Patient's INR slowly elevated over the course of this admission, reaching therapeutic INR (2.2) on [**2195-8-14**].
[**Last Name (STitle) **], for further guidance.
However, if his underlying crohn's disease is the etiology of his increased susceptibility to hypercoagulability, patient may require life-long anticoagulation with coordinated care between his PCP and gastroenterologist.
In regards to patient's IVC filter, it was not removed during this admission due to persistent clot burden and the necessity to continue heparin gtt.
# acute blood blood loss anemia:  Likely secondary to underlying crohn's disease with flare in the setting of anticoagulation.
Patient developed maroon stools with BRBPR in response to initiation of heparin gtt, with concurrent drop in hematocrit from 40 on admission to 26 on [**2195-8-2**].
EGD showed no acute bleeding but colonoscopy showed diffuse crohn's disease.
Active type and screen was maintained.
All other vital signs remained stable and patient did not experience any signs of hypotension or anemia.
Diagnosed in [**5-2**] but patient reported chronic symptoms for many years.
As above, following administration of tpa lysis and heparin gtt for PE, patient developed BRBPR and maroon stools.
In the MICU, an EGD showed no upper GI bleeding and a colonoscopy showed an active crohn's flare with no intervenable bleeding areas.
# Type 2 Diabetes:  With the administration of increased steroids, it was suspected that blood sugars would run higher.
During this admission, patient was continued on HISS with long acting glargine.
# HTN.
Patient's outpatient medication for hypertension included lisinopril.
After several days of continued stabilized of the hematocrits and vital signs, lisinopril was restarted.
# Acute Renal failure.
Likely secondary to decreased volume status in the setting of lower GI bleeding.
# Disposition:  There were several obstacles to the discharge of this patient.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Submassive Pulmonary Embolus Acute Blood loss anemia from lower GI bleed Crohns Disease Type 2 Diabetes Hypertension Arthritis   Discharge Condition: Stable, hematocrit 30-33, stools brown and formed.
Discharge Instructions: You initially went to an outside hospital with difficulty breathing.
After getting transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], we found that you had a large blood clot in your lung.
We treated your with medication to dissolve your clot and this caused you to have lower GI bleeding.
We then put a filter in your IVC, put you on blood thinners, and your bleeding has improved.
If you have any abdominal pain, fevers, chills, increase in your bloody bowel movements, please contact your primary care physician or visit the emergency room.
Your primary care physician will order you a repeat ultrasound at 3 months after discharge to see if you still have a blood clot in your leg.
