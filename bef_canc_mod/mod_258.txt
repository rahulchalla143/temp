At that time, it was felt his symptoms were multifactorial with contributions from his COPD and left sided pleural effusion.
He also became hypotensive after receiving sedation for intubation and was transiently on pressor support.
This was again thought to be multifactorial, secondary to multifocal pneumonia, persistent pleural effusion, COPD and poor pulmonary reserve s/p lobectomy.
He was treated with a 7 day course of meropenem ([**Date range (1) 19644**]) for a multifocal pneumonia.
He underwent repeat thoracentesis to r/o empyema/help improve respiratory status, which revealed a chylous effusion thought to be due to disruption of thoracic duct during his lobectomy in [**2158-9-27**].
The chylous effusion was followed by the pulmonary team, who recommended the patient be kept NPO and be treated with 2weeks of TPN.
Repeat CT showed persistant output.
In the SICU, the patient developed a respiratory acidosis and was intubated and extubated on [**2159-5-22**].
SICU course was also notable for complicated left subclavian central venous access attempt with cannulation of the subclavian artery resulting in signficant bleeding and requiring vascular consultation.
Follow-up ultrasound did not show aneurysm/fistula formation.
On admission the patient was also noted to have a left scapular wound infection, persistent since his lobectomy in [**Month (only) **], [**2158**].

HISTORY: 73-year-old man status post right pneumonectomy with respiratory distress.
The main and left pulmonary arteries are patent without evidence of filling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolism.
There has been interval increase in the left-sided pleural effusion.
There has also been development of a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms.
There are additional patchy ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
2) Left lower lobe consolidation and patchy left upper lobe opacities which are worrisome for pneumonia.
3) Interval increase in moderate-sized left pleural effusion.
RCA TO with L->R collaterals.
No significant shunt.
Moderate pulm artery systolic HTN.
CHEST CT ([**2159-4-30**]) - No PE.
LLL consolidation and LUL patchy opacity.
Interval increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
The left sided chest tubes remain in unchanged position and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
No new parenchymal infiltrates are present.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of NSCLC s/p right pneumonectomy, chemo/XRT and COPD, presenting with dyspnea, transferred from thoracic surgical service after VATS/mechanical pleurodesis for chylous pleural effusion.
During his hospitalization, the following problems were addressed: # PNA:  The patient was diagnosed with a pneumonia in the MICU and treated with a seven day course of meropenem.
On transfer to the floor,  he was afebrile with no leukocytosis.
In MICU, he was thought to have multifocal pna based on imaging although sputum culture was negative.
# Chylous pleural effusion:  The patient presented with significant right pleural effusion.
Thoracentesis demonstrated a chylous effusion.
They placed a chest tube and recommended TPN with octretide to help decrease tryglyceride intake and chylous output.
He was briefly intubated in SICU for respiratory acidosis and was extubated on [**2159-5-22**].
The chest tube was pulled [**2159-5-23**] with post xray showing possible small apical left pneumothorax.
He has poor pulmonary reserve given his pneumonectomy.
# CHF: The patient has an EF 60%, but likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction.
Given his elevated bicarb, he was started on diomax in addition to the lasix.
# CAD:  Patient has a history of CAD, no active issues during this hospitalization.
Beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor held due to blood pressure.
# Back wound from previous pneumenctomy:  The wound was growing MSSA and patient was started in oxacillin (started on [**2159-5-5**]).
# Right upper extremity DVT:  Given the the patient's tenuous status and history of coffee-ground emesis, and low risk of PE and stroke with upper extremity clot no anticoagulation was initiated.
# Anemia:  Anemia was originally thought to be due to chronic disease, but when transferred to the floor, patient had stool that was guiac positive.
He will be referred to GI for colonoscopy and further work-up once his acute pulmonary issues resolve.
# foot drop: patient has a left-sided foot drop, thought to be due nerve injury.
A video swallow study is being done to evaluate for aspiration risk.
Heparin Sodium (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: Five (5) thousand units Injection Q8H (every 8 hours): for DVT prophylaxis.
