Soft, NT, ND, no suprapubic tenderness.
Limited venography by hand ejection showing significant narrowing of the left axillary and distal veins, with evidence of collateral circulation.
[**2193-2-15**] TTE ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2193-2-18**] TEE ECHO: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 62 y/o female with h/o chronic pain with long-term Hickman now p/w UTI, fungemia, and altered mental status.
Likely due to underlying infection ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans fungemia) as she has had mental status changes in the past with infections that have resolved once her infection is treated with concern for brain lesions.
Most metabolic derangements, including uremia and ARF, have resolved.
No evidence of seizure.
Head CT negative x2 for acute processes or masses.
LP was unsuccessful and unlikely to be successful given her significant scarring.
- surgery D/C'd line [**2-12**], tip culture NGTD - ophtho exam [**2-12**] showed no eye involvement - Chest CT showed multiple nodular paranchymal lesions with tiny cavitations concerning for fungal infection, inflammatory process, or metastatic thyroid CA - Pt will require repeat chest CT in 2 months time - TTE/TEE to eval for vegetation were negative .
#) UTI - Bacterial: Neurogenic bladder with intermittent catheterizations.
U/A on admission was notable for many bacteria, elevated WBCs and small esterase positivity.
- changed foley on admission to ICU - Received Cefepime x 3 d given her history of UTIs with E coli and Pseudomonas that have been resistant to Bactrim and fluoroquinolones.
- Cefepime D/C'd [**2-13**] - Patient initially also given vancomycin, which was discontinued due to no bacterial infection found .
DDx folliculitis v. metastatic nodule v. skin seeding of fungemia.
- Derm performed punch biopsy [**2-12**] - pathology:     -Epidermal acanthosis with spongiosis and dyskeratosis (see comment).
-No evidence of fungal organisms on PAS-D stain.
-No evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
#) Thyroid Carcinoma: Metastatic papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy [**2165**] + XRT.
Found to have elevated thyrotropin stimulated thyroglobulin and treated with radioactive iodine in [**2189-12-27**].
New lung lesions and rising TSH (was on suppression therapy).
History of poor absorption.
Was likely due to infection, AMS and decreased PO intake.
#) Hypertension - Benign: - BPs labile, likely due to pain, and narcotics - metoprolol, and clonidine.
She has been running in the 150 range when in mild pain - No other change in anti-hypertensives at this time [**12-28**] new pain med regimen .
#) Anemia of chronic disease: -  known h/o guaiac positive stools that have been evaluated by endoscopy without bleeding source identified (non-bleeding grade II internal hemorrhoids seen).
Also with component of anemia of chronic disease.
#) H/O DVT/PE: - On warfarin at home for h/o hypercoaguability and h/o DVT and PE.
- warfarin at home dose, follow INR  #) BACK PAIN - CHRONIC - We started fentanyl patch for our basal rate at 50mcg, then using morphine PCA have determined: 1. currently she requires the patch alone while sleeping (reports no pain, and used no PCA doses overnight).
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Olanzapine 10 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
