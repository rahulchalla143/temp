Admission Date:  [**2154-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-5-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-7-12**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for longstanding diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency as well as hypertension (which has been difficult to control).
She awoke on the morning of admission with shortness of breath.
She denied any headache that morning; although, she notes that she did have some blurring of her vision.
She denied any chest pain or abdominal pain at home.
She denied any antecedent upper respiratory tract infection type symptoms.
She did not have any complaints at this time except for shortness of breath.
Her physical examination was notable for bibasilar crackles with diffuse wheezing.
There was 1+ peripheral pitting edema.
She also reported some left upper quadrant abdominal pain.
Electrocardiogram done on admission prior to the development of the left upper quadrant pain was unchanged from a previous baseline electrocardiogram.
After receiving her Lopressor, with a decrease in the heart rate, the electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in V4 through V6 and leads II, III, and F.  On arrival to the floor, the patient's blood pressure was 230, and she was complaining of left upper quadrant pain.
At that time, the electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, with normal axis, T wave inversions in leads II, F, V4 through V6 with biphasic T waves in lead V3.
Diabetes mellitus times 20 years.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 3.
Sarcoid times 30 years (by report, she has only had ocular complications until now).
ALLERGIES:  LIPITOR and COLCHICINE (both have caused muscle problems in the past).
Head and neck examination was notable for jugular venous distention to 8 cm.
No frank hemorrhages were seen.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was a displaced/diffuse point of maximal impulse.
There were bibasilar crackles halfway up the posterior lung fields.
No clubbing or cyanosis was demonstrated on peripheral examination.
A urinalysis showed no evidence of a urinary tract infection.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with cephalization consistent with mild heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital for management of her acute congestive heart failure exacerbation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Given her hypertensive emergency, the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.
She was started on intravenous nitroprusside for acute blood pressure control.
Given her nonspecific T wave inversions on electrocardiogram, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
This demonstrated an ejection fraction of 60%, mild left atrial dilatation, mild right atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and no significant valvular disease.
While on the floor, her blood pressure continued to be difficult to control with occasional bursts in systolic blood pressures of up to 250.
RENAL: She has a history of baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of approximately 3.
It was thought that the elevation in creatinine and acute renal failure with transient oliguria was due to a combination of the angiotensin receptor blocker (Diovan) and transient hypoperfusion.
During the course of her hospital stay, she was worked up for a possible renal artery stenosis given her presentation of extremely elevated blood pressure and a history of difficult to control blood pressure on multiple antihypertensive medications.
A magnetic resonance angiography was performed and demonstrated a moderate stenosis in the proximal left renal artery of approximately 50% to 70% of the diameter.
There was minimal post stenotic dilatation of the renal artery.
It was their thought that the left renal artery stenosis was not hemodynamically significant and was an unlikely etiology of the patient's presentation.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient complained of intermittent left upper quadrant pain during the course of her hospital stay.
She also had several episodes of vomiting and was intermittently nauseated.
She had no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology on an abdominal ultrasound on the day of admission or on the magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen two days after admission.
A portable abdominal x-ray was performed during the course of her hospital stay which demonstrated a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern and a prominent amount of stool throughout the right hemicolon.
She was also started on Reglan for the possibility that some of this symptomatology was related to diabetic gastroparesis.
Hypertensive emergency leading to congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Acute renal failure, secondary to hypoperfusion versus angiotensin receptor blocker.
Diabetes mellitus.
