Admission Date:  [**2129-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-11-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim DS  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**] Chief Complaint: pain crisis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right internal jugular central venous catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 46 yo F with sickle cell anemia, multiple admission for pain crises who presented with an acute onset bilateral knee, shoulder, hip, and chest pain, consistent with prior pain crises.
The patient experienced the acute onset of knee pain the morning of her admission, while brushing her teeth, about 20 minutes after getting up.
This was followed by chest, shouler, and hip pain bilaterally.
There was concern that she was developing acute chest and she was admitted to the MICU.
She complained of significant pain when she arrived the the ICU.
Past Medical History: 1) Sickle Cell Disease- Hgb SS: diagnosed at age 3 with complications including avascular necrosis of R hip, acute chest syndrome, and pulmonary infarction.
Liver biopsy [**3-24**], stage III fibrosis.
In [**2120**], was on peg interferon & ribavarin, but d/c'd due to neutropenia.
Anicteric sclerae.
No rebound or guarding.
EOMI, with no nystagmus.

EOMI, with no nystagmus.
Micro Labs Urine Culture [**3-10**]: 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
Since the recen radiograph one day prior, there has been development of new bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, likely pulmonary edema, however infection and infarction cannot be excluded.
Development of marked cardiomegaly and findings consistent with heart failure.
Multiple loops of distended large bowel incompletely imaged on this radiograph.
There are low inspiratory volumes.
There are diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs, increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and equivocal small effusions.
Again seen is diffuse increased density of the bones, likely related to the patient's sickle cell.
Increased density at the right humeral head could be due to osteonecrosis.Compared with [**2129-3-11**] at 2:04 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, no definite interval change.
Again there are areas of sclerosis involving the distal femur, proximal and much of the shaft of the tibia, and the talar dome.
Findings areall consistent with bone infarcts consistent with the patient's known diagnosis of sickle cell anemia.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

She developed hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, requiring MICU transfer for exchange transfusion.
#Sickle cell disease/Acute Chest Syndrome: The patient presented with severe pain.
EKG was normal, and MI was ruled out with serial cardiac enzymes.
The patient was treated with oxygen, IV fluids, and IV Dilaudid for presumed vaso-occlusive pain crisis.
The day after admission, she developed fever to 101.8 and a progressive oxygen requirement, with CXR showed bilateral infiltrates and a massively dilated heart.
She was started on CTX/azithro for coverage of community-acquired pneumonia.
In the MICU, given the patient's high-grade hemolysis and acute chest syndrome she underwent exchange transfusion on [**2129-3-10**] with a total of 6 units of PRBC's infused, with a goal of getting her hemoglobin S concentration under 30%.
The patient had a lot of difficulty with pain-control, requiring an IV Dilaudid PCA and bolus doses of IV dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
# Fever: She spiked fever to 101 shortly after leaving ICU and had another low grade temp however fever curve improved.
She noted that she typically has low grade temps during her crises.
She did have a bowel movement prior to discharge and never had notable pain, distension, or nausea.
# Proteinuria: Patient with a history of proteinuria and was started on lisinopril 2.5mg as an outpatient.
# Left Lower Extremity Growth: This was noted during her previous hospitatlization which was closely monitored.
X-ray did show findings consistent with bone infarction.
# Hepatitis C- Genotype 1B.
