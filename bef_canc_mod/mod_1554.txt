She states that she is still passing gas and localizes her abdominal pains to her mid and lower left quadrant.
In ED, she had initial hypotension to a low of 70/34, HR into 120-140s with notable atrial fibrillation, and she was resuscitated with 4L IVFs per ED records.
She is followed regularly by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] for her longstanding history of Crohn's disease.
Prior surgical history includes several fistula reconstructions, bowel resections, and temporary ostomies in the past.
She has known severe proctosigmoiditis which was corroborated on prior CT this past winter [**2175**].
On arrival to the ICU she was in no apparent distress but had several bowel movements immediately on arrival, was afebrile with BP 132/76, HR 125s with atrial fibrillation noted on telemetry.
Prednisone caused enterocutaneous fistulas.

Per patient, her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5874**] ([**Hospital **] Medical Center), has opted to defer cardioversion and coumadin therapy until a later date after she has surgery for her hernia and Crohn's disease.

There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
The trachea is deviated towards the left, at the thoracic inlet due to enlarged thyroid.
[**8-12**] PLAIN ABD:  There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
Surgical clips at the left lower abdominal quadrant.
No definite evidence of free air under the hemidiaphragms.

Diffuse thickening of the descending colon, sigmoid and rectum, with increased thickening in the descending and proximal sigmoid region and possible developing fistula between the sigmoid colon and small bowel.
Above this area the visualized mucosa just had scattered erythema and was relatively normal.
Biopsies were sent for histology and cmv.The biopsy for CMV was done at about 35cm where there were ulcerations.
Continue current therapy Additional notes: It was discussed with the patient that abnormalities including polyps and colorectal cancer can rarely be missed.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with refractory Crohn's disease, admitted with hypotension and Crohn's flare.
#Crohn's Flare: The patient presented with abdominal pain and >15 loose, bloody bowel movements daily.
Her CT abdomen was unrevealing but a flex sig was consistent with active Crohns, with unremarkable stool studies.
She was initially placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with cipro + vanco + zosyn; this was narrowed to cipro/flagyl once her initial hypotension resolved and there was no longer a concern concern for sepsis passed.
Pain was adequately controlled using dilaudid.
#Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a one year history of atrial fibrillation and presented with AF with RVR, with a ventricular rate in the 150s.
At baseline, she is not a candidate for cardioversion/anticoagulation given her active Crohns, and she takes diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control at home.
#Hypotension  The patient presented with hypotension on [**8-12**] in the setting of AF with RVR and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
Her hypotension was responsive to fluid resuscitation and was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to massive GI losses and diminished cardiac output from atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She remained clinically stable with no dizziness, SOB, AMS, or chest pain and was transferred to the medical floor on [**8-15**].
This remained stable and was managed with local wound care.
