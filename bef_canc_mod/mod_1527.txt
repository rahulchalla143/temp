There is upper zone vascular redistribution and perihilar haze consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo female with h/o with CAD, AVR secondary to endocarditis, Hepatitis C and a history of GIB admitted with severe anemia, supertherapuritc INR, and chest pain.
Anemia: Pt has a history of recurrent GI bleeds of unclear etiology.
She had a Hct of 17 and INR of 8, but she had no evidence of RP bleed, ICH, etc.
Pt refused a gastric lavage, and she required pursuasion to undergo any other work-up.
Of note, she had a very similar admission one year ago ([**12-23**]) during which she left AMA without intervention.
It was thought that pt likely had GIB in setting of elevated INR, in addition to having low grade hemolysis.
It was unclear why she was supratherapeutic with INR of 8, but pt may have confused the coumadin dosing.
This was likely secondary to hypovolemia as it stablized after volume repletion.
She was restarted on enalapril and lasix, and she had no further episodes of hypotension.
Daily lasix was restarted when pt c/o SOB and had pitting edema in lower extremities; did not have rales and never has rales as a manifestation of volume overload.
Her symptoms were improved with diuretics.
PVD: The patient has a chronic venous stasis ulcer on LLE.
Seen recently by plastics and did not have any signs of infection on LLE x-ray.
