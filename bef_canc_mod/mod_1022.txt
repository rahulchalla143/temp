Initial admission was for RUQ pain, nausea and fever to 103.
U/S had shown intrahepatic ductal dilitation and patient subsequently had an ERCP with diagnosis of cholangitis likely secondary to recurrent stones and possible stricture.
Intrahepatic ducts were inaccessible due to prior Roux-en-Y so percutaneous biliary drainage was attempted, the CBD was inaccessible, and a re-attempt was to be tried a few days later.
In the meantime the patient developed bleeding from the drain site, the drain was removed and the intrahepatic ducts were no longer dilated.
Patient appeared to be clinically improving and was to be discharged home, however on [**2172-3-20**] the Hct was found to have dropped to 20%, CT abdomen revealed heterogeneous liver consistent with intrahepatic bleeding.
CT performed on [**2172-3-21**] showed: - Intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving largely segments V and VI of the liver, with a moderately large right subcapsular hematoma.
- Moderately enlarged right hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
- Small perinephric free fluid.
A chest tube was placed by Thoracic surgery on [**2172-3-21**], 300 cc of serosanguinous fluid was immediately obtained from the chest tube, a second tube was used to replace the first with an additional 400 cc removed.
