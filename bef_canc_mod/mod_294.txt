Additionally, during that hospitalization, he developed a right sided loculated effusion for which he underwent a videoscopic thorascopy for removal.
Of note, he was sent out on a course of Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum culture on [**2113-8-22**].
Since the discharge from [**Hospital1 69**] four days ago, Mr. [**Known lastname 19388**] has had ongoing respiratory complained of shortness of breath with purulent sputum.
On [**2113-9-9**], he developed leukocytosis to 14.
Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin were added empirically for gram-negative coverage after a culture grew gram-negative rods.
On [**9-10**], the day of admission, he had increasing vent requirements.
Additionally, he was bronchoscoped by CT surgery revealed only mural secretions.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2097**].
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy in [**2108**].
Colon cancer status post colectomy.
The patient had nondiagnostic bone narrow in [**7-/2113**] on a preoperative for surgery.
History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Status post penile implant.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history revealed the following:  Father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.
Mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
BACK:  No CVA tenderness.
SKIN:  2 cm elliptical purpuric lesion in the left cheek; venous stasis changes lower extremities.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe opacities, greater on the right than the left, which had been increased compared to the prior study.
There was cardiomegaly with mild edema.
CT of the chest was done in the ED, which revealed large right lung consolidation, bilateral fluid collections, left greater than right.
Fluid collection has enhancing walls and empyema could not be excluded.
ST depressions in V5 and V6.
PULMONARY:  The patient's pulmonary status was believed to be complicated that he had infiltrates on chest x-ray and CT, as well as pleural effusions.
It was concerning that he had had a VATS and drain of loculated effusion approximately a week prior to admission, however, this seemed to have reaccumulated on the right and additionally he developed a new effusion on the left.
Our differential at the time of admission included that this was due to pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or post pericardotomy changes.
The rehabilitation facility from which he came was called and results were obtained for sputum culture.
Additionally, because he was fluid overloaded on examination, there was concern he was in congestive heart failure.
Cardiology team could give no definitive answer, but recommended diuresing the patient to see if the pulmonary status did not improve.
If his pulmonary status is not improved with treatment for pneumonia and diuresis for fluid overload, consideration will then be given for performing a diagnostic thoracentesis or possibly giving a trial of Prednisone for post cardiotomy syndrome.
The decision was made not to do diagnostic thoracentesis on him in house, because the INR was therapeutic and if were to stop his Coumadin, he would have to be put on Lepirudin rather than heparin since he has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has a recent diagnosis of pancytopenia likely secondary to mild dysplasia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Multifactorial respiratory failure requiring maintenance on the ventilator.
FOLLOW-UP CARE:  Follow up will be in two weeks' time with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or any available pulmonary attending.
