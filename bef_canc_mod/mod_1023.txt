[**2117-8-25**] - Tracheostomy [**2117-9-1**] - PEG Feeding Tube Placement  History of Present Illness: This 75 year old lady with remarkable past medical history with stage III lung cancer, treated about 7 years ago with chemo/radio therapy, managed to survive without recurrence of the cancer on recent extensive investigations when she presented with aortic stenosis.
Her investigation included angiogram and echo which basically showed severe aortic stenosis with calcified tricuspid aortic valve and significant disease in the right coronary artery and also a patent foramen ovale and mild mitral regurgitation.
Her past medical history as mentioned above includes the lung cancer, stage III, with also subsequent right sided pleural effusion as well as pericardial effusion for which she had pericardiocentesis in the past.
She thoroughly investigated with PET scan, etc to rule out possibility of any secondaries which were all negative.

LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at base HEART: RRR, 3/6 systolic murmur ABD: Benign EXT: Warm well perfused NEURO: Alert, nonfocal.
Findings consistent with cardiomegaly and interstitial pulmonary edema.
Nodular densities within the right upper lobe and volume loss in the right upper lobe.
Two compression fractures of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
There is a large amount of air underneath the diaphragms; a PEG tube appears to be in place in the left upper quadrant.
Small areas of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well as within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata bilaterally.
No evidence of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation to suggest a large minor or major vascular territorial infarct is identified, although MR is a more sensitive evaluation for evaluation for acute infarct.
Mild fluid opacification of the mastoid air cells and mucosal thickening within the sinuses.

She was noted to have severe facial and neck edema for which diuresis was initiated.
An underlying atrial fibrillation was noted.
A heparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia which was negative.
On [**2117-8-22**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was extubated however promptly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
A head CT scan was obtained which showed small areas of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well as within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata bilaterally.
While changing a central line, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive which responded to resuscitation.
Rate control of her atrial fibrillation was recommended.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continued to experience episodes of hypotension which responded to pressors.
Most of her episodes seemed to be related to atrial fibrillation which was aggressively controlled with amiodarone.
