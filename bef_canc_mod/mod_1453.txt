Presenting complaint of right hand tingling and mouth tingling.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy [**2168-7-20**] Blood transfusions, 4 units PICC insertion [**2168-7-30**]   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with a history of Tangier disease, paraplegia secondary to thoracic cord compression, and poorly controlled hypertension who presented with right tongue numbness and arm tingling.
She went to [**Hospital 40576**], where she became increasingly somnolent, had poor verbal output, and developed significant right-sided weakness.
Head CT showed a 4x3cm L frontal hemorrhage.
She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**1-24**] following a small occipital hemorrhage.
MRI and MRA were done at that time, and it was thought to be due to a pial malformation.
No angiography was done at that time.
MRI at that time did also show some evidence of microhemorrhages.
More recently she was hospitalized from [**6-26**] to [**6-30**] for poorly controlled hypertension (201 systolic) for which she was started on Diovan 160mg, Norvasc 10mg and HCTZ 12.5mg.
Past Medical History: - hypertension - paraplegia with indwelling Foley s/p spinal surgery [**9-22**] for thoracic epidural mass (T11/T12) - demyelinating neuropathy with bilateral Bell's palsy - occipital hemorrhage [**1-24**] - thrombocytopenia - tangier disease - AVN of bilateral humeral heads (likely secondary to long-term steroid use) - GERD - depression   Social History: Has lived in [**Hospital2 34116**] [**Hospital3 **] since [**4-23**].
Elder siblings both died of complications from alcoholism.
There is no history of Tangier disease or stroke.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T:97.6  P:82  R: 16  BP:137/54  SaO2: 98% on RA General: Pleasant, alert paraplegic woman with expressive aphasia, cognitively intact.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, mildly inflamed conjunctivae, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity.
Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Loud bruit over the abdominal aorta.
Skin: Red irregular plaque with scaling noted on scalp.
Significantly increased tone in lower extremities, with bilateral lower extremity spastic paralysis, flaccid paralysis in the right upper extremity.
Unable to hold left arm antigravity (though appears in part limited by pain in shoulder) with 4/5 FF, biceps and triceps on left.
Prominent Q waves in leads III and aVF are new as compared with previous tracing of [**2168-1-21**].
Head CT [**7-17**]: FINDINGS: In the left posterior frontal lobe along the high convexity, there is a 4.5 x 3.5 cm parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
There is approximately 4 mm of left to right midline shift at the level of the left frontal lobe hemorrhage and there is regional sulcal effacement though no downward herniation.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with surrouding edema.
The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic stroke versus hemorrhagic mass.
There is sclerosis and deformity of the left humeral head, compatible with history of prior AVN.
Given the absence of prior studies for comparison and abnormal appearance of the glenohumeral joint, evaluation for interval change is somewhat limited.
The left humeral head does appear to be slightly inferiorly positioned relative to the glenoid and the axillary view is suboptimally positioned and therefore nondiagnostic.
The examination is unchanged except for increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm.
Although this could merely reflect left lower lobe volume loss with pleural fluid, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
CXR [**7-19**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-18**], there is little change.
Continued increased opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Again, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in this region if there are appropriate clinical symptoms.
In addition, there is some ill-defined opacification in the left perihilar region.
This has developed since the most recent study and is worrisome for developing pneumonia in the region.
Bilateral pleural effusions have increased from prior study, left greater than right, with associated atelectais.
There is no pneumothorax.
The osseous structures demonstrate near complete destruction of the bilateral humeral heads.
EEG [**7-21**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of rare right frontal and left temporal sharp waves which may represent epileptogenic regions in the cerebral cortex.
It is also abnormal because of left frontal slowing suggestive of subcortical dysfunction.
There was no organized epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures.
Stable appearance of large left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage, with edema.
Minimal interval increase in left sulcal effacement and rightward subfalcine herniation now measuring 6 mm, previously 3 mm.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
EEG [**7-22**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in these regions and correlates with her history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
There was no clear epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures.
EEG [**7-23**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing due to subcortical dysfunction in these regions and correlates with her history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
There was no organized epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures.
Video fluoroscopy oropharyngeal swallow [**7-26**]: IMPRESSION: Penetration with cup sips of nectar with eventual aspiration.
Renal ultrasound [**7-27**]: The right kidney measures 9.1 cm.
There are no stones or hydronephrosis.
Both kidneys are echogenic, suggestive of underlying medical renal disease.
Partially imaged within the liver are simple hepatic cysts, better assessed on a prior dedicated liver ultrasound.
Head CT [**7-28**]: IMPRESSION: Stable size of the large left frontal lobe hemorrhage.
Stable surrounding edema and mass effect.
No new hemorrhage.
[**7-19**]: MRSA screen positive.
[**7-29**] urine culture no growth.
7/17 L subclavian tip no growth.
[**2168-7-18**] 02:09AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.0 eAG-97   Brief Hospital Course: 59yo F with Tangier disease and baseline paraplegia, who presented with large new left frontal intracranial hemorrhage.
Her [**7-21**] head CT did show minimal interval increase in left sulcal effacement and rightward subfalcine herniation measuring 6 mm, rather than the prior 3 mm.
# Nutrition She received NG tube feeds in the ICU, with diet advanced as her mental status improved.
#Polymicrobial UTI: The patient has a chronic Foley for neurogenic bladder.
Her [**7-19**] urine culture showed grew vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus and Pseudomonas, with repeat urine culture on [**7-28**] growing VSE at [**2158**]/ml, and a [**7-29**] urine culture with no growth.
#MRSA Pneumonia - In the ICU, she developed a retrocardiac infiltrate with BAL growing out MRSA.
She completed an 11d course of vancomycin and was afebrile with no cough or shortness of breath for the rest of her stay.
#Acute renal failure - On [**7-26**] her creatinine rose from a baseline of 0.3 to 1.5 and then climbed to a max of 2.2 on [**7-29**] before trending downwards back to 1.5.
Renal was consulted and thought her ARF was due to acute tubular necrosis, likely from hypotension related to a Lasix drip she received.
#Multifactorial anemia - Ms. [**Known lastname **] came with an Hct of 34.
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
She was hemodynamically stable with no signs of active bleeding.
#Tangier disease - Ms. [**Known lastname **] was at increased risk for CAD given dyslipidemia (HDL of 2).
# Muscle spasms The patient had occasional painful muscle spams in legs that she has had sometimes at home as well.
# Severe bilateral glenohumeral joint destruction The patient complained of arm pain.
Shoulder films showed severe glenohumeral joint destruction and fragmentation bilaterally (also present in past, consistent with AVN/Charcot joint).
Orthopedics saw her and recommended pain control, but the patient gets nauseous with opiates and did not want to add new medications other than Tylenol.
# Skin lesion on scalp She had an ulcerated plaque on her scalp that dermatology consult thought was consistent with seborrheic dermatitis and was not concerning for malignancy.
# Epigastric tenderness On the floor, she had epigastric tenderness with guarding but no rebound with palpation.
This was stable with no pain at rest.
She had no reported guaiac positive stools and a transient elevation of lipase to 75.
