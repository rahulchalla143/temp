# Aspiration pneumonia-  Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] was admitted with leukocytosis of 18.3 which is lower than his WBC of 20 at [**Location (un) 620**] after an aspiration event with his BIPAP.
Pt had a witnessed aspiration which is highly suspicious for the cause of his PNA.
This was consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
He did not have a formal video swallow study as he is unwilling to have a feeding tube placed.
He remains at high risk for recurrent events given his advanced MS, and he may have to ultimately be discontinued off of BIPAP, and have further changes to his diet.
# Encephalopathy:  He had worsening of his mental status in the setting of acute illness, but returned to his baseline with treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
Per family hyponatremia was thought to be due to Tegretola dn pt was switched to Keppra whilst on the Neurology service.

# Deafferentation-type sensory illusion syndrome: Syndrome is a result from terminal degenerative disease, pt believes in illusions that pertain to his body such as the sensation of having BMs, feeling itchy.
Neurology had commented on this during pt's last admission, only recommended therapy was to continuing the use of his antiepileptic therapy.
