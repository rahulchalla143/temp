History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo female with pmh of asthma, COPD on 3 L NC, dCHF, a.fib, hx of DVT, and htn admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hyperkalemia and concern for her tenuous respiratory status.
Denies fevers or CP, but does admit to a productive cough for two days.
She states for the past few days she had decreased po intake due to a general feeling of unwellness.
She admits to recent rhinorrhea, and pain after finishing urination as well as polyuria.
Has stable orthopnea, denies PND or new lower extremity edema.
No recent sick contacts.
She took 50 mg po prednisone at home the night before admission and nebs x 2, however her symptoms worsened so this morning she called EMS.
She had a CXR which was found concerning for PNA so she was given 750 mg po levofloxacin.
Her inital EKG had a widened QRS and peaked T-waves so she was given 10 mg IV insulin, 1 amp D50, 1 amp sodium bicarb, and 1 gm calcium gluconate all x 2 with eventual improvement in her EKG findings.
She was also given 60 grams of kayexalate and had one bowel movement prior to leaving the ED.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she states her dyspnea has improved somewhat at rest, but she still gets dyspneic with movements.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Her family history is notable for multiple family members with hypertension, father who died of lung cancer, and mother who died of CVA and hypertension.
Physical Exam: Vitals:  T 99 BP 144/94  P 90  RR 26  Sat 98% on 2 L NC General: Alert, appropriate, no acute distress at rest, but visibily has increased work of breathing after any movement.

Small to moderlate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yo with history of COPD and atrial fibrillation was admitted with shortness of breath found secondary to pneumonia triggering COPD exacerbation.
She was also found to have acute renal failure with creatinine to 1.8 associated with a Klebsiella urinary tract infection and marked hyperkalemia to K 8.4.
Acute exacerbation of COPD The patient was found to have a pneumonia, the likely trigger of her Asthma/COPD exacerbation.
She was started on Levofloxacin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia and given a dose of IV steroids in the ED.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] does have a history of diastolic heart failure and presented with an elevated BNP in the 3000s; however, she was found to be dry clinically and was not believed to have an acute exacerbation of her heart failure.
Her BNP was likely elevated as a result of right heart strain in the setting of acute pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
The patient has a baseline O2 requirement of 3L on nasal cannula at home; she was saturating at 98-100% on 2L nasal cannula upon discharge.
She is also on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline Cr is 0.9 - 1.1, and her Cr in the ED was found to be elevated to 1.8.
Her history suggests that she had poor PO intake for several days prior to admission; her ARF was likely of prerenal etiology and secondary to continued diuretic use in the setting of decreased PO intake.
Patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and remarkable lower extremity edema in the past.
She was taking KCl 20 mg po bid and aldactone 100 mg po daily as an outpatient which likely contributed to her hyperkalemia in the setting of ARF.
She was admitted directly to the ICU, where she was treated with further insulin, dextrose, bicarbonate, adn kayexalate; her potassium responded well and was brought down to 4.8 by the next afternoon, so she was transferred to the floor.
Urinary tract infection: The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection; the levofloxacin and ceftriaxone she was getting for pneumonia adequately covered for her urinary tract infection.
She did describe symptoms of urinary retention and overflow incontinence, which would increase the risk of urinary tract infection.
Muscle Weakness: The patient complained of symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, which started the day she was admitted, likely related to her hyperkalemia.
Her symptoms subjectively improved somewhat as her potassium level decreased, which would not be consistent with a spinal nerve compression.
The patient stated that the last time she used steroid therapy for her COPD was about 1 year ago, so she was unlikely to have steroid-induced myopathy.
She showed no clinical evidence of bleeding, though she had a known GI bleed in the past.
Leukopenia Patient's WBC has ranged between [**3-9**] primarily in the past and was stable in this range during this hospitalization.
Atrial Fibrillation She has atrial fibrillation and is on rate control with both metoprolol and diltiazem.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of shortness of breath.
For your shortness of breath, you were thought to have a pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
You were also found to have kidney failure and urinary tract infection.
You were treated with a urinary tract infection which is now much improved.
Likewise your kidney failure is much improved.
- diltiazem - we have increased this medication to 360mg daily, which is increased from 180mg daily.
- aldactone - we have stopped this medication due to your elevated potassium levels.
- prednisone - this is a steroid to help treat your COPD exacerbation.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop fevers, shaking chills, night sweats, worsened shortness of breath, worsened cough, increased lower extremity swelling, light-headedness, \ passing out, or muscle aches.
