Altered Mental Status: Following admission to the MICU, the patient was continued on a nalaxone drip given suspicion that his change in mental status was secondary to narcotic toxicity.
Work-up of potential infectious etiologies included blood cultures, U/A and urine culture, and chest X-ray.
A head CT scan was negative for acute process.
His ammonia was not significantly elevated on admission, however, he was continued on lactulose for a goal [**4-7**] bowel movements per day, given possible contributor of hepatic encephalopathy (at time of discharge, ammonia level was 33).
His aricept was also discontinued, given concern that its anticholinergic effect could be contributing to his acute change in mental status.
It is recommended that the patient does NOT receive any narcotics for pain control.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed in the MICU, which was not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
Sepsis was felt to be unlikely, and infectious work-up was carried out as above.
Cirrhosis w/grade III varices: The patient was continued on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
His narcotics were discontinued given concern for narcotic intoxication as the cause of his change in mental status/hypotension.
He was maintained on standing acetaminophen (<2g/day) and was started on a trial of SC Calcitonin for pain related to a compression fracture.
The etiology of this patient's compression fracture is unknown and will require outpatient workup.
He received Vit D and Calcium supplementation in house, but a bisphosphanate was not started given his known esophageal varices.
His anemia is likely secondary to ESRD, for which he receives erythropoietin at dialysis.
His thrombocytopenia is likley secondary to liver dysfuntion/portal hypertension.
Calcitonin (Salmon) 200 unit/mL Solution Sig: Fifty (50) IU Injection DAILY (Daily) as needed for bone pain.
