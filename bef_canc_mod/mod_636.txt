1. hypertensive urgency - pt presented to ER with SBP in 240s and c/o dyspnea.
This study showed no signs of dissection.
At time of transfer, she denied CP and SOB.
Pt was also continued on her HD regimen for ESRD, for volume control.
2. angioedema - pt developed facial swelling and shortness of breath while on medical floor.
Given history of SVC, venogram was ordered that did not indicate a complete occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein, as previously thought, with help of 22 gauge needle.
3. cough: pt presented with chronic cough/dyspnea without fevers.
Chest CT revealed bilateral infiltrates and nodularities, noted possibly infectious vs edema.
At time of transfer, pt's dyspnea was largely resolved and these findings were felt to be more consistent with edema given hypertensive urgency.
4. chronic abdominal pain - pt has had chronic abdominal pain, which was well controlled at time of transfer.
5. bacteremia - GPC in pairs and clusters; started on vanco on [**2142-7-12**].
Her [**Date Range 2286**] seems to have slightly improved this finding.
8. anemia/pancytopenia - chronic anemia, baseline pancytopenia, likely [**2-12**] CKD and SLE, currently above baseline, though has h/o GIB.
9. h/o gastric ulcer - PPI was continued throughout hospitalization.
11. h/o SVC thrombosis - patient's warfarin was discontinued after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**].
12. seizure disorder - pt was continued on home regimen keppra 1000 mg PO 3X/WEEK (TU,TH,SA).
