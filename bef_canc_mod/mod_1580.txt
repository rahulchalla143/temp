**FINAL REPORT [**2192-2-6**]**    MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2192-2-6**]):    No MRSA isolated.
There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema.
No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace effusions be difficult to exclude.
No definite focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with fluid overload.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The right ventricular may be more dilated and hypokinetic, but was not well visualized on the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 y/o F with CHF, [**Year (4 digits) 2091**], afib, T2DM, presenting with worsening lower extremity edema and pain, found to have acute on chronic kidney injury, acidosis, and hyperkalemia.
ACTIVE ISSUES # non-gap metabolic acidosis: Pt presented with predominantly non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Her presentation is most consistent with type 4 renal tubular acidosis, likely developed in the setting of diabetic [**Year (4 digits) 2091**].
There was a gradual decline of HCO3 in the past two months.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] is likely [**12-29**] CHF exacerbation with concormitant ACEI use.
There was probably a component of ATN given the presence of granular cast on urine sedimentation and prominant auto-diuresis on HD#3,4.
She needs continued monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function.
# Hyperkalemia: Pt presented with hyperkalemia to 5.7.
The reason for her hyperkalemia is likely multifactorial, including [**Last Name (un) **], RTA, and ACEI use.
There were no hyperkalemia related EKG changes during the entire hospitalization.
# CHF exacerbation: Pt presented with 25 lbs above dry weight with significantly elevated BNP, and CXR consistent with severe fluid overload.
ECHO on [**2-3**] showed unchanged EF with diastolic dysfunction.
We therefore held diuresis until her urine output normalized.
Pt was evaluated by the cardiologist, who also recommended aspirin for her CAD and compromised systolic function.
# Bradycardia: Pt had episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the ED.
Her average heart rate has consistently been >50, with episodes of recorded bradycardia from arhythmia.
Per discussion with cardiology, the underlying rhythm was afib with slow ventricular response and occasional slow a-flutter with variable block.
AV nodal disease is the underlying pathology.
Patient was started on a low dose beta blocker on this hospitalization for generalized rhythm control and cardioprotective effects.
No further episodes of bradycardia on carvedilol.
# Arrhythmia - Afib/Aflutter: Pt has known history of atrial fibrillation, CHADS score [**3-1**], on dabigatran prior to admission.
We had to discontinue her dabigatran in setting of renal failure.
However, pt had difficult venous access, thus difficult to obtain reliable monitoring.
We discontinued the heparin gtt as we felt the risk of adverse events outweighed the benefit of reducing the stroke risk while awaiting a therapeutic INR.
Her metoprolol was switched to carvedilol per above (initially held in presence of bradycardia), and she was discharged on a warfarin dose of 6 mg qday as INR remained subtherepeutic at time of discharge.
# LE edema: Pt presented with chief complaint of symmetric bilateral LE edema with tenderness on palpation.
This is a chronic condition likely [**12-29**] venous stasis and exacerbated by CHF exacerbation.
We felt cellulitis or DVT is unlikely in this clinical setting.
Pain symptoms improved with diuresis.
CHRONIC ISSUES # HTN: Pt's blood pressure medication was discontinued initially.
# GERD: Stable.

You were found to have a condition called renal tubular acidosis type 4 which was responsible for your potassium changes.
In regards to your leg swelling, we were able to remove significant amounts of fluid from you with diuretics, and your heart and kidney condition improved significantly.
