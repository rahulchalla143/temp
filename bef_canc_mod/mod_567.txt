He required ICU care and multiple antibiotic courses for bacteremia and sepsis.
He also had acute-on-chronic renal failure.
He typically follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] for his renal disease.
He has had an additional brief admission for hyperkalemia but was again discharged to [**Hospital1 **] where he is having his rehabilitation.
He has no abdominal pain and no complaints.
Social History: [**Hospital3 2558**] resident since prolonged admission for septic shock (7/9-21/09).

Family History: [**Name (NI) **] wife denies any heart problems in family.
No scleral icterus.
Neck:  No JVD.
Chest:  Rales at bilateral bases, no wheeze or rhonchi.
Extremities: with trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
DIAGNOSIS: Gallbladder: - Chronic cholecystitis.
No cystic duct lymph node is identified.
The opened gallbladder contains no bile and gallstones numbering approximately 20.
The gallbladder mucosa is erythematous and velvety.
The specimen is then represented as follows: A = cystic duct mucosa and sections of gallbladder wall, B = additional sections of gallbladder wall.
[**2166-8-10**] Renal U/S: RENAL ULTRASOUND: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis in the kidneys.
There are multiple bilateral renal cysts, the largest on the right measuring up to 9.1 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads I, aVL and leads V5-V6.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-8-5**] the rate has increased and the lateral T wave changes are slightly more prominent.
[**2166-8-16**] CXR: FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but has decreased in size with associated improvement in reported pulmonary vascular congestion.
Lung volumes are slightly greater in the interval, and there has been marked improved aeration at the left base.
There remains a confluent area of opacification in the right retrocardiac region, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.
Right basilar retrocardiac opacification, which could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Near-resolution of left basilar opacity.
Small pleural effusions, with improvement on the right.
On [**2166-8-8**], the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating a clear liquid diet, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and JP drain in place, and Percocet PO and Morphine IV PRN for pain control.
POD#1: Pain well controlled on Percocet.
Renal Service consulted for progressively increase creatinine in context of the patient's history of chronic renal insufficiency.
Acute on chronic renal failure believed secondary to post-renal obstruction from BPH.
Later in evening, became agitated and confused.
POD#3: Continued agitation, confusion overnight.
Given fluid bolus for low urine output with good response.
POD#4: Triggered for diaphoresis, SOB, and tachypnea.
Transfered to the TICU for respiratory acidosis and acute respiratory failure with fluid overload.
ECHO revealed Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction with LVEF >55%.
Renal followed; no dialysis at this time.
POD#6: CXR with mildly improved pulmonary edema and (R) basilar atelectasis.
Pain well controlled.
Aggressive respiratory toilet.
CXR showed right basilar retrocardiac opacification, which could reflect pneumonia.
POD#9: Hemodynamically stable.
No complaints.
Renal following.
POD#11: Tolerated diet.
Pain well controlled.
Urine culture revealed VRE UTI senstive to Linazolid; started on Linezolid for 2 week course.
Pain well controlled.
Voided adequately without problem.
At the time of discharge on [**2166-8-20**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a renal regular diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
