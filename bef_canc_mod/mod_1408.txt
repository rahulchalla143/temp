[**2168-5-7**] Right pleural effusion with pigtail placement.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman who underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2167-6-17**] for esophageal cancer.
Postoperatively he developed a severe stricture involving the proximal 3 cm of his conduit.
This was dilated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a tracheoesophageal fistula resulted.
This ultimately healed with placement of endoscopic stents but the patient had severe dysphagia and was unable to tolerate saliva.
Past Medical History: Esophageal cancer with esophagectomy 7.09 COPD hx of CHF but normal EF and echo in [**2168-4-16**] HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD with history of stents Horseshoe kidney cataract surgery tonsillectomy as a child  Social History: Lives at home with his sister History of 1.5 PPD x 60 years, none now.
CV: RRR S1, S2, no MRG or JVD Abd: soft, NT, ND, incisions healing without redness, purulence or drg.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax or mediastinal air present.
The pleural effusion at least partially loculated within the fissure is redemonstrated.
[**2168-5-25**] Video Swallow IMPRESSION: Profound aspiration into the airway with minimal passage of contrast into the esophagus.
With phonation, there appears to be incomplete movement of the right vocal cord and no movement of the left vocal cord.
On [**2168-5-4**] the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent re-do neck exploration, re-do laparotomy with harvesting of left colon and substernal colon interposition.
He was extubated on POD1; however, due to respiratory distress and for airway protection, he was reintubated that evening.
Bronchoscopies did show a recurrent fistula that was stented in the operating room on [**2168-5-13**].
Neuro: Pain was initially controlled with epidural.
Patient improved with Ativan for his agitation control.
On discharge, he was then maintained on a roxicet down his j-tube for pain control.
Patient with no neurological deficits during this hospital course.
Fluid bolus provided for hypotension and pressors avoided to perserve conduit vascular flow.
Lopressor resumed with hold parameters.
Extubated POD1 but required re-intubation due to respiratory distress.
Bronchoscopy performed for lavage and cultures, which returned Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas.
CXR did show an impressive R pleural effusion.
Bilious secretions were found in the airway, suggesting a re-occurence of his tracheo-gastric fistula.
With ventilator dependence and respiratory failure, he was taken to the operating room on [**5-13**] for tracheal stenting and a percutaneous tracheostomy.
Since then, he was able to be weaned to trach collar breathing without ventilator support.
GI/FEN: Pt is s/p colonic interposition for esophageal condiut.
PPI was started for prophylaxis.
NGT left in for gastric decompression.
He did have diarrhea but tested cdif negative several times.
Received several boluses of fluid and albumin for low urine output.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
With an elevated wbc and RLL infiltrate, he was started empirically on flagyl and aztreonam for pneumonia.
BAL cultures returned with a multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas.
Patient developed fever to 103 with elevated wbc 25, with worsening CXR, he received another bronchoscopy.
This showed reoccurence of a tracheal gastric fistula.
As this was stented, he was afebrile and wbc normalized.
He had no issues.
Hematology: The patient was transfused with blood on [**2168-5-6**] for hypotension, hct of 27% and to prevent ischemia around his anastamosis.
No obvious signs of bleeding.
No other issues.
Venodyne boots were used for DVT prophylaxis.
Wound: JP drains were removed on POD15 after amylase levels were checked and confirmed no evidence of any anastomotic leaks.
