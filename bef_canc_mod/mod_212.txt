A chest CT showed b/l nodules and tree-in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern concerning for mycobacterial infection given ongoing remicade treatment.
One was positive verifying diagnosis of pulmonary TB.
However, she developed a transaminitis so these were stopped.
Pt is still having fevers at disharge of around 101 but ID feels likely due to resolving Tb.
No other signs of infection to account for fever.
2) RESP FAILURE- After being transferred to MICU pt went into hypoxic resp failure, possibly from CHF or Tb.
3) NSTEMI: Pt had a NSTEMI in setting of respiratory failure and tachycardia.
4) AVNRT: Episodes of tachycardia felt to be AVNRT by cards.
Pt has h/o sideroblastic anemia and G6PD.
Felt to be due to systemic illness and potential marrow suppression from meds.
MRI showed progression of arthritis and fluid collection which was tapped for infection but negative includ AFB.
Her CTA here did not show PE so it was not restarted.
In addition, pt had intermittently high PTT which was thought to be due to SC heparin so this was stopped as well.
