HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 54 year old man with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus who has not seen a physician for approximately two years.
He presents with a one week history of nausea, dry heaves, fever, and an episode of syncope on the morning of admission.
The patient continued to have nausea over the next five days.
In addition, he had frequent dry heaves and anorexia.
In the week prior to admission, the patient also began to feel increasingly short of breath and developed a dry cough.
In addition, he notes a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] left sided flank pain that begins as a sharp pain and then gradually dulls and lasts for several hours at a time.
The patient's only sick contact is his son who has been sick with bronchitis for approximately two weeks.
He does not know what this fungus is but reports that it has made some of his co-workers ill with a fever and cough.
He walked back into his bedroom and had a second episode of loss of consciousness while laying on the bed.
He continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded until he arrived in the Emergency Department.
The patient's lower left back pain resolved with one tablet of sublingual Nitroglycerin.
Diabetes mellitus diagnosed in [**2147**] and controlled with insulin.
Hernia repair at the age of five.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient's mother has hypertension and was diagnosed with breast cancer several years ago.
His father has hypercholesterolemia and congestive heart failure.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies headache, visual changes, hearing changes, runny nose, or sore throat.
He does report occasional edema of his feet and ankles since [**Month (only) 205**] of this year.
He denies chest pain.
He denies diarrhea or constipation.
He denies any urinary symptoms.
In general, this is a pleasant but diaphoretic man laying in bed in no acute distress.
Dry mucous membranes with a light coating over the tongue.
No cuts, bruises, or other injuries from his syncopal episodes.
Pulmonary:  Diffuse bibasilar crackles with overall coarse lung sounds.
Extremities with trace lower extremity edema.
Lungs with diffuse bilateral coarse nodularity and interstitial opacities with more confluent areas in the right and left mid lung zones.
No pleural effusions.
These CK MB were normal but the troponin were mildly elevated with a maximum of 0.14.
The patient had no chest pain and no EKG abnormalities although past electrocardiograms were not available.
It was decided that the most probable cause of the elevated troponin was demand and/or renal failure.
However, during the first week of admission, the patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
The left atrium and right atrium were mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity was severely dilated with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No masses or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.
Wall motion abnormalities included an akinetic basal inferior, mid inferior and mid inferior lateral area.
Moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
There was no pericardial effusion.
Given these echocardiogram findings and the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, there was concern that the patient was suffering from a ischemic heart disease; however, given his acute renal failure, it was decided to further evaluate his heart without a cardiac catheterization.
There was coronary artery disease in the right coronary artery.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  It was felt that the patient's infection was most likely atypical pneumonia given his history and chest x-ray.
This showed no pericardial effusion.
There was a trace right pleural effusion.
There were reduced nodular opacities that were most prominently at the lung bases.
There was ground glass opacification surrounding the nodular densities.
The patient was initially treated for his community acquired atypical pneumonia with Levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
He continues to have a dry cough.
RENAL:  The patient with a severely elevated BUN and creatinine on admission.
He has no known history of chronic renal failure.
On admission, it was felt that the patient's acute renal failure was due to dehydration and he was rehydrated with intravenous fluids with a decrease in his statin.
However, the patient's creatinine remained elevated in the mid to high 2s following rehydration.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's nausea resolved with treatment of his atypical pneumonia.
ENDOCRINE:  [**Last Name (un) **] is following as the patient was previously followed there for his diabetes mellitus.
