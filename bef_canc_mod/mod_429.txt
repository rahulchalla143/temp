Admission Date:  [**2136-1-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-8-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Progressive shortness of breath, fever.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 45-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, last pulmonary function tests in [**2135-10-7**] showing a FVC of 2.5 (63%), FEV equals 0.47 on [**2135-12-27**], and recently treated as an outpatient for a congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with a steroid taper until [**2136-1-7**], and Levaquin until [**2136-1-5**], presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of increased shortness of breath not relieved by inhalers, as well as productive-yellow cough.
An electrocardiogram was a poor tracing, but it was relatively unchanged from previous, with no ischemic changes noted.
The patient continued to have difficulty with saturation and sputum control.
Blood cultures sent, chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating an interval improvement/resolution of a left upper lobe infiltrate, however, new infiltrates at the bibasilar regions concerning for pneumonia.
Patient was intubated for impending hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease; on home oxygen six months ago.
Status post left lower lobectomy; for a left lower lobe nodule, pathology report was subsequently negative on [**2135-9-6**].
On that echocardiogram, the patient had mild RV dilatation, mild global RV free-wall hypokinesis, mild left atrial enlargement, and a preserved ejection fraction.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had lung cancer at age 65, mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 63, brother had a CABG at age 43, sister has congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Chest:  Poor airway movement, diffuse wheezing.
Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus tachycardia at 119, right axis deviation, right bundle branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy.
CHEST X-RAY:  Interval improvement/resolution of left upper lobe infiltrate, new infiltrates at bibasilar regions concerning for pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE: MICU course:  Intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Found to have a new bibasilar pneumonia with ensuing sepsis.
Initial respiratory acidosis trouble shot on assist-control ventilation.
Chest CT scan was obtained on [**1-11**] to rule out pulmonary embolism.
The study were consistent with no pulmonary embolisms, however, mass-like densities were noted at the right lung base with inflammatory changes at the left lower base.
There was suspicious nodular densities adjacent to the heart on the right, as well as a more spiculated-appearing nodule in the left lower zone.
Likely infectious, however, nodular lesions suspicious for malignancy versus post-obstructive changes.
Echocardiogram was obtained on  [**1-12**], to look for pulmonary hypertension.
There was no evidence of tamponade.
MICU course included cycling of cardiac enzymes to rule out demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and sepsis.
The patient had no dynamic electrocardiogram changes throughout his course.
Also is noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia while asleep.
Regarding congestive obstructive pulmonary disease flare, patient was initially treated with standing albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, used subsequently weaned to his usual outpatient MDI doses.
Regarding the suspicious nodular densities demonstrated on CTA of the chest, the recommendation will be for the patient to followup with a repeat CT scan in four weeks.
Patient was also started on calcium carbonate at 1,000 mg po bid to prophylax against bone loss given pernicity of steroid use.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure throughout his course.
There his oxygen saturation should be kept between 90-95% (He is a CO2 retainer with severe congestive obstructive pulmonary disease).
Should have incentive spirometry, peak flow measurements, and pulmonary toilet.
Bibasilar pneumonia (status post sepsis).
Hypercapneic respiratory failure.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
CT scan of the chest on [**1-11**] with suspicious spiculated-appearing nodules in the left lower zone (patient needs followup CT scan in four weeks).
