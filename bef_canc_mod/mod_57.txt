Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure (with diastolic and systolic dysfunction).
[**2175-2-1**] echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% to 35%, no aortic stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic atrial fibrillation; status post pacemaker for bradycardia in [**2172**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
History of cerebrovascular accident in [**2166**] with left-sided weakness and numbness.

Anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 33%.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history positive for coronary artery disease without colon cancer.
Generally, the patient was lying in bed in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed jugular venous distention at 8 cm.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs revealed occlusion wheezing with trace crackles at the bases bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft with mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed no lower extremity edema.
No petechiae.
Rectal examination revealed gross blood (per Emergency Department).
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 88.
A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and by mouth contrast on admission showed no liver, no splenic mass, or biliary dilatation, with increased enhancement pericholecystic portion of liver.
The gallbladder was distended without gallbladder wall edema.
Multiple scattered lymph nodes in the celiac region; none of which appeared pathologic in size.
An abdominal ultrasound showed several gallstones and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid, and equivocal gallbladder edema.
The patient's rectal bleeding was thought to be due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
General Surgery was consulted on admission, and ultrasound and computed tomography were reviewed.
The patient continued to have epigastric pain and was eventually taken to the operating room on [**10-25**] for open cholecystectomy for possible peritonitis because the patient had persistent right upper quadrant peritoneal signs with increased left upper quadrant tenderness and a temperature to 101 degrees Fahrenheit.
On [**2175-10-25**], there was no hemodynamic instability and no changes in mental status with good urine output, but there was surgical concern that the patient may have gangrenous cholecystitis.
