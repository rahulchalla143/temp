Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left, similar compared to the prior study.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists.
No pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Continued bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left with bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history of severe AS, AF recently on coumadin, CHF and dementia who is presenting with severe anemia and hypotension in the setting of a GIB of unclear etiology.
# Anemia/GIB: presented with an acute GI bleed, unclear if upper or lower, has a history of prior upper GI lesion along with diverticulosis.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] his multiple comorbidities and overall poor baseline health status the decision was made not to pursue an endoscopic intervention.
The patient was re-started on IV PPI's because of his inability to tolerate po medications and the families concerns that he was symptomatic from reflux.
#  Hypernatremia The patient had been previously admitted for hypernatremia.
The patient is lethargic and fluctiations in sodium are likely without any po intake.
# Coagulopathy This is likely due to poor nutrition.
#CRF Stage III Baseline appears 1.7-1.9 was at 1.4 at discharge.
[**Month (only) 116**] limit transfusion requirement in future.
##Dysphagia Thought to be multifactorial (progressive dementia vs. MG), PEG/G-tube defered 2 months ago.
##Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (MG)/Dementia Was on pyridostigmine 60 Q8H, called pharmacy to see if this can be given IV-can be given IV but only on short term basis-1.9 mg Q3-4H because drug has a short half life and also has alcohol based preservatives which can cause renal toxicity.
##chronic AF Not on AC due to inability to tolerate po coumadin, poor RF precluded lovenox and now GIB also preculded AC.
# Goals of Care: After initial decision was made not to pursue an endoscopic intervention, palliative care was consulted to help with further discussions about his goals of care given his current GI bleed in the context of extensive medical co-morbidities.
The following day on the medical floor, the family decided to reverse the patient CMO and switch to DNR/DNI with supportive care but no invasive procedures.
