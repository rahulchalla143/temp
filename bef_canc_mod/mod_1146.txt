During his recent admission, CT scan did reveal fairly prominent parastomal varices although endoscopy (through stoma) did not identify an area of bleed.
Patient denies any symptoms of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers.
No orthostatics.

Similar appearance to multiple large areas of heterogeneous enhancement in the liver when compared to the previous study of [**2126-5-29**], likely representing areas of infarct.
The differential again includes biliary necrosis, cholangitis or other infectious processes.
However, there has been no interval development of an organized hepatic collection.
Thrombosis of the lower superior mesenteric vein, new since the previous study.
Partial thrombosis of the superior aspect of the extended TIPS which is also new since the previous study.
Focal dilation of the proximal jejunum, which may represent focal ileus.
There is a moderate amount of remaining ascites, but this is much reduced in size since [**2126-5-29**].
Parastomal hernia involving loops of small bowel, which is unchanged.
No evidence of obstruction.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
The left-sided pleural effusion has increased in size since the previous study.
Continued extensive varices, splenomegaly and non-visualized hepatic arteries which are likely thrombosed, all unchanged since the previous study  [**5-29**].
Interval development of multifocal extensive heterogeneously hypoenhancing hepatic areas, concerning for hepatic infarct/ischemia.
Cannot exclude early organizing intrahepatic abscess, but no definite thick-walled intrahepatic collection is noted.
Interval moderate increase of ascites, predominantly in the left lower quadrant, but without definite abscess.
The presence of large amount of ascites increases risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Similar perisplenic and perigastric varices.
Unchanged moderate right-sided pleural effusion, with bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
Similar right-sided parastomal hernia with loops of small bowel involved, but no bowel obstruction.
Status post colectomy with Hartmann's pouch without surgical complications.
Bilateral atrophic native kidneys, compatible with patient's history of end-stage renal failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 64239**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] [**Name (NI) **] surgical service on [**2126-5-20**] for hypotension and anemia from persistent stomal variceal bleeding.
Shunts were extended and findings of occlusion of proximal portion.
Displayed worsening encephalopathy on [**2126-5-27**] with increasing abdominal distention.
Diagnostic paracentesis with cytologies consistent with SBP.
He was intubated and upper endoscopies performed by GI, showed no active bleed but duodenal ulcers.
After procedure, hemodynamically unstable and consistent with systemic infectious physiology.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and CT scan performed showing increasing abdominal ascites and pleural effusion.
TEE did not show any vegetations, suggesting likely infected TIPS.
HD continued as clinically needed based on clinical exam and electrolytes, transfused as needed for low Hct, continued on all immunosuppression medications.
For more detail, his hospital course can be summarized by the following review of systems  Neuro: Pain was well controlled.
Patient was coherent and able to make own medical decisions without compromise.
Cardio: Pt with baseline hypotension while on midodrine and Florinef.
TTE/TEE procedures to assess for vegetations given patient's persistent bacteremia and were negative with normal cardiac function.
No hemodynamic issues.
Pleural effusion drained.
GI: Patient with history of liver [**Date Range **] x 2 c/b hepatic artery thrombosis.
Anti-coagulation was held due to parastomal bleeding.
CT also demonstrated SMA thrombosis.
Due to poor oral nutrition, dobhoff enteral feeding were started.
Patient with septic physiology, started on empiric antibodies of vancomycin and Flagyl.
Central, arterial and HD lines re-sited for persistent bacteremia.
TEE revealed no cardiac source.
Heme: Patient transfused with blood as needed for hypotension and other products as needed.
Discharge Medications: Atropine gtt SL Morphine PO Ativan  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: stomal variceal bleeding Liver failure bacteremia - fungal, bacterial Home hospice FTT   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
