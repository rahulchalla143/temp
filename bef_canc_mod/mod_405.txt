Starting yesterday developed nausea and diarrhea.
Malaise has persisted today with additional episodes of diarrhea after any attempt at eating.
EKG consistent with either flutter or MAT.
Has h/o atrial tachyarrhythmias (Followed by [**Doctor Last Name **]) but usually well-controlled with dilt and metoprolol but not anti-coagulated.
CXR showed possibility of acute on chronic aspiration, possible early developing infiltrate and had crackles on exam.
Received ceftriaxone and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
Labs revealed leukocytosis and hyponatremia.
She was admitted to the MICU for persistent tachycardia and hypotension.
She had no complaints other than a dry mouth and some pain in her throat that is chronic since undergoing radiation for her laryngeal cancer.

Given history, the possibility of chronic or possibly acute on chronic aspiration is considered.
[**2176-4-19**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and one ventricular premature beat.
Diffuse T wave changes.
[**2176-4-20**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-4-19**] sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats has replaced atrial fibrillation.
Persistent but decreased large right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion.
Increased pulmonary vascular congestion since one day prior.
Stable right lung and chest wall postoperative changes.
[**2176-4-24**] Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 yo F with h/o squamous cell lung CA s/p induction chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection [RUL lobectomy] as well as COPD who presents to ED with N/V/D/poor PO intake noted to be hypotensive with diarrhea.
#, Hypotension: Her hypotension was thought to be due to hypovolemia from dehydration and recent diarrhea in conjunction with her continuing to take both her diltiazem and metoprolol at home.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have been related to underlying infection given concern for a new infiltrate on CXR and h/o chronic aspiration so vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl were started to cover broadly for HCAP and aspiration.
Her tachycardia, thought to be MAT or AFlutter, was postulated to be contributing to the low BPs as well so a diltiazem gtt was started with moderate decrease in HR but minimal improvement in BP.
Tachycardia: She has a known history of either MAT or atrial flutter managed on metoprolol and diltiazem.
The tachycardia improved with IVFs and diltiazem gtt.
Hypoxia: She had a small O2 requirement on arrival from the ED, likely [**1-23**] pneumonia on top of malignancy and COPD.
She remained afebrile and her respiratory status rapidly improved.
N/V/D: Pt noted to have profuse diarrhea prior to arrival in the ICU however stool output was very modest while keeping pt NPO.
Flagyl for pts possible aspiration covered empirically for C.diff while waiting for the toxin result.
Metformin was held given pts elevated lactate on admission.
She had high blood sugars immediately prior to discharge felt to be related to steroid administration.
# CAD s/p MI-PTCA: No evidence of active ischemia in the ICU.
# FEN: tube feeds that pt receives for poor pos/dysphagia related to her cancer were continued  Medications on Admission: Diltiazem 120mg SR daily Prozac 20mg daily Advair 250/50 1 puff twice daily Magic mouthwash swish and spit Meformin 850mg twice daily Methadone 5mg/5mL-- 1m: per g tube and 0.5mL in PM Metoprolol 25mg daily Omeprazole 10mg daily Zofran as needed Prochloperazine 10mg every 6 hours as needed Simvastatin 20mg daily Tylenol 650mg daily Loperamide 2mg every 6 hours as needed Nebulizer 4times day Insulin 70/10, 11 Units in the AM, 8 with dinner.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to nausea and vomiting, and were diagnosed with pneumonia.
You also were found to have fluid around your right lung and you underwent a procedure to remove this fluid (thoracentesis).
The fluid collected because of your pneumonia.
You initially required oxygen while you were in the hospital but your oxygen saturation improved and you no longer required oxygen by the time of discharge.
