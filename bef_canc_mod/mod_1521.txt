Admission Date:  [**2167-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-3-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-3-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Betalactams / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 year-old female with CLL, HTN, CAD, CHF (EF 65% 1/08), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, CKD (baseline creatinine 1.3), DM2, anemia, and gout referred in by the oncologist from [**Hospital1 **] for AMS.
She was also noted to have worsening renal failure with increase in creatinine from 2 to 2.8, and worsening thrombocytopenia requiring a bag of platelets.
In the ED patient had a head CT which was negative for hemorrhage or mass effect and a CXR which was unremarkable.
Denies any pain, recent diarrhea or constipation.
Her only complaint is mouth pain including her tongue and teeth.
CT scan showed abdominal & cervical LAD, and large right pelvic mass.
BM Bx [**12-16**] revealed extensive infiltration, with 40% marrow cellularity.
However her chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia.
She remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to steroids and only minimal response to IVIG.
She began maintenance Rituxan on [**4-/2165**], but her course was complicated by diffuse arthralgias.
Due to increasing painful lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**].
This was then stopped due to thrombocytopenia.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2167-3-1**] CXR (PORT): IMPRESSION: Worsening CHF with now moderate pulmonary edema.
[**2167-3-2**] CXR: There has been continued worsening in pulmonary edema with increased consolidation in the left upper lobe.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is stable.
[**2167-3-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or significant interval change.
[**2167-3-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

ESCHERICHIA COLI.
[**2167-3-4**] BCX neg [**2167-3-5**] BCX neg  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68 year-old female with PMH of CLL, HTN, CAD, chronic stable diastolic CHF (EF >60%), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, CKD (baseline creatinine 1.3), DM2, anemia, a-fib, and gout admitted with AMS, UTI, and renal failure.
The patient p/w known UTI and recent neutropenia, and was recently started on oxycontin for pain.
#) Febrile neutropenia: The patient had febrile neutropenia (GRAN count 80 on [**2-20**])during admission without clear source.
Sites of previous biopsy showed no e/o abscess (though +fluctuance on exam).
Other possible sites included sacral wound and tooth decay.
The patient has lactam allergy and received imipenem at rehab, which could also be considered a cause of her neutropenia.
#) SOB/HYPOXIA: Had occasional O2 requirement this hospitalization w/ significant SOB [**3-2**] overnight in setting of transfusions.
On [**2167-3-4**], the patient had an acute episode of hypoxia which necessitated ICU transfer.
The patient had SOB and hypoxia in setting of HTN and tachycardia (afib with RVR) consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
CXR showed volume overload and echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved EF.
#) Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR: Likely triggered by hypoxia in setting of flash edema ([**2-14**] HTN).
With cardiology input, she was determined not to be a candidate for anticoagulation secondary to chronic low platelets.
#) Hypertension: Patient has history of malignant hypertension in prior admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric/left sided chest pain.
The patient did have significant chest pain with her rapid a-fib and received nitroglycerin with good effect.
#) ARF: The patient had a creatinine of 2.8 from baseline ~ 1.3 This trended back to baseline with diuresis and antibiotics.
Marrow infiltration vs. medication effect were considered; however, recent bone marrow biopsy on [**12-20**] was not suggestive of a clear explanation to account for pancytopenia.
Smear not very impressive but confirms pancytopenia, also some larger RBCs.
Etiology was most likely felt to be c/w medication-effect as the patient did receive imipenem at rehab and has history of leukopenia w/ beta-lactam antibiotics.
The patient was started on 3 day course of miconazole for yeast infection on [**3-12**].
on HISS in house with no acute issues.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with confusion due to a urinary tract infection and renal failure.
While you were here, you also developed very high blood pressure, rapid and irregular heart rate, and difficulty breathing.
We have treated your urinary tract infection with an antibiotic called bactrim for seven days.
You also developed severe shortness of breath due to your rapid and irregular heart rate, heart failure, and elevated blood pressure.
(Please note that there have been several changes so you should follow the updated list.)
If you experience any fevers > 100.5, chills, confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms please call your PCP or go to the ER for further evaluation.
