He was then readmitted to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**2146-12-3**] after developing acute pulmonary edema/CHF/unresponsiveness?.
There was a question whether he had a small MI; he reportedly had a small NQWMI.
Since admission has had an altered mental status and there is concern for possible hypoxic encephalopathy.
His wife is present and states that he is slightly more somnolent after ativan; but has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Past Medical History: CABG x [**Hospital3 68704**] (LIMA to LAD, vein grafts to OMI and PDA) ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Hyperlipidemia DM type II Obesity Partial colectomy for diverticulitis   Social History: Smoking X 40 yrs but quit 20 years ago.
Sclera anicteric.
PERRL Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
right medial leg incision healing well.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: CT head [**12-13**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
There is moderate cerebral atrophy with associated prominence of the sulci and ventricles.
Few foci of low density in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles likely represent mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
There is opacification of a left posterior ethmoid air cell.
CXR [**2146-12-12**]: No previous images.
However, no evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?MVP?).
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at least mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No mitral valve vegetation is seen but the images are suboptimal.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a valvular vegetation and to better assess the basis and severity of mitral regurgitation.
[**2146-12-16**] TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.

He then began to have GI bleeding and was found to have positive blood cultures, eventually attributed to endocarditis.
# endocarditis: high grade bacteremia with enterococcus and coag negative staph, both sensitive to vancomycin.
Blood cultures were positive on [**12-13**] and [**12-14**] and he had no further positive blood cultures on surveillance from [**Date range (1) 68705**].
Possible sources of endocaritis include CABG, post-CABG CVL, gut translocation from GIB.
He will receive 2 weeks of vancomycin 750 mg Q12H and gent 100 mg Q12H to treat staph line associated bacteremia.
# acute on chronic systolic heart failure: according to OSH reports, patient in pulmonary edema on presentation and ECHO showed EF 30%.
After reviewing OSH records, it appears that patient had significantly elevated MBI (CK 329, MB 80) at OSH with anterolatateral TWI in the setting of pulmonary edema.
He had no hemodynamic compromise in the setting of endocarditis.
After his GI bleed resolved, his beta blocker was restarted.
# CAD: s/p recent CABG.
Recent NSTEMI at OSH raises question of whether a graft went down acutely as he was recently revascularized.
Cardiac enzymes here were negative and patient had no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
Beta blocker was held in the setting of GI bleed and then restarted.
He underwent P-MIBI which showed a large fixed mild intensity perfusion defect in the inferior wall.
He had no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes with infusion.
His mental status rapidly improved once antibiotics were started suggesting his delerium was most likely due to his endocarditis.
# GI bleed: likely combination of upper and lower GIB with duodenal ulcer, diverticulosis, and rectal colitis.
Duodenal ulcer treated with injection and clipping.
He had no further bleeding following intervention.
Aspirin was initially held but was then restarted without incident.
He was started on niferex for presumed iron deficiency anemia.
Home valsartan was held and was not restarted due to low blood pressures.
ABG showed no respiratory acidosis or CO2 retention.
He will need a repeat CT scan in 6 months for surveillance .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for altered mental status and you were found to have an infection of your heart valve.
You were also found to have a bacteria in your stomach which can cause ulcers.
During your hospitalization you were also found to have bleeding in your GI tract.
A CT scan performed during your hospital stay showed a small nodule in your lungs.
You were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea during your hospitalization.
After you change your vancomycin to ampicillin, you will also need to start the antibiotic clarithromycin to treat H pylori infection in your stomach which may have caused the ulcer which was found during your hospitalization.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, problems with your PICC line or any other concerns.
Please follow up with Gastroenterology on [**2146-1-24**] at 12:30 pm to have a repeat sigmoidoscopy performed.
