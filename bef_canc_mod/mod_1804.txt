Her course was complicated by two unsuccessful extubation attempts secondary to stridor.
She reports new onset "throat tightness" and difficulty breathing since this morning.
Labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 5.9 and a BNP of 19,000.
End stage renal disease -On HD -Recently admitted in [**8-/2173**] with pseudoaneurysm at LUE fistula s/p excision.
Complicated by intra-operative hypotension with MC and L ACA watershed cerebral ischemia, and three intubations (intubated for surgery, with two unsuccessful extubations complicated by stridor).
Bronchoscopy did not show any evidence of airway obstruction, edema, or compromise up to the level of the vocal chords.
Vascular dementia s/p CVA -MRA with narrowing diffusely of BL MCA's and left A1 -A+O x1 at baseline 3.
HTN 4.

No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No JVD LUNGS: Listening over her neck, you can hear a high pitched inspiratory and expiratory stridor, which is transmitted to her distal lung fields ABDOMEN: NABS.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Heart size remains mildly increased.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
No large pleural effusions or evidence of pneumonia is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is coarse calcification in the upper abdomen, likely corresponding with calcifications in the pancreas seen on a prior CT abdomen and pelvis from [**2171-5-28**].
Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
CT AIRWAY FINDINGS: Since [**2173-8-16**], pulmonary edema has cleared.
There is no residual ground-glass or interstitial thickening.
Small residual bilateral pleural effusions and dependant atelectasis improved.
Left lower lobe aeration also improved.
Diffuse soft tissue edema is unchanged.
Right thoracic venous collaterals are extensive.
There is no pleural effusion.
Heart size is mildly enlarged.
Coronary artery calcifications are severe and aortic calcifications are mild.
3-mm right middle lobe nodule is unchanged.
3-mm right and left upper lobe nodules are present.
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic elevation except to note small- sized kidneys in this patient known for chronic renal failure and left upper extremity AV fistula.
Limited study demonstrating no evidence of stenosis within the intrathoracic airways to the subsegmental level.
Glottic and subglottic area are not well distended and should be correlated with bronchoscopy.
Inability to assess for malacia due to patient's inability to cooperate with breathing instructions.
Residual small bilateral pleural effusion and dependent atelectasis.
Diffuse soft tissue edema.
Extensive right thoracic collaterals and reflux in the azygos vein.
Patent SVC and stent in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Severe coronary artery calcifications and enlarged heart size.
Sub 4-mm pulmonary nodules.
1)Respiratory distress: The patient was transferred from her nursing home for increasing shortness of breath.
The patient has no history of asthma or COPD and has had several recent intubations.
The initial differential diagnosis included laryngeal injury, including edema or granulomatous inflammation; tracheal stenosis or tracheobronchitis.
The following morning she underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild cervical tracheomalacia, no stenosis, and the distal airways remained patent.
There appeared to be some edema of teh arytenoids likely secondary to acid reflux.
The ace-inhibitor and [**Last Name (un) **] were held given initial concern for angioedema.
