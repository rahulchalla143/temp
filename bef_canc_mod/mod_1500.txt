No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Hypokinesis is more notable in the basal inferior wall.
The right and non-coronary leaflets appear to have minimal mobility.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no apparent paravalvular leak.
There is concentric LVH.
The global systolic function appears mildly improved.
Bilateral pleural effusions persist and may be slightly increasing on the left.
Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the left.
No definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient has a history of COPD and was given nebs and attempted to wean off oxygen.
He sustained no injuries from this fall.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
