Admission Date:  [**2132-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-3-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 42104**] is an 89 year old female with history of 3VD (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI [**9-11**], CHF with EF 20%, 3+ MR, who has refused CABG and caths repeatedly in the past, who presents with rising BUN/creatinine over the past 3-4 days (baseline 1.2, now up to 2.4), and slowly worsening shortness of breath.
Given her creatinine increase her zaroxylyn and lasix were held for the 3 days prior to admission, with a resultant increase in weight by 3 pounds.
She denies CP, palpitations, PND, and no increase in her baseline orthopnea, but mild increase in LE edema.
No dietary indiscretion, no fever, cough, or recent illness.
On the day of admission, the patient was noted to have RR 30 with O2 sat on RA of 68% with mildly decreased mentation.
In the ED, and EKG revealed lateral ST depressions, creatinine 1.6.
CXR revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with decompensated CHF.
NSTEMI [**9-11**], hospitalization complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and intubation and NSVT.
CHF: Baseline 2 pillow orthopnea, chronic intermittent LE edema.
HTN 5.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 42104**] moved to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab a few months ago, and enjoys it there.
Family History: non-contributory  Pertinent Results: EKG: Sinus rhythm Long QTc interval Q's in the inferior leads consider old inferior infarct Poor R wave progression consider probable anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia Lateral ST-T wave changes less pronounced than previous  CXR [**3-10**]: The diffuse perivascular haze greater on the right than on the left has regressed since the most recent study but has not completely disappeared, indicating improved congestive heart failure.
Once again, there is cardiac enlargement in a configuration consistent with a left atrial enlargement.
There are mural calcifications of the thoracic aorta.
female with history of three vessel disease (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI 8.04, CHF with EF 20%, 3+ MR, who has repeatedly refused CABG/cath, admitted for respiratory failure in setting of rising BUN/creatinine (baseline 1.2).
Pt's lasix had been held for last week or so secondary to low blood pressures.
She presents with CHF exacerbation.
CHF exacerbation:  Resolved with diuresis and BIPAP support, as CXR with marked improvement, diuresed to -2.5 L since admission, O2 requirement decreased to room air.
Pt did flash again on [**3-10**] AM, thought d/t ischemia with a CK peak of 216.
An ACE inhibitor was held due to hypotension and history of acute renal failure while on an ACE I.  Zaroxylyn was stopped because pt responds to Lasix alone.
Pt likely had NSTEMI on [**3-10**] AM owing to flash pulmonary edema.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient has chronic renal insufficiency with reported baseline creatinine of 1.2, but seems to have been between 1.3 and 1.8 on past admissions.
Acute renal failure thought related to impaired forward flow in setting of CHF exacerbation.
After diuresis and correction of CHF exacerbation, pt's creatinine on discharge was 1.3.
Leukocytosis:  WBC elevated on admission but down to 6.8 on discharge.
There was a concern for infection, possibly superimposed PNA to explain subacute respiratory decompensation 2 days prior to admission.
Pt remained afebrile in hospital.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: NSTEMI CHF EF 20% 3 vessel disease   Discharge Condition: Pt was in fair condition, euvolemic, good O2 sats on RA, normotensive, other VSS.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, lethargy, or weakness.
