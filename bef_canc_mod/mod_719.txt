Open reduction internal fixation both-bones forearm     fracture including segmental radius and ulnar shaft.
History of Present Illness: 54 yo M with a PMH significant for tardive dyskinesia (?
secondary to prolonged Clozapine exposure), bipolar disorder, multiple abdominal surgeries (Roux-en-Y gastric bybass, distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, revision of gastrectomy/choledochojejunostomy), Vit D/Vit B12/testosterone deficiency, and anemia of chronic disease who presents as unrestrained driver in MVC.
EMS found the patient confused and unable to answer questions.
They could not obtain IV access and found the patient to be hypotensive with a systolic pressure blood pressure of 80.
Upon arival he was initially noted to have GCS of 14 with slow speech and was somnolent.
He complained of left forearm pain, nose pain (fracture nose last week with planned surgical repain in [**State 531**] in [**3-14**] weeks), and headache.
For the past several months he has been eating very little secondary to nausea and has had occasional tongue swelling with taste amplification.
He was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 39346**] for altered mental status and confusion.
Remeron and Trileptal were tapered out of concern that these medications could be contributing to his altered mental status.
Since the patient has no indication for being on Trileptal with the exception of a possible history of basilar migraines, we conferred with his psychiatrist who agreed that this medication was unnecessary and could be contributing to the patient's falls.
Also, a neurology note from [**2162**] stated explicitly that the patient did not have basilar migraines.
Prior notes have also felt like there was a large functional component to his neurologic deficits.
Also it is likely that the patient's numerous  psychotropic medications in the setting of his leukocytosis have been attributed to his unsteady gate.
A series of labs were sent off for the workup of a toxic metabolic syndrome or a nutritional deficiency which could cause a peripheral neuropathy.
At that time, the patient described persistent teeth grinding, abnormal movmements of the face and tongue, and slurred, high pitch speech that worsens at the end of the day.
The patient also reported abnormal leg movements with give-way weakness throughout his legs.
At that time, he had recently stopped tetrabenazine , which had worked well in the past, due to insurance changes.

CT C-spine: No fracture or malalignment CT Torso: No intrathoracic or intraabdominal injury Plain Film Forearm: Dispalced segmental fracture of the radius and fracture of the mid-to-distal ulna.
Plain Film of Hand: Minimally displaced transverse fracture of the proximal middle finger phalanx with volar displacement of the distal fracture fragment.
Orthopedics consulted for the fractures in his left forearm and he was taken to the operating room for repair of these injures.
Postoperatively he was noted to have significant swelling and was monitored closely for compartment syndrome.
His compartments on exam did remain soft and the swelling decreased significantly with elevation using  a stockinette attached to IV pole.
His right middle finger fracture was evaluated by Hand Surgery.
His finger remained splinted while discussions for operative repair were underway.
Occupational therapy was consulted for splinting of his extremities.
He was taken to the operating room again on [**2162-4-23**] for repair of his finger fractures and nasal fracture (of note, was an exacerbation of an old nasal fracture and elective repair had been scheduled prior to this injury).
He was bronched prior to extubation and purulent secretions were found.
His chest x-ray at that time showed bilateral atelectasis with mild hilar congestion.
He was noted with pain control issues postoperatively and was initially started on MS Contin with oral Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Because of some mental status changes felt likely from the narcotics these were stopped and he was started on around the clock Tylenol and standing Ultram.
He was also seen by Physical therapy given his history of frequent falls.
