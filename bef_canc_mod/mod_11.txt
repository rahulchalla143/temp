Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs. symptomatic tachycardia.
Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1 conduction.
On hopital day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia when lopressor was added).
Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of Pneumonia.
Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by respiraotory.
An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.

He was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3, his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an appropriate bump in his hematocrit.
He was noted to have [**Known lastname **] guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his trach/mouth.
His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient, and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for trace blood.
He is maintained on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.
He should be restarted on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.
His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer.
Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and continued on DSD for sacral wound.
