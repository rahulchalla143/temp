Over the course of the day she slowly developed epigastric abdominal pain associated w/ nausea and ultimately emesis.
She denied fevers, chills, cough, or diarrhea.
In the setting of abdominal pain on exam and leukocytosis, a CT abdomen and pelvis was performed with contrast which ruled out on preliminary read an acute process.
For her anion gap acidosis she was started on an insulin gtt for treatment of DKA and given IVF 4L NS and started on vancomycin and zosyn for her elevated lactate.
Had second primary [**Doctor Last Name **] level IV in [**2138**], s/p wide excision with no sentinel node procedure.

# Metabolic Acidemia: Pt had AG metabolic acidosis upon arrival to MICU, most likely [**2-13**] to DKA considering history of uncontrolled blood glucose.
AG metabolic acidosis could also be [**2-13**] lactic acidosis given her elevated lactate of 4.4 (now downtrending to 3.0).
Her elevated lactate may be associated with pt's DKA or associated with potential toxic ingestion of salicylates (pt currently taking Aspirin).
Given that bicarb may worsen the hypokalemia and hyperosmolarity observed in DKA, bicarbonate was avoided in empiric treatment of lactic acidosis.
# Hyperglycemia/Insulin Dependant Diabetes:  Pt had a blood glucose of 547 upon transfer to the MICU as well as an AG of 36.
#Leukocytosis: The patient was admitted with an elevated WBC of 22.4.
The patient had no clear source of infection (clinically afebrile with negative blood cultures and negative abdominal CT and CXR).
=================== TRANSITION OF CARE: - Pt had leukocytosis during hospitalization, no suspected infectious focus: please recheck CBC at PCP appointment, and follow up blood cultures - Pt needs more diabetes education (possibly reusing lancets for fingersticks)  Medications on Admission: INSULIN PUMP (HUMALOG INSULIN) MOEXIPRIL [UNIVASC] - 15 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day SIMVASTATIN ASPIRIN [BABY ASPIRIN] MULTIVITAMIN WITH MINERALS PYRIDOXINE [VITAMIN B-6]   Discharge Medications: 1. moexipril 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
5. simvastatin  Oral 6. pyridoxine  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your white blood cell count was also higher than normal, but we found no sign of infection and your white blood cell count has decreased over the past two days.
Please attend the follow up appointments listed below with your primary care doctor and your [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes physician.
