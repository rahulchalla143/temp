Admission Date:  [**2125-9-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-9-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-12-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  66-year-old male with history of tracheal stenosis status post multiple T-tubes, dilatations, and ablations, history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of pulmonary effusion in [**1-/2125**], history of seizure disorder, history of adrenal insufficiency, who recently was discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2125-8-30**] secondary to removal of left main stem bronchus stent.
Granulation tissue had overgrown causing obstruction of stent and retention of secretions, necessitating removal.
On Friday, [**2125-8-30**], patient continued to cough with minimal hemoptysis.
Overnight from Friday to Saturday patient's hemoptysis and cough increased with copious secretions and blood with phlegm being coughed up.
Cough now severe and persistent enough that patient began having left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Only has abdominal pain with cough.
Also complaining of shortness of breath but denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills, as well as headache.
Post tracheal stenosis status post multiple T-tubes, dilatations, and ablations.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
PE in 01/[**2125**].
Status post pacemaker for complete heart block.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair.
History of Pseudomonas sepsis.
History of MRSA bronchitis.
History of C. differential infection.
Multiple abdominal injuries and lower extremity injuries.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Reflux sympathetic dystrophy.
Has a history of three-and-a-half-pack-per-year smoking; stopped in [**2121**].
General: Alert and oriented times three, pleasant male in moderate distress, well developed, slightly overweight.
Oropharynx: Blood tinged with small clots in lower pharynx.
Neck: Supple; no lymphadenopathy; no jugular venous distention appreciated.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Decreased breath sounds on the left; decreased fremitus on the left; right clear to auscultation.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis; edema present in both lower extremities.
Hemoptysis:  It is very likely that cause of patient's hemoptysis was a consequence of recent stent removal that he had not too long ago.
Likely the patient might have had a mucosal tear as a consequence of the removal or some mucosal irritation.
Lovenox and Coumadin were held overnight for procedure.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit secondary to the hypoxia.
He had bronchoscopy done inside the MICU which showed a small left main tear with large amount of purulent secretions that were evacuated on day of procedure.
Hypoxia:  The following day after admission the patient was noted to have a seizure with development of chest pain, tachypnea, shortness of breath with sats dropping to 85% on nasal cannula.
Patient was changed to face mask then without success, and then changed to a nonrebreather.
EKG at time was taken and noted to be normal with no ST elevations or depression.
Patient's chest pain subsided with sublingual nitroglycerin but developed pleuritic chest pain and continued to desat while talking.
MICU stay was complicated by hypotension and oliguria which were treated with fluids and pressors.
Patient's hypoxia was secondary to atelectasis of left lung secondary to mucus plug or blood clot.
Bronchoscopy showed a large mucus plug causing the atelectasis.
CT of airway showed mucosal tear.
Gout:  Patient was continued on his Allopurinol without any acute flares in house.
No other seizures were noted.
Fungal infections on feet:  Triamcinolone and Fluconazole were continued while in house.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient's desaturation were a consequence of the atelectasis caused by the large mucus plug found in the left main stem bronchus.
Otherwise there was no clinical or radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.
Heme:  Hematocrit was stable throughout stay with no further hemoptysis noted by day two of admission.
ID:  Patient maintained low-grade temperatures for two to three nights which resolved two days prior to admission.
Patient was noted to have a peak white blood cell count of 14.2 with evidence of gram negative rods on bronchi-alveolar lavage growing out Pseudomonas and Staph aureus.
Patient was initially started on piperacillin, tazobactam, and gentamicin for treatment with a notable reduction of white blood cell counts and back to normal after two days of treatment.
Sensitivities at that time were pending and subsequently antibiotic regimen was changed to Ciprofloxacin and Cefuroxime which adequately covered both organisms, Pseudomonas and staph aureus.
Visual spot:  Patient developed a spot in his right visual field seen only with right eye.
Visual fields were grossly intact to confrontation with no other deficits.
