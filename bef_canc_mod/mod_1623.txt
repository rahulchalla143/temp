Admission Date:  [**2112-3-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-3-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-2-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented initially to [**Hospital **] Hospital with approximately one week of "heartburn-like" symptoms that started on the left side of her chest and radiated across to the right.
She denied associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.
She came to the emergency department when she had three hours of unrelenting pain at rest, for which she took indigestion medications but failed to gain relief.
At [**Hospital **] Hospital, she ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction with positive troponin, initially 1.4, then 15.7 and then coming down to 8.4.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q myocardial infarction and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties times two.
Chronic bronchitis.
Seizure disorder of unclear etiology:  The patient had one episode approximately ten years ago and had been taking Dilantin since then until about one month prior to admission when the patient self-discontinued her medications.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
She had a sister with coronary artery disease.
She was comfortable and in no apparent distress.
There was no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy and no thyromegaly.
The patient had good inspiratory effort without crackles or wheezes bilaterally.
S1 and S2 were normal with a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and right upper sternal border with radiation to the axilla.
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds and no guarding or rebound.
In the extremities, the patient had trace pedal edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
The skin was warm and dry with no rashes.
On neurological examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three without any focal neurologic deficits.
After returning to the floor from cardiac catheterization, the patient did have some transient but prolonged episodes of bradycardia and hypotension, most likely secondary to a vagal response.
The electrocardiograms and serial enzymes showed no evidence of in-stent restenosis or active ischemia.
Subsequently, the patient did have two sustained but self-terminating runs of asymptomatic tachycardia with stable blood pressures that, on analyzing the rhythm strips, most likely represented atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
With upper titration of her beta blocker, she did not have recurrent episodes of this rhythm.
NEUROLOGICAL:  In the setting of the patient's previously mentioned hypotensive episodes, she developed some question of seizure activity.
A head CT scan was performed emergently and showed no acute intracranial process.
The patient's symptoms resolved with return of normal blood pressure.
She was loaded on phenytoin at that time and started on a standing oral dose because of her previous but uncertain history of seizure activity.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Per the patient's family, the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleeds in the past with negative endoscopies, but we were not sure at which time.
The patient developed some bright red blood per rectum after her cardiac catheterization while on Integrelin and her hematocrit dropped from 40 to the low 30s; this was stable after discontinuation of Integrelin.
The line tip subsequently grew out mixed flora.
The fevers resolved on their own and there was no clinical evidence of active infection, so we did not treat her with antibiotics.
