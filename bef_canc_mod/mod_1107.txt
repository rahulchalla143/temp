Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 87276**] for SBP requiring ex-lab with adhesion lysis, c/b post-op ileus.
During that admission, she also underwent ERCP for removal of biliary stent [**7-24**] that was placed one month earlier for PSC - post-removal imaging showed normal CBD/CHD and right hepatic duct with known stricture.
On [**7-29**] patient developed fever, chills, nausea and emesis after a meal, with no associated abdominal pain.
On [**7-30**] (day she went to ED), continued nausea, fever and new RUQ abdominal pain.
She was sent by ambulance for ocnern of intra-abdominal process.
Exam notable for peripheral edema, RUQ discomfort.
She was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 80's, recieved 2L IVF, central line placed and started on levophed for concern of septic shock.
CTA chest with pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe segmental arteries.
On the floor, patient with minimal discomfort.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis status post hemicolectomy in [**2194**] Primary sclerosing cholangitis, dx by MRI in [**3-/2199**]; recent labs  include CEA =2.4 (wnl), CA [**07**]-9 <0.8 (negative) SBO [**6-/2199**] s/p exlap, incisional hernia repair and adhesion lysis c/b post-op ileus ERCP removal of biliary stent COPD Hypertension Glaucoma Small left cavernous carotid aneurysm detected in [**2198-1-19**] GERD Osteopenia Status post hysterectomy s/p cholecystectomy '[**71**] s/p left ankle tendon transplant and calcaneal osteotomy '[**84**] Mixed right parotid tumor resection '[**85**] Cataracts s/p surgery  Social History: She does not smoke or drink alcohol.
Physical Exam: Upon admission: Vitals: T: 96.3 BP: 104/51 P: 75 R: 25 O2: 94% 4L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear, no thrush Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: decreased air movement, otherwise CTAB with no wheeze or rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: minimal discomfort in RUQ with pain more localized toward mid-axillary line.
soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, recent surgical scar intact with no sign of infection.
GU: + foley Ext: edema in bilateral lower extremities to knee, warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
no palpable cords.
Puklmonary emboli within the left lower lobe segmental arteries, visualized despite suboptimal bolus due to hand injection through central line.
Additional smaller emboli may also be present.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Irregular intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, compatible with history of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Compared to [**2199-7-20**], there is likely no change in this process.
Left renal cyst.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
No free fluid or free air, abscess, or other postoperative complication status post recent lysis of adhesions.
Micro: [**7-30**] Blood cxs x2: No growth  Labs at discharge: [**2199-8-3**] 06:36AM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-3.05* Hgb-9.5* Hct-28.4* MCV-93 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.4 RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-282 [**2199-8-3**] 06:36AM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-4* Creat-0.5 Na-136 K-3.7 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: 82F with history of ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis status-post biliary stenting, COPD admitted with acute cholangitis and found to have an acute PE  #Acute cholangitis: Patient was initially admitted to the ICU for hypotension and was fluid resuscitated and required transient vasopressor support.
Surgery and GI were consulted who felt that no intervention was necessary as acute cholangitis was probably related to recent ERCP and further intervention would only increase infection risks.
Additionally, it was not felt that cholangitis was due to any focal stricture/obstruction.
#Hypertension: Given initial hypotension and infection the patient's Lisinopril was held during hospitalization and not restarted upon discharge as she was not hypertensive while hospitalized.
Patient was instructed to follow up with her PCP as she will likely need to have her lisinopril restarted once infection is completely resolved.
#Left carotid artery cavernous sinus aneurysm: Patient had been evaluated by Neurosurgery previously for evaluation of aneurysm and was found to have a 7x6mm carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Case was discussed with the patient's Neurosurgeon who felt that risk of rupture was very low and that if rupture occurred it would occur in the cavernous space and not the brain.
Therefore, it was felt that the benefits of anticoagulation outweighed the risks and that the risk of recurrent/worsening PE was higher than an aneurysmal bleed.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute cholangitis Acute pulmonary embolism Primary sclerosing cholangitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were also found to have a blood clot in your lungs and are being treated with anticoagulation medication.
Your INR on discharge was 1.5  You also have some residual swelling from the IV fluids you received.
