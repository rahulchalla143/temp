The patient has history of end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without contrast.
CT ABDOMEN: There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There appears to be inflammatory stranding and slight wall thickening of the transverse colon and hepatic flexure.
A small amount of free fluid is identified tracking around the liver.
There is no free air.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
Moderate hydronephrosis is again identified in the transplant kidney.
A small cyst is noted in the transplant kidney as well.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
CTA IMAGES: There is severe atherosclerotic disease.
Severe atherosclerotic disease especially involving the superior mesenteric artery, but patent mesenteric vasculature.
Inflammatory stranding and slight wall thickening of the transverse colon and splenic flexure consistent with colitis, most likely infectious or related to a low flow state.
Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.
Moderate hydronephrosis in the transplant kidney which is not significantly changed compared to [**2156-11-27**].
RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S.  [**2158-5-2**] 10:07 AM  RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S.  Reason: assess cadaveric renal transplant for clot/occlusion  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54 year old woman with h/o cadaveric renal transplant, now admitted w/ SMA occlusion s/p OR w/ R colectomy, now worsening renal function REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess cadaveric renal transplant for clot/occlusion INDICATION: History of cadaveric renal transplant, admitted with SMA occlusion, status post colectomy, now with worsening renal function.
Please assess for clot or occlusion.
Moderate hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney appears approximately unchanged in degree since [**2156-11-27**].
Doppler examination of the transplant kidney demonstrates visibly less venous flow in the periphery of the renal cortex in comparison with the previous examination.
There is no echogenic thrombus within the main renal artery or vein.
Continued slight increase in resistive indices and visual decrease in venous flow within the transplant kidney.
No evidence of thrombosis of the main renal artery or vein.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Colon with transmural infarction with ulceration and serositis.
Mucosal infarction present at distal resection margin.
Mesenteric vessels with mild focal medial calcification.
Ileum, cecum, ileocecal valve, and appendix, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized..  7.
One lymph node, no malignancy identified.
Brief Hospital Course: From the ED patient was taken to the SICU fairly quickly, intubated, and then taken to the OR for a R extended colectomy & ileostomy/[**Doctor Last Name **] for gangrenous R colon due to SMA thrombus.
She was reintubated on [**5-14**] with NGT and swanz-ganz catheter placement after being brought to unit the day before for shortness of breath and a negative V/Q scan.
Patient was in fluid overload with pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, underwent diuresis and altering of blood pressure medications as her pressures were running on the high end for a significant period of time.
Patient had multiple instances of repeat abdominal pain with elevated white counts in the setting of immunosuppression so KUBs and a few CTs were performed to rule out any obstruciton, abscesses, or acute surgical complications.
She then went back and forth from from cleras to NPO for the next week during intermittent episodes of abdominal pain.
Was eventually on a regular diet for a few days before having to be reintubated gain for respiratory failure.
Elemental tube feeds were started slow only [**5-27**], they were advanced on [**6-1**] when she had no abdominal pain.
#Renal/Electrolytes: Patient had post-op ATN in the setting of a previous kidney transplant.
Continued slight increase in resistive indices and visual decrease in venous flow within the transplant kidney.
No evidence of thrombosis of the main renal artery or veinHad HD at one point.
Later developed hyponatremia and hypercalcemia.
#heme: Throughout her admission, patient received a total of 8 units of red cells for falling hematocrits.
She also received a course of levo toward the end of her stay for E Coli in her urine which will complete on [**2158-6-3**].
#Rheum: Early [**Month (only) **] patient complained of R knee pain - had a gout flair with suprapatellar bursitis.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheeze/sob.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
