STUDIES Chest Xray [**2149-6-27**] FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally.
There is right basilar atelectasis, and a small right pleural effusion.
There is gaseous colonic distention.
There is osteopenia, and exaggerated thoracic kyphosis.
Right basilar atelectasis with a small right pleural effusion.
Acute pulmonary emboli to the right upper and lower lobes.
Right greater than left moderate and small pleural effusions.
Chest xray post PICC [**2149-6-29**]: There is a new left PICC line with tip in the low SVC.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2149-7-2**] Sigmoidoscopy Along the anastomosis site, near one of the staples, a superficial ucler approximately 2 cm without stigmata of bleeding.
No other pathology was noted.
Large amount of debris anterior to the anastomotic site with contrast as well as possibly separated suture material.
No apparent bowel wall can be noted through this section,and he consistent with anastomotic rupture.
Massive amount of free air is apparent.
Edema and wall thickening in the right colon suggestive of congestive hepatic colopathy.
Splenic vein and IMV thrombosis extending into the portal venous confluence.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with h/o colon adenoca, s/p open sigmoidectomy for colonic adenoca [**2149-6-12**], COPD, DM, EtOH cirrhosis, who is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, malaise and failure to thrive.
Hypotension: Patient with slightly lower BP than baseline, which is likely [**2-27**] to acute blood loss given the ongoing blood in the stool and lower HCT despite diuresis at the rehab.
Patient did not have signs or symptoms consistent with infection.
This was felt to be reflective of hypovolemic hyponatremia due to diuretics vs cirrhosis.
Sodium improved with blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
# Pulmonary embolism- Patient was noted to have a new oxygen requirement in addition to CXR findings concerning for PE.
A CT was done which demonstrated submassive PEs in the right upper anterior lobe (4:46) and lateral right middle lobe (4:80) subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
EKG was without evidence of right heart strain.
LENIs showed no evidence of DVT.
# Abdominal distension- On HD 1 the patient was noted to have abdominal distension without associated pain.
KUB demonstarted dilated loops of bowel without bowel wall edema or thumbprinting.
Given recent antibiotic therapy the patient was started on flagyl for empiric coverage of c. diff.
Colorectal surgery was consulted and did not think pt had evidence of pseudo/partial obstruction, Ogilvies or or any other acute abdominal pathology.
His diarrhea improved but he was still having loose stools at time of callout from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt was noted to have copious ascitic drainage from midline surgical incision.
On HD 4 a wound vac was placed in the middle of his incision and continued to drain copius amounts of ascites throughout his hospitalization.
He started having frequent low volume melanotic bowel movements.
Due to the increasing bloody bowel movements, the heparin Lovenox  was stopped and heparin drip restarted.
A nutrition consult was intitated due to poor intake.
Spironolactone was d/c'd due to persistent systolic blood pressures in the 90's.
On HD 7 he was found to be tachypneic and his abdomen was significantly more distended.
An urgent CT was consistent with anastomotic rupture.
