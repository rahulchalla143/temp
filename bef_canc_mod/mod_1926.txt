He now presents to [**Hospital6 2018**] with fevers, change of mental status and generalized weakness for one day.
During his initial presentation he also was complaining of difficulty breathing, swelling on "the inside of his throat" that has been progressing over hours.

History of squamous cell carcinoma of the right basal tongue, status post selective neck dissection on [**2156-4-1**]; 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head and neck examination revealed head normocephalic and atraumatic.
Ear, nose and throat examination failed radiation changes in the anterior and lateral neck, no fluctuance and scar was present.
Heart examination, regular tachycardiac, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Gastrointestinal, soft, nontender, nondistended and bowel sounds were present.
Genitourinary examination revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness, no suprapubic tenderness.
Musculoskeletal extremity examination revealed no spinal or paraspinal tenderness.
Skin revealed no rash and the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Chest x-ray taken in the Emergency Room revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient became hypotensive, 87/40 with continued fevers to 102 and received 7 liters of normal saline and was placed on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.
The lumbar puncture was performed in the Emergency Room and during this lumbar puncture he became dyspneic complaining of neck swelling, throat closure and was taken to the Operating Room for emergency intubation which was unsuccessful secondary to questionable airway edema and emergently had his old closed tracheostomy sites accessed by endotracheal tube and was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit.
Levophed was required transiently for hypotension and one episode of sinus bradycardia to the 30s which was responsive to Atropine.
He was hemodynamically stable since [**5-4**] and was ruled out for an myocardial infarction.
The patient continued to be treated on Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Levofloxacin for presumed postoperative otorhinolaryngology infection, however, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures from admission remained negative and computerized tomography scans of the neck and chest did not reveal any abscesses.
However, the computerized tomography scan of the neck did show some marked edema posterior and of the hypopharynx with a questionable right density versus aneurysm of the right jugular vein versus jugular ectasia but normal flow by ultrasound and no further concern for septic thrombophlebitis.
Vascular Surgery consults suggested likely extraluminal hematoma.
Right Port-A-Cath was removed on [**5-4**] without complications.
Since transfer to the floor the patient has had no complaints and notes a slight sensation of throat swelling but denies any shortness of breath.
He continued to have secretions around the tracheostomy and will continue on antibiotics for a total of ten days.
8 hours prn pain 6.
Respiratory distress 2.
