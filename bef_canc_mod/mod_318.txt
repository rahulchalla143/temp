There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical segments (suggestive of a non-ischemic myopathy).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
Central arterial  pressure was mildly elevated (aortic pressure was 144/95 mm Hg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to markedly elevated filling pressures and two recent determinations of ejection fraction.
Intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs were noted.
Because of the markedly elevated filling pressures, the patient was transferred to the CCU for IV inotropic, vasodilator, and diuretic therapy.
No angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
Severely elevated right sided filling pressures.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
Severely depressed cardiac index.
Known moderately to severely depressed left ventricular systolic function.
CT ABDOMEN [**2104-2-5**]: FINDINGS: CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small right sided pleural effusion which is low in density.
There is adjacent atelectasis within the right lower lobe posteriorly, and atelectasis vs scarring at the left base.
There is density within the right renal hilum near the upper pole which could represent calcification vs a small amount of previously excreted contrast related to the patient's cardiac catheterization.
There is a 6 cm simple cyst arising from the interpolar region of the right kidney.
An additional rounded cystic appearing structure is seen just superior to this within the right kidney, possibly representing a hyperdense cyst, although this is incompletely evaluated on this examination.
There is nonspecific stranding surrounding both kidneys.
The aorta is normal in caliber throughout, with mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
There is no free interperitoneal air.
There is diffuse stranding throughout the mesentery and subcutaneous soft tissues, possibly consistent with congestive heart failure.
CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small amount of fluid layering within the pelvis, and between multiple pelvic loops of bowel.
There is a suggestion of bladder wall thickening at the bladder base, although the dome of the bladder is nonthickened.
Small amount of stranding surrounding the right common femoral artery and vein, possibly consistent with puncture at this location.
A small fluid collection is seen in the left groin, in the region of a left fat containing inguinal hernia.
This could also possibly represent an enlarged lymph node.
BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine without evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Low density ascites without evidence of hemoperitoneum.
2) Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis vs consolidation.
3) 1.6 cm hypodense lesion within the right lobe of the liver, incompletely characterized on this examination.
4) Simple cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney.
An additional cystic structure within the right kidney could represent a hyperdense cyst, although it could be further evaluated with renal ultrasound.
5) Small amount of stranding in the right groin could indicate a minimal hematoma  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 85 year old man with a history of hypertension admitted with biventricular heart failure.
1) CHF: Cardiac echo showed EF of 30-35% with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis and right ventricular hypokinesis consistent with non ischemic cardiomyopathy (cath was normal).
Most likely tachycardia induced or from chronic hypertension.
Patient developed 2:1 heart block on the beta blocker which was then discontinued.
3) Rhythm: Wide complex regular tachycardia: consistent with sinus tachycardia with AV delay and frequent PACs and PVCs.
Patient then developed 2:1 heart block and Wenkebach on beta blocker.
He was then started on a low-dose beta-blocker without difficulty.
4) Coagulopathy: likely from hepatic congestion from CHF.
5) Anemia: Patient had a small post procedure hematoma.
6) ARF: secondary to NSAIDs and diuresis.
