NH staff have also noticed a new left sided weakness.
STAT labs revealed a lactate of 7.4, and given his concurrent SIRS criteria, sepsis protocol was initiated.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12367**] is a 76 year old nursing home resident who presented with a left lower lobe pneumonia who came to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis, was intubated upon arrival, then extubated on [**3-23**], transferred to medical floor.

Of note, due to his aspiration risk, he was evaluated by speech and swallow with modification of his diet as below.
Nutrition:  Patient has a history of dysphagia and there was concern for aspiration.
