Admission Date:  [**2113-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-10-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Paralysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 32 yo woman w/ IDDM, autoimmune pancreatitis s/p pancreatectomy and splenectomy, p/ww acute onset L facial droop, LLE and LUE weakness, and aphasia at 6:30 PM.
At that time, she developed weakness of her left arm and leg.
It is not clear, but shortly thereafter she developed the inability to speak.
In the ED a code stroke was called but a MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**] did not reveal evolving infarct and MRA negative for vascular occlusion.
The pt's weakness was felt to be due to hyperglycemia.
The question arose whether the pt had focal seizures as she had shaking in b/l arm and lef and foaming in front of her mouth at one point.
She aslo reports N and V. She reports blurry vision in the L eye and decreased sensitivity on her left side.
On [**2113-12-24**], the patient was found to have varying neurological exam and there was some concern on the part of the ICU and neurology teams that this was conversion disorder.
Psychiatry was consulted and felt that conversion disorder was unlikely given the lack of recent stressful event.
She still reports weakness in talking.
Past Medical History: - Pancreatitis- s/p pancreatectomy/splenectomy, c/b pancreatic fluid collection s/p catheter drainage, and pancreatic fistula - DMII - PCOS: Dx by clinical symptoms of acanthosis nigricans, obesity, and hirsutism.
Had borderline elevated free testosterone at 2.6 and elevated DHEA at 8.4 one year ago.
- Upper GI bleed: Endoscopy in [**2108**] showed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear and duodenitis thought to be [**2-23**] to NSAID use.
Severe bleeding with some (6+ pads/hr at worst).
- Optic neuritis: decreased vision in L eye - depression w/ previous SI - keloid scarring - s/p tubal ligation - s/p umbilical hernia repair - h/o PPD+, but CXR -   Social History: Haitian-born, youngest of 7 children.
No r/r/w Abd: soft, diffuse tenderness in left mid-epigastrium and lower abdomen without rebound or guarding.
Surgical scar well healed w/ no drainage or erythema.
No focal consolidation or interstitial edema is noted.
There is mild prominence of pulmonary artery again identified, possibly indicating mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
Mild levoconcave curvature of the thoracolumbar spine is identified, likely positional.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-12-21**] 9:20 PM  MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please perform DWI stat to eval for acute stroke  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 32 year old woman with acute stroke.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform DWI stat to eval for acute stroke MRI OF THE BRAIN  CLINICAL HISTORY: Left hemiparesis and aphasia.
If the patient's onset of symptoms is hyperacute there is a small false negative rate, particularly in the posterior fossa and a followup study might be of use.
MRA OF THE HEAD  TECHNIQUE: A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs through the inferior cranium.
FINDINGS:  The distal internal carotid arteries, the distal vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery appear normal.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2113-12-24**] 1:02 PM There is a stable small right pleural effusion.
The liver demonstrates normal enhancement and contour without focal mass or biliary ductal dilatation.
There is stable mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.
No diverticula, abscess or free pelvic fluid is identified.
The urinary bladder, rectum, uterus and intrapelvic loops of small bowel appear normal.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are identified.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Inflammatory stranding adjacent to the sigmoid colon with ovoid focal fat density, consistent with epiploic appendagitis, or less likely uncomplicated diverticulitis.
No evidence of abscess, fluid collections or free intraperitoneal air.
Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 14437**] is a 32yo woman with multiple hospital admissions for history of autoimmune pancreatitis, HTN, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitis who presented with acute onset of left hemiparesis, ?
Her MRI/MRA was negative for infarction and her symptoms completely resolved shortly after admission to the MICU.
There was question if hyperglycemia may have caused this episode as here admission BG was 502.
Once transferred to the general medical [**Hospital1 **] the patient developed Left lower quadrant and left flank pain.
Nephrolithiasis was entertained, but there was no evidence for ureteral dilation and urinalysis was negative for RBC's.
Her pain was controlled with Morphine IR and she was discharged for follow up in clinic in two days.
# Paralysis: very unclear etiology; conversion disorder was considered, but thought unlikely by psychiatry consultation without stressful event as precipitant.
# Left lower quadrant/left flank pain: Epiploic appendagitis by CT, pt was treated with NSAIDS and PRN morphine for breakthrough.
Degree of pain seemed disproportionate to CT finding.
Nephrolithiasis was entertained, but there was no evidence for ureteral dilation and urinalysis was negative for RBC's.
Chronic pancreatitis pain considered, but enzymes were not elevated- though possible in chronic pancreatitis, this seemed less likely given the quality of the pain differed from her usual symptoms.
Optic neuritis in history, but no visual evoked responses noted in [**Hospital **] medical record.
Pt reports history of trauma as a child with low vision in the left eye since.
Possible spinal cord plaques with neuritis possible.
# DM I: Diabetes thought secondary to autoimmune pancreatitis.
Hypergylcemia with BG 502 on admission.
# Depression - Psychiatry recommended starting treatment as inpatient initially with sertraline, then switched to mirtazapine given night time difficulty sleeping.
No symptoms of SI/HI were endorsed by the patient.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 4 days: Take only as needed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for rapid onset of left sided weakness and a critically high blood sugar level.
You later developed left sided pain and we performed a CT scan with contrast of your abdomen.
There was a small amount of inflammation, but no other abnormalities seen.
We treated your pain with ibuprofen and morphine by mouth.
Please call your doctor or 911 if your experience any new fevers, chills, shortness of breath, blurred vision in both eyes, increased urination, increased thirst, new weakness, tingling or numbness, chest pains or any other concerning symptoms.
