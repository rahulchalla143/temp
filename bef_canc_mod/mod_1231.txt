The pain was [**8-27**] started in the center of the chest and radiated to both shoulders.
The pain was associated with dyspnea and felt like pressure.
He took 1 sl NTG that brought the pain from an 8 to [**4-27**].
The pain persisted during the day but lessened.
There he was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was treated with lopressor x 3 and dig x1.
His heart rate was difficult to control and had decreased BP that limited further beta blocker administration.

Patient reports that he has been essentially pain free since leaving [**Hospital3 **] at rest.
Patient reports that the pain is similar in severity and quality to the pain he had during the cardiac catherization this week.
He has been anxious about the chest pain and feels nervous that no intervention was done.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**1-7**] biliary cath check: Gravity cholangiogram through a previously placed biliary catheter demonstrates mild stenosis at the hepaticojejunostomy anastamosis with mild left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mild delay of contrast passage into jejunal loops.
This is likely secondary to postoperative edema at the anastamosis.
No evidence of biliary leak.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 64260**] was admitted to the cardiology service for management of unstable angina along with his new onset atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.
However, on [**2157-1-3**] he developed sharp pain in his epigastric region.
A CT scan revealed new intraperitoneal free air in the setting of recent liver transplant and bile leak with increasing gas and fluid collection with the appearance of a developing abscess in the retrohepatic space.
Because of this he was started on IV vancomycin and zosyn and was taken the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, drainage of the intra-abdominal abscess, resection of the necrotic distal common bile duct and hepaticocholedochojejunostomy.
Initially he was difficult to extubate and went into rapid atrial fibrillation on [**2157-1-4**].
On [**2157-1-7**] he underwent a cholangiogram which demonstrated mild stenosis at the hepaticojejunostomy anastamosis with mild left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mild delay of contrast passage into jejunal loops with no evidence of biliary leak.
The vancomycin and zosyn were discontinued and his diet was advanced without difficulty.
On [**2157-1-8**] he was started on coumadin for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
