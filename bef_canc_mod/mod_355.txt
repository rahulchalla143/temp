He had gained some weight recently (unclear how much), buit the family thinks this was in the setting of his increased appetite.
He did not have any significant edema, and it was unclear if he had any orthopnea or PND.
CXR revealed bilateral fluffy infiltrates c/w pulmonary edema or a diffuse infectious process/ARDS.
Due to increased respiratory distress the patient was intubated.
He was given CTX/azithromycin for possible CAP, and about 1.3L of IVF total.
Initial labs were notable for mildly increased BUN/Cr (Cr 1.1 up minimally from baseline if 0.9-1.0), a normal CKMB of 3, a Tn of 0.01, WBC of 10.1, stable HCT/plts, and a lactate of 1.3.
ECG revealed V-pacing without significant ischemic changes.
The patient is unable to provide information on his review of systems   Past Medical History: -Atrial fibrillation with tachy brady syndrome, s/p PPM in [**2175**], off coumadin -Diabetes mellitus, type II with complications, including neuropathy and [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease -CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**], with recent NSTEMI [**10-9**] -Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease, Left first toe ampuation -Chronic systolic CHF, EF 45-50% [**10-9**] -Orthostatic hypotension -Eye blindness, left eye -Cataracts -Glaucoma -Likely dementia  Social History: Currently at [**Hospital3 2558**].

[**2183-8-26**] CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent of the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions.
The signs of moderate pulmonary edema are unchanged.
Following extubation, lung volumes are slightly lower, exaggerating volume of the already moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.
Slightly smaller right pleural effusion has decreased.
Previous mild pulmonary edema in the upper lungs has improved, but atelectasis at the left lung base has worsened.
No pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary pacer.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Partial left lower lobe collapse secondary to effusion.
[**2183-8-29**] CHEST X-RAY In comparison with the study of [**8-28**], there is continued substantial pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis in a patient with previous CABG and dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
[**2183-8-28**] UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND No evidence of DVT within the left upper extremity.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis/akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-10-18**], apical hypokinesis/akinesis appears to be new.
Brief Hospital Course: 88M history of AF with tachy/brady syndrome s/p PPM in [**2175**] not on AC, DMII, CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI, sCHF with EF45-50% and orthostatic hypotension who presents with increased work of breathing per the wife.
# Respiratory Failure: DDx originally included infectious versus cardiovascular.
Sepsis is felt to be unlikely given normal lactate, no bandemia, and negative U/A.
Infectious source could possibly be lungs, with history of SOB, although collateral history is somewhat vague, per ED the patient did not have any fevers at home.
Was felt to most likely be secondary to a cardiogenic source, given patent was hypertensive on arrival, with SBP in the 200s, as well as a history of HF with an EF <45% with CXR consistnent with pulmonary edema.
ECHO showed a new decrease in EF to 30% with FWM abnormalities.
He was called out to the floor off of a nitrogen gtt, with a plan to increase his blood pressure regimen to prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
The patient was also briefly on HCAP antibiotics, but upon [**Year (4 digits) **] from the ICU was felt to no longer need these medications given a presumed cardiogenic etiology.
Antihypertensive medications were uptitrated and upon [**Year (4 digits) **], he was normotensive with SBP 120-130, appeared euvolemic, with no oxygen requirement.
# acute on chronic systolic CHF, EF 45-50% [**10-9**]: Please see above discussion regarding respiratory failure.
Multiple medications including Carvedilol and Lisinopril initially helped in the ICU, subsequently patient transitioned back onto home Carvedilol and TID captropril (plan to transition back to lisinopril) as well as amlodipine, for BP control.
# Hypertension:  SBP 200s on admission likely contributed to flash pulmonary edema.
# Altered Mental Status - pt self dc'ed lines overnight [**8-28**].
Has baseline dementia and h/o hospital delirium.
- Negative infectious workup to date, afebrile, no leukocytosis, negative legionella, sputum, urine cx, CXR shows stable pleural effusion, LLL lung collapse  # Acute kidney injury - developed [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr 1.4 (from baseline 1.0-1.1) in the setting of aggressive diuresis, remained stable and was 1.4 on [**Last Name (un) **].
# Atrial fibrillation with tachy brady syndrome, s/p PPM in [**2175**]: - Increased carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **], continued Amiodarone 200 mg PO Daily  # CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**], with recent NSTEMI [**10-9**] - Cont ASA 81 mg Daily, Atrovastatin 80 mg Daily - Increase lisinopril to 10 mg Daily  # Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease, Left first toe ampuation and chronic necrotic eschar on left 2nd toe without evidence of infection - Cont ASA 81 mg Daily, Atrovastatin 10 mg Daily - Follow-up with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery regarding possible amputation # Diabetes mellitus, type II with complications, including neuropathy and [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease:  Cont home sliding scale insulin # GERD:  Cont ranitidine # Presumed BPH:  Cont tamsulosin HS # Glaucoma:  cont lantanoprost 0.005% qHS & dorzolamide-timolol eye drops [**Hospital1 **] # PSYCH:  cont sertraline and mirtazapine # General Care - Continue multivitamin - cholecalciferol 800 mg Daily  TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES - Continue aggressive chest physical therapy - Collapse of left lower lobe of the lung is most likely caused by pleural effusion from exacerbation of congestive heart failure.
If it persists, may consider bronchoscopy to rule out obstructing mass or lesion.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
[**Location (un) **] Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 656**], It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent hospitalization for difficulty breathing.
You were found to have fluid in your lungs which is likely because your blood pressure was elevated and your heart could not move fluid effectively.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Continue aggressive chest physical therapy - Collapse of left lower lobe of the lung is most likely caused by pleural effusion from exacerbation of congestive heart failure.
If it persists, may consider bronchoscopy to rule out obstructing mass  or lesion.
