Worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, orthopnea consistent with acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation.
PE was considered - however onset of shortness of breath has been chronic and LENIs were negative.
Pneumonia was considered given patient's initial presentation with hypotension, however patient was afebrile without leukocytosis - patient did recieve Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levofloxacin x1 in the emergency deparment.
Blood cultures were negative, and the patient had no further signs of localizing infection.
Given the initial hypoxia, the patient was given vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin with concern for pneumonia.
Transient Bacteremia vs. Sepsis was a concern given hypotension.
However, the patient was afebrile and had no elevated white blood cell count.
Pt has not missed doses of prednisone.
FAST exam in ED showed no pericardial effusion.
The patient was restarted on his Metoprolol and Lisinopril with no complications.

Pt has known diastolic dysfunction with preserved EF of 55%.
Lasix gtt was started with improvement in blood pressure and renal function.
COP: Patient has significant dyspnea and has been on chronic steroids.
Patient will follow up with pulmonology for discussion of decreased prednisone dosing.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine of 2.4 on admission most likely secondary to heart failure and intravascular depletion.
Stable Angina: Per discussion patient reports central chest pain chronically with exertion.
