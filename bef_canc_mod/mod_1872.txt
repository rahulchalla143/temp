So, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2114-4-4**] to [**2114-4-21**] for a pneumonia that was unresponsive to ceftriaxone.
A bronchoscopy was consistent with eosinophilic pneumonia, and the patient was started on prednisone with good response.
She was discharged to home on [**2114-4-21**] and was doing well without complaints until the evening of admission on [**2114-4-29**], where she began to experience increasing shortness of [**Date Range 1440**] without relief from her inhalers.
She also reports some chest pain and proceeded to activate her lifeline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of CAD status post MI.
End-stage renal disease.
History of recent pneumonia.
She had no JVP.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
She had a [**2-23**] holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Her chest x-ray showed focal mid and lower lung zone opacities, some pleural thickening at the right base.
No new infiltrates or effusions.
Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 130 with normal axis, normal intervals, and some degree of LVH.
In terms of her pulmonary status, the patient was continued on the intubation through the night, but with a goal to wean her to pressure support.
The differential diagnoses for her shortness of [**Month/Day (4) 1440**] included PE, COPD flare, superimposed pneumonia.
A CT scan was obtained of her lungs that showed stable multifocal parenchymal opacities, a small interval increase in the right- sided pleural effusion.
No new focal consolidation or ground- glass opacity to suggest any acute process.
In terms of her cardiovascular status, the patient initially had some elevated troponins, but did not appear to be having any acute coronary events.
She did not experience any episodes of chest pain on this admission, and her cardiovascular signs remained stable including her blood pressure.
