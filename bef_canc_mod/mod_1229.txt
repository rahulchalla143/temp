History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 71867**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 71 yr old male s/p meningioma resection was seen in office for a wound that was leaking clear fluid from bottom [**12-28**] of incision.
At approximately 5pm pt c/o sudden onset headache with N/V.
After dilaudid pt became lethargic and uncooperative- IV Narcan was given and pt became more alert and was oriented.
Head CT was done without contrast as pt has contrast allergy with no obvious signs of collection.
Past Medical History: Meningioma s/p resection, for cyberknife: first seen in ER [**2198-2-25**] with headaches, found to have R parietal mass on head CT.
He was admitted to neurology for brain tumor w/u, with neurosurg consulting.
[**Month/Day/Year 4338**] with multiple lesions in brain.
Stereotactic biopsy consistent with possible grade II meningiomas (though some crush artifact, the MIB-1 was 16%, high for meningioma).
Family History: : father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in 70s, mother with "[**Name2 (NI) 500**] cancer" at 54; sister recently found to have brain metastases from breast cancer.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: WBC: 19.6               Na:138 Hgb: 17.5               K: 3.4 Hct: 50.6               Cl:93 Plts: 156               CO2:28 PT: 11.2                BUN:43 PTT:22.2                Cr:1.2 INR:0.9                 Gluc:140  Multiple BC and CSF cultures x2 negative  Head CT: No obvious sign of infection; further evolution of PCA infarct.
Recommend [**Month/Day (1) 4338**] w/ and w/out contrast  [**Month/Day (1) 4338**]: Persistent enhancement and edema within the right parietal lobe, largely unchanged compared to [**2198-4-2**].
There is no leptomeningeal enhancement, however.
New focus of edema within the right frontal lobe likely secondary to planum sphenoidale meningioma.
Subacute right posterior cerebral infarct.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with  normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area  1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation  is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The  tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If clinically indictaed, a TEE may  better exclude a small valvular vegetation   EEG [**2198-4-24**] This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
This suggests a moderate encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities or medication effect.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2198-5-10**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 71-year-old man with CSF leak, mental status changes.
TECHNIQUE: Head CT without intravenous contrast.
There is persistent right parietal lobe encephalomalacia, consistent with PCA infarct.
Interval unchanged appearance of area of encephalomalacia, consistent with a right PCA infarct, with area of hyperdensity at the periphery.
Unchanged focus of hyperdensity in the left frontal area previously characterized to represent a remnant or menigioma of platinum sphenoidale.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-4-24**] 11:23 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN  Reason: Please check placement of ETT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old man with weakness, recent crainatomy, currently intubated, ETT repositioned.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, with its tip at the level of the stomach.
Low lung volumes, left retrocardiac opacity (atelectasis vs. consolidation) and basilar pleural effusion are again noted, and the left hemidiaphragm is now completely obscured and no longer visible, which represents significant worsening as compared to earlier today at 2:35 p.m.
The periphery of the right lung field is not completely imaged and therefore comparison with the prior area of right basilar atelectasis is not possible.
A calcified lymph node in the aorticopulmonary window is again noted and stable.
CONCLUSION:  1) Interval worsening of the left consolidation/pleural effusion at the left base as compared to earlier today at 2:35 p.m.  2) Endotracheal tube at 4.1 cm above the carina as described above.
No pneumothorax.
3) Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, with its tip at the level of the stomach.
4) Incomplete visualization of the peripheral right lung field, making comparison impossible at that level.
He was intubated on [**2198-4-25**] due to altered mental status and decreased cooperation, pending [**Date Range 4338**].
Revision of scalp wound under general anesthesia occurred on [**2198-4-25**].
Lumbar puncture revealed cloudy CSF and demonstrated increased WBC [**Numeric Identifier 19337**],  RC [**Numeric Identifier 27588**] and elevated protein 276 with normal glucose 55.
There was no growth.
Monitoring progress should include weekly CBC+diff, CRP/ESR, LFTs and Cr with results faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (5) 71868**] (Attn: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] R.N.
After debridement of necrotic wound edges, a rotational flap was used to close the defect over the craniotomy.
On [**4-30**] further debridement of the wound occurred under general anaesthesia and vacuum dressing was applied.
---  There was concern for possible tonic clonic seizure early in admission and he was treated with Keppra.
EEG showed slow and disorganized background rhythm without focal epileptiform activity.
No further seizure activity has been observed.
Extremities: Bilateral UE swelling was noted on [**4-29**] and ultrasound demonstrated right cephalic vein thrombus (superficial) only.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right scalp wound dehiscence and infection requiring skin grafting.
Discharge Condition: Improved to rehab   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers greater then 101.4, chills, or other signs of infection.
Also return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, redness, swelling, or purulent discharge from the incision site.
Return if you experience worsening pain or any other concerning symptoms.
If needed you can take a stool softner such as Colace (one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as Milk of Magnesia) once per day.
Keep scalp wound dry at all times unless otherwise specified by your surgeon.
