On the morning of [**2112-3-25**], the patient was felt to have evidence of increasing oxygen needs from two liters nasal cannula up to 4 liters nasal cannula to maintain O2 saturations.
It became apparent that the patient's fluid status was not being adequately controlled by Hydrochlorothiazide alone and Lasix 40 mg p.o.
She had an episode where her eyes rolled into the back of her head and she became unresponsive.
First arriving physicians reported that the patient had never lost a pulse or respirations and appeared to have had a vagal episode.
The patient was felt to be in respiratory distress secondary to flash pulmonary edema, the consequence of rebound tachycardia from a vagal episode.
Thereafter, the patient was seen by Cardiology Consultation Service who felt that the patient most likely had diastolic heart disease and that it was unable to further image the patient secondary to her obesity.
She was not a candidate for cardiac catheterization or MIBI examination.
She was recommended to have a calcium channel blocker and Lasix and start an ACE inhibitor, all of which was done, and the patient tolerated this well.
Hematologic:  The patient had an ongoing anemia with hematocrits as low as 26 following the Intensive Care Unit stay.
These were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient's source of bleeding was most likely related to her vaginal bleeding as described above and acute illness.
