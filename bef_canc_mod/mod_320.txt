After being tachypnic on NRB and having a arterial blood gas which revealed hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis with mental status changes he was intubated.
10 minutes after intubation his BP's dropped to SBP-60-70's and it was noted his PEEP was gradually increasing, with low tidal volumes.
He was not auto PEEPing; exam was concerning for pneumothorax, so right and left chest tubes were placed, with initial poor return so they were repositioned.
He was empirically treated for sepsis with Cefazolin, Vancomycin, Azithromycin with Albuterol nebs.Sedated with Midaz and Fentanyl.On levophed with SBP-120-130's on transfer to the MICU.

Again seen is biapical scarring and evidence of bullous disease.
There is increased opacity at the lateral right lung base which could relate to underlying scarring and is likely similar in appearance to CT from [**2192-7-8**] scout view.
Bilateral intrapulmonary pleural tubes deep in both lungs, responsible for bleeding into bullae and, on the left, into the lung.
Right lower lobe pneumonia or bloody aspiration.
No pneumothorax,hemothorax or chest wall blood collectio.
Acute, widespread bronchial inflammation.
Granulomatous calcification in liver and thoracic lymph nodes.
No evidence of active infection.
Potential malposition of the newly placed right-sided chest tube in the lung parenchyma, potentially draining emphysematous lung instead of the pleural space.
Removal of the pre-existing right chest tube and of the pre-existing left chest tube.
Massive increase in extent of the pre-existing air collection in the soft tissues suggesting presence of an air leak.
Mild increase in extent of a pre-existing right lower lobe opacity, now accompanied by a small right pleural effusion.
Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged, including some air-fluid levels in bullae at the left apex.
Markedly severe subcutaneous gas and pneumomediastinum, a finding which is progressively worsening since [**2195-2-4**].
Gas tracking along the sites of previous right and left chest tubes, raising the possibility of ongoing extrathoracic air leak.
Redemonstration of right lower lobe and left apical air-fluid levels, similar to those seen most recently.
Redemonstration of bilateral pulmonary consolidation, with slight interval worsening on the left.
Interval increase in the size of bilateral pulmonary consolidations.
Given their location they are most compatible with aspiration pneumonia.
Unchanged right lower lobe and left apical air-fluid levels, an infection can not be excluded.
Mild interval increase in the size of right pleural effusion.
New, small left pleural effusion is seen.
New ascites is identified.
Unchanged hypodense lesion in the head of the pancreas.
CXRAY ON [**2-21**]: FINDINGS: There is moderate amount of right-sided subcutaneous emphysema which is similar in appearance compared to prior.
There is no increase in the pneumothorax.
Bilateral parenchymal opacities are again visualized and not significantly changed.
There were no endobronchial abnormalities.
Thick secretions were aspirated from both lower lobes.
Wire introduction with serial dilation resulted in the straightforward placement of a #8 Portex Per-fit.
Thiw was localized to the RUL  Impression: 78M with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistula.
Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with successful percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, and serial airway balloon occlusion was performed with identification of an air leak from all three RUL segments.
The endobronchial sizing balloon was used to determine the diameter of the apical RUL segment while monitoring for decrease in chest tube leak.
A 7mm intrabronchial valve was placed without difficulty.
The balloon was used to occlude the posterior segment, however no decrease in the leak was noted.
There were no complications.
Impression: 78M w/ persistent right sided bronchopleural fistula and respiratory failure.
Flexible bronchoscopy with intrabronchial valve placement in the anterior and apical segments of the RUL was performed with decrease in the air leak.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 13260**] was a 77 yo M with a h/o COPD (FEV1 22%, 3-4L baseline home oxygen) HtN, Afib who presented with dyspnea to the ED in mid [**Month (only) **].
He was then intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to a long hospitalization course which was complicated by having multiple chest tube placed and developing subcutaneous air leakage, requiring trach placement, pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure and choledolytiasis.
#Hypoxemic Resp Failure- The patient had a pmh significant for very severe COPD on home O2 and he was admitted for respiratory distress leading to hypercarbichypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be related to his COPD.
On arrival the the ED he was initially placed on BIPAP which he continue to be hypoxic and hypotensive, there was a concern for pneumothorax given his hx of blebs on CT scan.
Upon entry of the needle into the thorax, a large rush of air return was noted, however the patient continued to be hypotensive and a needle compression was also subsequently performed on the left.
He remained hypotensive and pressors were started in addition to have bil chest tubes placed.
Likely had right pneumo with potential bleb which burst upon intubation on the right side, potentially causing a bronchopleural fistula.
Possible right lower lobe infiltrate seen on imaging and he was covered with vancomycin and Cefepime.
Left chest tube was removed by thoracics on day # 2 with no pneumothorax seen on subsequent imaging.
Right chest tube was readjusted by thoracics on day #2 and they felt it was placed in the pleural space, even though CT chest revealed possible position in lung.
He ended up being bronch X 2 was negative for bronchpleural fistula and DAH.
He developed a diffused emphysematous air leak that progressively worsen and he ended up having 2 bronhcial valve placed on [**2-16**] with some improvement of the air leakage and subcutaneous air.
He was intially treated with steroids for 4 days because of COPD exacerbation and azithromycin for 5 days, with standing nebs.
pneumonia on the RLL, although there was no bacaterial growth from the cultures or the bronchial lavage.
He was also negative for legionella.
There was some suction trauma in the airways seen on bronch.
There were many attempts to place pt on pressure support for trials of SBT which he failed due to labile BP and agitation.
His agitation and hypertension was thought to be related to ICU delirium, he was then started on Haldol PRN then switched to [**Hospital1 **] dosing of seroquel.
He was restarted on some of his anti-hypertensive medicaitions and he would then become hypotensive.
His PCOs was also very high which he was then allowed to have permisse hypercarbia given his significant hx of COPD which was thought to help his respiratory drive.
Given his sginficant COPD hx w/ recent hx of trach in [**4-/2194**] and failure of SBTs regardless of multiple attempts, he had a tracheostomy and a Peg tube placed by IP.
He developed bleeding from multiple sites including the trach and had visual blood at times in the ET tube.
He also had a repeat bronch that showed some bronchial bleeding.
He also became febrile and hypotensive requiring 2 pressors.
This was thought to be related to sepsis/septic shock.
His antibiotics were then switched from vanco and cefepime which he was on for a 14 day course ([**Date range (1) 21801**]) to tx HAP pneumonia to Linezolid and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] given concern for resistant bacteria.
He had pan culture and repeat chest CT that showed interval increase in the size of bilateral pulmonary consolidations which were most compatible with aspiration pneumonia.
Unchanged right lower lobe and left apical air-fluid levels, an infection can not be excluded and mild interval increase in the size of right pleural effusion and new, small left pleural effusion is seen.
He also had Abd and pelvis CT that showed distended gall bladder with hyperemia and pericholecystic fluid consistent with acute cholecystitis, no definite stone identified.
There was some hyperemia in the liver along the gallbladder fossa as well as hyperemia of the colon along the hepatic flexure, both likely due to secondary inflammation.
This was concerning for acute cholecystitis and the surgical team was consulted.
Their recommendation was to have a percutaneous gallbladder drain placed, however after discussion with the family they did not want to escalate care or have any surgical interventions.
So he was continued on Linezolid/[**Last Name (un) **] and added Cipro which was then switched to Tobramycin and [**Last Name (un) **] given concern for gallbladder/GI related bacteria leading to sepsis.
# SEPSIS: He became hypotensive during his initial presentation, and with ?
Given the severity of his illness and his tenous clinical status he was then started emperically on vancomycin and cefepime.
In addition of the Azithromycin x 5 days for COPD exacerbation.
He had bronch lavage and pan cultures sent which were all negative; however pt persisted with ?
pneumonia on image and he was initially treated for 8 day course of antibiotics which was prolonged to 14 days since his clinical picture was still concerning for infection and he had increase in his WBC and recent procedure with placement of bronchial valves.
On his last day of antibiotics he then developed a significant fever with increase in his WBC to 19 K , hypotension requiring pressors, low urinary out up.
His Tbili: 1.9, Dbili: 1.3, LDH: 6550, IRN 1.8 were also elevated with decrease in his HCT 29 which was initially concerning for DIC or hemolytic anemia.
developement of new pneumonia and CT abd showed distended gall bladder with hyperemia and pericholecystic fluid consistent with acute cholecystitis.
R SC line changed thinking of possible infectious sources.
Surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous drain which the family refused given change in goals of care to do not do any invassive procedures and preeceding his CMO code status.
# Labile BP: He was initially hypotensive which was thought to be related to intubation and high PEEP with potential right sided pneumo and possible sepsis.
He then became hypertensive with SBP at times up to the 200s during awake trials which was thought to be related to agitation and possible pain related to the chest tube and diffused subcatenous air.
His pain was also treated with fentanyl bolus.
He then would have episodes of hypotension post medications.
We had discussed starting on nitro drip for better BP controlled, however he became hypotensive in the setting of sepsis and all his antihypertensives were stopped.
We checked cortisol levels and attempted an ECHO which was unable to give us US image given amount of subcutaneous air in his chest.
#Atrial [**Name (NI) 6233**] Pt had hx of A-fib with RVR.
He was initially rate controlled and as he became septic around [**2-18**] he started having episodes of A-fib with RVR and hypotension.
However he continued to have significant hypotension and Amio was stopped.
# Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine tripled over 3 days in the setting of hypotension and ?
septic shock, likely ATN given hypotension and increase over the last several days.
FeNa 0.98%, consistent with prerenal.
Initially responsive to fluid bolus, he overall became fluid + by 18 L. His UO had been decreasing and became minimal on the day of his death.
Patient with CT abdomen/pelvis showed dialated gallbladder, concerning for cholecystitis, less likely cholangitis particularly in light of fevers and leukocytosis.
?s elevated LFT?????
?s are likely also due to shocked liver during hypotension leading to transient hypoperfusion given the degree of elevation.
Surgery was consulted initially t for question of percutaneous drain placement for the distended gallbladder, which may be a source of sepsis; however family decided to not have any invasive procedures.
We also held Tylenol and other liver toxic medications.
# Anemia/Bleeding: Hct has been stable s/p 2 units PRBC [**2-9**].
No evidence of melena or active GI bleed.
On [**2-17**] and on [**2-18**] pt had oozing from multiple sites including trachea, ET tube, with ET suction, around central line, catheter and rectal tube.
His LDH was up, as well as his Tbil which was concerning for DIC/ hemolytic anemia.
He did not required transfusion and his bleeding improved.
We treated his pain with fentanyl which was then switched to morphine which he appeared much more comfortable on this regimen.
