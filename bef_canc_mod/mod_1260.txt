Pertinent Results: Admission PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2121-12-26**]: A moderate-to-large, laterally and posteriorly loculated left pleural effusion has increased in size relative to [**2121-9-1**], though there has been no progressive rightward mediastinal shift.
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: The size of the large left-sided partially loculated pleural effusion is stable.
There is no cardiomegaly.
There is no new mediastinal shift.
Long-standing large loculated left pleural effusion surrounded by thickened pleura may be due to infectious process, although the long-standing nature of this finding could be the cause of pleural thickening.
Slightly enlarged mediastinal and left mammarian lymph nodes could be reactive to infectious process.
Given the decrease in size over the last four months of this lesion, it is most likely due to a previous traumatic insult, although the intrasplenic infection cannot be excluded.
Further followup with abdominal CT or ultrasound is recommended.
