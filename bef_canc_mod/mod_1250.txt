He was brought to the emergency room today by EMS for seizures at home.
Unfortunately the patient is extremely lethargic due to benzodiazepine administration and unable to provide any history.
I was able to reach his daughter to obtain a history (though somewhat limited by her lack of knowledge of the [**Hospital 228**] medical problems).
He then told them that he thought he was going to have a seizure.
He went on to have a total of 4 seizures in the next 30 minutes.
When they arrived, he was noted to have "jaw clenching" and biting movements.
At this point, he is no longer having clinical seizure activity, but it completely uresponsive.
His usual seizures consist of an aura of left arm tingling followed by left sided shaking or generalized tonic clonic seizure.
He has also been noted in the past to have a post ictal Todds paralysis on the left.
Per his daughter, he has been feeling well, no complaints of fever/chills, cough, n/v, cp, palpitaions or dysuria.
She does not know if any changes in his medications were made.

Mild atelectasis is also demonstrated within the left lung base.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax is present.
HEAD CT, [**11-7**]: There is again noted a large old porencephalic CSF collection in the right parietal occipital region which communicates with the right lateral ventricle and is secondary to sequela from old hemorrhage.
There is again noted a small left pons infarct which is also unchanged.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or edema is identified.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise intact without evidence of acute cerebral infarct.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68 year old man with a past medical history of 2 strokes, left parietal occiptal and right occiptial and a secondary seizure disorder, who presents with series of partial complex seizures, with secondary generalization.
Seizures: The patient was not noted to have any obvious precipitating factors for his seizures.
On exam, he was mildly ataxic on finger-nose-finger and had some nystagmus on lateral gaze.
He notes no other symptoms of dilantin toxicity.
Given his renal failure, we will not use higher doses for now.
No focal motor seizures were noted during this admission, but the patient described an episode, lassting minutes, during which he had the feeling of the TV getting real big, himself becoming very big, and seeing all as "blood red".
CV: The patient was ruled out for an MI by cardiac enzymes.
Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 1.3 on the day of discharge.
He received pneumoboots and subcutaneous heparin for DVT/PE prophylaxis.
