Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old female with a history of COPD, on 2L NC home oxygen, HTN, DM, vascular dementia who presents with shortness of breath.
# COPD exacerbation: There is an unclear inciting event.
Initially the patient was on up to 6L NC for oxygenation.
The most likely etiology is scarring but malignancy cannot be ruled out.
# Tachycardia: The patient has episodes of tachycardia which were thought to be secondary to alberterol nebulizers.
She was switched to Xopenex with a decrease in the heart rate.
# Acute kidney injury: On presentation was 1.3 likely in the setting of dehydration.
# Elevated Cr: Cr up to 1.3 from baseline around 1.0 on admission and mildly dry appearing on exam, likely from poor PO intake over the weekend while having respiratory difficulties.
# DM: The patient had elevated blood sugars in the setting of steroids.
