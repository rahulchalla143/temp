ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2151-10-13**]):    NO GROWTH.
Although possibly due to focal atelectasis, an evolving pneumonia in this location cannot be excluded.
[**2151-10-7**] CXR: PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison is made to study performed one day earlier.
Previously described ill-defined right basilar air space opacity is not well seen on the current study and may have represented atelectasis.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is apparent breakage of the most inferior sternal wire.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia on the current exam.
No hardware loosening, periprosthetic lucency, or focal osteolysis is identified.
There is surrounding soft tissue edema and possible joint effusion.
Diffuse osteopenia.
Scattered vascular calcification noted.
IMPRESSION: Status post right THR, without evidence of loosening or fracture.
[**2151-10-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearance of the chest since [**2151-10-8**].
[**2151-10-11**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears mildly to moderately  depressed with nearly global hypokinesis particularly the inferolateral,  anterior and basal inferoseptal walls.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2151-10-13**] PORTABLE CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-9**] and 25: Mild pulmonary edema has almost entirely cleared.
Moderate right pleural effusion persists.
There are no focal pulmonary findings to suggest pneumonia.
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placements continuous from the left pectoral pacemaker.
No pneumothorax.
woman, 4 weeks s/p R total knee replacement with hypotension and abd pain and h/o diarrhea was transferred from MICU to medicine in stable condition.
Patient has elevated lactate, likely due to hypoperfusion, but will keep possibility of mesenteric ischemia in mind.
Pt's diarrhea resolved and remained without diarrhea on medicine service.
Pt's abdominal pain resolved, no possibility of mesenteric ischemia.
consolidation vs fluid overload on CXR.
On exam once transferred to medicine pt had crackles [**12-21**] bases R>L and diminished breath sounds b/l.
CXR did not show focal consolidation more c/w fluid and atalectatic picture.
Pt's sputum stian w/gram + cocci in pairs and clusters and growht w/gram -rods.
Pt responded with Neb tx, improved cough w/guafenesin and on emperic PNA treatment with improvement.
No overt aspiration noted with consult evaluation, but could not rule out silent aspiration.
#Hypotension - Likely [**1-20**] severe volume depletion in the setting of intermittent diarrhea and vomiting x 2 weeks and decreased PO intake.
She was given Toprol XL 25mg PO x1 per NF when called o/n for elevated BP and an episode of desat to 90%RA.
#CAD - no current CP but pt has extensive cardiac hx inclusing MI x 2 and CABG Her CE were cycled and flat throughout her admission.
#CHF - no peripheral edema and minimal evidence of fluid overload on lung exam initially.
Once transferred to medicine pt was noted to have small b/l pleural effusions on CXR, which got a little worse.
Pt had mild 1+ pitting edema of LE b/l.
On exam pt had diminished breath sounds b/l R>L and had 2 episoded of decreased O2 sats overnight.
Her BB has held initially for mild CHF exacerbation and prior to d/c she was put back on her BB.
Upon transfer to medicine as noted above pt's cardiac meds held and pt became hypertensive.
#Hyperlipidemia - Continued Lipitor .
#Anemia: worked up on previous admission - iron deficiency + anemia of chronic disease.
She was hemodynamically stable throughout her admission, no signs of bleeding.
