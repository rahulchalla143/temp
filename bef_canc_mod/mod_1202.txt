Stable mild left biliary duct dilatation.
There is no small or large bowel obstruction.
Mild amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid is unchanged.
Interval increase in size and number of innumerable enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Atypical glandular epithelial cells in a background of   acute inflammatory cells.
Cholangiograms through the existing biliary catheters as well as over the wire cholangiogram demonstrating mild dilatation of the left hepatic duct and free passage of contrast material into the small bowel through the hepaticojejunostomy.
Two sets of separate brushing samples were obtained for cytology, the first set from left hepatic duct and confluence of left and right hepatic ducts.

Found to have elevated glucose of 757 and be in diabetic ketoacidosis.
No trigger for DKA such as infection or ACS could be found.
Patient with some abdominal discomfort and nausea; and an episode of vomiting prompted holding and then restarting slowly of tubefeeds.
After that, with blood sugar control and symptom management, patient was eating and tolerating tubefeeds on discharge, with pain resolved.
Nutrition: The patient has an NJ tube, feedings were restarted after nausea resolved.
Her NJ tube currently travels down the limb which is closest to the duodenum, rather than towards the ileum, at this point she does not seem to be suffering any adverse effects from this placement.
Her symptoms were monitored during tube feeds and she was eating and tolerating tubefeeds well on discharge.
Likely pseudohyponatremia secondary to elevated glucose as well as hypovolemic hyponatremia given dehydration.
Elevated Alk Phos: Patient with baseline elevated alk phos in setting of biliary drain placement.
Some concern for new source of biliary obstruction or compression that may be contributing to nausea and vomiting and causing recent elevation in alk phos - but this was not verified by imaging or clinical course.
