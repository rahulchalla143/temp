Admission Date:  [**2167-5-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-1-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Levofloxacin / Flagyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**] Chief Complaint: fever, AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 46 y/o female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke complicated by brainstem herniation intraoperatively in an attempt to evacuate the bleed, which has caused spasticity and weakness in all extremities, and seizure disorder who initially presented to the hospital after an episode of acting strangely and projectile vomiting.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER she was evaluated by the neurology consult team, who felt that her symptoms were consistent with complex partial seizures.
Given the concern for seizure at Stat Net EEG was done in the ER that was read as positive, so she was given 3mg of ativan and 1g of keppra and admitted to the epilepsy service.
The neurology consult resident was concerned that she was in complex partial status, and that her sweatiness may also have been due to early infection or opiod withdrawal.
In the setting of her fever she became tachycardic and the neurology team was worried about underlying infection.
They attempted an LP but were unsuccessful due to significant fibrous tissue from prior baclofen pump placement.
A repeat KUB was done given her complaint of abdominal pain which showed nonspecific bowel gas pattern with a moderate amount of stool.
Repeat CXR again showed bibasilar atelectasis vs. infiltrates.
Neurology was very concerned that an underlying infection was the cause of her seizures and requested transfer to the MICU.

Sputum Cx [**2167-5-25**]: [**12-3**] PMNs and < 10 epis, with no microorganisms seen, and no growth.
Overall, there were dozens of seizures and dozens more of briefer (10 seconds) beginnings of rhythmic sharp and fast activity in the left posterior quadrant.
Except for blinking and a bit of head turning, seizures had no clear clinical signs on video.
Limited study due to motion, however, there is no evidence of gross hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.
CXR [**2167-5-21**]: IMPRESSION: Streaky bibasilar opacities which could represent aspiration versus bibasilar atelectasis=.
No large confluent consolidation.
No free air.
CXR [**2167-5-22**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lung opacities are more conspicuous in comparison to prior radiographs from yesterday and in the view of clinical history, concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
EEG [**2167-5-22**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed no seizures although it did have some sharp low voltage fast activity in the left posterior temporal region similar to that at the beginning of the frequent seizures from the previous day.
EEG [**2167-5-23**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background remained of low voltage throughout the recording, with similar frequencies in all areas, generally indicating medication effect.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, and there was no evidence of even the beginning of electrographic seizures noted on the first day of recording.
There is some prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
There is no definite consolidation or large pleural effusions.
Femoral catheter is seen with distal lead tip projecting over the right sacral ala. On the lateral view, there are no compression deformities.
There is no abnormal antero- or retrolisthesis.
There is facet joint arthropathy of the lower lumbar spine.
There is a non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
Essentially unremarkable examination, with no evidence of rim-enhancing or other fluid collection in the imaged lumbar spine to suggest an infectious process associated with the indwelling baclofen pump device.
No pathologic focus of enhancement.
No evidence of spondylodiscitis.
Only mild disc bulging at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels, with widely patent spinal canal and neural foramina.
No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no evidence of an acute ischemic event and no pathologic leptomeningeal or parenchymal focus of enhancement to specifically suggest meningo-encephalitis.
Established cystic encephalomalacia with gliosis, mineralization and volume loss involving the left parietooccipital lobe, with associated wallerian degeneration.
EEG [**2167-5-24**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The record showed a widespread mixture of faster beta activity and some alpha and theta background.
There were no areas of prominent focal disturbance or any epileptiform features.
There were no electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2167-5-25**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed several right hemisphere sharp waves but no overly epileptiform discharges and no electrographic seizures.
The background rhythm was mildly slow when the patient was most alert.
There was also additional slowing on the right side.
EEG [**2167-5-26**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
No clearly epileptiform activity or any electrographic seizures were seen in this recording.
The background rhythm remained slow and was better seen on the right.
This suggests a mild encephalopathy.
There was also some independent focal slowing in the right hemisphere.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular vegetations or abscesses appreciated.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: # SEIZURES: EEG in the ED showed seizures, so the patient received 3 mg lorazepam and 1 g Keppra and was admitted to the epilepsy service.
Given ongoing seizures and concern for underlying infection, the patient was transferred to the MICU.
She was extubated on [**2167-5-25**] and remained without seizures for the rest of her hospital course.
# FEVER/POSSIBLE MENINGITIS: As above, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) plus acyclovir for possible meninigtis.
Lumbar puncture on [**2167-5-22**] showed 210 WBC, however no organisms grew from culture, and HSV PCR was negative.
Cryptococcal antigen, fungal culture, HSV PCR, and Bartonella serologies were negative.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2167-5-27**] and the patient remained afebrile through the remainder of the hospital course.
# SPASTICITY: The patient has spasticity in all extremities, legs greater than arms, secondary to hemorrhagic parieto-occipital stroke in [**2158**], s/p baclofen pump placement in [**2159**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 54184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] ([**Hospital1 2177**] orthopedics - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94375**] or pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94376**]).
# CONSTIPATION: The patient has constipation at baseline and had several days without a bowel movement while in the MICU, leading to abdominal pain and some distention.
A KUB showed no obstruction.
PENDING RESULTS: [**2167-5-23**] BCx [**2167-5-24**] CSF from baclofen pump EEG final read [**2167-5-27**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to be followed to ensure that she does not have any fevers now that she is off of her vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Some people with epilepsy will not need to make any of these changes.
- Wear rubber gloves when handling knives or washing dishes or glasses in the sink.
- Avoid trailing wires and clutter on the floor.
- Pad sharp corners of tables and other furniture, and buy furniture with rounded corners.
- Hang the bathroom door so it opens outward, so it can be opened if you have a seizure and fall against it.
- Set the water temperature low so you won't be hurt if you have a seizure while the water is running.
- Use shatterproof glass for mirrors.
At work: - Consider telling your co-workers that you have epilepsy and the correct first aid for seizures.
- Wear head protection when playing contact sports or when there is a risk of falling.
- Dress, change, and sponge bathe the baby on the floor.
- Move the baby around in a stroller or small crib.
- Explain your seizures to your child when he or she is old enough to understand.
