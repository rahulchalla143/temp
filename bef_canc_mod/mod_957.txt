Patient sent from rehab for fevers and hypotension.
He had a failed L IJ attempt, so a L fem line placed.
A CT head showed was negative for an acute bleed.
Also of note, his EKG showed diffuse twave inversions v2-v6.
Cardiology was called and felt there was no intervention needed at this time.
L cadavaric kidney transplant ([**2152**]) for renal failure [**1-31**] presumed chronic glomerulonephritis 2.
Restrictive lung disease 5.
HTN 6.
Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis 7. s/p L AV fistula 8. hypercholesterolemia 9.
Metastatic Calciphylaxsis   Social History: lives by himself, divorced; no EtOH or tobacco.
Multiple areas of necrosis on extremities   Pertinent Results: on discharge: WBC 18.3 (16 yesterday), HCT stable at 27.4, Plt 434 sodium 143, K 3.9, Chloride 110, bicharb 26, Bun 13, Cr 2.6 Gluc 58, Cal 5.9, ionized calcium 0.99, magnesium 2, phos 3. .
1/4 bottles of blood cultures from [**2172-10-16**] showed coag neg staph .
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted imaging is most sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
Persistent opacification of the mastoid air cells on the left.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
Progression of induration along the collecting system of the left lower quadrant transplant kidney of unclear etiology.
While this may represent progression of postoperative change (i.e.
secondary to lymphatic obstruction), a low-grade liposarcoma with prominence of the renal sinus fat cannot be completely excluded.
Anasarca with increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of ascites.
Focus of hypoenhancement within a prominent spleen as noted on prior which may be secondary to prior infarction/infection.
CXR 10.14: Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary airspace opacities, similar in appearance.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo M with metastatic calciphylaxis and ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic immunosuppressive therapy admitted with fevers and hypotension.
Initially admitted to the MICU with fever & hypotension concerning for bacterial sepsis.
# Altered mental status.
He is NOT to receive any narcotics except for Dilaudid as all other medications (oxycodone, morphine, oxycontin, etc) will make him altered once more given his renal failure.
He was continued on Dilaudid, Neurontin, and Ibuprofen only for pain control.
Please give doses as specified in his medication planning as these prevent profound hypotension.
He was also evaluated by psychiatry on [**10-14**] and found not to have capacity to make his own medical decisions.
# Dyspnea.
Possible etiologies included volume overload, reactive airways (wheezes on exam).
He was found to be volume overloaded given his need for IVF resuscitation with his hypotension.
# Hypotension He has been intermittently hypotensive throughout his ICU stay mainly due to over-aggressive dialysis or narcotic medication administration.
Please take BP from on top of his AV fistual as this may be more accurate.
Significant pain secondary to necrotic soft tissue and his metastatic calciphylaxsis.
Please follow medication recommendations as these were titrated for maximal effect without excessive sedation/hypotension.
# Metastatic calciphylaxis.
Poor prognosis as no known curative treatment.
They recommended to keep his calcium level as low as possible with goal corrected calcium of 8.0 and an ionized Calcium level of 0.8 to 0.9.
Please discuss with nephrology regarding further recommendations to keep his calcium level low.
No acute issues currently.
# Renal Failure.
S/p failed renal transplant.
When his BP stabilized, he was transitioned to HD with intermittent ultrafiltration to remove excess volume.
# Diabetes.
No flu shot given for concern of initiating calciphylaxis.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Dilaudid 2 mg/mL Solution [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) mg Injection q3hrs: Hold for sedation and please hold prior to HD to avoid hypotension .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Altered MS/confusion due to iatrogenic narcotic overdose Fever/Hypotension Dyspnea due to volume overload ESRD on CRRT/HD Necrotic skin wounds  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypotension ESRD on HD Metastatic Calciphylaxsis   Discharge Condition: Stable to be discharged to rehab   Discharge Instructions: Please follow up with his nephrologist after you are discharged from the hospital.
His blood pressure runs low - SBP 80-100.
