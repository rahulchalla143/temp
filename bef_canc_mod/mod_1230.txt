He was fatigued, lethargic then had chest pain relieved by nitro and passing flatus.
At OSH, EKG showed afib with RVR and received digoxin and lopressor.
He had TWI anterolaterally during afib which persisted while in sinus.
Stress on [**12-24**] showed mild fixed apical defect and decreased EF so he was planned for cath on [**12-27**].
Cath on [**12-27**] showed prox LAD calcification with occlusion of D2 and occluded mid RCA.
During intervention on the D2, the guidewire appeared to cause dissection of the artery and there was extravasation of blood seen on cath.
The patient experienced CP so was started on nitro gtt.
Echo was perfomed which showed no effusion.
The following day the chest pain had completely resolved and a repeat Echo showed only physiologic effusions.
