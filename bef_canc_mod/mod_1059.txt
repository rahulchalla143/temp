Admission Date:  [**2153-6-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-7-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis x 2 EGD Blood transfusion x 4 units   History of Present Illness: 78 yo male with CHF, severe TR, cardiac cirrhosis, multiple episodes of GIB secondary to AVM's who presented to the ED on [**6-29**] for routine paracentesis.
He complained of dyspnea and was found to be have a hct of 18 and melenic stool on rectal exam.
He noticed increasing abdominal distension and tried to schedule a paracentesis (he routinely gets at least 2 per month) but was unable to, so he came to the ED instead for the procedure.
In the ED, rectal exam revealed dark, guaiac positive stool; he refused NG-lavage or placement of central line or peripheral IV's.
He denied lightheadedness or dyspnea, his SBP's were initially in the 110's but drifted down to the 90's, and his ECG was unchanged.
He also denies recent f/c, uri, chest pain, dyspnea (though has had orthopnea for past few weeks), n/v/d, melena (stool is always dark from iron), hematochezia, or urinary sx.
Paracentesis was peformed with removal of 4.8 liters of serous fluid.
Family History: Mother- HTN, ?died of MI; Father-83 yo and died of "old age"; no FH of cancer  Physical Exam: PE: T 98, BP 100/60, HR 70, RR 18, SpO2 97% on RA Gen: pleasant, chronically-ill male, fair function, non-toxic, NAD HEENT: anicteric, op clear with dry mucosa Neck: distended ej's that fill from above, not below, no lad, no thyromegaly CV: rrr, soft s1s2, [**3-6**] llsb systol murmur PULM: no resp distress or accessory muscle use, fair air movement, decreased breath sounds at bases ABD: firm, distended but not tense with positive fluid wave, large  ventral hernia (pt states chronic), mild diffuse tenderness BACK: no cva/vert tendrn, no sacral edema EXTREM: chronic venous stasis changes with scars from previous grafts, no edema NEURO: a&ox3, no focal cn/motor defect  Pertinent Results: [**2153-6-29**] 04:40PM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-1.84*# Hgb-5.8*# Hct-18.2*# MCV-99* MCH-31.7 MCHC-32.0 RDW-22.9* Plt Ct-272 .
Compared to the prior study, there is persistent pulmonary congestion with blunting in the the left costophrenic angle again noted and persistent fluid within the right horizontal fissure.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild to moderate CHF.
TTE [**2153-6-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with prominent free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and fail to fully coapt.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-9-30**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular cavity size have increased and global left ventricular systolic function is slightly worse.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is similar.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis with success.
*Jejunum: Flat Lesions Several small angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the proximal jejunum, mid jejunum and 3rd/4th portion of *Duodenum.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Impression: Angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum and 3rd portion of duodenum (thermal therapy).
Brief Hospital Course: 78m with cad, chf, tr, cardiac cirrhosis, reccurent avm-related gi bleeds, cri here with increasing abominal distension, fatigue, and a hct of 18. .
1) Anemia:  Patient is chronically transfusion-dependent secondary to multiple AVM's.
Bleed is known to be slow and chronic, and patient maintains symptomatic and hemodynamic tolerance of low hematocrit.
There, he refused multiple interventions, including foley to monitor u/o, NG-lavage, and peripheral IV's, stating he's aware that he may become very ill or die without these interventions.
2) Cirrhosis with ascites:  Patient routinely requires paracenteses bimonthly due to rapid reaccumulation of fluid in the setting of right heart failure.
Spironolactone was recently discontinued due to hyperkalemia during previous hospitalization.
A therapeutic paracentesis was performed on [**6-30**] with removal of 4.8 liters of serous fluid and no complications.
Given residual ascites and persistent abdominal discomfort, a second paracentesis was performed on [**7-2**] with removal of an additional 3 liters of serous fluids.
3) Cardiac: (a) Pump: Patient with known right side CHF, and as a result, much of his total body fluid likely contained within the abdomen.
This reflects increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular cavity size with slight worsening of global left ventricular systolic function.
(b) Vessels:  Patient with known CAD and slight troponin leak of 0.26 in the setting of severe anemia.
This leak was consistent with known baseline.
ASA has been held indefinitely in the setting of chronic bleed.
(c) Rhythm: Continue amiodarone for rate control.
Anti-coagulation contraindicated in the setting of high bleeding risk.
4) Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine ~1.2 was at baseline during this hospitalization, improved from previous hospitalization.
He was started on Bactrim for UTI, but this was disconinued after urine culture returned with no growth.
6) Hypothyroidism: h/o thyroid goiter s/p thyroidectomy.
Medications on Admission: 1) Amiodarone 200 mg daily 2) Levothyroxine 150 mcg daily 3) FeSO4 325 mg daily 4) Pantoproazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] 5) Digoxin 125 mcg 3x/wk (MWF) 6) Furosemide 120 mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Nursing Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia Chronic GI bleed secondary to arteriovenous malformations Recurrent ascites Right heart failure Severe tricuspid regurgitation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with ascites (collection of fluid in your abdomen) and lower extremity swelling.
You underwent an EGD with cautery of several blood vessels.
Given your history of heart failure and swelling, you should weigh yourself every morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you weight increases by 3 pounds or more.
