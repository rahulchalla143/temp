HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, last dialysis Friday, coronary artery disease, CHF with an EF of 40%, presents with acute shortness of breath with gradual onset.
The patient had gone out to dinner and eaten a meal that was not consistent with her usual low-salt diet and felt that she had an increase in peripheral edema following her Friday hemodialysis.
She experienced orthopnea without chest pain, lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring of acute CHF exacerbation.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
Coronary artery disease, status post RCA stent in [**8-6**] with thrombus, re-stent stenosis in [**10-6**] with NSTEMI.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral femoral-[**Doctor Last Name **] and left fem-tib bypass.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General: Uncomfortable on mask ventilation, in no acute distress.
Chest:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiac: Regular rate, I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen:  Soft, positive bowel sounds, obese, nontender, nondistended, no organomegaly.
There was 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Left upper extremity fistula with bruit and thrill.
Chest x-ray consistent with CHF, pulmonary edema, consolidation at left lower base with bilateral small pleural effusions.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 91, normal axis, normal intervals, Qs in III, T wave inversion in III, hyperacute versus peaked T waves in precordial leads, ST depression, 1 mm in V5 and V6, and I which were new.
IMPRESSION:  The patient was admitted to the MICU with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and anuric who presents with shortness of breath.
Given the patient's prior significant coronary artery disease, continued on aspirin and Plavix and monitored with serial enzymes to rule out an ST elevation MI given positive troponins.
The concern was cardiac etiology for her CHF exacerbation rather than dietary indiscretions.
The patient was dialyzed on hospital day number one with resolution of her shortness of breath, continued to monitor troponins which reached a peak of 0.2.
Given her prior cardiac history, a TIMIV was obtained which revealed new inferior reversible defect.
The decision was made to take the patient the patient the Catheterization Laboratory where there was a discreet 80% lesion in the OM2 with a Taxol-eluding stent placed and a discreet 90% lesion in the RCA with balloon angioplasty and brachytherapy to the area.
The patient postoperatively day number one and two did well without chest pain or evidence of significant volume overload.
In discussion with the Renal Team, it was felt that the patient's dry weight goal could be decreased and to be further monitored as an outpatient, hemodialysis continued, calcium acetate and Nephrocaps as well as strict fluid and sodium restrictions.
No acute changes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  There are no medication changes with the exception of an increase in the patient's Zocor to 20 mg p.o.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with PCP in one to two weeks as well as Cardiology in one to two weeks to assess for weight, volume status, to continue on outpatient hemodialysis t.i.
