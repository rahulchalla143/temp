The patient reports that on Sunday (4 days prior) she began to feel weak, shaking chills and total body aches.
She reports that the symptoms progressively got worse.
The patient had spiking fevers (Tmax: 104.8) while in the hospital.
They also performed a TTE that showed vegetations on the mitral valve.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she started reporting having HAs, she then had an acute decline in mental status and was found to have ICHs on CT of head, likely from septic embolic and complicated by her uremic coagulopathy and ITP.

with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Large bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages in bilateral frontal lobes and left occipital lobe with surrounding edema and fluid/fluid levels.
There are subarachnoid hemorrhages bilaterally, but worse on the left.
Tiny hemorrhage of the left thalamus and possible tiny hemorrhage of the left cerebellum.
Accentuated [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation and effacement of some sulci suggestive of diffuse edema.
[**6-15**] Echo - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild mitral regurgitation.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has decreased.
[**6-18**] CT abdomen - Limited evaluation of the lung bases demonstrate bibasilar opacities, consistent with airspace disease.
There are no focal liver lesions.
This is nonspecific, but differential considerations could include small cyst or hemangioma.
In the region of the splenic hilum, again seen are several densities, which represent splenules or varices.
There is no evidence of cholecystitis.
There has been bilateral nephrectomy.
There is a small amount of free fluid inferior to the liver.
As before, there are several prominent lymph nodes within the pelvis, such as a right iliac chain node measuring approximately 10 mm in short axis diameter.

No intra-abdominal abscess.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
A small amount of free fluid is identified.
There is no evidence of cholelithiasis.
Within the gallbladder neck, there is a small curvilinear hyperechoic structure without shadowing which may represent a fold or a tiny polyp.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholelithiasis.
[**6-19**] Ct of head FINDINGS: There has been interval evolution of multiple large bilateral parenchymal hematomas, without change in size, surrounding edema, or mass effect, consistent with evolution of hemorrhages.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
There continues to be present sulcal effacement and S-shaped midline shift.
Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of bilateral parenchymal hemorrhage, without change in size or associated mass effect.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, along with the strikingly prominent dilatation of the main pulmonary artery trunk indicating chronic pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 30 yo F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD (T, Th, Sat), HTN, anemia, sickle trait, with multiple [**Hospital1 18**] admissions and recent MSSA endocarditis (tx w/ vanco until [**5-14**]) and osteomyelitis with BKA admitted for S. aureus bacteremia.
Had ICH likely secondary to septic embolic and underlying coagulopathy.
Continues to have improving mental status, being treated for endocarditis with cefazolin, and is otherwise stable.
# Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage: Pt c/o of new onset left frontal headache at ~10am on [**6-6**].
The patient did not have any focal neurological findings.
The patient continued to c/o headache after dialysis and it did not improve with tylenol or dilaudid.
The patient had increased blood pressure during the night refractory to treatment.
The patient also began to have a nose bleed and a stat head CT was performed that showed large bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages in bilateral frontal lobes and left occipital lobe with surrounding edema.
There were also subarachnoid hemorrhages bilaterally.
The ICHs were likely due to septic embolic from endocarditis and underlying thrombocytompenia and uremic coagulopathy.
# S. aureus bacteremia: Pt was transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital ([**6-4**]).
Pt had blood cultures drawn at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] that showed MSSA bacteremia as well as a TTE that showed vegatation on the mitral leaflet.
ID was consulted and continued vancomycin 1gm at dialysis pending sensitivity results.
No cultures were positive.
Because no source of infection was found in cultures or CT scans, [**Month/Year (2) 621**] was switched again to ceftriaxone to cover MSSA on [**6-24**].
Pt has remained afebrile and we will complete [**5-17**] week course of hemodialysis dosed ceftriaxone for endocarditis.
# ESRD on HD: The patient had received dialysis on the day of transfer.
Dialysis was continued throughout her stay through her temporary femoral cath until her last dialysis in which her EJ dialysis cath was used.
She did have some episodes of mild hyperkalemia that was resolved at dialysis.
The patient had no signs of avtive bleeding or bruising.
On [**6-7**] the patient had a acute intracranial hemmorhage.
was also thought to have uremic plts and was given DDAVP x 1 and cryoppt.
Platelets remained low throughout the stay, set an arbitrary goal of >75,000 or active rebleeding before transfusion.
Pt also has history of HIT so did not used heparin at all.
# Hypotension and tachycardia - has several episodes while in the MICU and one while on the floor.
# Nutrition - patient had NG tube placed after ICH and was being fed on tube feeds.
# Pain control - pain control has been an issue for the patient since her mental status improved.
Most of her complaints revolve around her sacral wound.
She also did complain about wrist and elbow pain one day.
The pain resolved and she no longer has limb pain.
She also complains of back pain of unknown etiology.
Our concern is that there may be a central component to her pain due to the hemorrhages in her frontal load.
Pain service was asked, and they recommended restarting her amitryptline, as well as adding gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
# Sacral stage II ulcer - remains stable, not infected.
# Hypotension - had transitory hypotension while in the MICU which was responsive to fluid boluses.
# Abdominal pain - had several days of abdominal pain and had a CT scan and ultrasound that was negative.
Belly labs have been normal except for consistently elevated alk phos.
The elevated alk phos is likely from her bone rather than her liver due to her very severe osteodystrophy secondary to her renal failure.
# Anemia - chronic enema likely from renal failure and other multiple medical problems.
After her EJ placement had an acute Hct drop to high 20s that has been stable since the procedure.
She is afebrile and her vital signs have been stable for about 1-2 weeks now and her mental status has been continuously improving.

aureus bacteria infection found in your blood.
This is conistent with endocarditis, an infection of your heart valve.
No other bacteria grew.
You then stopped having fevers and the infectious disease team decided to just keep you on cefazolin as an antibiotic.
You also had a bleed in your head that was diagnosed on CT-scan.
You are continuing to have pain from your bed sore and your L wrist.
We are trying to control your pain with dilaudid and fentanyl patch.
We need to be careful with your pain medicines so we don't sedate you too much, and because your kidney does not metabolize the medicines well.
You were kept on dialysis throughout your hospital stay for kidney failure from your lupus.
We put in an external jugular catheter for dialysis access.
Pleae return to the hospital for changes in mental status, seizures, increasing pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerns.
Followup Instructions: Pt going to acute rehab facility - will have doctor at next facility who will continue management of care.
