Admission Date:  [**2166-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-2-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-6-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Betadine / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 54453**] Chief Complaint: S/P fall- Pt presenting from OSH after fall with acute renal failure, GI bleed, and aspiration pneumonia.
EGDs on [**2166-2-16**] and [**2166-2-17**]   History of Present Illness: HPI: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for melanoma and esophageal cancern s/p resetion admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-2-16**] with hypotension, renal failure, and a GI bleed.
Pt was found to have striderous breathing and was electively intubated.
He was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for concern of a aspiration PNA on CXR.
They preformed an upper endoscopy which showed evidence of the previous esophago-gastric anastomosis 15 cm from the incisors in the upper third of the esophagus.
There was esophagitis with stigmata of recent bleeding in the upper third of the esophagus.
A single nonbleeding 6 mm ulcer could be visualized in the distal stomach.
It was felt that his infection was secondary to asipraion.
Renal was also consulted given the pt's severe acute renal failure.
He was felt to be very dry in setting of low Hct.
On [**2-17**], pt was much more stable from a respiratory standpoint.
This showed multiple superficial and cratered ulcers in the stomach ranging in size from 3 mm to 12 mm in the body, antrum, and pylorus.
A clot suggested recent bleeding on the 2 ulcers near the pylorus.
He had had no further bleeding and Hct was stable.
Amelonotic melanoma of the left shoulder s/p excision [**2-14**].
The sentinal lymph node was negative for metastatic disease.
SCC of the left ankle s/p excision.
Esophagela cancer s/p resection 2 months prior to admission.
HTN 5.
H/O ATN 7.
H/O multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers  Social History: Pt lives alone at home.
No drugs or tobacco.
Anicteric sclera.
Mildly dry mucous membranes.
No lesions in the oropharynx.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with gas containing structure and density along the right mediastinal border consistent with a a esophagectomy and pull- through.
Heterogeneous contrast is seen within the right lung consistent with aspirated barium.
There is new linear opacity at the left base consistent with atelectasis.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
New plate-like atelectasis at the left base.
No renal masses, stones, or hydronephrosis is seen.
No perinephric fluid collections are seen.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
CT scan ([**2-20**]): CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions, as well as bibasilar atelectasis.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pericolic gutters, right greater than left.
There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
There are no identified pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen.
There is a small area of diastasis of the anterior abdominal wall.
There is evidence of fluid in the soft tissues consistent with anasarca.
No free air in the abdomen.
There are multiple air fluid levels in the rectum and distal large bowel, consistent with the recent history of hematochezia.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There are no pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) Although the colon is not distended with contrast, there are no detected mass lesions.
2) Left pelvic mass medial to the left iliac bone, consistent with a post-op seroma.
The less likely possibilities include a new mass, or sequella of an old hematoma.
3) Left inguinal stranding, likely post-surgical, although a small hematoma in this region is not excluded.
4) Bilateral pleural effusion.
KUB ([**2-20**]): Distribution of bowel gas is unremarkable with gas present throughout the colon and in the rectum and no evidence for intestinal obstruction.
Multiple irregular radiodensities overlie the right lower hemithorax location undetermined but seen in both films possibly aspirated barium.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for melanoma and esophageal cancern s/p resetion admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-2-16**] with hypotension, renal failure, and a GI bleed.
Floor course was complicated by a small amount of BRBPR and increased abdominal pain.
Now with decreased pain.
Pt had an episode of BRBPR in the ED on arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
Following the second EGC, the pt's Hct remained stable and he had no further bleeding until [**2-19**].
At that time, he had a small amount of BRBPR associated with abdominal pain.
He had no further bleeding during the rest of the hospitalization and this was felt to be most likely due to a hemorrhoid.
Abdominal pain- Pt developed abdominal pain and nausea on the morning of [**2-19**].
At that time, his abdomen was soft without rebound or gaurding.
However, that evening, the pt's pain became more severe and he vomiting a large amount of nondigested food and bile.
Pt had mild rebound and decreased bowel sounds.
A KUB was obtained that did not show obstruction or free air.
The following day, the pt recieved a CT of his abdomen following IV fluids and mucomyst given his acute renal failure.
They are significant for surgical changes but did not show a clear etiology of his abdominal sympoms.
By [**2-21**], the pt's abdominal pain was much improved.
Renal failure- Pt presented to the hospital with acute renal failure with an initial creatinine of 9.4.
This was thought to be secondary to volume depletion secondary to dehydration and bleeding.
Renal US on [**2-16**] showed no renal calculi, obstruction, or hydronephrosis.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt was hypotensive and febrile on admission.
He had a CXR which showed aspiration of barium in the right lung.
At that time, pt was started on treatment for probable aspiration PNA with levo, flagyl, and vanco.
His sputum culture from [**2-16**] and [**2-17**] grew methicillin resistant coag positive staph aureus.
The pt remained afebrile and his WBC count trended down during admission.
HTN- Holding all BP meds at this time given recent hypotension in setting of infection and GI bleed.
[**Name (NI) 53769**] Pt with history of multiple skin cancers and esophageal s/p excision two months ago.
Relative [**Name (NI) 104**] insufficient- Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stem test showed a relative insufficiency on admission.
Pt should set bolt upright for all POs, should not use straws, should use chin tuck method, and should not have mixed consistencies.
Of note, pt was initially on a CIWA scale for possible ETOH withdrawal but did not requird any medicaion.
Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **] TCU - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Acute renal failure  Secondary diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia GI bleed S/P fall Esophageal cancer s/p resection Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
