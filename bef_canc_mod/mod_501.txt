**FINAL REPORT [**2202-1-8**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2202-1-8**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2202-1-10**] 9:15 PM  MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for perirectal abscess.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for perirectal abscess.
Evaluate for perirectal abscess.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 30339**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: In the [**2-25**] o'clock position (when viewed lithotomy position, left-to-left/posterior) of the intersphincteric space situated approximately 2 cm proximal to the anus, an area of crescentic high signal intensity is identified on the T2-weighted imaging (series 6, image 26) that measures 1.5 cm AP x 7 mm TV x 1.5 cm SI, with a peripherally enhancing rim, consistent with a tiny abscess too small to drain.
A thin slip of high signal on T2W images (series 6, image 29), with thin curvilinear enhancement extends from this tiny collection inferiorly along the intersphincteric space and along the expected location of the internal sphincter from the 3:00-6:00 location until reaching the anal verge, where there is thickening of the external sphincter on the left side (series 104a, image 27).
It is unclear if this represents a tract, or may be secondary to previous surgery or granulation tissue.
The internal sphincter is hypoenhancing on post- gadolinium images, and indistinct but slightly hyperintense on T2W images, again possibly due to prior surgery.
There is nonspecific edema and vascular engorgement within the perirectal fat.
There are bilateral hydroceles with an inguinal hernia on the left containing some peritoneal fat and fluid.
No evidence of any significant lymphadenopathy.
Small intersphincteric abscess from the 3 to 6 o'clock location (from lithotomoy position) on the left at the level of the levator ani.
No drainable abscess.
Mild hyperintensity on T2W images, mild enhancement, and thickening of left external sphincter along course of previously ([**2198**] MRI) described intersphincteric tract, which may represent residual tract, or postoperative or granulation tissue--correlate with surgical history.
Bilateral hydroceles with left inguinal hernia containing fat and peritoneum.
Nonspecific edema and engorgement of vessels in perirectal fat.
This may be due to hepatic disease and collateral portal blood flow.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 53 yo M s/p liver [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**2197**], pan-cytopenia, splenomegaly who presented with continuous oozing after tooth extraction.
Hospital course by problem below: Thrombocytopenia - platelet count of 69 on [**11-25**].
DIC labs were negative for chronic DIC.
He was also transfused platelets on two occasions, when his platelets decreased below 10.  he experienced only minimal improvement in platelet counts after transfusion, from [**6-3**].
[**Month/Day (1) **] were significant for non-occlusive thrombus adherent to the wall of the main portal, splenic, and the tributaries forming the SMV near the portosplenic confluence.
He was trasferred out of the SICU to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit where he continued to have high outputs via the JP (~ 3 liters) for which he received IV fluid replacements and albumin.
Given that he had a distal pancreatectomy, the JP fluid was sent for amylase.
JP drainage trended down to 40 by [**2-4**]  Bacteremia: Patient developed fever and leukocytosis on [**1-5**].
He was treated empirically for a neutropenic fever with cefepime.
A source of his bacteremia was thought to be from a perirectal abscess identified on MRI.
He remained afebrile while on cipro.
A MRI was done noting small intersphincteric abscess from the 3 to 6 o'clock location (from lithotomoy position) on the left at the level of the levator ani.
On [**1-24**] CVL was d/c'd for low grade temps.
An abd CT was done revealing partially walled-off fluid in the left upper abdomen with air locules, interval progression of nonocclusive thrombus in the portal system, to a greater degree in the splenic vein and left portal vein, moderate left pleural effusion, and left nephroureteral stent in stable position, with moderate dilatation of the left renal pelvis, which has progressed from the prior study.
A CXR demonstrated L lung base atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.
Upsizing of left abdominal drain as described above without immediate complications.
Pull back study through track failed to demonstrate track communucation with the left thorax or left pleural effusion.
He was discharged home on Vanco, flagyl and Levaquin with indefinate duration pending resolution of fluid collection.
He did complain of some loose stool which was sent for c.diff x 2.
#) Hypertension -diltiazem and atenolol were continued at 25mg daily.
Lower leg edema persisted.
#) Diabetes - Glargine was discontinued due to persistent low glucoses.
Kcals were ordered for poor po intake and supplements were ordered.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
