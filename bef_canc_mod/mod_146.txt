No acute intraabdominal pathology including no evidence of bowel ischemia.
Their imaging appearance is nonspecific, however, given the patient's history of multiple intestinal AVMs, this appearance could be compatible with multiple hepatic AVMs.
IVC filter, left common iliac venous stent, and left external iliac venous stent in unchanged position.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F with DM2, HTN, chronic anemia and chronic GI bleeding presenting with recurrent GI bleeding resulting in acute blood loss anemia, s/p transfusion, EGD and colonoscopy with thermal therapy treatment of stomach and cecal angioectasias.
She was found to have mild acute renal failure with acute blood loss anemia (Hct 15 down from 28 1 month prior).
She was admitted to the ICU, received 4 units PRBC's with return of Hct to 28-29 and resolution of her acute renal failure.
Due to severe abdominal pain complaints she had an abdominal/pelvis CT without any signs of an acute pathology.
She underwent EGD and colonoscopy with findings of numerous angioectasias in the stomach and cecum all of which were treated with thermal therapy during the procedure.
She had no further problems, including stable Hct and resolution of abdominal pain complaints (which were probably related to constipation).
The patient has iron deficiency anemia for which she should continue as she was prior to admission on outpatient IV iron repletion/supplementation.
Incidental findings: Multiple hepatic hypodensities, probably consistent with AVM's.
