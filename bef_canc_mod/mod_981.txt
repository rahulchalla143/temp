Admission Date:  [**2116-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-2-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-7-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: fever, vomiting, weakness, dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation   History of Present Illness: 67yo man with h/o esoph CA dx'd [**6-29**] on endoscopy after he presented with dysphagia and hematemesis, s/p chemo and XRT in [**8-5**], s/p esophagectomy [**2115-11-14**], with recovery c/b poor nutrition requiring G-tube placement, who was doing well until 4d PTA when he began to have fevers and dyspnea.
He developed a productive cough with greenish sputum 3d PTA, then began vomiting 1d PTA with his wife noticing [**Name2 (NI) **] streaks in his mucus.
When the streaking became worse on the AM of admit, the patient's wife brought him into the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation.
[**Name (NI) **] wife reports recent URI and feels that the patient may have caught her illness.
In ED, CXR showed RML and RLL infiltrates with persistant small bilateral pleural effusions.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 97.5   116/64   88   28   66% on RA with HOB at 10 deg, 100% on NRB with HOB at 30 deg Gen: thin, elderly asian man appearing older than stated age, in moderate to severe resp distress, with accessory muscle use, unable to speak except in one word sentences HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, MMM Skin: warm and dry Chest: diffuse rales throughout, decreased bs in R lower [**12-29**], no apparent wheezing or rhonchi CV: tachy, regular, soft s1 loud s2 click, [**2-2**] syst murmur at apex, rads to abd Abd: soft, PEJ tube in place, nt/nd, +bs Ext: no c/c/e, no peripheral edema   Pertinent Results: [**2116-1-14**]   Chest PA and Lat: Comparison with [**2115-12-12**].
There is a new air space opacity in the right lower lobe and possibly right middle lobe.
No pneumothorax.
Presently not felt to be related to heart failure as echo with no change in LV function and no evidence of pulm HTN.
Feel that underlying respiratory distress may be related to interstitial pneumonitis.
He initially presented on the floor, but subsequent respiratory distress necessitated transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His respiratory distress was thought to be multifactorial; due to CHF (he was in afib, likely volume overloaded), influenza (tested positiv from nasal aspirate), ?pneumonia, and his underlying lung disease.
They felt that the differential for his interstitial lung disease was UIP, amiodarone toxicity, and BOOP.
Follow up CT scan showed improvement in the ground glass appearance, and he remained afebrile and without leukocytosis.
The irregular rhythm had probably been contributing to his CHF and volume overload.
He remained in normal sinus rhythm after this intervention and had not more problems with volume overload.
In terms of volume status, he should still be kept even with respect to his Ins/Outs, for he gets volume overloaded very easily.
Esophageal Cancer (T3N0M0): He is s/p chemotherapy and radiation in [**6-29**] followed by esophagectomy in [**10-30**].
He failed video swallowing study repeatedly on this admission.
Hypernatremia-He had some hypernatremia while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] which responded to free water boluses.
CV a) Ischemia: he had a small troponin leak while in the unit, likely demand related.
He was aggressively diuresed in the unit (component of volume overload likely contributing to his respiratory distress and requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay).
Upon returning to the floor, he was kept even with respect to Ins/Outs and had no further problems with volume overload.
Anemia: He had somewhat stable Hct in the range of 26-30; anemia was likely multifactorial (anemia of chronic disease).
He failed speech and swallow evaluations on multiple occasions, and had a video swallowing study on [**2116-2-7**] where he failed thin and nectar thick liquids (frank aspiration noted with inappropriate coughing/clearing reflex).
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: [**12-29**]  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
