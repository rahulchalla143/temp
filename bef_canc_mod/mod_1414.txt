Admission Date:  [**2127-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**] Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypotensive, distended abdomen, likely UTI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 69 year old male, who is admitted with atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Patient was recently admitted one month ago for a radical cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and neobladder creation.
Post-operatively, his hospital course was complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR when he was NPO following surgery, at which time he was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] requiring an esmolol gtt.
A KUB demonstrated question of ilieus or partial small bowel obstruction.
Finally, he reported foul smelling urine from his neobladder.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient reported he was doing well and had no complaints.
Specifically he denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
He did report that his abdomen has been more full and somewhat distended after "eating too much--a steak and cheese sub" over the weekend.
He denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
As noted previously, he did not take medications after discharge and did not follow up with any physicians - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, discovered at time of cancer diagnosis [**10/2126**], difficult to control post-operatively [**2-24**] - High-grade invasive transitional cell carcinoma - Osteoarthritis of ankles   Social History: As noted in the chart, patient is married and lives with wife in [**Name (NI) **].
No history of illicit drugs.
Father died in early 70's from asbestosis  Physical Exam: On admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress, appearing slightly uncomfortable, moving around in bed HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no conjunctival pallor, slightly dry mucous membranes, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: Irregularly irregular tachycardic, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB anteriorly, no W/R/R ABD: Soft but mild to moderately distended.
No tenderness, +BS.
No fluid wave or shifting dullness.
No guarding or rebound tenderness.
Full ROM of ankles, no erythema.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Imaging: [**2127-3-26**] Abdomen X-ray: IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for small bowel obstruction .
There is moderate hydronephrosis, bilaterally.
There is no evidence of renal calculi or cortical masses.
Within the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a hypoechoic lesion with increased through transmission consistent with a simple cyst measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm.
No evidence of renal calculi.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder who was initially transferred to the ICU from the floor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate: Since his surgery last month, his rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].
Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF.
He reported he was aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Given HR increasing to 130s-140s with activity once transferred to the floor (not orthostatic), pt was given IV digoxin again given concern for poor po absorption in the setting of his colitis.
Prior to discharge, pt was having several 2 second pauses while sleeping (this could be due to sleep apnea, increased vagal tone), but heart rate would still go up into the 130s with little activity.
He was completely asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and refused to stay in the hospital any longer for titration of his medications.
After discussion with urology, it was felt he likely had a soft tissue infection of his neobladder based on description of his urine, urine analysis, and fevers.
# Hypotension: It was felt that the patient's hypotension was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR and poor forward flow.
In addition patient appeared volume depleted at time of admission.
There was also concern for developing sepsis given leukocytosis, fevers, foul smelling urine and urine analysis consistent with infection.
No chest pain or EKG changes to suggest ischemia.
# C diff Colitis/ Distended abdomen: Initially there was concern for possibly developing partial small bowel obstruction or ilieus, however he continued to have flatus and move his bowels.
He began to develop loose stools and a c. difficile toxin assay was positive.
He continued to have abdominal cramping and then nausea.
His abdominal examination remained benign, although he continued to have gas cramps and loose stools.
KUB appeared benigin on [**3-31**], and he was given antiemetics for his nausea (likely due to flagyl).
His antibiotics were changed back to IV in the case of poor GI absorption and once afebrile for 48 hrs, po antibiotics were resumed.
Will continue cipro for UTI and flagyl for C diff .
# CAD: No active symptoms, no acute EKG changes.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0.
Although his BUN was not as high as would be expected for pre-renal etiology, suspect that volume depletion and poor forward flow while in AF with RVR, with possible development of some ATN in that setting.
A renal ultrasound demonstrated mild hydronephrosis, which per discussion with urology is expected after neobladder formation, although a bump in creatinine is not typically expected.
# Ankle pain: Patient reports this is chronic secondary to arthritis.
# Anemia: Stable HCT since last admission (32.8), suspect secondary to losses from prior urologic surgery, chronic disease state with concurrent malignancy.
# Elevated total bilirubin: Noted on admission, however returned to baseline.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for arthritis pain.
Disp:*20 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate hypotension acute renal failure C difficile colitis Klebsiella UTI   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and found to have both a urinary tract infection and GI infection (C diff colitis).
You also were transferred to the ICU for poorly controlled heart rates and low blood pressure.
You also were given vicodin to be taken if your arthritis pain is severe.
Call your doctor or return to the ER for any fevers, worsening abdominal pain, diarrhea, dehydration, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
