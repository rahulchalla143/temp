Admission Date:  [**2155-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-3-22**]   Service:  Acove  ID:  This is an 89 year old male with questionable pneumonia, chronic pleural effusions and dehydration.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old male (Russian noncommunicative) with multiple medical problems who initially presented with vomiting and loose stools as well as dyspnea at his nursing home and was admitted to [**Hospital 517**] Medical Floor for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
While on the floor the patient became hypotensive and was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
Antibiotics were discontinued given decreased white count, no fever and no copious sputum production, arguing against active pneumonia.
However, Flagyl was continued for possible Clostridium difficile infection given that the patient was having continued loose foul-smelling diarrhea.
The patient also has chronic pleural effusions with an increase in interval size.
End stage renal disease secondary to nephrotic syndrome on hemodialysis started in [**2154-6-30**]; 3.
Atrial fibrillation times nine years; 4.
Questionable history of Clostridium difficile; 8.
History of hepatitis B; 9.
History of aspiration pneumonia; 10.
Bilateral hydroceles times eight years.
General appearance, awake, in no acute distress, noncommunicative.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, slightly dry mucous membranes.
Lungs, decreased breathsounds at the bases with no rales or wheezing.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities, contracted lower extremities bilaterally with no edema and scrotal edema present (chronic).
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, hypertension and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was transferred to the Medical Floor in medically stable condition from the Intensive Care Unit status post resolved hypotension with intravenous fluids, questionable pneumonia treated with three days of Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl as well as a chronic left pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.
Pulmonary - Questionable pneumonia was treated with three days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
Initially a left lower lobe opacity versus atelectasis versus chronic effusion was visualized on chest x-ray.
The patient has been afebrile without sputum production, therefore after three days of broad spectrum antibiotics, all antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient did have a history of aspiration pneumonias.
During the rest of the hospital stay the patient remained afebrile with normal white count.
In addition the patient has had a history of chronic pleural effusions which had an increase in interval size since previous films.
Pleural fluid studies revealed no PMNs, no microorganisms and fluid cultures were negative for infection.
This is most likely secondary to volume depletion from loose stools and resolved upon resuscitation with intravenous fluids.
In addition the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with good rate control using Diltiazem as well as Lopressor and Digoxin.
No significant events were found.
The patient has not been on anticoagulation due to the history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
Renal - The patient has a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Initially there was some trouble with catheter access but the access issues will be dealt with as an outpatient.
Gastrointestinal - The patient has reportedly had a history of diarrhea for the past few months per nutritionist that has been following him.
Initial decrease in hematocrit was likely secondary to intravenous fluid resuscitation.
The patient will return to [**Hospital6 1760**] for usual dialysis schedule.
