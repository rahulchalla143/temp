His other concerns are fluid overload and acute on chronic renal failure.
Bubble study was negative for intracardiac shunt A wound VAC was placed to the abdominal incision after completely opening the incision and Vancomycin was started x 3 days.
Right leg cellulitis was noted on admission and this improved with the Vancomycin.
With mild volume expansion, the ARF appeared to be resolving and all diuretics continued to be held.
On [**7-11**] he underwent paracentesis for increasing abdominal pain.
No organisms were seen on gram stain and the fluid culture was reported as no growth.
Renal consult service was recommending the initiation of hemodialysis as his creatinine which initially decreased to 3.3 by HD 5 was increasing daily in the ensuing days.
The patient was transferred to the medical service on [**2151-7-15**] with the hepatobiliary (West 1 team) following abdominal wound and VAC changes.
On [**2151-7-16**], the patient was in respiratory distress with tachypnea and sat-ing at 95% on 5 liters of oxygen.
This was secondary to fluid overload secondary to liver and renal failure.
Paracentesis with ultrasound was attempted at the bedside, but very little fluid could be removed.
Fluid was sent for fungal cultures.
Hemodialysis line was placed by IR in anticipation of hemodialysis for fluid overload.
Hemodialysis did not provide any relief of respiratory symptoms and the patient remained in a great deal of pain with respiratory distress.
