Admission Date:  [**2140-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, hypothermia, mental status changes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] is a 56-year-old male with progressive MS who has had multiple admissions in last year for ?sepsis, pneumonia and UTI (has had suprapubic catheter in place since [**1-25**]) who presented on [**2140-11-2**] with questionable mental status changes, hypothermia and hypotension in setting of overnarcotization.
Per wife, had [**Name2 (NI) 15618**] baclofen pump 6 days prior to admission, then downtitrated again 4 days prior to admission, after which patient appeared somewhat sleepy, but without acute changes.
On the day of admission, SBP at home was initially in the 130s, but then after bathing and numerous activities with home health aide became hypotensive to 80s.
Per wife, no fever, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting occurred (PCP notes that wife has noted the patient intermittently hypotensive at home, but no log brought in here.
CXR showed diffuse worsening pulmonary edema and an opacity in the left lung base that could be confluent edema or an early focus of infection.
Upon transfer, patient was experiencing sharp pain in his lower extremities bilaterally from his hips to his toes, "the usual pain".
He denied trouble breathing, abdominal pain, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or palpitations.
2) Multiple admissions for hypothermia and ?sepsis .
3) h/o upper GIB (ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis secondary to NSAIDS) .
4) h/o LGIB (Colonoscopy in [**9-26**] revealed internal hemorrhoids and polyp) .
5) History of pneumonia Most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-10-19**] with a final diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia .
6) Neurogenic bladder S/p placement of suprapubic catheter.
8) GERD Likely secondary to ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis secondary to NSAIDS .
9) Hypertension .
11) Left eye blindness  Social History: He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.
Family History: Father had CAD and CVA.
No palpable lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ edema in lower extremities bilaterally.
Could not move lower extremities, and due to extreme pain upon attempt to move lower extremities, did not test range of motion, reflexes, or strength.
Imaging at [**Hospital **] Hospital EKG: Sinus 70, nl axis, no ST T changes, nl intervals .
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) [**2140-11-2**] Diffuse worsening pulmonary edema.
The opacity in the left lung base may be confluent edema although a focus for early infection cannot be excluded.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect.
Note is made of mucosal thickening in ethmoid sinus.
Impression: Somewhat limited study, without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: BP INSTABILITY: Initial hypotension likely due to overnarcotization in the setting of multiple blood pressure medications.
Patient responded well to IV fluids and narcan, and hypotension resolved by [**2140-11-3**].
Patient's blood pressures were elevated to 200/100 and pulse to 110 on [**2140-11-4**], and it was felt that autonomic dysfunction from MS could be contributing to blood pressure lability.
He BP should be maintained between 100-150/60-100 ideally, though any abnormal blood pressure readings should be repeated and he should be assessed clinically.
UTI/NEUROGENIC BLADDER: Patient has had suprapubic catheter since [**2140-1-20**] due to neurogenic bladder; has had a history of UTIs since then.
Urine culture from most recent UTI ([**2140-10-17**]) grew out enterobacter and proteus both sensitive to meropenem, which was begun on [**2140-11-2**] to treat probable UTI given UA results with WBC >50 and moderate bacteria.
Because enterobacter and proteus from [**10-17**] infection were also susceptible to ciprofloxacin, IV meropenem was d/c'd on [**2140-11-4**] and PO ciprofloxacin started for a total of seven days of antibiotics.
Fentanyl patch was restarted on [**2140-11-4**] to help with pain control; other narcotics were held.
UTI and hemodynamic instability were addressed as described above.
His neurontin can be re-started at his neurologists/PCP discretion though his pain was well controlled without it at discharge.
His vicodin was stopped due to mental status changes which resolved.
Evaluated by OT, recommended relief cushion for support, pain relief.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Narcotic Oversedation/hypotension Autonomic Dysreflexia Urinary Tract Infection .
Secondary Diagnoses: Multiple Sclerosis Neurogenic bladder Gastroesophageal reflux disease   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers/chills, worsening confusion, or any other symptoms that concern you.
