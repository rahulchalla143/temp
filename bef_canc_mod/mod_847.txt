[**2106-4-11**] GIB study: IMPRESSION: Single focus of tracer uptake in the right lower abdomen that likely represents a focus of bleeding, the location of which cannot be determined due to its static nature.
[**2106-4-13**] CXR: CONCLUSION: No new focus of pneumonia.
Progressively resolving bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with resolving aspiration pneumonitis.. .
[**2106-4-13**] Colonoscopy: Findings:  Mucosa: Localized superficial ulceration with no bleeding was noted in the proximal ascending colon.
The area was difficult to visualize due to residual fecal material and also, the area was technicially difficult to reach.
There was no evidence of active bleeding.
Impression: Small ulceration in the proximal ascending colon compatible with postpolypectomy site   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  79 yo M with COPD, AFib, recently diagnosed PE, recently admitted for BRBPR in setting of anticoagulation, now presents with BRBPR.
* Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Nuclear study with evidence of static bleeding (RLQ) at unspecified location.
Colonoscopy demonstrated superficial ulceration and small clot at post-polypectomy site, which is the same location as that seen on the red tag cell scan.
Discussed filter, but given that bleeding site most likely secondary to post-polypectomy, agreed with restarting anti-coagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin.
* CAD: during last admission, he was noted to develop anginal symptoms in setting of tachycardia.
* COPD - severe, uses 3L oxygen at home at night - cont prednisone at 25 mg-> tapered to 15 mg [**2106-4-15**] (on bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given long use) - continued monteleukast, advair, tiotropium, and albuterol nebs.

You had a fever while you were in the intensive care unit and the infectious workup revealed that you had infection with C.diff in your stool.
