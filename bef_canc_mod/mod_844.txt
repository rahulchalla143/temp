Diagnostic esophagoscopy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is unfortunate 41-year-old gentleman with Marfan syndrome status post extensive aortic dissection who has had multiple vascular procedures including de-branching of the head vessels which are now fed with new grafts from the ascending aorta and the femoral axillary graft with Endo grafting of the ascending aorta, arch and descending aorta, de-branching of the visceral aorta with static grafting and extra-anatomic reconstruction of both renal arteries, the celiac access and superior mesenteric artery.
About 10 months ago he presented with spontaneous rupture of the esophagus and underwent a very complex repair of the left thoracotomy with primary repair buttressed by gastric fundus and transposition of the omentum.
He recently returned to the hospital with evidence of herniation of the entire stomach into the chest with organoaxial volvulus and obstruction.
Given the prior Boerhaave contamination of the left pleural space it was expected that there may be extensive adhesions and  a transthoracic approach was necessary.
Past Medical History: -Marfan Syndrome -thoracic aortic aneurysm s/p endovascular stent placement to ascending, arch, and descending aorta with right axillary - femoral bypass grafting and reconstruction of innominate and left carotid artery [**3-25**]; s/p visceral debranching procedure & infrarenal aortobi-iliac graft [**6-26**] -Boerhaave's esophageal rupture s/p repair [**11-25**] -aortic dissection s/p aortic valve replacement & ascending aorta replacement [**5-24**] -h/o post-op DVT -h/o post-op A-fib -asthma -GERD -hiatal hernia, s/p hernia repair, -s/p foot surgery  Social History: Denies tobacco.

Luminal irregularity of the distal esophagus in region of fundoplication likely represents postoperative edema.
A very small left apical pneumothorax is again noted.
