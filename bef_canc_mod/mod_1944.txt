#Acute on chronic respiratory failuredue to OSA and COPD: -initially felt to be likely [**2-25**] CHF and COPD exacerbation on underlying severe untreated OSA/OHS.
There was no obvious pneumonia on CXR and pt remained afebrile w/o leukocytosis.
His mental status/somnolence and hypercarbia improved after BiPAP set at 18/10 4L O2.
Looking back at his previous labs, his creatinine has fluctuated up in this range in the past (was 1.9 in [**2195-8-24**]), and no other cause for renal failure was identified.
64yo male with severe COPD on continuous home O2, OSA (in the past has refused to use BiPAP), acquired [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]'s disease associated with MGUS, recurrent GI bleeding, diastolic HF, pulmonary HTN, who presented with dyspnea likely from COPD exacerbation.
# Acute on chronic respiratory failure requiring ICU stay but not intubation - MICU team felt COPD exacerbation main component and started high dose steroids, Abx, nebulized bronchodilators - no evidence of bronchospasm on my exam - am tapering steroids rapidly -D/C levofloxacin - wean O2 to maintain sats 88-92%, down to home flow of 2L/min via NC.
Check ambulatory sats - OSA likely large component - needs to wear BiPAP at night.
# Acute kidney injury -admission creat = 1.0, has been gradually increasing - now 1.8.
-FeNa yesterday = 0.95%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia but creatinine continues to increase despite IV hydration and holding ACE-I -no evidence of urinary retention (PVR < 350) -He was seen in consultation by Nephrology on [**2195-10-12**], and they agreed with trial of IV hydration and with holding the ace-inhibitor and the diuretic.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure -last echo in [**2195-6-24**] showed right heart failure (likely due to chronic lung disease and resulting pulmonary hypertension) but preserved LV function -no evidence of acute HF now - received torsemide inthe ICU with resulting decrease in BNP, but increase in creatinine - on the floor, we held off on further diuresis -there was no peripheral edema .
# Htn: Continue carvedilol.
Lisinopril D/C'd in the setting of rising creatinine .
# MGUS: Patient has been on bortezomib and velcade to treat MGUS-associated VWd and subsequent GIB.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure COPD Obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with respiratory difficulty likely due to poor oxygenation from COPD and obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension.
There may also have been a component of heart failure as well.
Maintain a low salt diet and watch closely for evidence of heart failure (leg swelling, increasing weight, and/or increasing shortness of breath).
