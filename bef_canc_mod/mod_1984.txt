History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] is a 76 year old man with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, ESRD on HD, rectal cancer s/p resection and partial colectmy who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with fatigue and a hematacrit drop noted at hemodialysis today.
The patient has also complained of intermittent nausea and vomiting approximately for 1 hour after meals for about 2 weeks but only would vomit up food; denies hematemesis or coffee ground emesis.
He has noted some lightheadedness and dizziness but no syncopal episodes.
He reports non-radiating substernal chest pressure when nauseous that was often relieved by vomiting; denies associated diaphoresis or dyspnea; chest pressure not worse with exertion.
Denies prior episode of melanotic stools.
Past Medical History: rectal cancer s/p resction in [**2183**] (with XRT and chemo) and [**2189**]; has colostomy hypertension diabetes mellitis (resolved since lost weight w/ CA) end stage renal disease on hemodialysis x 12 years mitral regurg tonic-clonic seizure after HD in [**2190**]; none since Left retinal hemorrhage left temporal meningioma s/p cholecystectomy gallstone pancreatitis h/o AV graft clot [**12/2199**] cataracts   Social History: Retired cryogenic engineer.
Strong family history of DM  Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: T 96.6 HR 106 BP 176/66 RR 23 Sat 100% RA Gen: Pleasant man in bed in no apparent distress.
No cervical or supraclavicalar lymphadenopathy  CV: III/VI HSM loudest at apex, II/VI crescendo-decrescendo murmur radiating to carotids.
Joints: no swelling, no erythema, no warmth.
Since previous tracing of [**2199-6-27**], no significant change .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-7-25**] 11:59 PM IMPRESSION: Left costophrenic angle blunting which likely represents a small left pleural effusion.
No other acute process is demonstrated.
[**2200-7-22**] EGD: Nodule in the middle third of the esophagus Enlarged gastric folds Blood in the stomach Polyps in the duodenal bulb No blood was seen in the duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
[**2200-7-24**] EGD: Enlarged gastric folds vs gastric varices were seen in the fundus.
Polyp in the duodenum A very small nodule vs vein was seen in the mid esophagus.
There was no bleeding.
Blood in the stomach Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2200-7-26**] 11:13 AM 1) Soft tissue mass within the duodenum causing dilatation of the distal common bile duct.
It is unclear, on this examination, if this mass arises from the ampulla or duodenal wall.
Further evaluation of the distal CBD and pancreatic ducts should be performed with ERCP.
4) Findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
6) Incompletely characterized left lower pole renal mass.
ECHO Study Date of [**2200-7-29**] No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Moderate aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-6-24**], aortic stenosis may have slightly progressed.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 76 year old man with Type II DM, ESRD on HD, who present with 3-4 week history of fatigue, 1-2 weeks of "dark stool" found to be severely anemic, with melanotic stools.
ED Course: NG lavage in the ED was notable for pink return with some small clots.
Antihypertensives were initially discontinued, but metoprolol was restarted after an episode of aflutter vs afib with rates in 150s; associated with sensation of chest pain and dyspnea.
Returned to NSR after (Per patient he had a prior episode of afib during AV graft 1 year ago and was cardioverted immediately to NSR).
#GI Bleed: Based on the postive NG lavage and melanotic stools Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t two EGDs to assess for an upper GI bleed.
They revealed fresh blood and clots in the stomach, but no active source of bleeding; large gastric folds vs. varices; and a polypoid mass in duodenum.
Given the potential for gastric varices, an US was performed that demonstrated normal portal vein flow, no evidence of thrombosis; splenic vasculature was not well visualized.
An MRI/MRA of abdomen was subsequently performed which demonstrated normal splenic vasculature, no evidence of gastric varices; a duodenal mass that might be arising from the ampulla of the pancreas; hemosiderosis.
Iron studies were not consistent with hemachromatosis.
# Anemia: likely a combination of anemia of chronic renal failure and blood loss from UGIB.
#CARDIOVASCULAR Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] had two episodes of an arrhythmia.
The first occurred in the ICU, appeared to be atrial flutter and resolved with resumption of metoprolol (which was d/c'd on admission).
The second episode occured on HD#3 and appeared to be atrial flutter with irregular ventricular response and atrial ectopy; it lasted for ~3 hours; metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg TID.
He will be discharged on nifedipine 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 37.5 mg TID and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for BP monitoring.
#Chest Pain/Pressure: Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] presented complaining of substernal chest pain worse after meals and resolving with vomiting with suggested a GI/GERD etiology, however did not improvement after his PPI was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing as an outpatient.
Admission EKG had no new ischemic changes.
He spiked a temperature to 101.8 and was recultured; fever trended downwarded and was afebrile for >24 hours at time of discharge.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
# ESRD ON HD: Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] was continued on his T, Th, Sat dialysis schedule.
Folic Acid  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Upper GI Bleed Anemia atrial flutter controlled with metoprolol deconditioning .
Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic Kidney Disease on hemodialysis H/O Diabetes Mellitus history of rectal cancer s/p partial colectomy x 2 with colostomy Hypertension Mitral Regurgitation Atrial Stenosis h/o gallstone pancreatitis s/p CCY   Discharge Condition: Stable; non-melanotic stools; hematocrit stable; in normal sinus rhythm   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for anemia (low red blood cells) and blood in your stool.
Your blood counts stabilized and the amount of blood in your stool decreased substantially.
One set of blood cultures had a bacteria that sometimes can infect the valves of  your heart.
An ultrasound of your heart (TTE) was performed and did not show any evidence of such an infection.
You should contact your physician or return to the Emergency Department for: -lightheadedness/feeling like you might pass out -worsening shortness of breath or fatigue, particularly with exercise -if you notice blood in your stools or really dark stools -persistent vomiting or if you vomit up blood or your vomit looks like coffee grounds -fevers, particularly >102 -shaking chills -chest pain or chest pressure, or feeling like your heart is racing.
-if you seem confused or less alert than normal or lose consciousness -other symptoms that are concerning to you  Followup Instructions: Please schedule a follow-up EGD with ultrasound performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to evaluate the folds in your stomach and take biopsies as needed.
