Small-bowel obstruction with a transition point seen within distal ileum within the patient's pannus anterior to the pubic symphysis at that level.
Growing soft tissue in the pre-sacral fat is again noted, concerning for recurrence.
Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
Stable bibasilar consolidation, more prominent on the right side could be due only to atelectasis; however, superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded  [**2160-9-2**]:  chest x-ray:  FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increasing signs suggestive of pulmonary edema, notably on the right, which might be caused by a change in patient position.
On the other hand, the opacities on the left have mildly decreased in severity.
There still is a small right pleural effusion with evidence of right atelectasis, as well as moderate cardiomegaly.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting.
Cat scan showed a small-bowel obstruction with a transition point seen within the distal ileum.
He required replacement of the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube for abdominal distention.

His operative course was notable for a large fluid requirement.
Intra-op, he required levophed for blood pressure support.
He had intermittent episodes of hypoxia and his intravenous fluids were discontinued.
His surgical pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA.
On POD #3, he experienced bouts of confusion and was started on his home psychiatric medications, at which time, his [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was removed.
During his post-operative course, he was reported to have bouts of oxygen desaturation to the 80%'s both at rest and with ambulation.
Along with this, he had a decreased urine output and was given intermittent doses of lasix with good results.
On POD #5 his diet was advanced to clears and he was seen by PT who recommended short term rehab.
On POD #6, he had a recurrence of emesis and required replacement of the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube.
He was discharged to rehab on POD #9 with instructions to follow up in the acute care surgery clinic on [**2160-9-18**] for staple removal.
