ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with well healed scars in the presence of the ileostomy and the fistula.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a takedown of his mucous fistula and jejunostomy and placement of a Hickman.
On [**2124-2-28**], he underwent takedown of his jejunostomy and mucous fistula and placement of a left subclavian double lumen Hickman.
He tolerated the procedure well with an estimated blood loss of only 200 cc.
Findings showed multiple adhesions.
Postoperatively he complained of extreme pain despite a patient - controlled analgesia.
A postoperative electrocardiogram was markedly changed from his preoperative electrocardiogram and showed a left bundle branch block.
There were no obvious ST changes.
His cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was consulted and had no further recommendations.
On postoperative day one, he was still complaining of increased pain despite the patient - controlled analgesia, although he states that it was less than prior.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Pain service recommended continuing the patient - controlled analgesia and also restarting the patient on his Neurontin.
On [**2-29**], the patient went into an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Again, he ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Also Vascular Surgery was consulted for his history of coagulopathy and thromboembolism.
An angiogram was performed which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
An abdominal CT scan was also performed which showed evidence of a right lower quadrant collection.
He underwent a repeat abdominal CT scan on [**3-3**], which showed a pelvic collection which was aspirated and sent for a gram stain and culture.
Additionally he was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Vascular Surgery, who recommended coagulopathy work up, starting folate and B6 and B12.
His urine from [**3-1**] grew out Enterococcus and his antibiotics were changed to vancomycin.
Additionally, blood cultures from [**3-3**], grew out penicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, again sensitive to vancomycin.
