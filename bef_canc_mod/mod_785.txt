She's been medically managed on prednisone and had a trial of cytoxan which she did not tolerate due to nausea and vomitting.
Her hypertension has been controlled with enalopril, atenolol, and nifedipine until about 7 days prior to admission when she ran out of medication and for that reason has been non-adherent.
Upon arrival at the ED, she developed chest pain and shortness of breath.
Later, the nifedipine was weaned for a concern of renal insufficiency and a NTG drip was started at which point her systolic blood pressure decreased to 180.

HTN: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a hypertensive emergency, as evidenced by EKG changes, papilledema, and head CT changes.
This was thought likely secondary to a lupus flare, ARF and poor medication compliance.
She was started back on metoprolol and nifedipine, but her ACE I was held for the renal failure.
Titration of these medications on the medical floor and addition of hydralazine did not result in adequate BP control as the patient had several systolic blood pressure readings in the 250s.
Rheum: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has SLE with discoid rash and ARF.
She was also started on plaquanil for 1-2 months for her discoid rash.
Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
This was thought to be multifactorial, from both HTN and an exacerbation of SLE.
Of note, her UA remained somewhat bland, without acanthocytes.
She was also started on mycophenolate mofetil in the hopes of slowing her progression to ESRD and giving her a few months before having to start HD as more permanent renal replacement.
A peripheral smear showed schistocytes, so the Heme service was consulted, however this presentation could also be secondary to a malignant hypertension inducing shearing of erythrocytes and platelets.
Her ARF could be attributed to her hypertension as well.
The patient had 7 plasmapheresis treatments, one of which was complicated by symptomatic hypocalcemia evidenced by abdominal pain.
She was also started on folate and iron for her anemia.
GI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had one episode of hematemesis during plasmapheresis.
With this concern for GIB, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to the MICU where an EGD showed diffuse linear erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding in the stomach body.
These findings were compatible with mild gastritis but did not account for the HCT drop.
