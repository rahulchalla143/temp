Pt with melena and guaiac pos stool.
Per her daughter (history obtained from Attending note) she has been noticing blood in her stools and checked hemoccult at home.
This Am patient had cough and felt jaw and left arm pressure not relieved by SL NTG so called 911. .
They felt that this was likely demand ischemia as no EKG changes and recommended medical management, BB with goal HR in 60's, SBP>90's, start lipitor.
On the floor, the patient denies chest pain or arm pain, admits to a small amount of jaw pain.
Denies also, abdominal pain or discomfort.

HTN 7. hx of bilateral DVTs and saddle embolus in [**2190**], had been on warfarin.
Anemia, due to renal failure and anemia of chronic disease, on procrit weekly 10.
LUNGS:CTAB no w/r/r HEART: RRR, soft II/VI SEM at base of heart nonradiating, and III/VI SEM at apex.
EXTR:left ankle with large soft-tissue swelling over lateral malleolus, mild TTP.

# GIB: Patient has history of GIB and has refused EGD and colonscopy in the past.
Her Crohn's disease was diagnosed in [**2176**], disease mainly distal small bowel with possible strictures by a SBFT.
Last colonoscopy [**2187**] showed normal mucosa but active colitis by biopsy.
Had another Flex Sig at OSH with active disease (no records available).
Bleeding is felt to be intermittent hematochezia at home but no diarrhea, abd pain or distention.
The patient received 2 units pRBCs and was transfused to hct>30 given evidence of active ischemia.
GI felt initially that patient would need [**Last Name (un) **] versus SBFT/CT scan, but could be done as an outpatient in addition to better managing her Crohn's medications and mesalamine and prednisone were continued during admission.
Then pt experienced several episodes of BRBPR with a drop in hct once again and she was brought to flex sig which found no evidence of bleeding in the distal colon, although there was a section of colitis.
Patient improved clinically with IV steroids, had one further episode of melena, hct stable.
# NSTEMI: No EKG changes but troponin peaked at 1.2.
This was attributed to demand in the setting of anemia from the GI bleed.
Regardless, patient is refusing catheterization to cardiology who saw her in the ED and continued to refuse on the floor, understanding the risks of not intervening with catheterization (possible risk of continued ischemia and possible death).
We attempted to start metoprolol, but blood pressure and heart rate did not tolerate it resulting in a brief transfer to the MICU in the setting of hypotension and bradycardia which resolved with holding beta blockade.
Transfusion goal was HCT >30 by ACS protocol, ECG showed no ischemic changes and TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and preserved ejection fraction.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline Cr 1.5-1.8.
Likely pre-renal due to hypoperfusion in the setting of GI bleed, improved with transfusions.
# Anemia: Has baseline anemia now worsened with GIB.
