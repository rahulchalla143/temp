Admission Date:  [**2149-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-9-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses PICC line placement Transesophageal Echo Video swallow evaluation Paracentesis   History of Present Illness: This is a 76 y/o male with a h/o pancreatic CA s/p modified Whipple [**2146**], e.coli bacteremia complicated by recurrent liver abcesses in [**3-3**] and [**5-31**] treated with drainage and Cefepime/Vanco x5 weeks, who initially presented to an outside hospital on [**8-8**] with fever, dysuria, fatigue and difficulty ambulating.
Found to have a drop in Hct to 25, WBC of 20.9, was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
Found to have e.coli bacteremia originally treated with Levaquin, although strain was resistant and this was switched to CTX 1g QD on [**8-11**]; later increased to CTX 2g qD on [**8-13**].
A RUQ U/S obtained on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for abscesses vs malignant nodules, with MRI not more helpful in delineating the two.
In regards to his hct drop on admission, he was transfused 3u pRBC and GI was consulted who felt it was related to chronic anemia as well as in the setting of sepsis and marrow suppression with recommendations only to tx to hct >28, and obtain OSH records regarding previous colonoscopies.
Pt remained stable until [**8-14**] at 7pm when he had a large volume bloody BM on the floor.
He was admitted to the MICU for monitoring  Of note, he had been started on a heparin gtt 2 days prior due to an upper extremity DVT; however, his heparin gtt had been turned off for the 24 hours prior due to a ?
liver biopsy of the above lesions.
Acute Renal Failure at OSH in DC [**5-/2149**] 4.

Focal opacities in the left mid zone.
-([**8-9**])CT head w/o contrast: No intracranial mass effect or hemorrhage is identified.
-([**8-11**])PA/lat CXR: There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
The right effusion likely has a subpulmonic component.
-([**8-11**])U/S LE b/l: No left or right lower extremity DVT study.
Two predominantly cystic heterogeneous lesions within the right lobe of the liver showing characteristics more concerning for metastatic disease.
Gvien history of bactermia and prior liver abscess, an abscess is difficult to exclude.
Strongly recommend MR for further characterization.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate ascites.
Multiple rim enhancing necrotic lesions within the liver parenchyma with overlapping characteristics of abscesses (hyperemia) and necrotic metastases (rounded hypervascular mass in segment V).
- ([**8-15**]) TTE: The LA is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function (LVEF 60-70%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve or mitral valve.
-([**8-18**]): Redemonstration of liver abscess in right inferior lobe of liver.
- -([**2149-8-23**]) Abnormal MRI: :  Several areas of slow diffusion with enhancement in the brain as described above are suspicious for septic emboli.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Mild interval decrease in size of liver abscesses.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation to suggest obstruction of the biliary system as an etiology for the patient's liver abscesses.
Of note, the MRCP images are markedly limited due to patient's inability to hold his breath and a small stone in that region cannot be excluded on this study.
Large loculated collections of ascites within the abdomen which appear to have thick enhancing rims, although assessment for enhancement is limited on this study.
This raises the concern for peritonitis and a cytological tap is recommended to further evaluate.
-([**8-28**]) TEE: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic  arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are  seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No vegetation or abscess seen.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 52006**] presented to a [**Hospital6 **] with what was thought to be an acute hct drop to 25 and e. coli bacteremia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment and further workup.
RUQ U/S on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for abcesses vs. metastases.
He received a CT guided drainage of one liver abscess and drain placement on [**8-15**] -> growing klebsiella resistant to cetriaxone, enterococcus and yeast.
No malignant cells were found on abscess biopsy.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
He had two other liver nodules also drained by IR, last on [**8-19**].
Secondary to this ,antibiotics will need to be continued for 6 weeks with serial imaging to monitor for resolution of absecesses.
Pt had heme + guaiac and was initially transfused 3u PRBCs upon admission and GI was consulted who felt anemia was likely chronic, especially in the setting of sepsis and marrow suppression.
Per patients reports, has had recent colonoscopies without evidence of bleed.
Pt maintained hematocrit until [**8-14**] at 7pm when he had a large volume bloody BM on the floor.
Gastroenterology saw again and thought that the bleeding was most likely due to an upper GI bleed from known gastric and duodenal ulcers.
As a result, he had been positive ~10L and developed anasarca, likely secondary to poor nutritional status with an initial albumin of 2.2 which decreased to 1.2 by the time he was transferred back to the floor.
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
SAG was < 1.1, not suggestive of portal hypertension involvement.
He had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with persistent word finding difficulties throughout admission.
Head MRI showed possible septic emboli on [**8-23**], however, a TEE on [**8-28**] was negative for vegetations.
It was thought that his mental status changes were most likely delerium secondary to metabolic/infectious encephalopathy.
At discharge patient's mental status had improved, he was tolerating tube feeds well, urine output was stable, he had been afebrile for 2 weeks, hematocrit had been stable, and he denied colonoscopy as an inpatient.

You will need to have weekly labs checked to ensure tolerance of your antibiotics as well as appropriate antibiotic levels in your blood.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital for fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, dizziness, confusion, chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, change in your urination or stools, or any other concerns.
