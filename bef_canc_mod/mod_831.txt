CXR [**2176-4-22**]: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, with crowding of the pulmonary vascular structures, and suggestion of mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
TRANSPLANT U/S [**4-23**]: Status post renal and pancreas transplants to assess for possible hydronephrosis or peri-transplant fluid collection.
The renal transplant is identified in the right lower quadrant and measures 9.6 cm in length, similar in size to the prior scan of [**2172-10-31**].
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis and no peri-transplant fluid collections are seen.
Normal arterial waveforms and velocities are seen in the main renal artery and main renal vein.
CONCLUSION: Normal-appearing right lower quadrant renal transplant.
PANCREAS U/S [**4-23**]: CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post pancreas transplant, to assess for fluid accumulation or parenchymal damage.
The pancreas transplant could be partially imaged and was seen in the right periumbilical region, but visualization was incomplete due to patient's body habitus and overlying bowel gas.
There were no peritransplant fluid collections seen and the graft measures approximately 2 x 3 x 3 cm.
Venous flow was seen contiguous to the graft, possibly in the splenic or superior mesenteric vein, but arterial flow within the pancreas transplant could not be established.
CONCLUSION: Limited views of the pancreas transplant in the right periumbilical region show no fluid collections.
Doppler assessment is inadequate, possibly for technical reasons cited above.
MICRO: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2176-4-23**]):    NO GROWTH.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2176-4-25**]):    No significant growth.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 35-year-old man with type I diabetes and ESRD s/p renal / pancreatic transplant with ESRD (on HD via indwelling line) following allograft failure admitted [**2176-4-22**] with severe sepsis presumptively from line infection.
Culture data from dialysis center grew out coagulase negative staph, susceptible to Vanc.
Per transplant recs, pulled line via IR guidance and tipe sent for culture.
On the medicine floor he remained afebrile and HD stable.
Cultures from HD center on [**4-22**] grew out gram positive cocci in clusters, speciated to coagulase negative staph, sensitive to Vancomycin.
# Normocytic anemia: Hct stable, at baseline, most likely [**12-27**] ACD.
On the medicine floors he became hypertensive and his home doses of metoprolol and clonidine were restarted.
Hypertension 3.
Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with high fevers from dialysis.
You had low blood pressure initially, and you were admitted to the ICU where you received fluids and antibiotics.
We found out that you were growing a bacteria from the first line and you will need to continue antibiotics when you leave.
