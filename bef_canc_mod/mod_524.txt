Admission Date:  [**2164-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-10-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: dizziness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer now presenting with dizziness.
He felt increased generalized fatigue and nausea as well.
When he stood to walk he felt very unsteady.
He denied any focal numbness or weakness.
His daughter brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] for further evaluation.
In the ED, he still felt this dizziness and kept his eyes closed during the interview with the ED neurology resident.
He denied any recent infectious symptoms diarrhea, post-nasal drip, or rashes.
He did not feel any lightheadedness with the symptoms, and denied any new visual symptoms.
Past Medical History: -Colon cancer status post 5-FU and leucovorin [**1-16**] and status post liver right lobectomy for three liver mets in [**1-17**], complicated by a bile leak with catheter removal in [**11-16**], persistent sinus tract drainage from the site.
-CAD s/p MI -Hypercholesterolemia -HTN x 10 years -Glaucoma resulting in right eye blindness.
Family History: There are no strokes or neurological disorders in the family.
Skin: abdominal scars Neuro: Mental status: Mandarin speaking only, exam performed with daughter as translator.
Language difficult to assess but no report by daughter of slurred speech or errors.
III,IV,VI-EOMI w/o nystagmus however there is evidence of saccadic intrusion bilaterally, no ptosis; when later assessed there is some nystagmus on right lateral gaze with fast component to right.
V-- sensation intact to LT/PP, masseters strong symmetrically; VII-no facial asymmetry, muscles of facial expression strong; VIII-not formally tested; IX,X--voice normal, palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline, gag intact; [**Doctor First Name 81**]--SCM/trapezii [**5-17**]; XII--tongue protrudes midline, no atrophy or fasciculation.
Motor: Mild right pronator drift; strong extensors of the arms and wrists and hand grasps bilaterally; moves legs as well with nl extensor strength; normal tone in legs.
Gait deferred due to the patient's condition - patient with marked truncal ataxia sitting at edge of bed.
There is no evidence of a brain metastasis.
The appearance of the left cerebellar lesion described on CT of the same day is consistent with a recent infarct within the left superior cerebellar artery territory.
Slight increase in hypodensity of a left cerebellar infarct, with mild increase in local mass effect upon the quadrigeminal cistern, without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of probable prior infarcts within the right and left cerebellar hemispheres."
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
There has been no further progression of the area of left cerebellar infarction.
Additional small areas of signal abnormality in the cerebellum are stable.
No new areas of diffusion signal abnormality are seen.
There is flow in both internal carotid arteries and in the anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches.
A left posterior communicating artery or fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery is also identified.
MRI of the brain reveals no change in the extent of left cerebellar infarction and no new findings.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo man with hx colon ca and the following stroke RFs: CAD s/p MI, High Chol, HTN, age, with ?hypercoagulablility from GI malignancy?, who presented with dizziness, nausea and vomiting, found to have dysmetria on exam, and by CT, acute left cerebellar stroke that seemed to be in the left SCA territory; he has other older strokes in the cerebellum bilaterally, and thus seemed likely to have a posterior circulation defect.
By MRI, he did not seem to have metastatic disease in his brain.
He was monitored in the ICU for first 24 hours of admission, and once felt to be stable, he was transferred to the floor.
For his borderline lipid panel, we started a statin (Lipitor 20 mg); LFTs should be monitored, as he has a history of liver metastases status post resection.
An echo was unrevealing as a source of emboli, with no wall motion abnormalities, and in fact, hyperkinetic with an EF of 75%.
Carotid ultrasound report suggested (among 40-59% L carotid stenosis) a subclavian steal syndrome.
MRA of the chest was considered in addition to intracranial circulation imaging, to better characterize this question of steal; he was discussed in vascular neurology conference, and the decision was made not to pursue this, as he had never had symptoms from the steal before, and with his other stroke risk factors, this was not likely to be the cause of his present vascular event.
He also had a guaiac positive stool (which was brown, and without associated acute anemia by CBC).
On telemetry, he was generally regular, but after a brief run of apparent SVT lasting 4-5 seconds, an EKG was performed that was completely unchanged from prior (inferior and anterior Q's and TWIs in lateral leads); lytes were normal.
MRA performed on the day of discharge showed occlusion of the left vertebral, and unchanged distribution of infarct with no exacerbation of edema.
Because of his posterior circulation disease and his potential hypercoagulable state (due to malignancy), anticoagulation was considered with Coumadin.
In addition to the fact that evidence for anticoagulation in this capacity is lacking, he is also currently very ataxic and thus at great risk for fall; he would not be a good candidate for this medication.
For his history of a heart attack in the past, he is on a beta blocker, aspirin, and additionally, for improved blood pressure control, a low-dose ace inhibitor was added (Lisinopril 5mg).
Truncal ataxia was still present, and finger-nose-finger tasks were still more abnormal on the left than the right.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Cerebellar Infarction Acute Cerebellar Infarction   Discharge Condition: Stable neurological exam, some mild improvement but not at baseline.
Still with truncal ataxia and abnormal finger to nose on left more than right.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had an acute cerebellar stroke and still feels dizzy.
If it suddenly worsens, or if he develops more nausea, new visual disturbances, speech or language problems, numbness, tingling or weakness, please notify MD.
