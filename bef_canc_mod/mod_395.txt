This appearance could be seen with an infectious etiology including atypical forms of pneumonia.
Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to reassess, and particularly of suspicion for discrete nodules were to persist, then chest CT could be considered.
RUQ U/S [**2184-1-6**] Status post cholecystectomy without intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation; trace amount of perihepatic ascites, similar to prior exams.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2182-12-23**] (images reviewed), the degree of mitral regurgitation appears decreased, although the quality of the current study is inferior and the amount of regurgitation may be underestimated.
Known right upper lobe atelectasis and extensive left lung changes.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
There is extensive left basal fibrosis and right upper lobe atelectasis.
In the reasonably well-ventilated lung areas, there is no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Video Speech and Swallow [**2184-1-15**] Barium passes freely from the oropharynx into the esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was silent aspiration of thin liquids with multiple sips.
There was a thin line of penetration noted in the laryngeal vestibule with thin liquids during chin tuck.
Tongue pumping was noted with a pureed bolus and moderate residue was present afterwards in the valleculae.
There was mild pharyngeal residue with cup sips of nectar thick liquids but no penetration or gross aspiration.
Moderate vallecular residue with pureed foods.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 yo female with history of childhood ALL, pulmonary fibrosis s/p left lobe lung transplant, left mainstem bronchus bronchomalacia s/p stent placement, and sinus tachycardia presented with fever and cough, found to be tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive with infiltrates on CXR.
# Pneumonia / Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, likely secondary to alveolar hypoventilation as a result of dense multilobar infiltrates.
Due to her respiratory failure, she was intubated in the ED and placed on ventilation with low tidal volumes per ARDSnet protocol.
Given her prior history of MRSA pneumonia, multiple health care encounters and recent CAP, she was treated presumptively for HCAP, and was started on Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin (discontinued on [**1-6**]).
The patient's leukocytosis continued to improve throughout her course and her ventilatory support was gradually weaned until she was successfully extubated on [**2184-1-13**].
# Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on presentation to the emergency department, likely as a sequelae of septic shock.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia as high as 120 as an outpatient.
She experienced little change in her resting heart rate despite resolution of her sepsis.
The patient's home carvedilol was held for the duration of her stay due to her hypotension, and she was later transitioned to low-dose metoprolol due to its superior cardioselectivity.
There was no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed, no hematuria, acute RP bleed or bleed into her right fem a-line.
# Transaminitis: The patient demonstrated a mild transamonitis early in her hospital course.
Thus, her elevated enzymes were most likely a result of sepsis, as her transaminitis improved in tandem with her stable blood pressures.
# Dysphagia: got video speech and swallow after extubation.
