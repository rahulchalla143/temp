Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a diagnosis of blood in your stool.
We aren't sure exactly where the bleeding was coming from - one possibility is that because you were taking a lot of laxatives, this might have irritated your bowels.
In the past, you have had hemorrhoids seen on colonoscopy, and these hemorrhoids may have started to bleed once you started to have more bowel movements.
To be completely sure where the bleeding is coming from, you should see the gastroenterologist as an outpatient.
An underactive thyroid gland can make you feel tired, cold, constipated and slow your heart rate.
To help treat this, we have started you on a medicine called levothyroxine, which should help treat these symptoms.
If you experience further bleeding in your stool, weakness, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency department.
