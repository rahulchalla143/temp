Admission Date:  [**2164-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**] Chief Complaint: MVC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2164-8-8**] trach/PEG/IVCF [**2164-8-3**] R Craniectomy   History of Present Illness: 19 y/o male s/p roll-over MVC, driver, ejected, unknown restraint, unresponsive on EMS arrival.
Pertinent Results: [**8-3**] CT Head: Subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal hematoma with cerebral edema, leftward subfalcine herniation, and partial effacement of the basal cisterns.
Multiple skull fractures as described above.
Due to fracture involvement of the carotid canals bilaterally, recommend carotid CTA for evaluation of potential vascular injury.
Temporal bone fractures bilaterally with ossicular disruption in the left middle ear cavity.
[**8-3**] CT Spine: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Extensive skull base fractures as detailed on concurrently performed head CT.
Right upper lobe posterior consolidation also better assessed on CT torso.
[**8-3**] CT Torso: L1 superior endplate compression fracture with only minimal loss of vertebral body height.
Segmental collapse in the posterior segments of the right upper lobe and left lower lobe likely secondary to aspiration/atelectasis.
[**8-4**] CT head: Interval R craniectomy and evacuation of underlying SDH.
Minimal residual subdural hyperdense blood products persist.
Scattered SAH and parenchymal hemorrhagic contusions in the bilateral vertices and bilateral temporal lobes are grossly stable.
New hemorrhage in the R frontal white matter and scattered foci at [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white interfaces bilaterally likely reflecting diffuse axonal injury.
Diffuse parenchymal edema and resultant mass effect with sulcal and ventricular effacement.
New impingement upon the L supreasellar cistern is concerning for early uncal herniation.
Extensive calvarial and skull base fractures are as previously delineated on the CT report from one day prior.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is an increasing left retrocardiac opacity as well as probably a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Partial right upper lobe atelectasis is nearly resolved.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atalectasis, slightly worsened on the right.
There appears to be relatively increased density to the entire right lung relative to the left, but this appears to be partially due to asymmetrically-placed overlying sheets.
A repeat radiograph can be obtained if there is any concerning new asymmetry of breath sounds on examination.
There is no pneumothorax seen.
[**8-8**] CT head - IMPRESSION: Increased number and amount of hyperdense foci with surrounding hypodensity in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes consistent with contusion, increased subdural fluid collection layering along the falx, significantly increased right hemispheric mass effect, opacification of bilateral mastoids.
Extensive diffuse axonal injury in the corpus callosum bilaterally, the inferior frontal lobes bilaterally, and the left cerebral hemisphere.
Extensive bilateral hemorrhagic contusions with associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Unchanged extent of cerebral herniation through the large right craniotomy defect, with unchanged rightward shift of midline structures and associated distortion of the supratentorial ventricles.
He was admitted to the TSICU for management of his neurological injuries and a bolt was placed by the neurosurgical service until the patient could be taken to the operating room for a hemicraniectomy.
Pt taken to the OR for emergent RIGHT craniotomy for elevated ICP (40s) noted after bolt placed at bedside.
[**Name (NI) **] pt with tachycardia and stable b/p.
[**8-4**] patient continues to be unresponsive, though neuro exam waxes and wanes with decorticate posturing and occasional withdrawal to pain.
Fever > 101, arctic sun was applied, after couple of hours patient developed shivering, arctic sun was discontinued.
New L SCV CVL placed, femoral CVL removed.
[**8-7**] Decreased oxygen saturations in the morning.
Bronchoscopy was performed with copious thick secretions in right mainstem and down.
[**8-11**] Pt was hypertensive into the 170's on triple therapy therefore a nipride gtt was initiated.
Staples were removed and an MRI was obtained which revealed extensive [**Doctor First Name **] and hemorrhagic contusions.
[**8-27**] R direct tap of epidural space 20cc which finalized as no growth.
[**8-30**] Infectious Disease determined there was no infectious process and fevers were central vs. secondary to an autonomic disorder [**8-31**] Rehab screening started [**9-3**] Repeat Head CT to eval for cranioplasty planning: Return to clinic in 4 wks w/head CT then schedule day.
A Autonomic Disorder consult was done but a the diagnosis of PAID could not be given as it is a diagnosis of exclusion and they felt that all medical work-up would need to be repeated in order for a formal diagnosis.
Infectious Disease has cleared patient of an infectious etiology.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**1-21**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Morphine Sulfate 1-2 mg IV Q2H:PRN pain hold for RR < 12   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1122**] Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Subdural Hematoma Multiple Brain Contusions Traumatic Brain Injury CSF Leak L1 Burst Fracture Respiratory Failure   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Bedbound.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
