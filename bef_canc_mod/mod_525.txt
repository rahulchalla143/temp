He also presented a troponin leak from likely demand ischemia.
Recently, he had a normal TSH ruling out hyperthyroidism as an etiology and a virtual colonoscopy that showed no colonic lesions though there was poor visualization of the descending colon and no intraabdominal masses or other pathology.
He was followed by surgery and GI but it was felt that there were no indications for intervention since he's a poor surgical candidate and colonoscopy could potentially perforate the colon.

THe TTE did not show any evidence of endocarditis.
He then underwent a TEE which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
- An initial CT abd/pelvis on admission raised the possibility of intravesical air as a sign of entero-vesical fistula (which might explain the VRE uti and subsequent bacteremia - A f/u CT abd/pelvis was done with rectal contrast to evaluate for this possibility.
While the rectal contrast did not reach high enough to directly visualize a potential fistula, there was no evidence of intra-vesical air on this study, making a fistula less likely.
