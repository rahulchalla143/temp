HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, who presents with acute onset of midepigastric pain without radiation to his back.
The pain was constant and ten out of ten.
The patient came to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and he had dry heaves but without vomiting.
He denies fever or chills at home.
He has no history of postprandial pain.
No recent changes in his medications.
The patient denies chest pain and currently he has no palpitations.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels in [**2189**], at [**Hospital6 2121**].
Myelodysplastic syndrome with thrombocytopenia.
History of dysplastic colonic polyps.
Degenerative joint disease with disc herniation at L4-L5.
Aortic stenosis with moderate aortic insufficiency.
Echocardiogram in [**2196**], demonstrated an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with aortic valve of 1.0 square centimeters and moderate aortic stenosis and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Ciprofloxacin, Morphine, Demerol that causes nausea and vomiting.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother with muscular dystrophy.
No jugular venous distention.
Abdomen is soft, nondistended with decreased bowel sounds and midepigastric tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
There is no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Neurologically, there is no gross deficit.
There was moderate gallbladder distention but no wall edema.
No pericholecystic fluid.
There was also fatty infiltration of the liver and some splenomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following the results of the right upper quadrant ultrasound, it was felt that the patient had a dilated common bile duct secondary to obstruction by gallstone and the patient was treated with Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and given intravenous fluids.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted but cannulation of the biliary duct was unsuccessful despite multiple attempts because the patient became very agitated and uncooperative and therefore, the procedure was aborted.
However, in the meantime, the patient was found to have rising troponin T which gradually reached the 0.6 level.
Original impression was that this elevated troponin represented demand ischemia imposed on the heart by the pancreatitis and the cholestatic picture in the setting of aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation.
Given the rising trend in the troponin, as well as need for general anesthesia to perform the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, it was decided that the patient should be evaluated by cardiac catheterization.
The cardiac catheterization showed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, as was known from before.
Severe but not critical aortic stenosis with moderate aortic regurgitation, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, systemic systolic arterial hypertension, severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure, patent left internal mammary artery - left anterior descending, patent saphenous vein graft OM and saphenous vein graft posterior descending artery, presumed occluded saphenous vein graft - diagonal and severe disease in unusual OM4 to AV groove with complex OM lesion arising from bifurcation and distal lesion with limited runoff.
It was decided that most of the perioperative cardiac risk is related to the severe aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation and diastolic heart failure.
It is doubtful that balloon angioplasty of this OM which supplies only a small area of myocardium would significantly improve his perioperative risk of cardiac events.
As of [**2198-12-23**], the pancreatic enzyme levels as well as the total bilirubin level have returned towards normalization, and the patient is free of abdominal pain.
During the hospitalization and at the time that the patient was in a pancreatitis abdominal pain picture, intravenous fluids were given resulting in an increase in total body weight and fluid retention.
This diuresis is complicated by the elevated creatinine which currently is 1.8 as of [**2198-12-23**].
Hematology - The patient has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome which manifests with chronic thrombocytopenia.
Also during this hospitalization and while the patient was on telemetry, he demonstrated frequent premature ventricular contractions as well as runs of ventricular tachycardia.
