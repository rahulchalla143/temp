The patient had mild productive cough but no fevers or chills.
She was found to be atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 140s and started on heparin and Diltiazem for rate control.
Pulmonary:  Respiratory failure secondary to hypoventilation secondary to morbid obesity in the setting of restrictive lung disease and congestive heart failure.
Decreased mental status:  Believed to be secondary to hypoxia and hypercarbia, resolved with improved oxygenation.
Restrictive lung disease with PFTs, FEV of 1.38, 77%, FVC     of 1.78, 71%, mild decrease in DLCO, on home O2 two to     three liters at night.
Morbid obesity.
Presumed obstructive sleep apnea.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction,     echocardiogram in [**2166**] very limited, ejection fraction     was 67% on stress test in [**2164**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Stasis dermatitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient alert, in no acute distress sitting in a chair.
Unable to assess jugular venous pressure secondary to morbid obesity.
Grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Lungs:  Rare crackles bilateral bases.
Right upper extremity edema near PICC line.
Erythema of bilateral calves but not warm to touch.
Chest x-ray unchanged from previous studies, shows congestive heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.
Pulmonary:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to morbid obesity/hypoventilatioin and CHF.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter:  Cardiology was consulted for a possible transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion.
She had no wheezing while on beta blockers here ofr last 2 days of admit.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of positive stress tests with reversible defects.
Cardiology was consulted for possible cardiac catheterization.
The patient was continued on Statin and aspirin.Repeat TTE was done that showed decraesd EF of 35-40% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
beta blocker and ACE-I have been added to help with CAD and CHF managament.
Aortic stenosis murmur on examination with mild AS confirmed on echo this admit.
Hematology:  The patient on anti-coagulation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The patient's pain improved spontaneously without intervention.She appears to have right rotator cuff tendonitis vs bursitis.
[**Month (only) 116**] need PT to help increase use and could use tylenol or low dose nsaids for increased pain.
Diabetes mellitus: The patient was continued on home medications, Glucophage and Avandia as well as a Regular insulin sliding scale.Her glucotrol and amaryl were added back the day prior to discharge.
Obstructive sleep apnea/obesity hypoventialtion syndrome 3.
Congestive heart failure 4.
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
CAD with echo evidence of prior MI and reduced EF 9. mild AS 10. constipation                               [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3022**], M.D.
