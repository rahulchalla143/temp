Today on the day of admission she was rushing to answer the phone, became lightheaded and fell to the ground.
She denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, weakness prior to the event.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, low back pain, hypercholesterolemia, history of syncope, nephrolithiasis, recent cellulitis, acute renal failure, baseline creatinine of approximately 1.7 and a history of right shoulder dislocation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa.
In general, she was an elderly Russian female in no acute distress.
HEENT showed mucous membranes are moist.
Lungs were significant for bibasilar crackles.
There was a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.

X-rays showed anterior dislocation of her humerus.
Mental status:  On approximately the third hospital day the patient's mental status began to decline over a period of two days and the patient became progressively less responsive.
Neuro consult felt that her decrease in mental status was likely secondary to a toxic metabolic encephalopathy from her Tylenol #3 failing to clear with decreased creatinine clearance as well as the possibility of uremic encephalopathy given the fact that her creatinine had increased markedly during admission.
Renal:  The patient came in with an elevated creatinine.
The etiology of her new renal insufficiency remained unclear at the time of discharge and renal consult did not feel that her mental status changes were secondary to uremia.
