Given the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath he was transferred here for further mgmt,  In the ED he was tachycardic to 102 and SBPs were 96/31.
CT-A was done which showed multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Of note the patient was hospitalized in [**2106-11-23**] with PNA and COPD exacerbation.
ROS: Aside from the aforementioned, the patient reports a 60 pound wt loss over the past 1.5 months.
He reports having no appetite or energy.
As stated above he does report chest pain and shortness of breath.
He denies any GI sx.

HEENT: PERRL, dry MM, op clear NECK: unable to appreciate jvp given body habitus, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: end expiratory wheezes appreciated throughout lung fields CV: RR, nl S1S2, no gmr ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: 3+ pitting edema of bil LE and RUE.
onychomycosis of toe nails SKIN: old blister on dorsal or R toe no rashes/no jaundice, stage II sacral decub NEURO: AAOx3.
Multiple new segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli compared to the prior CT. 2.
Persistence over two months of consolidation in the posterior right upper lobe with right hilar adenopathy, likely reactive.
Differential diagnosis includes persistent aspiration pneumonia.
Underlying mass cannot be excluded.
Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavaity size and dynamic systolic function (LVEF >75%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no resting LVOT gradient.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary emboli, multiple severe GI bleeds in the setting of anticoagulation for above, S/P IVC filter placement, S/P NSTEMI, S/P intubation for respiratory failure(pneumonia, COPD, etc.
), S/P Stroke with left-arm & leg deficits, and acute anuric renal failure in setting of septic shock.
For his respiratory failure, he required a course of steroids for COPD and for PNA, multiple courses of antibiotics, most recently on linezolid and meropenem for Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella (to complete course on [**2107-3-20**]).
Patient also developed line infection with coagulase negative Staph bacteremia on [**2107-2-20**], and was treated by removing line and Vancomycin course.
Infections were complicated by intermittent septic shock which temporarily required vasopressors and IV fluid resuscitation.
His multiple episodes of septic shock complicated by acute oliguric/anuric renal failure with resultant volume overload, that was intermittently responsive to vasopressors as well  He was unable to wean from ventilator so tracheostomy/PEG were placed.
The patient subsequently developed ventilator associated pneumonia, for which he is on his current antibiotic course (Linezolid and Meropenem until [**3-20**]).
It was agreed that the following would no longer be pursued: vasopressors and fluid boluses for hypotension/oliguria, renal replacement therapy (either CVVHD or intermittent HD) for his anuric renal failure, anticoagulation for stroke/CAD/atrial fibrillation.
While hospitalized, patient continued to accumulate substantial amounts of fluid due to exogenous administration for hypotension in setting of hypoalbuminemia and renal failure, which led to marked anasarca, and marked amount of pain related to the oedema and the skin ulcerations.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to COPD, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia.
