HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension with a resultant end-stage renal disease who recently has had fatigue and coughing spells making it hard for her to catch her breath, with fevers and chills and dark sputum for one week.
On [**3-2**] in the a.m. she had acute shortness of breath without chest pain and Emergency Medical Service was called.
There, she had hypertension to 215/120.
Initial electrocardiogram changes with ST elevations in V2 to V3 were attributed to her underlying congestive heart failure by Cardiology.
Later on her first day, she did have some chest pain responsive to morphine, but her electrocardiogram had normalized.
She had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on [**3-2**] in the p.m.  On [**3-3**] she had another ultrafiltration for 3 kg with plans to resume regular schedule thereafter.
She also had several episodes of chest pain with ST elevations in V2 to V3 on the electrocardiogram, treated with nitroglycerin and Lopressor, and the pain resolved.
The team then felt the chest pain was related to traumatic intubation more than angina, as it is present only when she coughs.
The cough precedes the chest pain, and the chest pain goes away with the cough, and the pain is present substernally up to her throat.
She has had a bit of colored sputum attributed to traumatic intubation with mild hemoptysis.
She had low-grade temperatures thought secondary to possible aspiration and got one dose of zithromycin on [**3-4**].
The pain had been on and off for one week and was [**6-8**] in intensity but only hurt with cough.
The patient did not remember what her myocardial infarction pain was like.
She did have shortness of breath while coughing.
There was no nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
No melena or blood.
Type 2 diabetes with retinopathy and nephropathy and neuropathy.
End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension; dialyzed on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for five years.
Coronary artery disease, status post anterior myocardial infarction in [**2158**]; last catheterization in [**2158**] showed 100% right coronary artery with collaterals from distant circumflex and right coronary artery, 80% left anterior descending artery, and 64% ejection fraction, moderate diastolic dysfunction with increased filling pressures.
An echocardiogram in [**2166**] had an ejection fraction preserved with mild left atrial enlargement and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Cervical spondylosis, status post multiple discectomies.
She has been leaning on others to do things for her recently.
Cardiovascular revealed she was tachycardic with a regular rhythm, with an first heart sound and second heart sound and third heart sound without murmurs or rubs.
Lungs had bilateral rales.
No wheezing on rhonchi.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm with good dorsalis pedis pulses.
Sensation was slightly decreased in the lower extremities with diabetic neuropathy, dysesthesia when extubated today (on Sunday).
She had a slight tremor of tongue and jaw.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in place with heart size at the upper limits of normal, diffuse bilateral opacities more focal in the right perihilar regions, small effusions, right chronic hemidiaphragm elevation.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 98 with a normal axis, a Q wave in V2 to V3, with poor R wave progression until V4 with ST elevations in V2 to V3 and ST depressions in II and V5 to V6.
Echocardiogram showed 25% ejection fraction, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinesis, no valve disease.
Repeat chest x-ray revealed much decreased edema from the first with a small right pleural effusion, left CPA not seen.
RENAL/FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION/VOLUME:  She had a volume-related congestive heart failure episode managed by further hemodialysis.
A new dry weight was being set at hemodialysis.
MIBI was negative with normal wall motion, fixed or reversible ischemia with a 50% ejection fraction.
Her chest pain was attributed to traumatic intubation and improved steadily.
We tried to initiate [**Last Name (un) **], but after repeated hemodialysis she was a little volume depleted with low blood pressures, so this was held.
Repeat chest x-ray showed slight elevation of her right hemidiaphragm which is chronically blunted, CPA, and mild right basilar atelectasis correlating with rales in her right base.
No antibiotics were used despite low-grade temperatures and a white blood cell count of 12.4.
Chronic diarrhea can be followed up as an outpatient.
Congestive heart failure secondary to volume overload from a missed dialysis appointment.
Possible minor aspiration event at intubation.
Hypotension after loss of volume at hemodialysis.
