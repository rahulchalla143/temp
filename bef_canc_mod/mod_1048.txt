Over the past few days (since [**3-19**]), patient has noted increasing dyspnea both at rest and on exertion.
She denies fever or chills.
She denies peripheral edema or increasing abdominal girth.
She endorses chest pain for three days which is sternal, constant, and exacerbated with palpation.
She has no recent travel history and is not able to describe sick contacts.
She denies nausea or vomiting.
She was given aspirin and nitroglycerin, albuterol and ipratropium bromide nebs x2 and methylprednisolone, and started on azithromycin and ceftriazone for community-acquired pneumonia coverage.
Past Medical History: COPD, 2 ppday smoking history Hypertension Diabetes mellitus II Schizophrenia, and ?MR Breast mass, s/p L mastectomy OA, knees, b/l   Social History: The patient is from the [**Location (un) 86**] area.
She has smoked 2ppd for many years.
Family History: Patient is not aware of any history of COPD / asthma / atopy.
Physical Exam: VS: T98.6F  HR 100 BP 156/69  RR 20 O2 Sat 90% ^LNC GENERAL: Obese Caucasian woman lying in ED cot, breathing with some difficulty HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, dry mm, hirsutism of chin NECK: supple, no thyromegaly or lympadenopathy CHEST: + 15+ cm horizontal scar from L mastectomy, "buffalo hump", patient breathing with some difficulty and congestion, hyperinflated, diffuse wheezes bilaterally with bibasilar crackles COR: rrr, nl S1 and S2, no JVD ABDOMEN: rotund, + BS, difficult to assess HSM due to size GU: not examined EXTREMITIES: pulses in DP b/l, no c,c,e, sensation to LT and sharp object intact in lower extremities NEURO: Patient is awake, alert and oriented x3.
There is continued perihilar haziness and vascular engorgement consistent with congestive heart failure which is slightly improved in the interval.
A more focal opacity is seen in the right lower lobe likely representing pneumonia, which appears slightly improved in the interval.
There is no pneumothorax.
Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
Minimal improvement in congestive heart failure.
Widening of the left mediastinal contour lateral to aortic knob calcification, concerning for aortic dissection.
Differential diagnosis includes lymphadenopathy and mediastinal lipomatosis.
Improving CHF and resolving right lower lobe process.
Consolidative opacities in the lower lobes dependently are suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules.
This could represent metastatic disease (possibly breast cancer given the patient's mastectomy), lymphoma, or an inflammatory process such as sarcoid.
Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for further evaluation.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is at least mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is at least mildly depressed but images are suboptimal and EF could be lower.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Ms [**Known lastname 58650**] is a 60 year old woman with history of COPD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia who was initially admitted to the medicine floor with a 6-day history dyspnea, cough and fear of falling.
On admission to the floor, pt developed hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and transfer to the MICU.
Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to COPD exacerbation and bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.
Pt's oxygenation and dyspnea initially improved with nebulizers, steroids, and antibiotics given in the ED.
Pt was noted to be in respiratory distress with O2 sats 83-89% on 6L nc and RR of 51.
Brief trial of bipap for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure was unsuccessful and pt was electively intubated.
Pt was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of CAP/atypical pneumonia.
Echocardiogram revealed mildly depressed EF of 40-45%, but not other abnormalities.
While intubated, pt's pulse O2 sats ranged from 90-94%, with paO2 range from 72-100; her hypoxia was consistent with underlying COPD and new pna.
On [**3-28**], pt had a bronchoscopy for pulmonary toilet, because of secretions.
Chest pain: Pt reported chest pain at group home for 3 days.
The pain was somewhat reproducible on physical examination.
EKG showed TWI and lateral ST depression.
Pt didn't have any chest pain while hospitalized.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: CXR on [**3-27**] was noted to have mediastinal widening.
2 small pulmonary nodules were noted in RML and RUL.
