ECHO [**2152-7-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intrapulmonary shunting by bubble study.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction with elevated PCWP.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
EKG [**2152-8-9**]: Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial ectopy.
Q-T interval prolongation.
[**2152-8-9**] Abd/Pelvis U/S & duplex doppler: IMPRESSION: 1.
Heterogeneous and coarsened liver without focal lesion.
Left lower quadrant cystic structure.
As compared to the previous examination, there is moderate improvement.
The lung volumes are still small and the hemidiaphragms are elevated, but the extent of the right-sided pleural effusion has markedly decreased.
There is no focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
[**2152-8-15**] Chest x-ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no major change.
On the frontal radiograph, no pleural effusion is seen.
[**2152-8-18**] Wrist x-rays: Preliminary report - no fractures.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o F with a history of NASH cirrhosis now with weight gain and increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema for 1 month.
She had previously patent vessels and no ascites on her last U/S.
No ascites was noted on a repeat ultrasound on this admission and vessels were patent.
Cardiac causes including MI/CHF were also considered, however, an echo on [**7-21**] showed a normal EF.
She does have marked diastolic dysfunction which may be contributing to volume overload.
Upper GI bleed: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had about 1L of hematemesis on [**8-14**] and was transfered to the MICU where she received a 2 units of RBCs and underwent endoscopy.
The first EGD showed no intervenable varices but the repeat EGD showed 2 bands of grade II varices and 2 bands of grade I varices and 2 bands were placed.
Cirrhosis: The patient has stage IV cirrhosis by biopsy.
There were no significant changes in her LFTs during her stay.
Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.3-1.7.
It increased to 1.9 after diuretics were resumed post-GI bleed, likely because her volume overload had improved significantly and she was slightly dry.
No overt seizures were noted.
CAD: The patient has had a previous CABG and known 3 vessel disease on cardiac cath in [**2151**].
She is not currently on an ACEI, statin, or aspirin.
The patient is quite anxious about her cardiac status, especially since it is the anniversary of her husband's death.
Iron studies revealed that she is iron deficient, and she was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation.
Then on [**8-14**] she had an episode of 1L of hematemesis and she received another 2 units of RBCs.
FEN: The patient was given a low salt, cardiac and diabetic diet.
She was initially hyponatremic, likely from increased diuretic use.
Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin sc tid until her upper GI bleed.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Forge [**Doctor Last Name **] senior living  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Volume overload  Additional Diagnoses: NASH/cirrhosis Thrombocytopenia GERD Type 2 Diabetes Major Depression with psychosis Hypertension Diabetic nephropathy Obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: stable, satting well on room air, pain free.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of rapid weight gain, increased abdominal size, and increased leg edema concerning for water retention.
The abdominal ultrasound also showed a cystic structure in your pelvis that was noticed 2 years ago on a CT study, but was not seen on a study 3 years ago.
In addition, the echocardiogram that was performed on [**2152-7-21**] was significant for some diastolic dysfunction.
This finding may help to partly explain why you are retaining excess water and having increased shortness of breath.
Given your history of coronary artery disease, we recommend that you follow-up with a cardiologist to discuss possible options for further medical management.
During your admission you were started on ferrous sulfate because you were noted to have an iron deficiency anemia.
You also received 1 unit of red blood cells because of a low hematocrit.
