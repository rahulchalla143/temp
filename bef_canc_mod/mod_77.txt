HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29-year-old female with multiple medical problems including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, anorexia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple line infections, who was in [**Hospital **] Clinic today for parenteral iron treatment and became hypotensive.
One hour later, an infusion of 100 mg of Ferrlecit was infused and five minutes after the infusion started, the patient complained of back pain radiating to her shoulder blades bilaterally and she received 10 mg of Decadron for concern of allergic reaction.
Family reported that she had a transient rash on her right upper extremity and face.
However, of note, she had a recent admission in [**2157-1-6**] for line sepsis at which time a Port-A-Cath was removed and a left subclavian Hickman was placed.
This was removed in [**2157-2-6**],  and a PICC line was placed, which was later discontinued due to concern for upper extremity DVT despite negative ultrasound.
Review of systems is positive for nausea and vomiting times three days, fatigue, myalgias, sick contacts.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome diagnosed four    years ago [**Hospital6 1129**] treated with 1    liter of normal saline seven days a week at home through a    Port-A-Cath or Hickman as well as Florinef.
Anorexia nervosa.
Postprandial hypoglycemia.
Enterococcal sepsis secondary to contaminant of central    line of unclear source.
Congenital strabismus.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Posttraumatic stress disorder secondary to sexual    abuse as a child.
Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with an ejection    fraction of 30 percent.
Clindamycin causes nausea and vomiting.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Grandfather with a pheochromocytoma.
No evidence of tongue swelling.
Neck is supple, no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
Left subclavian line site clean, dry, and intact, no erythema.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Good capillary refill, warm and dry, no rashes.
Rectal:  Normal tone, guaiac negative, no saddle anesthesia.
Back:  No evidence of CVA tenderness.
No step-offs or spinal tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes.
Chest x-ray:  No acute disease.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 84, normal axis, T-wave inversions in V2 through V4 consistent with old EKG from [**2155**].
Hypotensive episode:  Unclear if the patient really has    had an allergic reaction versus sepsis or transient    bacteremia versus episode of autonomic dysfunction.
The patient was hemodynamically stable during    the entire time of her hospitalization, although she did    have persistent orthostatic tachycardia.
All culture data    were negative for signs of infection including urine and    blood.
Hypoglycemia:  This was felt to be secondary to an    abnormal insulinemic surge during times of parasympathetic    overactivity due to underlying autonomic dysfunction.
Diarrhea:  This was resolved within one day of    hospitalization and thought to be possibly secondary to a    brief episode of gastroenteritis versus a parasympathetic    surge.
Anemia:  The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia.
It    was strongly encouraged that she reconsider the use of IV    iron given the symptoms that she seem to develop    concurrent with IV iron administration.
Back pain:  This was suspected to be musculoskeletal as    there were reproducible features on exam.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was able    to tolerate a full diet without nausea and vomiting at the    time of discharge.
intake at the time of discharge, and was asymptomatic with hemodynamic stability.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please notify your primary doctor if pain, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, lightheadedness, nausea, or diarrhea.
Please be sure to eat frequent small meals throughout the day given your propensity for hyperinsulin secretion, ensure adequate fluid intake, and although most patient's with heart failure (low ejection fraction) require low salt and low fluid diet given your postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, you require a high salt, high fluid diet.
Hyperinsulinemia surge.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Cardiomyopathy of unknown origin with an ejection fraction    of 35 percent.
