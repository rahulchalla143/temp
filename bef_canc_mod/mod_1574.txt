Admission Date: [**2170-5-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2170-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-12-30**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes type 2 with last hemoglobin A1C in [**7-/2169**] of 11 percent who was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission when he noticed that his blood glucoses were abnormally high in the 500 to 550 range and that he felt nauseated.
The emesis was non-bloody and non-bilious.
He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations.
No dyspnea on exertion but states that he did have limited exercise tolerance secondary to gait imbalance.
Patient had stable two-pillow orthopnea, no postnasal drip, positive lower extremity edema  in the past controlled with a "water pill."
Patient states that he has never had a stress test echo or other cardiac workup.
The patient went to an outside hospital secondary to his high blood sugars and nausea and vomiting.
At the outside hospital he continued to have dry heaves and CK was 13.13, MB was pending, AST 174, ALT 174.
The patient's EKG at the outside hospital revealed an isolated Q wave in Lead III and ST elevations in V1 through V3.
His diabetes is complicated by peripheral neuropathy and question of Parkinson's disease, history of lacunar infarct, history of depression, history of left-sided Bell's palsy, status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Mother has diabetes mellitus and sister has coronary artery disease.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions V5 and V6, Q waves in Lead III, evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial abnormally.
Chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1, normal S2, and positive for S3, pulmonary bibasilar crackles, right greater than left; no rales.
Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
His pulmonary capillary wedge was 10, PA pressure 27/12, mean was 19, and the results of the catheterization were as follows:  Left anterior descending 90 percent proximal long, 70 percent mid, diffuse disease distally up to 80 percent first diagonal, 70 percent proximal, 90 percent distal of the left circumflex, and 99 percent PDA bifurcating obtuse marginal 1 with 80 percent upper branch and 70 percent lower branch, right coronary artery 100 percent origin, probably nondominant.
Patient also had an intraprocedure echo performed which revealed a depressed ejection fraction at approximately 20 percent with a relative preservation on inferolateral wall.
Chest x-ray was performed which revealed no congestive heart failure with patchy infiltrates.
He received four units of packed red blood cells, four units of fresh frozen plasma, one bag of platelets, 10 units of vitamin K.  Had a CT which was positive for right-sided intrapleural hematoma as well as an extra pleural hematoma.
On discussing the case with the Cardiac Medicine team that initially had the patient overnight, it became evident that patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the Emergency Room and did received chest compressions for a short period of time.
Captopril was held off given the patient did have chronic renal insufficiency.
His blood pressures remained mildly hypertensive to normotensive.
These findings were felt to be consistent with a sepsis.
Rhythm:  Throughout his hospitalization patient remained in normal sinus rhythm but did have evidence of an supraventricular tachycardia with three-beat run to the max.
A video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed with drainage of bloody fluid.
Patient had minimal drainage at these chest tubes and in the setting of a mild decrease in hematocrit, a noncontrast CT was obtained.
The case was discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery who felt that patient did not have evidence of active bleeding.
The patient would become extremely tachypneic and would drop his tidal volumes.
Again, weaning from the ventilation was attempted, but patient's rhythm consistently remained above 100 and he would become tachycardiac as well as drop his tidal volumes on attempt to try a spontaneous breathing trial.
This failure was felt secondary to fluid overload and due to persistence of intrapulmonary infiltrate secondary to the hemothorax.
Renal failure:  Patient's renal failure was improving on Lasix at time of discharge from the Cardiac Care Unit.
His creatinine bumped to a high of 3.6 felt likely secondary to overdiuresis as well as sepsis.
Infectious Diseases:  Patient, in the setting of hypotension and elevated cardiac output, as well as decreased SVR and sepsis, blood cultures were sent off which, by time of transfer, were no growth to date.
Patient also had a urine sent off which was no growth.
A sputum culture was consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Other sources of infection were felt to include patient's hemothorax as well as chest tube insertion sites as those areas had some mild purulent discharge which was managed by wound care.
Patient also had a stage 2 decubitus ulcer on his coccyx which were managed with DuoDerm as well as air mattress.
