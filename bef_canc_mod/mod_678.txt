History of Present Illness: This is a 68-year-old female who noted the acute onset of left foot pain at 10 o'clock the prior evening and after a few hours went to [**Hospital3 **] where she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1535**].
Upon arrival she had a palpable left femoral pulse but it was weaker than her right femoral pulse.
She had no dopplerable signals in her left foot and she had mildly decreased motor and decreased sensation of the left foot.
Past Medical History: ESRD from htn, partial colectomy for colonic polyps, and thyroid resection for benign disease, ventral hernia repair   Social History: Lives with husband in home  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: 98.9  P:76   BP: 125/70   RR:20   Spo2: 99% NAD A&Ox4 CTAB RRR Abd soft, NT, ND Ext: LLE 3cm skin open with serous stained packing.
COMPLICATIONS:  There were no complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and taken to the cardiovascular intensive care unit in guarded condition.
INDICATIONS:  This is a 68-year-old female who noted the acute onset of left foot pain at 10 o'clock the prior evening and after a few hours went to [**Hospital3 **] where she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].
Upon arrival she had a palpable left femoral pulse but it was weaker than her right femoral pulse.
She had no dopplerable signals in her left foot and she had mildly decreased motor and decreased sensation of the left foot.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was placed in the abdominal aorta and a short 4-French sheath was placed.
A longitudinal incision was made in the left groin and the common femoral artery was exposed.
A longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the common femoral artery and there was a large amount of thrombus present.
Arteriography was then performed of the left lower extremity and there was still noted to be a large amount of clot at the tibioperoneal trunk and despite multiple attempts with the export catheter over a [**Name (NI) 41314**] PT wire which had been placed into the posterior tibial artery and despite multiple passes with the excisor vacuum assisted battery-operated thrombectomy device, there was still a tremendous amount of clot in the anterior tibial and the posterior tibial so these were pulled out and the sheath was left in place.
A cutdown was performed of the below-knee popliteal artery and the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle were taken off their attachments to the tibia.
At this point a longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the below-knee popliteal artery and a #2 embolectomy catheter was passed into the anterior tibial artery all the way to approximately 60 cm and a large amount of thrombus was removed after multiple passes and ultimately there was excellent backbleeding.
There was noted to be persistent thrombus in the distal anterior tibial and distal posterior tibial artery but the decision was made to stop at this point.
The fascia was then incised in a deep posterior and superficial posterior compartment through the same incision as the below-knee popliteal exposure.
The patient, at the completion of the case had a dopplerable distal AT, peroneal, PT, but there was no signals in the foot.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  Initial images of the abdominal aorta revealed patent abdominal aorta and iliac arteries bilaterally.
Initial image of the left lower extremity reveal a clot sitting in the profunda which seems superimposed on the SFA.
There is flow through the anterior tibial but it is very sluggish and goes very slowly through the mid leg.
There is very minimal flow going through the posterior tibial artery.
The peroneal artery is patent but there is a large clot sitting at the proximal posterior tibial artery.
There is very sluggish flow through the anterior tibial artery in the mid leg and there is no flow into the DP in the foot.
There is small amount of tarsal flow and collaterals into the foot from the peroneal.
There is injection of papaverine followed by one completion run showing the same appearance with poor flow into the foot.
Successful removal of clot from the tibioperoneal trunk,     but there is persistent thrombus at the distal PT going     into the foot as well as the very distal AT going into     the foot.
There is continuous flow through the peroneal artery     supplying collaterals to the foot.
