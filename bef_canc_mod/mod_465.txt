She initially presented to OSH where EKG uninterpretable in setting of v-paced rhythm.
At time of transfer, patient complained of persistant chest discomfort, rated [**1-1**].
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient complained of persistent discomfort despite high nitro gtt causing SBP in 80-90s.
Angiography revealed thrombus in prox Cx which was treated with prox and mid DES.
She denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CKD with Cr of 2.6 Anemia, due to CKD Nonhodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo/XRT Gout PVD Lymphedema on left leg Pituitary adenoma, likey cause of frequent headaches IBS GERD Arthritis  Social History: -Lives alone in [**Location (un) 2973**], performs all IADL's incl driving -cleaning lady comes once a week -Tobacco history: former smoker 1ppd x25 years, quit [**2161**] -ETOH: none -Illicit drugs: none  Family History: Her father died at the age of 59 from CAD.
Extensive family history of heart disease.
No family history of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Mild kyphosis.
Crackles bilaterally halfway up posterior lung fields, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
GROIN: angioseal in both groin sites, femoral bruit over right groin, no obvious tenderness at either site, no hematoma felt EXTREMITIES: Asymmetric peripheral edema noted in left leg, trace edema at right ankle SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to prior study of [**2174-2-28**], left ventricular ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation now much worse.
# RADIOLOGY  [**2-20**] ULTRASOUND OF RIGHT FEMORAL CATH SITE IMPRESSION: Small collateral coming off the right common femoral artery, but no evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
No evidence of hematoma.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild aneurysm/akinesis of the basal inferior septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of the more distal inferior , distal lateral, and apical segments.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

# STEMI/CAD: Patient presented with ACS/STEMI with elevated cardiac enzymes and an uninterpretable EKG.
She has been chest pain free since cath.
Post-cath, she was noted to have a femoral bruit, however there was no evidence of aneursym on right groin ultrasound.
She was not started on an ace inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] given acute on chronic renal failure.
# Acute on chronic CHF: Patient was in acute on chronic congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema on chest xray.
Diuresis is difficult secondary to acute on chronic renal failure.
O2 requirement increased overnight.
TTE on [**2-20**] showed left ventricular systolic function that was severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex.
Repeat chest xray showed mild improvement in pulmonary edema.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine was elevated (baseline Cr 2.6, now 4.0), likely secondary contrast-induced nephropathy secondary to dye load from cardiac catheterization.
No electrolyte abnormalities currently.
She will need further monitoring and workup of her renal failure after discharge.
# Leukocytosis: WBC increased from 8.1 to 11.6.
Had elevated temperature but not true fever, and it spontaneously resolved.

Her reaction was thought [**12-24**] either metolazone or diuril which she received slightly prior to the rash.
# Gout: Stable.
Allopurinol was stopped temporarily given worsening renal function.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this admission.
