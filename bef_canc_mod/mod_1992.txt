There is no confluent consolidation.
There is, however, indistinct pulmonary vascular marking seen throughout.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of small pleural effusion.
Right costophrenic angle is sharp.
Bilateral deep brain stimulator devices project over the chest.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise notable for hypertrophic changes in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2204-3-2**]: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
The gradient across the mitral valve is increased (mean = 7 mmHg).
No mitral regurgitation is seen (does not exclude due to acoustic shadowing).
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring but with increased gradient.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
[**2204-3-2**] Urine culture: negative  Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old male w/ PMH notable for mitral valve prolapse s/p MVR and annuloplasty, mitral stenosis, c/b RV dysfunction, dCHF, and Parkinson's disease who presents for dyspnea and abdominal discomfort.
Dyspnea due to acute on chronic dCHF from dietary indiscretion.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Admission exam notable for crackles and CXR w/ pulm congestion.
Acute heart failure likely caused by recent increased sodium intake and URI.
CE were negative x2 and ECG w/o ST changes, making ischemia highly unlikely.
Patient afebrile, no leukocytosis and CXR without focal consolidation, so low concern for PNA.
Repeat ECHO on [**3-2**] showed normal EF and no significant changes in MV area and MV gradient (slightly better compared to [**2200**]), no MR. BNP ~1000 (unclear baseline).
Patient clinically improved and no longer having O2 requirement at rest and with walking down stairs.
# Fatigue: Patient describes slow progressive decline over years, as well as some fatigue and weakness over the past few days.
# Parkinsons.
# Microcytic anemia: Hct stable in low 30s.
H/o iron-def anemia.
Plan for outpatient colonoscopy  # Constipation: Abdominal pain seems to be d/t constipation.

You were admitted because you had trouble breathing.
This is because fluid backed up from your heart to your lungs from congestive heart failure.
The cause of this acute episode is likely from increased salt intake and your recent cold.
