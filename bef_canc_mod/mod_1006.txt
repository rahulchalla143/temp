Admission Date:  [**2166-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Cough and Malaise  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Bone Marrow Biopsy Bronchoscopy with Bronchoalveolar Lavage Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV (last CD4 of 137 on [**2166-3-18**]) brought to the ED by his friends after the patient had been complaining of generalized malaise and cough x 1 week, as well as diffuse joint pains.
He initially denied having a cough, but then stated it had been on-going for a week.
On ROS, the patient denied any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, back pain, dysuria, dysphagia, or odynophagia.
He denied pain around the tunneled catheter HD line, denied recent Tylenol use, or accidental ingestions.
At that time, the patient was admitted with acute on chronic renal insufficiency, started on hemodialysis which was continued as an outpatient, and was diagnosed with a RML/RLL PNA and completed a course of CTX/Azithromycin.
Given concern for PNA with a leukocytosis and symptoms of a productive cough, and rhonchi noted on exam, the patient was given CTX and azithro for a possible CAP.
However, Abx coverage was broadened to include Vanco and Flagyl for a possible biliary source of infection after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis.
He underwent an CT abd/pel which showed fluid filled loops of colon and an atrophic left kidney but no intrabiliary pathology.
2) Hep C dx in [**2153**].
No hx of treatment.
3) COPD 4) GI bleed/ shock [**9-22**] Workup notable for CMV esophogitis s/p valganciclovir, Cdiff positive s/p po vancomycin.
5) Blindness R eye since [**2152**], unclear etiology 6) HTN 7) Polysubstance abuse 8) Diverticulitis s/p resection [**2150**] 9) Hypoplastic L kidney 10) CRF with concern for medication induced AIN/ATN as noted above 11) Tobacco Abuse   Social History: The patient is a widower, he currently lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with his sister.
The patient reports his Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] to be his HCP [**Name (NI) 1139**]: 2 PPD ETOH:  Reports prior heavy use, none current Illicits: History if IV Heroin and Cocaine, last documented use [**2153**]   Family History: Mother: [**Name (NI) **] CA Father: CAD  Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile 140/60 60s 95% RA GEN: Severely cachetic male with buccal lipoatrophy, awake, opens and closes eyes intermittently, oriented to person, place, year, date, month, situation HEENT: EOMI, right [**Doctor First Name 2281**] and pupil occluded with scarring, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, MMM but intact, no thrush, poor dentition NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
CXR PA and Lat [**3-31**]: Interval improvement in multifocal right lung patchy opacities which could represent a resolving infectious process.
Limited non-contrast evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma is unremarkable without evidence of significant intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There are diffusely prominent fluid-filled loops of bowel without evidence of mechanical obstruction.
No evidence of space-occupying lesion within the brain.
Aerosolized secretions in the right maxillary sinus could suggest a component of acute sinusitis.
Correlate clinically, with history of prior trauma or infection, particularly cytomegalovirus infection given the patient's HIV status.
CSF [**4-6**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Many lymphocytes, some with reactive changes, monocytes and macrophages.
Extensive centrilobular and panlobular emphysema.
Nodular peripheral parenchymal lesion in the right lower lobe, accompanied by a satellite lesion, parenchymal consolidation and a moderate pleural effusion.
This lesion is suggestive of recent infection, most likely fungal or bacterial.
Disseminated subpleural nodules that are most likely post-infectious in origin.
Right lung predominant bronchiolar nodules of varying density, suggesting recurrent bronchiolar infection.
Tracheal widening with tracheal sputum level.
Moderately enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Partial fissural distortions caused by scarring.
Bone Marrow [**4-9**]: Pathology - Hypercellular bone marrow with megakaryocytic hyperplasia.
No lymphoid aggregates are seen on the core biopsy and corresponding flow cytometric analysis of the marrow aspirate showed a T cell predominant population.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION - Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Erythrocytes show mild anisopoikilocytosis with macrocytes, dacrocytes, and rare schistocytes.
Lymphocytes include large granular lymphocytes and lymphoplasmacytic lymphocytes.
Rare myelocyte as well as a rare blast is seen on scan.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of multiple cellular spicules.
Erythroid precursors are present with overall normoblastic maturation; forms with mild nuclear membrane irregularities, occasional asymmetric nuclear budding, as well as occasional megablastoid forms are seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and shows hypercellular marrow with overall cellularity of approximately 70%.
ADDENDUM: Special stains for infectious organisms (AFB, GMS) performed at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] were negative for acid-fast and/or fungal organisms.
B cells comprise 4% of lymphoid-gated events and do not express aberrant antigens.
Clonality could not be reliably assessed due to non-specific staining by surface immunoglobulin antibodies (cytophilic staining pattern).
INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Few atypical squamous cells in a background of neutrophils, few macrophages and few bronchial cells, (see note.)
CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2166-4-8**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2166-4-8**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2166-4-11**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE: R/O CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (Final [**2166-5-9**]):       NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2166-4-17**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
NOCARDIA CULTURE (Final [**2166-5-2**]):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
Cryoglobulin   TRACE POSITIVE .
Fungitell (tm) Assay for (1,3)-B-D-Glucans   285 pg/mL   Brief Hospital Course: 60 YO M HCV, HIV (recently off ARVs w CD4s in the mid-100s), CKD on HD, admitted with joint pain, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, hypotension, and short MICU stay for hypercarbia which improved without intervention.
# Altered mental status.
The patient's mental status worsened during the beginning of his hospitalization and he was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was transferred to the MICU but improved prior to treatment with alternative ventilation.
Given concurrent anemia, thrombocytopenia, and worsening renal function, there was initial concern for TTP/HUS although bili and haptoglobin were normal.
Head CT was without enhancing lesions or hemmorrhage and LP demonstrated a mild lymphocytic leukocytosis consistent with known HIV infection but was otherwise within normal limits.
Upon admission, his urine tox was positive for benzodiazepines and methadone, both of which he denied recently taking.
Shortly after admission, he was started on his home narcotics regimen per OMR followed by the nadir of his mental status.
He was also noted to have a likely pneumonia on chest XR and CT. A combination of narcosis and infection was the most likely etiology of both his hypercarbia and altered mental status.
# Thrombocytopenia.
Hematology was consulted and performed a bone marrow biospy with results c/w HIV associated myelopathy with megakaryocytes present in increased numbers and focally in clusters.
# Macrocytic Anemia.
The patient's Hct remained stable in the mid-20s with an appropriate reticulocyte index and bone marrow findings consistent with a normal amount of erythroid precursors.
He last had an EGD in [**2164**] w findings demonstrating CMV esophagitis as well a gastritis versus portal gastropathy.
Although he was noted to be hypotensive early in his stay, this was likely either related to hypovolemia or SIRS phenomena in the setting of pneumonia and resolved with fluids and was not consistent with acute blood loss anemia.
His anemia is most likely multifactorial and related to HIV disease, HCV, renal failure, poor nutrition and possibly gastritis or portal gastopathy.
# Pneumonia, Transaminitis.
Given the patient's initial hypotension and leukocytosis w CT findings suggestive of penumonia, the patient was covered broadly with meropenem, fluconazole and vancomycin for an 8 day course.
His transaminitis may have been related to a viral URI that then predisposed him to a bacterial or fungal pneumonia.
In addition, with HCV and worsening immunocompromise, his viral titer may have transiently risen in the setting of acute illness.
While he was not hypotensive for long periods of time, his hypotension with reperfusion may have also contributed to his transaminitis.
ARVs on hold since [**2-24**] given concern for tenofovir, bactrim, lisinopril/HCTZ-related ATN.
# ATN in setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
Essentially, given several months of renal failure, renal felt the biospy would show scarring without any specific diagnostic gain.
# Chronic Pain.
In addition, cryoglobulins were checked in the setting of known HCV and joint pain and were borderline positive.
Disp:*7 patches* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Thrombocytopenia, NOS Immunosuppression secondary to HIV infection Iron Deficiency Anemia Chronic Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis  Secondary: Hepatitis C Virus   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable with normal vitals.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of your malaise, low blood pressure, and labs showing new findings of liver cell inflammation and low platelets (thrombocytopenia).
You also had an episode of altered mental status with high blood carbon dioxide levels for which you had a short stay in the intensive care unit.
Bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy have not revealed a reason for your symptoms and your lab abnormalities to date.
While there are several tests pending which you should follow up on with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], your low platelets may likely be the result of a viral illness, including HIV.
Please return call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] or return to the emergency department if you experience shortness of breath or difficult breathing, chest pain, abdominal pain, spontaneous bruising, nose bleeds, blood in your sputum, urine or stool, or any other concerning symptoms.
