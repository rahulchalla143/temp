Admission Date:  [**2116-12-17**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2042-8-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 2048**] [**Known lastname 10680**] is a 74-year-old female with extensive past medical history including breast cancer, status post mastectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 359**], and cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease status post stents times two.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10680**] was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer in [**2116-8-24**] and underwent left upper lobectomy on [**10-6**], which was complicated by respiratory decompression secondary to mucous plugging as well as Pseudomonas pneumonia and Klebsiella pneumonia.
Hospital course was also complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile colitis and ischemic colitis.
She has had continuous difficulties with sections and mucous plugging requiring multiple bronchoscopies to clear the secretions and multiple course of antibiotics.
She previously had an ICU stay with failure to wean, complicated by sepsis and bacteremia requiring pressors.
She also has a history of partial small-bowel obstruction and she is TPN dependent.
She was doing well until [**12-17**], when she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest, felt to be secondary to a primary respiratory arrest in the setting of mucus plugging.
During the arrest she was found to be pulseless and apneic.
She had no neurologic sequela from the arrest.
Chest x-ray, status post cardiopulmonary arrest, showed a large left pleural effusion, left main-stem cutoff and opacification of the left lung which shifted the mediastinum with left lung collapse.
She was transferred to the Medical ICU for further management of her respiratory failure.
Squamous cell lung cancer, status post left thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy, [**2116-10-6**], status post mediastinal lymph node dissection [**2116-10-8**].
Squamous cell cancer of the lung.
Status post tracheostomy, [**2116-10-27**] with Passy-Muir valve for respiratory failure.
Ischemic colitis.
Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction [**2116-8-24**].
Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease by cardiac catheterization status post stent.
Intermittent atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Pseudomonal pneumonia.
History of partial small-bowel obstruction.
History of recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of right sided breast cancer status post mastectomy.
History of recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of right sided breast cancer status post mastectomy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
CURRENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the patient to be afebrile with the heart rate of 80, blood pressure 120/60, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 99% on ventilator setting of pressor support of 15; PEEP 5, FI02 40%; observed tidal volumes ranging from 280 to 350.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert, awake, verbally responsive and in no distress.
Neck was supple without jugulovenous distention.
HEART:  Heart is regular without murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.
LUNGS: Lungs exhibit decreased breath sounds and bronchial breath sounds at the left base.
There is intermittent scattered end-expiratory wheeze heard in both lung fields, both anteriorly and posteriorly, which varies with the timing of her respiratory treatments.
Chest x-ray on [**12-28**], showed some improved re-aeration of the left lung status post bronchoscopy, but persistent collapse and some shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left.
The most recently chest x-ray on [**1-4**], showed slight interval improvement in the degree of atelectasis in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion, unchanged when compared to prior films.
There remains extensive left sided volume loss likely due to a combination of left upper lobectomy and partial collapse of the left lower lobe.
However, there was some slight interval with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Chest CT performed on [**1-1**], showed again, slight interval improved aeration of the left lower lobe with persistent collapse of most of the left lower lobe, small left pleural effusion, which is stable in size, as well as a moderate right sided pleural effusion.
Note was made of a blood clot in the junction of the left pulmonary vein and left atrium, which had been noted on a prior CT scan and had been evaluated by echocardiography and felt to be a lower embolism given its location in a vein, which was then tied off during left upper lobectomy and not in communication with a dynamic contractile structure.
Multiple plain films of the abdomen were obtained to evaluate abdominal distention and diarrhea.
Abdominal films showed an ileus without evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
Serial abdominal films over the course of the hospitalization showed improvement of the ileus.
RESPIRATORY:  Little progress was achieved in reversing the patient's persistent left lower lobe collapse and subsequently weaning her off the ventilator.
She currently remained on a low level of pressure support with adequate tidal volumes and no respiratory distress.
Bronchoscopies have been notable for evidence of tracheomalacia in the airways.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted regarding possible stent placement for this tracheomalacia, however, this was not felt likely be of therapeutic advantage for this patient.
Consideration was also given to possible completion pneumonectomy on the left; however, consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], the patient's thoracic surgeon was obtained and it was not felt to be a viable option at this time given the patient's overall poor nutritional status and questionable therapeutic benefit.
Throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was noted to have significant bronchospasm and she was treated aggressively with inhaled corticosteroids, beta agonist, Atrovent, and a low-dose steroid taper, with subsequent improvement in her bronchospasm and overall improvement in respiratory function.
She was also treated with a 14-day course of Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis with subsequent improvement in the amount and consistency of her secretions.
She has, over the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay, shown significant improvement in re-aeration of the left lung; however, she has been slow to wean off the ventilator and has required repeated bronchoscopy several times a week.
She has been continued on her Amiodarone for control of her intermittent atrial fibrillation; however, has not been in atrial fibrillation during her Intensive Care Unit stay.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a two-week course of Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis.
Flagyl for Clostridium difficile colitis.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has a history of CMV colitis status post treatment with Ganciclovir.
She is also felt to have ischemic colitis.
She has failed feeding attempts both through the NG tube and oral, with episodes of ischemic colitis with each feeding attempt.
It is felt that she has an area of water-shed ischemia in this area.
The patient is also felt to have a resolving abdominal ileus.
The abdominal examination currently remains benign with slight distention and normal bowel sounds.
HEMATOLOGY:  As previously mentioned the patient was noted on CT scan to have a clot in the left pulmonary vein at the junction of the entrance into the right atrium.
Consultation with Cardiology staff was obtained to determine the need for long-term anticoagulation.
It is not felt that this clot represents a significant risk of thromboembolism because it resides in essentially a blind pouch, which is not communicating with blood flow or contractile organ.
She continues on TPN with plans to continue this indefinitely until definitive bowel resection can be performed to treat her ischemic colitis.
The patient and her family desire aggressive measures to attempt eventual weaning off the ventilator.
