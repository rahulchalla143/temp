Patient continued to have episodes of chest pain that were being treated with SL NTG with improvement.
Denies any other associated symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.
However, did note that the pain radiated to both of her arms.
Patient went into mild heart failure yesterday after getting IVF but seems to be improving with IV Lasix.

FINDINGS: Compared to the study of 6 hours earlier, there has been an improvement in the congestive heart failure pattern with decreased upper zone redistribution.
IMPRESSION: Improving congestive heart failure.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the origin.
The LCX had a 60% stenosis of the OM1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 10 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated (PA pressure was 47/18 mm Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (mean PCW pressure was 21 mm Hg).
Central arterial pressure was mildy elevated (aortic pressure was 150/63 mm Hg).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.

Severely depressed LVEF.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal lateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate mitral regurgitation is present.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # CHF - The arrived slightly fluid overloaded then had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension and fluid administration on the floor.
Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal lateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis was present.
She diuresed well and became euvolemic with a base weight of 49.8kg.
If her diarrhea persists, consider stopping Crestor.
# LBBB.
# Acute renal failure- The patient had an increase in her Cr here thought to be due to contrast.
# Anemia and thrombocytosis: She takes hydrea for essential thrombocytosis.
Initially her Plavix was doubles to 150 since she has thrombocytosis, but then she had an episode of blood-streaked stool therefore her Plavix was reduced to 75.
# Abdominal Pain: The paitent had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting daily at home and this continued here.
