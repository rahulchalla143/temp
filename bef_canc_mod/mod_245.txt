Two days prior to admission, she developed worsening of her right leg pain, described as sharp and intermittent, relieved by dilaudid, similar to when she had an infection in the past.
She has also noticed swelling and erythema of her right leg over the course of the past few days.
She also notes low grade fevers to 100.6 per her VNA at home.
She has been constipated for several days, and states that she has some pain across her lower quadrants that she tends to develop with constipation.
Patient presented to dialysis today, and was noted there to have hypotension and fever to 101.8.

Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission (ED): Vitals: 101.8 F HR 116 BP: 119/66 RR: 17 SaO2: 98% 2L General: young female in pain Head/eyes: sclera anicteric, pupils 4 mm--> 2 mm bilat Chest: crackles [**12-11**] way up bilaterally, no wheezes or rhonchi Cardiovascular: tachy, holosystolic III/VI murmur heard throughout Abdominal: multipole scars, soft, diffusely tender.
No rebound or guardin, but patient not cooperable with exam.
Flank: no CVA tenderness Musculoskeletal: no spinal tenderness.
DIffuse pain on palpation of muscles of R leg.
Skin: multiple hyperpigmented discoid lesions over extremity (UE,LE bilat) Neuro: pt not able to comply with strength testing R LE due to pain.
[**4-12**] dorsi/plantar flexio L, sensation to LT intact LE.
There is still substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and evidence of vascular congestion in this patient who has intact midline sternal sutures.
No evidence of acute pneumonia.
There is a new external fixation device with three screws passing through the proximal tibia with two calcaneal screws.
Increased callus is noted at the site of a transverse fracture through the distal left fibula.
An oblique fracture is also present in the distal tibial diaphysis.
Although there may be increased demineralization about the site, it is difficult to assess the tibia for the degree of interval healing.
CXR [**2177-11-9**]: No appreciable change in patchy consolidation of both lungs, suspicious for pneumonia with possible superimposed failure.
There is no pneumothorax or sizeable pleural effusion.
Moderate pulmonary edema has improved from [**10-10**].
Severe cardiomegaly and marked dilatation of the pulmonary artery are chronic findings.
Again, there is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion with more focal opacification at the left base and huge enlargement of the pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Acute osteomyelitis.
Increased uptake of labeled white blood cells in the distal third of the right lower extremity consistent with continued active infection.
Cut off of bone marrow activity at the site of white cell uptake suggests the white cell uptake is secondary to osteomyelitis involving the distal third ofthe right tibia.
Bone Marrow Scan [**2177-10-17**]: IMPRESSION: Increased uptake in the distal third of the right distal lower extremity consistent with continued active infection.
No other sites of white blood cell uptake.
Cut off of bone marrow activity at the site of white cell uptake is suggestive of osteomyelitis involving the distal third of the right tibia.
Findings consistent with osteomyelitis of the distal right tibia.
Photopenic defect of the proximal [**12-11**] of the right tibia presumed due to overlying external fixator hardware.
CXR [**2177-10-11**] (MICU): Enlarged pulmonary arteries due to pulmonary hypertension are unchanged.
Moderate pulmonary edema is stable from the day before and has worsened from [**10-6**].
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are no sizable pleural effusions.
CXR [**2177-10-10**] (MICU): IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of congestive heart failure/volume overload.
Tib/Fib in OR [**2177-10-10**]: FINDINGS: Some fluoroscopic images from the operating room demonstrate interval removal of the intramedullary rod with proximal and distal interlocking screws within the tibia.
There remains a fracture of the distal tibia with a large bony defect.
Fracture of the distal fibula with subacute callus is also seen.
CXR [**2177-10-6**]: A small component of pulmonary edema present on [**10-4**] has resolved.
Diffuse ground-glass opacification and more severe peribronchial infiltration at both lung bases are chronic findings present since at least [**2177-4-8**] consistent with lupus pneumonitis.
Severe cardiomegaly and marked dilatation of the pulmonary arteries are also chronic features.
A central venous line, presumably a PIC, ends on the left clavicle, probably not intrathoracic.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present.
Pathology [**2177-10-4**]: Right tibial bone: Bony fragments with acute and chronic inflammation, fibrosis and focal necrosis consistent with acute and chronic osteomyelitis.
CXR [**2177-10-4**]: Slightly improved congestive changes compared to prior but overall not particularly different; certainly no worse than baseline.
CXR [**2177-9-29**]: Mild pulmonary edema has developed since [**9-6**] superimposed on chronic atelectasis at the lung bases, mild chronic interstitial abnormality, severe pulmonary hypertension and vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.
Mild tracheal narrowing in the neck is due in part to mild thyroid enlargement, but probably also post-intubation stricture or mild focal tracheomalacia.
Final internal length is 25-cm, with the tip positioned in mid-subclavian due to known central venous stenosis and per request from clinical team.
US guided FNA [**2177-9-19**] CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration of an inflamed area in the right lower extremity was performed with minimal yield.
Specimen sent for Gram stain and culture.
No discrete fluid pockets could be identified during scanning.
WBC Scan [**2177-9-17**]: Right anterior lower extremity soft tissue abscess and underlying osteomyelitis of the adjacent tibia.
No uptake within nephrectomy beds .
Several lymph nodes are seen in the right inguinal area, the largest measuring 3.6 cm.
This phlegmon extends to the anterior tibial cortex and distal interlocking screws.
There is no definite evidence of osteomyelitis or hardware-related complication at this time.
Circumferential edema within the lower extremity soft tissues, worse in the area of skin ulceration as described above.
Unilateral Non-vasc US [**2177-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: No discrete fluid collection.
Allowing for limitations, no evidence of DVT.
CT without contrast [**2177-9-7**]: CONCLUSION: Extensive bilateral airspace infiltrates in both lungs without change from [**2177-7-1**].
Very tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy which is without change.
Bilateral nephrectomies.
In the right nephrectomy bed, there is a 5.1 x 2.6 cm fluid collection which has increased in size from [**Month (only) 205**].
CXR [**2177-9-6**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacity, most suggestive of atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
Mild interstitial edema.
Distal right tibial and fibular fractures status post ORIF of tibial fracture.
Unchanged soft tissue defect anterior to the fracture site.
No cholecystitis.
Right lower lobe consolidation versus pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 30 yo F w/PMHx sx for ESRD on HD, SLE, HTN, and tib/fib fracture w/ hardware repair c/b bacteremia s/p course of antibiotics who presented with RLE pain, swelling, erythema, fever, and hypotension.
This phlegmon extended to the anterior tibial cortex and distal interlocking screws.
There was, however, no definite evidence of osteomyelitis or hardware-related complication at that time.
Results showed pseudomonas and enterococcus.
After debridement, orthopedics had placed a vac dressing on the wound which then needed to be changed in the OR every week.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] apprehensive to remove hardware and apply ex-fix due to condition of tissue.
On [**2177-10-17**] she had a bone marrow scan which showed increased uptake in the distal third of the right distal lower extremity consistent with continued active infection.
The patient continued to have weekly vac changes in the operating room on Tuesdays, and cultures were taken on [**2177-10-21**].
A bone marrow scan was completed on [**2177-10-28**] to investigate progression of her infection compared with a scan on [**2177-10-17**], which was found to be unchanged.
Pt had a short MICU course surrounding the [**Month/Year (2) 6024**] due to hypotension likely [**1-10**] epidural and narcotics for pain control.
Tib/Fib Fracture: Tib-fib films without evidence of displacement.
Pain control LLE pain: Patient remained on PCA for pain relief and was followed by the chronic pain service.
Settings for her PCA were recommended by the chronic pain service, and she was taken off her basal rate.
Pt followed by chronic pain service and PCA dose converted to long acting narcotic (fentanyl patch at 125mcg/hr) with 4-8mg po dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Also started on topamax for neuropathic/phantom limb pain .
Myoclonus: Patient has had on/off myoclonus, with apparent worsening prior to dialysis.
Have discussed with pain managment who started patient on lyrica.
At the time, patient was not having bad myoclonus and lyrica was continued.
Lyrica was decreased to 50 mg qd and her symptoms were monitored.
Lyrica subsequently d/ced as recommended by chronic pain.
Hypotension: On [**9-30**] s/p a wash out/vac change with orthopedics, Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] required Neosynephrine in PACU for high narcotic requirement with hypotension.
She stabilized and returned to the floor where she triggered for hypotension and low grade fever.
Patient's fever and BP improved with daily dose of antibiotics.
On [**10-4**] after yet another day of dialysis and going to the OR with orthopedics, Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] returned to the floor in agonizing pain and was given a total of 3mg dilaudid IV in addition to PCA.
She subsequently became somnolent with desaturations and hypotension for which she was transferred to the MICU.
She improved there and pain consult again changed pain recs.
On [**10-9**], patient was again transferred to MICU for fever with hypotension.
Her HD schedule was changed so that she would not have hemodialysis on the same day as the OR washout and vac change (from T/Th/Sat to M/W/F) schedule and she tolerated 2 weeks of vacuum changes without an episode of hypotension.
Pt again had a short micu course [**11-21**] to [**11-24**] for hypotension surrounding her [**Month/Year (2) 6024**] and subsequent revision.
Pt remained afebrile, and w/o significant bleeding/stable HCT post op.
Bloody sputum: Had new cough and bloody sputum on [**11-11**] (pill cup amount).
with recent intubations, has had bloody sputum previously with intubations.
Vital signs stable--no elevation HR, drop BP, or decrease O2 sat on RA.
CXR performed, with no new changes, unlikely large bleed.
Anemia: The patient received epoeitin at hemodialysis for her anemia.
She was transfused several units for her low Hct during her hospital stay as well as perioperativel;y. .
ESR, and CRP levels were monitored without major changes.
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab with f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks.

Discharge Condition: stable, improved, transferring in bed with assistance, tolerating pos, pain controlled on po regimen   Discharge Instructions: You have been treated at [**Hospital1 69**] with a wound infection.
You were treated for an infection of the hardware holding your leg bones together.
Considering that your blood vessels and body is sick from your lupus and that you are receiving standing steroids, the chance of meaningful healing of the wound was felt not to be good.
Please return to the ED with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Please return to the emergency department or call your primary care physician if you have fever >101.4 F, worsening pain, any new symptoms which are concerning to you.
