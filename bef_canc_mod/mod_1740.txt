However, she then developed cough that became productive yesterday and SOB worsened yesterday as well.
She mentioned that her temperature was recorded at 99.7 and her baseline usually runs around 96.
She noticed mild tremor at rest and also jerky movements when she moves her arm.
Per the ED her CXR showed new infiltrates bilaterally and she was thought to have a PNA.
Prior to leavinig the ED her vitals were T=98, HR=92, BP=99/54, RR=25, POx=97% 4L (on 2.5L at home)  On the floor, the patient endorses that these are her usual symptoms when she gets a PNA.
She also reports mild gas pains in her abdomen and a headache.

There are increased pulmonary interstitial markings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema.
There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema with moderate left and small right pleural effusions and bibasilar opacification, likely atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.
[**2197-10-20**] - CXR (portable): In comparison with the study of [**10-18**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
There is extensive opacification in the retrocardiac region, suggesting substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Large opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with collapse of the left lower lobe.
Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion, bilateral pleural effusions and right lower lobe atelectasis are stable.
Brief Hospital Course: (This is a 65 year old female with PMH significant for multiple drug resistant PNAs, asthma/COPD s/p multiple intubations on 2.5L of home O2, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, morbid obesity, OSA (not compliant with CPAP), aortic stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2), atrial fibrillation off Coumadin due to GI bleed, and HTN presenting with worsening cough over the last 4-5 days, worsening shortness of breath, and new greenish sputum production consistent with PNA.)
This is a 65 yo F admitted for progressive SOB and productive cough on [**2197-10-18**] and discharged on [**2197-10-31**] .
# Dyspnea, multifactorial with the recent pneumonia, baseline COPD, asthma, disastolic heart failure, and OSA.
She initially did well with medical therapy on the inpatient floor with antibiotics, nebulizers, and asthma therapy.
Given patient's history of respiratory distress and requirement of intubation, she was transferred to MICU ([**2197-10-20**]) for hypercarbic respiratory failure .Antibiotics were broadened to levofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem.
While in the MICU, discussions regarding tracheostomy were had on multiple occasions  but the decision to proceed was defered to another date due to remarkable improvement in clinical respiratory status (although the patient and family understand that this might be the eventual endpoint of her respiratory disease).
She appeared dry-euvolemic initially on presentation, but did have significant LE edema with skin changes consistent with chronic venous stasis.
Her fluid status should be monitored closely by daily weight or strict In's and Out's, and diuretic dosage and be adjusted accordingly.
# Increased alkalosis.
On the lfoor her alkalosis has resolved no near baseline.
# Pneumonia.
Initial clinical symptoms and signs were consistent with recurrent pneumonia.
She was treated empirically initially with meropenem given her history of multi-drug resistant bacterial infection in the past, then later added on levofloxacin and vancomycin.
# COPD/Asthma.
Patient has poor lung function at baseline.
# Atrial fibrillation.
She has not been anticoagulated with coumadin given her history of GI bleeding.
# Pancytopenia.
She was noted to have longstanding pancytopenia of unclear origin.
# Obstructive sleep apnea.
# Deconditioning.
