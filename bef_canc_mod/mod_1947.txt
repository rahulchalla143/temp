Admission Date: [**2150-12-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2150-12-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-9-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CTS   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59 year old female was referred in by her primary care physician to the hospital and admitted to the medical service on [**2150-12-2**], presenting with increasing dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema.
She had a known history of breast cancer with moderate severe aortic stenosis.
She was feeling fine until she developed symptoms approximately two weeks prior to admission after a trip to New [**Country 6679**].
She felt she had some unusual chest sensations and no dyspnea at that time but she went to her son again three weeks ago and had noticed increasing dyspnea, as well as palpitations with walking but no lower extremity edema.
Then in the prior two weeks to admission, she developed some orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea over one week.
She also noticed she had a ten pound weight gain in one week and decreased urine output times one week with dark urine and increased thirst.
Her primary care physician noted her increasing lower extremity edema.
She had no chest pain at that time and was admitted into the hospital on the medical service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Breast cancer, stage II hormone positive, status post lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy with chemotherapy in [**2149-1-1**], to [**2149-6-1**], with Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxol, and radiation therapy [**2149-7-1**], to [**2149-8-1**], thirty-three visits.
Bicuspid aortic valve.
Prior echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2150-12-2**], revealed mild to moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency and one plus mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Benign positional labyrinthitis.
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known medical allergies although she says she is sensitive to adhesive tape.
She also stated that she periodically took    Sulfamethoxazole as well as vitamins, calcium, Vitamin E,    multivitamin, Fibercon and a stool softener.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical service and cardiology for her congestive heart failure that she presented with in preparation for cardiac catheterization and repeat echocardiogram.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was diuresed and ultimately received echocardiogram on [**2150-12-8**], which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis, bilateral atrial enlargement, moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency, one to two plus mitral regurgitation, and depressed right ventricular function.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2150-12-4**], which showed 30 percent left main lesion, two plus mitral regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 percent with severe diffuse hypokinesis and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared, a peak gradient of 45 mmHg.
The patient additionally had low cardiac output in the catheterization laboratory.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7625**] of cardiothoracic surgery who noted her prior history of bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse and her history of left breast cancer, status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery with Adriamycin.
Of note, the patient also had left upper extremity lymphedema from her prior lumpectomy and axillary node dissection.
On examination, she was in no apparent distress but slightly short of breath in bed.
She had mild jugular venous distention.
The heart was regular rate and rhythm with a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and apex.
She had a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
Her extremities were without any cyanosis, clubbing or edema but her hands bilaterally were slightly cyanotic.
She had two plus bilateral carotid pulses, no palpable radial pulses, and one plus bilateral femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Preoperative electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.
Preoperative gallbladder ultrasound showed a right pleural effusion and just minimal fluid around the gallbladder attributed to her congestive heart failure.
The elevated AST and ALT were again noted the following morning to be elevated as well as INR of 1.4.
It was recommended that the patient have some Vitamin K subcutaneously and repeat liver function tests and INR check in the morning.
Preoperatively on [**2150-12-6**], the patient had an episode of left sided chest pain and was given intravenous Morphine and a bolus of normal saline.
This was then stopped after the patient complained of worsening dyspnea.
The patient was appropriate at that time with no asterixis and continued to be followed on the medical service in preparation for her surgery.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and the patient was then intubated on [**2150-12-7**], by anesthesia given her aortic stenosis and increasing respiratory distress with respiratory rate over 30 and an unobtainable peripheral oxygen saturation.
Given the patient's worsening hemodynamic status and worsening transaminases, as well as recent intubation, the plan was discussed to possibly have the patient have a valvuloplasty the following morning and manage her volume.
A postprocedure echocardiogram also noted by the congestive heart failure fellow was that the patient's echocardiogram showed some worsening of her aortic insufficiency which was now moderate.
The patient was also evaluated by clinical nutrition given her abnormal liver function.
Her creatinine rose slightly with sodium nitroprusside but the goal was to get her to an index of 2.6.
She continued to run slightly negative for her diuresis.
The patient was also evaluated by the case manager for cardiothoracic surgery in preparation for her hospitalization and potential surgery.
He also encouraged aggressive attention to nutrition and general condition as the patient is preoperative for high risk surgery.
Preoperative stroke risk was also evaluated by the stroke attending who recommended carotid ultrasound and MRI/MRA of the brain as well as tight glucose control.
The patient had some slight disorientation after her extubation on [**2150-12-10**], and some right sided weakness was also noted.
The patient was also evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of the heart failure service covering for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] and was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9673**] of the heart failure service also.
KUB was negative for obstruction.
Sputum had some polymorphonuclear cells with four plus gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and clusters, as well as sputum culture showing moderate oropharyngeal growth.
Electrocardiogram showed occasional premature ventricular contractions with short runs of trigeminy.
The head CT with contrast showed a small hypodense focus seen adjacent to the left side of the left angle commissure consistent with a Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space.
No mass effect, midline deviation or hemorrhage was seen.
Chest x-ray [**2150-12-10**], showed left hemidiaphragm opacity likely a combination of small pleural effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.
Magnetic resonance imaging was also ordered to help better determine possible cerebrovascular accident.
Preoperatively also the patient had some supraventricular tachycardia versus atrial fibrillation which was relieved by Lopressor.
Her congestive heart failure became better compensated.
Head MR showed no evidence of a cerebrovascular accident.
The patient did have some chest pressure briefly with tachycardia that resulted from the atrial fibrillation and was given Diltiazem and beta blocker with relief.
At this time, though, on [**2150-12-13**], the patient did have some persistent right sided weakness despite any evidence that she had had a cerebrovascular accident.
On additional review by neurology, it was determined that the patient probably did have an abnormality that seemed like motion artifact.
The patient did continue to have some right arm weakness but was then referred on to cardiothoracic surgery, was also seen and evaluated by physical therapy.
Urine culture showed E. coli with Bactrim resistance.
The patient was reevaluated by cardiac surgery on [**2150-12-15**], who noted her decreasing liver function tests and the fact that she had been cleared by neurology for cardiac surgery and heparinization.
The patient's preference was for mechanical valve and the plan was to schedule the patient for aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement on the following Friday.
The patient was seen again by the stroke service on [**2150-12-16**], and was evaluated again by the congestive heart failure service to make sure her diuresis and volume status had been optimized.
Additional preoperative laboratories on [**2150-12-17**], prior to surgery were as follows:  White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 348,000.
Urinalysis showed some leukocytes with 6-10 white blood cells and no bacteria.
Preoperative carotid ultrasound showed no significant disease.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was in sinus tachycardia in the 120s and blood pressure was 126/66.
On postoperative day number two, the patient had spiked a temperature, continued with diuresis, had a run of atrial fibrillation and was converted.
The patient in the morning was in atrial fibrillation again at 106 on p.o.
The patient also continued with perioperative Vancomycin and was otherwise alert and oriented in no apparent distress and doing well with an unremarkable examination.
The patient had some incisional pain which was medicated with Tylenol number three.
Sternal incision was dry and clean and intact.
Lipitor was discontinued given her recent elevated liver function tests without any evidence of coronary disease.
She continued to work with physical therapy, had some incisional pain, a little bit of ankle edema as well as right arm edema and weakness which was known to the team from preoperative workup.
The patient also had a small amount of back pain which was also medicated with Tylenol number three.
The patient had one episode of hypotension after doing stairs.
She did continue to have this hypotension when she was doing stairs but otherwise asymptomatic.
Left upper extremity lymphedema.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
