HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 -year-old Russian speaking female with a past medical history significant for diabetes type II, congestive heart failure of unknown etiology, and hypertension.
The patient presents with a three day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, nonproductive cough, and fever to 102 F on the day prior to admission.
Per patient's husband, she denies any nausea or vomiting, chills at night, night sweats, or chest pain.
The patient does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and two pillow orthopnea.
The patient denied any chest pain throughout her entire presentation.
Type II diabetes mellitus.
Morbid obesity.
Congestive heart failure of unclear etiology with normal [**Name (NI) 20679**] systolic function.
Question of left ventricular hypertrophy on prior echocardiogram.
Stasis dermatitis in bilateral lower extremities.
No history of coronary artery disease.
Restrictive lung disease, believed to be secondary to morbid obesity.
Presumptive obstructive sleep apnea.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for cancers.
Paternal grandmother with diabetes mellitus and maternal aunt with coronary artery disease.
PRIOR STUDIES:  Echocardiogram of 12/99 revealed mild left axis deviation, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Exercise tolerance test MIBI was without angina, no ischemic changes, left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 64% with normal wall motion.
In general, the patient was alert and oriented times three, on 100% nonrebreather, in moderate respiratory distress.
Chest examination reveals diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and crackles with a prolonged expiratory phase.
Cardiovascular examination is of regular rate and rhythm without evidence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is obese without tenderness, guarding, or distention, there are normoactive bowel sounds.
There is no suprapubic tenderness, no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities reveal trace bilateral upper extremity edema with 2+ to 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema, 1+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses, and 2+ bilateral radial pulses with stage I stasis dermatitis of the bilateral ankles.
Neurologic examination: there are no focal motor deficits and the patient denies any sensory changes.
Chest x-ray on admission showed florid congestive heart failure with no evidence of pleural effusion, but perihilar haziness and more confluent of opacification of the lung bases and retrocardiac region.
Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, stable from comparison electrocardiogram of [**2165-10-30**], with no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ongoing ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and started on a regimen for treatment of acute pulmonary edema.
Levaquin 500 mg po q day was also initiated for treatment of presumptive pneumonia.
The patient was sent for a stat CT scan angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism.
This study, although grossly limited, did not find any major perfusion deficits in the pulmonary vascular system.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring and optimization of respiratory status in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology with underlying congestive heart failure and pneumonia, both of which were being treated.
It was noted that intermittently throughout her hospital course, the patient was experiencing gross hematuria through her Foley catheter.
In addition, this was believed to be secondary to the fact that the patient was intermittently on heparin around the time of admission as empiric therapy for a possible pulmonary embolus.
Upon returning to the Medical Floor, the patient was noted also to have intermittent alarms on telemetry of paroxysmal multi-focal atrial tachycardia and frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia.
For further characterization of the patient's congestive heart failure, a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to assess the patient's systolic function for any further causes for possible diastolic dysfunction.
Echocardiogram windows were severely limited secondary to the patient's body habitus; however, preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was of a sustained systolic function.
Over the following day of her hospitalization, the patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy, was ambulating well, and was switched to po regimens for her diuretics.
At this time she will also be scheduled for further outpatient pulmonary follow up for characterization of her restrictive lung disease and for further evaluation of possible obstructive lung disease.
