He has also complained of burning in his urine over the last few days.
Given vanco, zosyn, 125mg solumedrol for wheezing on exam.
Past Medical History: PMH: 1) Atrial Fibrillation - s/p cardioversion in [**10-13**].
Currently not anticoagulated due to fall risk.

Mild perihilar congestion is noted bilaterally.
DIfferentials include asymmetric pulmonary edema or aspiration.
CT Head: No acute processes .
CT Torso: No PE Small R pleural effusion.
No acute intraabdominal findings.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Global left ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is mildly elevated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-5-13**], there is less tricuspid regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, ESRD on HD, and PVD with recent TMA ulcer s/p debridement, who presents with altered mental status and hypotension in the setting of HD catheter related VRE line sepsis.
# VRE Sepsis: Due to contaminated HD line.
Patient presented with altered mental status and hypotension requiring pressors (levophed) and high dose steroids in ICU.
No evidence of endocarditis on TTE, although was of poor quality.
Negative surveillance cultures and no new murmurs on exam or stigmata of endocarditis.
Patient underwent a TTE and subsequently a TEE to evaluate for possible endocarditis which was negative.
#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: ABG on presentation consistent with acute on chronic respiratory acidosis which improved on BiPAP and was continued on the floor.
#Altered Mental Status: Likely due to sepsis + hypercarbia.
Eventually recovered and was AOx3 and back to baseline status after sepsis and hypercarbia were both treated (see above) and when called out to the floor.
Not anticoagulated due to fall risk.
Held meds in setting of sepsis, but were restarted once hemodynamically stable (digoxin and metoprolol).
# ESRD on HD: Patient is s/p failed cadaveric renal transplant, and receives HD on TThSat.
Was noted to be confused and hypotensive at HD.
# PVD s/p TMA debridement: He is s/p surgery on [**5-11**] with wound vac placement.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] surgery was reconsulted regarding possible bone exposure and question of osteomyelitis.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] surgery replaced a wound vac which needs to be changed every three days.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to chronic osteoarthritis from obesity.
Does have history of septic arthritis of the knees in the past, but no effusions noted on exam.
Continued percocet prn for pain and monitored.
[**Month (only) 116**] be elevated in setting of recent infection.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**1-10**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain: please hold for sedation or RR < 12.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1' Diagnosis Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci Sepsis Delirium  2' Diagnosis End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis Obesity Hypoventilation Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating POs  On a wet to dry dressing, will need Wound vac when returning to [**Hospital3 2558**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion and low blood pressures.
You were diagnosed with a bacterial infection in the blood stream likely from your hemodialysis line.
Your HD line was replaced and you underwent a TEE to rule out endocarditis which was negative.
You will need to have your wound vac replaced when you are at rehab.
Return to the hospital or call your PCP if you experience any of the following symptoms: fever > 101 F, worsening confusion, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms not listed here concerning enough to warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2742**].
