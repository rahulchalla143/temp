Admission Date:  [**2176-10-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-10-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transfusion of packed red blood cells Upper endoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diverticulosis who presented with chest discofort and was found to have a gastrointestinal bleed.
In brief, the patient presented to the ED on [**10-17**] with right-sided, typical chest pain.
The pain was exacerbated by exertion, but he did not have any associated heart failure symptoms.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any nausea, diaphoresis, melena or hematochezia.
In the ED, he was found to have melena with a Hct of 21.
There, he had a positive NG lavage, and ischemic changes were noted on his EKG in the inferior and lateral leads.
Due to his bleeding and INR of 2.5, he was given 2 U prbc, 2 U FFP, and 10 mg SC Vitamin K, and he was admitted to the ICU.
After receiving blood, he had resolution of ECG changes.
He had an EGD performed on [**10-18**] that showed healing duodenal ulcer with no sign of recent bleeding.
On my interview, the patient denies any chest pain, respiratory difficulty, abdominal pain, further dark stools, nausea or vomiting, or any other concerns.
Atrial fibrillation: history of slow ventricular response, on Coumadin 2.
Hypertension 3.
CAD: [**1-11**] stress-MIBI showing ischemic EKG changes in inferior and lateral leads and MIBI showing a mild reversible inferior wall defect, medical management only 4.
CHF: ischemic cardiomyopathy (mildly depressed EF 50-55%) 5.
Melanoma: s/p excision [**4-11**] & [**2174-10-3**] R posterior    auricular region, + radiation treatments (last in [**12-14**]), concern for recurrence in [**3-13**] but pt refused further w/u 7.
Glaucoma 10.
Venous insufficiency 11.

Healing ulcer in the posterior bulb.
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus.
CXR ([**10-17**]):: Interval improvement in the previous possible lingular opacity with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECG ([**10-17**]): Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Labs on discharge: Hct 28.9 BMP remarkable for creatinine 1.6 INR 1.1  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old gentleman who presented with chest pain and likely demand ischemia in the setting of a hematocrit of 21 due to gastrointestinal bleeding, now with stable hematocrit and free of chest pain after transfusions.
# Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's EGD showed healing ulcers and changes consistent with gastritis.
He had a colonoscopy in [**2169**] which showed diverticulosis as well as a single polyp.
The patient was instructed to speak with his primary care physician regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat EGD (due to concern for Barrett's) and potentially a colonoscopy within the next 2-3 months.
Due to his low risk for rebleeding, the gastroenterology team felt comfortable with Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9533**] both his aspirin and coumadin.
The VNA should further instruct the patient regarding signs and symptoms of further bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient is well rate controlled naturally, with his usual pulse in the 50s range.
He did have some bradycardia to the high 30s while sleeping.
# CHF and CAD: On the day after arrival on the floor, the patient's home regimen of ACEi, nitrate, and lasix were restarted.
The patient remained chest pain free.
It is likely that Mr. [**Known lastname **] has fixed coronary lesions with demand ischemia which manifested itself when his hematocrit was so low.
# Fever: The patient did have low grade fevers on transfer to the floor without an elevated white blood count.
His chest x-ray is unchanged from last month with a vague lingular opacity but no other significant findings.
It is possible that this low grade temperature is due to atelectasis.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal bleed, likely secondary to gastritis Atrial fibrillation Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and comfortable on room air   Discharge Instructions: Please take all your medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room should you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, blood in your urine, stools, or vomiting, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, pain with urination, productive [**Hospital **], fever > 100.5, or any other concerns.
