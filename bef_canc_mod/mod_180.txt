In fact, she was unaware of having anything wrong, and says she came to the hospital because her grandson said she was slurring her speech.
She denies having a history of intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage; she denies any neurosurgery, head trauma, and prior stroke; she denies a history of internal bleeding; and she denies a history of intracranial neoplasm or vascular malformation.
On neuro ROS, she reports a headache, but still denies having any other deficit, including loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.

No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Because she still had significant deficits and had evidence of occlusion on CT, tPA at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg was administered (61 kg; 6 mg given as IV push, 55 mg infused over 60 minutes).

Pertinent Results: [**2201-1-16**] 05:21AM   GLUCOSE-117* NA+-138 K+-4.0 CL--99* TCO2-24 [**2201-1-16**] 05:15AM   UREA N-9 CREAT-0.7 [**2201-1-16**] 05:15AM   CK(CPK)-27 [**2201-1-16**] 05:15AM   CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-<0.01 [**2201-1-16**] 05:15AM   WBC-8.8 RBC-5.22 HGB-13.7 HCT-42.8 MCV-82 MCH-26.2* MCHC-32.0 RDW-15.3 [**2201-1-16**] 05:15AM   PT-12.9 PTT-30.7 INR(PT)-1.1  [**1-16**]: CTH: noncontrast head without evidence of acute ich.
[**1-16**]:CTA demonstrates apparent filling defect in right mca (3:212, 213) concerning for thrombus.
[**1-16**]: MRA: Focal area of narrowing and signal loss near the bifurcation of right middle cerebral artery, indicative of a thrombus seen on the earlier CT. MRI: Findings indicative of acute infarct in the distribution of right middle cerebral artery.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: After arrival to the SICU, pt with stable exam with L sided weakness 4+-5- in UMN pattern with L neglect both visual and sensory with right sided gaze preference.
By the time of discharge the patient merely had a left visual field cut, but was otherwise doing very well.
ECHO revealed moderate to severe stenosis of the aortic valve.
There was no clear cardioembolic source.
The aortic stenosis was not hemodynamically significant during this admission, but the patient was notified of the abnormality and the need for follow up.
The patient was noted to have an elevated LDL and was started on lipitor 80.
Medications on Admission: Albuterol/Atrovent INH 2 puffs tid prn SOB Fosamax 70 mg weekly Lipitor 20 mg daily Beconase AQ 1 spray [**Hospital1 **] prn Calcium 600/D 600/200 daily Fluoxetine 20 daily T,TH,[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]; 40 mg MWF Nifedipine SR 30 mg daily ASA 325 daily Prilosec 20 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

The patient still has a left homonymous hemianopsia.
These include, but are not limited to, weakness, numbness, slurred speech and vision changes.
Be aware that though the echocardiogram of your hear did not find a reason for your stroke, it did find severe dysfunction of your aortic valve.
