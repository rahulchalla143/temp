He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 111043**] for fever and hypoxia felt [**1-31**] RLL pneumonia, and treated with Flagyl, Vancomycin and Levofloxacin empirically, and then was re-admitted from [**Date range (3) 101313**] for multiresistant Klebsiella RLL PNA treated with 2 weeks imipenem.
However, several days after finishing imipenem ([**2120-1-25**]), he again developed fever and respiratory distress.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hosp on [**2-8**] and intubated for respiratory distress (suctioning revealed food-like substance).
[**2-9**] sputum showed many yeast and GNR, with rare GPR.
The patient was treated with imipenem and diflucan for possible recurrent klebsiella and fungal PNA.
He was also treated for flagyl for possible C. diff colitis given his chronic diarrhea (diarrhea on his previous [**Hospital1 18**] admission was C. diff negative).
He was extubated transiently but required reintubation on [**2-11**] for respiratory distress.
CXR from [**2-12**] showed R effusion and bilateral infiltrates.
On [**2-10**], LENI showed R DVT but IV heparin had to be stopped [**2-12**] due to acute hct drop from 28 to 24 with guaiac + stools.

PNA: Recurrent aspiration PNA, in setting of decreased MS. S/p extubation, stable.
INr on day of discharge was 1.5; spoke to attending about this who wished to maintain pt on coumadin 5 mg qd and check INR qd until theraptuic and adjust coumadin dose as needed.
HTN - The patient's nadolol was increased to a maximum of 80mg qd.
Volume status - The patient was noted to be increasingly volume overloaded after his transfer from the MICU.
Acute altered mental status, on top of dementia.
The etiology was unclear, and a full w/u was done by neurology without reversible cause shown.
Diarrhea - The patient had a chronic, C diff negative, diarrhea.
He was started on lactulose on this admission for possible hepatic encephalopathy contributing to altered MS, and he began producing some formed stools as well as diarrhea, when the lactulose was d/c'ed.
His continuing diarrhea was attributed most likely to his TF's.
DM - Continued RISS q6h and NPH 20 [**Hospital1 **].
