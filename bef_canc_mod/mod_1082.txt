His hospital courses have been complicated by DVT (completed 3 mos of lovenox therapy) and atrial fibrillation.
His most recent hospitalization was in [**11-19**], when he presented with fever to 103, leukocytosis, and elevated ESR/CRP.
No organism grew on blood cx, but given his h/o recurrent MRSA he was treated with IV vanc x8 weeks, completed in [**1-21**].

Imaging: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine without and with gad IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for progressive discitis at T12-L1 and possibly at L1-L2.
Probable abscess within the disc space at T12-L1.
Extensive epidural enhancement which may be related to prior surgery or infections.
No large epidural abscess is noted at this time.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is mild upper zone paraseptal emphysema (2:16).
A small left pleural effusion tracks along the dependent regions and the left major fissure (301b:63).
Bilateral dependent atelectasis is slightly worse on the left.
A left-sided PICC terminates at the lower SVC (2:21).
There is no pericardial effusion.
No large central pulmonary embolus is detected, though this examination is not optimized for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.
Scattered prominent and enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, including a prevascular node measuring 10 mm along the short axis (2:18), 11mm pre-and subcarinal nodes, and a 12 mm right hilar node.
There is also partial vertebrectomy of T12 through L2.
The tissue immediately adjacent to the surgical hardware is difficult to evaluate due to extensive streak artifacts.
There is no evidence of hardware failure.
There is expected post-surgical subcutaneous fat and soft tissue stranding, with a small foci of air (2:40).
No fluid collections are seen.
The second surgical approach is via the left flank, where there is soft tissue stranding at the entry site (2:57), and a partial left tenth rib resection (2:49).
A small focus of subcutaneous and intramuscular air is seen anteriorly (2:65).
Thickening of the left lateroconal fascia is present, with a small focus of air at the lateral-most aspect (2:75,78).
There is asymmetric thickening of the left psoas muscle (2:78), which appears to abut a relatively hypodense triangular-shaped prominence (2:80).
This may represent a small fluid collection, thickened muscle, or phlegmon.
No fluid collections are seen.
A coarse calcification overlying the left psoas muscle (2:77) may represent a surgically-related loose body, as this was not visualized on the [**2124-1-6**] CT examination.
The evaluation of the solid abdominal organs is limited due to extensive metallic streak artifacts.
A small hepatic cyst is seen near the falciform ligament (2:50).
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
The gallbladder, stomach, spleen, right adrenal gland, right kidney, pancreas, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal.
The left adrenal gland is not well visualized due to metallic artifacts.
A subcentimeter hypoenhancing cortical lesion within the left kidney (2:75) may represent a small cyst, but is too small to characterize.
Numerous prominent retroperitoneal and paraaortic lymph nodes are present (2:76,79).
There is no intra-abdominal ascites.
There is bony fusion of multiple lower lumbar vertebral bodies (301B:44), as seen on prior examinations.
The upper thoracic spine demonstrates mild degenerative change.
Post-vertebrectomy and fusion of the thoracolumbar spine, with post-surgical changes at both the midline posterior and left flank approach.
No definite fluid collections detected.
Inflammatory changes and soft tissue thickening along the left lateroconal fascia and posterior pararenal space may be postsurgical, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded with this technique.
Enlarged mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, likely reactive.
Small left pleural effusion.
Mild adjacent atelectasis.
Mild paraseptal emphysema.
Pathology: T12-L1 [**Year (4 digits) 500**], excision: Necrotic and viable [**Year (4 digits) 500**], cartilage and fibrotic tissue.
No active inflammation seen.
Four representative sections are submitted in cassettes A-D.   Brief Hospital Course: 58yo M with h/o recurrent MRSA infections with lumbar spine and right humerus involvement on chronic doxycycline for suppressive tx, IVDU and HCV without cirrhosis who presents with osteomyelitis of the spine.
The surgery was complicated by a significant amount of blood loss requiring PRBC transfusion.
He was afebrile on this regimen and did not have a leukocytosis at time of discharge.
#Pain-The acute pain service was consulted post-op for assistance with pain management.
# HCV: Stable, no evidence of decompensated cirrhosis during this hospitalization.
#Transitional: Per Infectious Disease request an ESR, CRP and Liver function tests were obtained prior to discharge for them to follow up considering Fluconazole was started for treatment.
