Brief Hospital Course: 34-year-old female with history of DMI, achilles avulsion s/p repair who is transferred from outside hospital with DKA s/b possible osteomyelitis; Also with nausea and some vomiting likely due to chronic gastroparesis.
# DKA: Most likely secondary to systemic stress from possibly right foot ulcer, as the patient is compliant with her medications.
She presented to the ICU on an insulin drip, with a closed anion gap and low glucose.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult felt that chronic poor glucose control and noncompliance likely played a role.
Pt discharged with lantus 9 U qhs and insulin sliding scale after having some asymptommatic hypoglycemic episodes on day of discharge(improved with meal)  She will call to have f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] center .
# Cellulitis: Initial concern for cellulitis vs. osteomyelitis of the right foot, which was unclear based on her history and information from OSH.
OSH wound cultures grew Staph aureus and Serratia Marcesans sensitive to levofloxacin so she was swiched to IV levofloxacin on [**8-15**].
Podiatry consult at this point did not clinically feel that she had OM and recommended f/u with OSH ortho for achilles surgery.
MRI showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Pt discharged on levaquin to complete a 7 day course(through [**8-24**])  # Anemia: Chronic but appears to be worse than baseline, but no apparent active bleeding.
Trending of hematocrit levels showed no changes; should be monitored to establish future baseline.
