She reports being compliant with her medication.
Her husband reports that she has been in the process of counting carbs over the past 2 weeks in preparation of transitioning to insulin pump due to poor glycemic control with insulin sliding scale.
Over the last one week, the patient reports URI symptoms including rhinorrhea, non-productive cough, sneezing x 1 week.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 35 y/o female with a h/o poorly controlled Type I DM HTN, CKD, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, depression, and osteoperosis who presents with DKA.
It is likely that the precipitant of the DKA was either a viral URI or noncompliance with insulin.
The patient has poorly-controlled DM with stage IV CKD (based on a recent biopsy), retinopathy and neuropathy.
Pt did still have signiifcant nausea and vomiting for a few days.
# ECG changes- Patient with T-wave flattening compared to prior ECG.
No signs of acute MI but given the global changes, metabolic abnormalities of DKA are likely causative.
Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath and required no further work-up.
Inactive Issues:  # Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.0, Baseline 1.0.
Renal biopsy on [**2139-9-15**] showed scarring consistent with stage IV diabetic nephropathy.
On discharge her creatinine was 1.0  # Peripheral neuropathy: Decreased sensation in lower extremities.
