Decreased vascular congestion and improved aeration.
Faint residual opacity at left lung base may represent persistant infection or atelectasis.
Persistent but improved multifocal pneumonia as compared to [**2150-9-27**].
New bilateral small pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic process.
A 2 x 1.6 cm right thyroid nodule is present.
[**9-30**] RLE U/S: no DVT .
[**9-28**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No acute intracranial findings.
Mild parenchymal atrophy and small vessel ischemic disease.
# Respiratory failure: The pt presented to [**Hospital 730**] Hospital on [**9-27**] c/o respiratory distress.
CXR was c/w pulmonary edema and the patient became hypotensive.
A CXR revealed multifocal pneumonia and an ECHO showed a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, normal LV systolic function (LVEF>55%), and no clinically significant valvular disease.
She continued to improve clinically and remained afebrile with an O2 sat of 95-97% on 2L (her baseline at home).
The pt has remained afebrile with negative blood cultures.
Her lungs are clear with no sputum production.
UA was negative and stool was negative for C. diff.
# Rhabdomyolysis: CK peaked to 34,000 but has been trending down and is currently 716.
She denies myalgias, although reports weakness in her arms and legs with difficulty lifting extremities off the bed.
Muscle weakness is likely due to ICU myopathy since pt has been bedbound for such an extended length of time.
Neurology evaluated the patient and believe that it is due to sciatic nerve impingement.
# Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline cr ~ 1.4): On admission the pt's creatine was 2.3, and peaked to 3 while in the MICU in the setting of critical illness.
# Anemia: Patient?????
Borderline microcytic/normocytic pattern.
# Abnormal LFTs: The pt was noted to have a rise in her AST, ALT, and Alkaline phosphatase while in the MICU.
She has no known h/o liver or biliary disease and was asymptomatic.
# Thyroid nodule: On the CT chest on [**2150-10-1**] an incidental 2 x 1.6 cm thyroid nodule was seen which was not visualized on a previous CT chest on [**2143-10-17**].
# CAD s/p RCA stent: Continued plavix 75 mg daily.
# Diastolic heart failure: Patient was hypervolemic in the setting of critical illness in the MICU.
Acetaminophen-Codeine #3, 1 tab TID PRN pain 14.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] HealthCare at [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Pneumonia - Rhabdomyolosis - Anemia - Myopathy - Right sciatic nerve impingement - Thyroid nodule Secondary: - Diastolic heart failure - Restrictive lung disease - Obstructive sleep apnea - CAD s/p stent - Diabetes - Chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress and found to have pnemonia which we treated with an antibiotic called levofloxacin.
During your hospitalization you developed right foot weakness and "pins and needles" which is due to compression of the sciatic nerve.
You also developed muscle weakness.
