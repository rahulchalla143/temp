The electroencephalogram was consistent with encephalopathy, no focal activity indicating seizures.
Additionally, the patient had occasional episodes of low blood pressure, which resolved without intermittent treatment.
A urinalysis was done which ultimately grew out Klebsiella culture and she was started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for this.
From [**3-8**], the patient continued on ciprofloxacin and had no new issues.

This has been a major issue while in house.
