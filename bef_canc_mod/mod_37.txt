At the outside hospital the patient had investigation for two month history of abdominal pain which showed mainly epigastric.
This work-up included abdominal CT which showed thickened duodenal valve, 2 cm adrenal mass, question of colon lesion consistent with intermittent intestinal obstruction.
In the hospital the patient had work-up which included CT angiogram due to abnormal EKG initially which revealed pulmonary embolism and patient had been started on Heparin.
Her initial EKG revealed T wave inversion at V2 and V6 plus ST depression so she was also admitted for rule out MI.
CT also revealed dilated common bile duct up to 18 mm.
She had two episodes of coffee ground emesis on [**1-1**], became hypotensive and bradycardic and acute EGD was performed which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the lower third, ulcer in the stomach, body and antrum, blood in the stomach and anterior vault.
There was large oozing clot in the duodenal bulb.
Anticoagulation was discontinued and patient was started on Protonix drip and had been transferred to medical Intensive Care Unit due to hypotension and active bleeding.
EGD at that time revealed esophagitis, ulcers in the antrum which were injected with Epinephrine and also posterior bulb injection and thermal therapy, a large inferior posterior duodenal ulcer with oozing refractory to injection.
For this reason the patient underwent angiography revealing the source of bleeding and underwent duodenal gastric artery embolization.
Other studies during the hospital course included chest x-ray which revealed widened mediastinum secondary to tortuous and dilated thoracic aorta and bibasilar atelectasis.
CTA revealed moderate intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, left pulmonary artery embolism and left adrenal mass.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed no DVT, KUB revealed no obstruction and chest x-ray on [**1-5**] revealed bilateral small pleural effusion with consolidation of the lower lobe presenting either atelectasis or infection.
