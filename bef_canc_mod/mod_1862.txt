Admission Date:  [**2111-6-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-6-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old African American female with HIV, last CD4 count 240 and viral load of undetectable in [**2111-4-19**], and a history of Factor VIII deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for shortness of breath.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening prior to presentation on [**2111-6-9**], when she began having chief complaint of shortness of breath.
This shortness of breath subsequently progressed and became very acute on the morning of presentation approximately 6:00 a.m.  She took her usual MDIs but had no relief.
Upon arrival, the patient was noted to be tachypneic and wheezing.
On review of systems, the patient's granddaughter had an upper respiratory infection.
The patient denied any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or headache.
She denied any rhinorrhea but did have mild pharyngitis, sinus congestion.
She has a chronic nonproductive cough which is unchanged.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient was given nebulizers times two with no improvement.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates.
HIV diagnosed in [**2104**], last CD4 approximately 230 in     [**2111-4-19**], with a viral load undetectable.
Diabetes mellitus times twenty-five years.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic bronchitis.
Asthma since childhood, no history of intubation     required.
History of renal failure secondary to volume depletion.
In general, the patient was an ill appearing black female sitting upright, tachypneic and short of breath with short sentences.
No lymphadenopathy was appreciated.
Chest examination - expiratory wheezes noted, decreased breath sounds throughout, no stridor, no crackles.
Cardiovascular examination - tachycardia, II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border.
Abdominal examination is soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no guarding, no rebound.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically, the patient is [**Year (4 digits) 3584**] and oriented, responds to commands, speaks in short sentences.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140, left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversion and ST depression in lead V5 through V6.
T wave inversions noted in lead III.
Chest x-ray revealed the heart size normal, diffuse bilateral interstitial process with septal lines, pulmonary edema versus interstitial pneumonitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 64 year old female with HIV, diabetes mellitus, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presenting with acute shortness of breath.
Cardiac - The patient was admitted originally to the Medicine Service and placed on telemetry for rule out myocardial infarction protocol.
The patient subsequently ruled in for myocardial infarction with shortness of breath.
Echocardiogram was obtained which revealed ejection fraction of less than 40% with wall motion abnormality consistent with ischemia.
That evening after cardiology consultation, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and CK enzymes subsequently increased to 1600 with positive MB index and positive troponin greater than 50.
The patient was found with agonal respirations.
A tight mid left circumflex lesion was seen.
Given the fact that the patient had acute renal failure post cardiac catheterization and unable to tolerate ace inhibitor, the patient was started on Hydralazine and Isordil in order to decrease morbidity and mortality.
Congestive heart failure - The patient during hospital course had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure from a blood transfusion.
Upon initial admission, cardiac echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of less than 40% and wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia.
Repeat echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 40% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and akinesis of the basal inferior and lateral walls with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Neurology - The patient upon admission was relatively [**Name2 (NI) 3584**] and oriented times three, however, during hospital course status post cardiac catheterization and intubation and acute renal failure, the patient's mental status subsequently waxed and waned and the patient was subsequently confused most of the time.
Neurology service was consulted and the patient's mental status was thought secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy and related to her uremia and other medical conditions.
The patient's mental status was subsequently improved with resolution of her uremia.
Pulmonary - The patient was originally admitted to the Medicine service, however, when the patient became hypotensive and was emergently intubated, the patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma and was continued on nebulizer treatment and continued her MDIs with good effect.
Infectious disease - The patient has a history of HIV positivity since [**2104**], on highly active antiretroviral therapy with her last CD4 count of 230 and a viral load which was undetectable.
However, when the patient's acute renal failure subsequently began, the patient's medication therapy was renally adjusted.
Renal - The patient had an episode of acute renal failure, status post cardiac catheterization.
The patient's renal failure was thought secondary to possibly contrast nephropathy, cardiac catheterization versus emboli from cardiac catheterization to the renal glomerulus.
The patient's creatinine subsequently began increasing and subsequently plateaued at 6.1 to 6.2 and remained stable at that time level.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and was continued on fingerstick glucoses and sliding scale insulin with good effect.
Hematology - The patient had a history of acquired Factor VIII deficiency.
However, the patient required transfusion of packed red blood cells secondary to her anemia.
However, during transfusion, the patient had subsequently flash pulmonary edema requiring Lasix therapy and intubation.
As per hematology/oncology, transfusion of packed red blood cells will be held off until absolutely necessary due to the fact that the patient has a predisposition for congestive heart failure.
Lines, access - The patient has a poor peripheral access.
During her stay in the Medial Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a right internal jugular triple lumen as a central line for venous access.
Myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous     transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent placement to     the mid left circumflex.
Acute renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
