Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
Early anterior R wave transition.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Moderate left hydronephrosis secondary to a 14 x 10 mm obstructing stone in the pelviureteric junction.
Possible superimposed infection in the left renal collecting system.
No evidence of aortic dissection or bowel ischemia.
Unchanged stenosis of the celiac origin, with likely retrograde flow in the distal celiac trunk.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 16232**] is a 75 y/o F with a recent history of ischemic colitis, CAD, OSA not on home bipap who presented with abominal pain found to have an obstructing renal stone, urinary tract infection and sepsis.
#) Sepsis due to UTI: urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis as the primary source from the obstructive renal stone, found to have high grade E.coli bacteremia.
Her first night in the ICU was complicated by significant hypotension that was IV fluid responsive requiring large volume fluid resuscitation.
Pressures remained stable and patient was discharged home with IV antibiotic therapy to complete a 14 day course of ceftriaxone (Cipro was deferred given the Flecainide cross reactivity and possible gut edema from her CHF).
#) Obstructing Renal Stone: large renal stone on CT 1.4cm x 1cm, percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed on the night of admission.
#) Acute Renal Failure: moderate amount of hydronephrosis on the left, Cr still within normal limits but up from her baseline of 0.6 to 0.7.
#) Acute diastolic CHF- On transfer to the floor the patient was noted to be markedly volume overloaded.
