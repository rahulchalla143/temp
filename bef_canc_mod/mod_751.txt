HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of known coronary artery disease with three VD, refused CABG in the past, hypertension, high cholesterol, who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and respiratory distress to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 am on the day of admission when she developed sudden shortness of breath.
Upon arrival to [**Location (un) **], the patient denied any chest pain, but noted shortness of breath.
CAD with three VD.
The patient had a catheterization one year ago that showed as follows:  LAD with a 99% proximal stenosis, circumflex with a 90% discrete proximal stenosis, RCA with a total occlusion in the proximal segment.
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  The patient DEVELOPS A SKIN REACTION FROM PLAVIX.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 57 with normal axis and normal intervals with Q wave in three and T-wave flattening in 1, AVL, and V6.
Chest x-ray:  ETT tube in place with pulmonary edema and possible right upper lobe infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 87-year-old female with known severe coronary artery disease, who presented with acute onset of pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and acidosis requiring intubation at an outside hospital.
By arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] the acidosis and hypoxia were improved status post intubation and diuresis.
Plavix was not resumed due to a skin reaction the patient develops with Plavix.
The patient was able to be extubated on the day after admission without difficulty.
She was transferred to the floor and later that evening, the same day of extubation, she again developed flash pulmonary edema that was unresponsive to 120 IV Lasix.
Of note, on the second intubation, she again had a respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.11.
She also showed some ST depression in 1, 2, AVL, V5 and V6 during that episode.
The rales have significantly improved on examination, such that on the 31st, she just had basilar rales and she was over one liter and one half negative for her fluid balance.
Beta-blocker was not restarted due to her bradycardia in the 50s to 60s.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with one episode of SVT on telemetry and no other events.
She developed flash pulmonary edema again and required intubation.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with elevated Amulase and lipase.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially presented with elevated white count and a question of infiltrate on chest x-ray.
On repeat x-ray this resolved and sputum cultures were negative for infection.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a thrombocytosis most likely reactive.
