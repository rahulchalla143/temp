Admission Date:  [**2117-6-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-6-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-7-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Bactrim / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy (x3) / tracheostomy placement  History of Present Illness: HPI: 68yoM with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, s/p PPM/ICD, esophageal ca who presented to OSH on [**2117-6-3**] with respiratory distress.
He was given low dose dopamine and diuretics for his CHF and brady/relative hypotension.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was found to be afebrile with stable vs but somnolent on appearance.
Given the hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolent appearance, the pt was transferred to the ICU for further care.
In the ICU the pt was intubated for impending respiratory failure and hypersomnulance.
CAD s/p CABG 3v in 11'[**13**] ---LIMA --> LAD, SVG --> OM, and SVG --> RCA ---Ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF = 40%), s/p ICD placement in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2114**] 2. s/p mitral valve replacement (Carbomedics mechanical prosthesis) in [**10/2114**] 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hypertension 5.
Diabetes 6.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibriosis s/p Pulmonary Rehab at New [**Hospital1 13199**] Rehab in '[**15**] ---severe restriction on his pulmonary function testing, which is markedly worse than his preoperative TLC of 75% predicted.
Some of this restriction may reflect worsened fibrotic lung disease or it may be due to some element of pleural thickening releated to his previous problems with pleural effusions as per his pulmonologist.
Stage II esophageal cancer T3, N0, MO, status post XRT, chemotherapy and esophagectomy.
ECG: Anterolateral TWI that were present in previous EKGs, bradycardia with rate of 40, appears to have high grade AV block with a junctional rhythm .
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the distal third of the left ventricle.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Aortic valve: leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Pericardium: there is no pericardial effusion.
The LMCA had a distal 40-50% distal stenosis.
The LAD had severe ostial and proximal diffuse diseased and was totally occluded after D1.
The D1 branch had a 70% stenosis at its ostium.
The LCX had a 40% stenosis at the origin of a large OM1.
The OM1 branch had serial 70% lesions proximally and mid vessel with distal luminal irregularities.
The RCA had a mid-vessel tubular 60% stenosis and a 70% stenosis just before the RPDA.
There were luminal irregularities in the PDA and RPL.
There was anterobasal hypokinesis, anterolateral akinesis, apical dyskinesis/akinesis, inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis.
There was mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, esophageal cancer, MVR and bradycardia s/p PPM/ICD who presented with somnolence, hypercarbic respiratory failure, bradycardia, hypotension and likely urosepsis.
Pt ultimately developed worsening tracheal secretions, resulting in repeated bronchoscopy, then on [**6-19**] developed severe tracheal obstruction, c/b bleeding, resulting in worsening hypoxemia and ultimately PEA.
ACLS x 30 min, without recovery.
* Respiratory failure: Patient was transferred from an OSH for possible pacemaker replacement and had significant respiratory distress at presentation.
He had been on Bipap at the OSH but had worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure upon arrival here.
The patient had a h/o of severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but it was unclear what the underlying insult was.
Initially cardiogenic vs. septic process was debated.
He was ruled out for MI with three sets of CEs.
He also had episodes of tachypnea and tachycardia but these improved with sedation.
He completed 8 days of levaquin to cover for a PNA and had sputum cx that had rare growth of coag + staph, but this was thought to be colonization.
On the monring of [**6-19**] pt was noted to have decreased tidal volumes and found to be in respiratory distress with O2 sats of 97% on 100% O2.
Manual bagging was commenced, an an emergent bronchoscopy was performed which revealed ball-valve clot/soft-tissue obstruction at distal trach with complete luminal occlusion during exhalation.
Pt subsequently developed progressive hypoxemia and bronch then revealed diffuse bleeding from above and below.
*Hypotension/sepsis: Pt was hypotensive at admission.
He was known to have a UTI at the OSH, so it was thought that hypotension was potentially [**1-28**] to urosepsis.
His CXR also showed a consolidation.
His OSH records showed growth of enteroccocus in the urine, sensitive to vancomycin.
His cultures here later showed growth of methicillan resitant coag negative staph in a bcx from [**6-8**] and enterococcus in the urine on [**6-8**] as well.
Initially it was unclear whether pt's hypotension was [**1-28**] to sepsis or cardiac source.
As mentioned above he had nl EF and no evidence of cardiac ischemia.
SVO2 was high , also suggesting sepsis and positive culture data was further c/w this.
B/c he had bacteremia and sepsis in the setting of a MVR, there was concern for endocarditis.
TEE was negative for endocarditis and all abx were stopped at that time.
His ucx from [**6-13**] showed continued growth of enterococcus so foley was changed on [**6-16**] and ucx re-checked.
*Bradycardia: Patient was initially admitted to cardiology for w/u of bradycardia and possible pacemaker replacement.
EKGs demonstrated several different rhythms from NSR and atrial fibrillation to 2nd degree heart block.
EKG here at one point showed bradycardia with high degree heart block and junctional escape rhythm.
* Hypernatremia: Na was slightly elevated at around 146 at times.
he had free water fluid boluses in his TFs to replace his free H20 defecit.
He was then diuresed with  good results and only slight elevation in Cr.
He had guiac + stools in the setting of being on heparin but had been seen by GI and a decision was made that he did not need to be scoped at this time.
He also had some bloody respiratory secretions which could also have contributed to slow [**Month/Year (2) **] loss.
* Abdominal distension: Pt was noted to have abd distension during his stay.
Pt had KUB that was negative for obstruction and abd distension has decreased after having BMs.
*CAD: Pt has h/o CAD s/p CABG.
Allergies: Amoxicillin / Bactrim / Keflex  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: respiratory failure / pulseless electrical activity  Discharge Condition: deceased.
