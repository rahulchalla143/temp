Three nights prior to admission he became confused and this progressively worsened and he became weaker.
Two night prior to admission he was found to have a new oxygen requirement and this increased over the next day, and he became febrile.
In the ED, he was febrile to 102, hypotensive, tachypneic, and confused and was intubated as his respiratory status continued to decline.
Additionally in the ED he was noted to be hyperkalemic with K+6.0 and peaked T-waves on ECG that resolved with insulin +D50 and calcium gluconate  Surgery was consulted for possible small bowel obstruction.
Evaluation revealed severe fecal impaction, but no SBO.

Rads: KUB [**7-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1)  No definite evidence of obstruction.
There is no free air seen in the portion of the abdomen imaged.
There is also apparent rectal wall thickening.
The findings are consistent with a fecal impaction.
2)  Dense consolidation in both lower lobes which contain high attenuation material, suspicious for aspiration.
3)  Extremely limited assessment of the abdomen due to respiratory motion and beam hardening artifact from the patient's arms.
4)  Peripherally calcified cystic structure in the upper pole of the right kidney with Hounsfield units not consistent with a simple cyst.
5) 7 mm non-obstructing right renal stone and tiny 1 mm non-obstructing left renal stone.
No evidence of hydronephrosis on this limited exam.
There is continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 78yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, Parkinson's Dz, chronic back pain presented in sepsis, diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and severe fecal impaction.
Sepsis:  Sepsis was thought to be due to MRSA pneumonia vs aspiration event in setting of partial small bowel obstruction brought on by fecal impaction.
He also completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin/metronidazole for suspected GI source.
This was discontinued on day 5 as the patient was persistantly hypertensive at that time.
Vancomycin was dosed according to level given his concurrent renal failure.
ARF:  He presented with an acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
This was felt to be due to prerenal etiology given his recent episodes of emesis and fever prior to presentation.
Additionally, hypertension improved with control of the patient's chronic pain.
Hyperglycemia:  patient was hyperglycemic in setting of sepsis and with concurrent steroid use.
He was treated with an insulin gtt for tight glucose control.
He required repeated soap suds enemas and manual disimpaction.
He was discharged on a standing bowel regimen of colace and senna consistent with his outpatient regimen.
Parkinson's disease:  the patient's Sinemet was held on day two for concern that it can cause ileus, leading to worsening constipation and possible SBO.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Sepsis Altered Mental Status Fecal impaction Acute renal failure Secondary: Parkinson's disease Hypertension Chronic lower back pain  Discharge Condition: Improved, oriented, stable off oxygen, with improving renal function  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ED for fevers, shortness of breath, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
