He also was experiencing dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.
He also noted chills and cough productive of white yellow sputum and decreased energy.
He was unable to assess his ankle swelling and does not check his weight.
He had been admitted for CHF in [**2190**], otherwise his CHF had been relatively well controlled on his home medication.
He appeared fluid overloaded but had SBP 90-100, so the ED gave 500 cc bolus and then Lasix 60mg IV.
He had a CXR which showed no acute process.
On review of systems, he has had a history fo bleeding at time of surgery, but denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains,hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
There are low lung volumes resulting in vascular crowding.
There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
The heart is slightly enlarged.
No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lung could be pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Pleural effusion on the left is likely, small-to-moderate.
No pneumothorax.
There is mild vascular congestion.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Atelectasis in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe has resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] was a 63 year-old man with multiple medical problems including obesity, diastolic congestive heart failure, CRI, vWD ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] disease) who presented after a week of increased fatigue and shrotness of breath.
# Dyspnea: Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] was admitted to the cardiology service for presumed decompensated congestive heart failure.
Soon after admission, he became obtunded and was found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure with a pCO2 of 111.
A chest X-ray obtained post intubation was concerning for pneumonia and he was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin on hospital day 2 ([**11-26**].)
Attempts to wean him from the ventilator initially failed secondary to hypoventilation.
He was subsequently transfered to the general medicine floor where he did well though he continued to have desaturations.
He was also provided a trial of CPAP overnight to treat his suspected obstructive sleep apnea.
In review of his medical record on the 6th hospital day, it was determined that Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] had evidence of pneumonia prior to intubation and therefore did not need continued treatment with vancomycin and it was discontinued.
He remained afebrile on the medicine floor and was evaluated by the physical therapy service.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] had a baseline creatinine of 1.6.
# Obesity Hypoventilation: Mr. [**Known lastname 99999**] was morbidly obese with chest wall compliance limited secondary to body habitus.
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: His right sided heart failure likely contributes to his respiratory dysfunction.
He has mild pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram from 3/[**2194**].
# VWD: Continued on home dose of aminocaproic acid  Medications on Admission: aminocaproic acid [AMICAR]as needed for uncontrolled bleeding carvedilol 25 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **] furosemide 40 mg Tablet daily lisinopril 10 mg Tablet daily sildenafil 100 mg Tablet 1/4-1 tab daily as needed B complex vitamins [B Complex] 1 capsule daily Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg (1,500 mg)-200 unit [**Unit Number **] tab daily.
Target SpO2 above 90%   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were found to have a pneumonia and received antibiotics that helped your breathing.
