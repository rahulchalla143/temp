No evidence of consolidations suggesting pneumonia.
No parenchymal opacities.
No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
TTE [**2156-10-14**]: - Peak Ao grad 39, mean grad 20, peak velocity 3.1, Ao area 1.1 cm2 -There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %) secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis/akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 9 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
-Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-8-6**], there has been significant worsening of left ventricular and right ventricular contractile function.
[**10-15**] NCHCT- No evidence of acute intracranial process.
[**10-16**] NCHCT- No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Minimal ascites.
No acute process to explain patient's symptoms identified.
-The mass in the left lower quadrant, though called a hematoma on prior studies, has the appearance of a rejected prior transplanted kidney, clinical correlation recommended.
TEE [**10-20**]: negative for endocarditis .
Focus of uptake within the right hemipelvis which may be within the region of the transplanted kidney.
The transplant could be further [**Month/Year (2) 6349**] with an ultrasound to determine presence of infectious process such as and focal infection of abscess in the region of the transplanted right kidney.
Transplant renal U/S [**10-28**]: Normal appearance of renal transplant, apart from mild elevation of RI's.

Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo female with extensive past medical history including severe AS, AFIB, ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant, s/p OLTx [**2153-7-21**], presenting from OSH with worsening anemia and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
>> Active Issues:  #Comfort Measures: Pt had PEA cardiac arrest on [**11-2**] during HD.
Pt's blood pressure remained lower than baseline, most likely secondary to worsening cardiac function and developing sepsis.
On [**11-6**], the patient developed worsening sepsis most likely secondary to known UTI and PNA.
DDx includes prerenal azotemia from some combination of dehydation from poor PO, poor forward flow from systolic heart failure (possibly with some contribution from clinically severe AS), and lasix use.
Gave daily MIVF at 100cc/hr for 1 L daily until pt starting to develop signs of volume overload and increased O2 requirements.
Pt with persistently elevated BUN in 120s.
Pt's BUN downtrended and signs of uremia improved, most notably AMS.
# ESBL Klebsiella UTI: Longstanding history of multi drug resistant UTI's in the past.
Pt with carbapenem allergy.
UA on adm positive and ucx on adm with klebsiella growth.
Repeat ucx on [**10-18**] showed persistence of multi-drug resistant Klebsiella likely colonization in the setting of clearing of pyuria on UA.
Pt with repeat UAs on [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] with significant pyuria and many bacteria.
# Leukocytosis: Chronic leukoctyosis dating back to [**2153**] with baseline WBC count [**12-24**] rarely into 9-11 range.
Etiology of persistent leukocytosis unclear but could be related to chronic prednisone use vs chronic infection, including possibility of recurrent UTIs with low-grade pyelo.
Pt initially admitted with UTI with clearing on UA, then recurrent positive UA from [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] after completing 10d course of tigecycline.
Pt with CXR neg for infiltrate, negative cdiff, stool cx neg, no acute process on CT abd/pelvis and no evidence of endocarditis on TEE.
CSF not c/w infection.
Tagged WBC scan showing focus in nose and RLQ.
Concern for focal infection of transplant kidney like abscess but no evidence of such on renal U/S.
Pt afebrile during course.
WBC persistently elevated in 13-16 range; WBC count normalized [**10-31**].
# AMS: Pt had dizziness while toileting and fell and hit head against wall reportedly (unwitnessed) on [**10-15**].
Pt subsequently had worsening of MS on [**10-22**] during which she became more lethargic, A&Ox1-2 and increased myoclonus and twitches.
EEG was attached and showed moderate diffuse background slowing c/w encephalopathy.
There were no electrographic seizures.
EEG showed increased sharp wave activity suggestive of brain irritability.
AMS thought likely to be result of uremia vs infection vs med-related.
Thought that may also be component of severe depression with catatonia as pt perseverating and some waxy flexibility on exam.
Psych [**Month/Year (2) 6349**] the pt and agreed may be component of catatonia but treatment would be benzos; held off on benzos in the setting of lethargy.
Pt also noted to have elevated TSH to 6.9 and low T4 and T3, but free T4 WNL so did not adjust levothyroxine dose per endocrine recs.
Pt had fluoro-guided LP on [**2156-10-24**] after failed attempt at bedside on [**10-23**] per above.
Pt started on temp HD [**10-26**] for uremia mgmt.
CXR c/w volume overload and vascular congestion, pulm edema and pleural effusions.
HD for fluid removal.
# Drop in plts in the setting of abnormal RBC smear: Plt count has decreased from 500-600s to low 200s where stable.
1+ schistocytes on smear [**10-25**] as well as 8% nRBCs.
H/H stable but elevated MCV and RDW with nRBCs.
DIC and hemolysis labs unremarkable.
Heme consult for assistance in interpretting smear and believes abnormal smear most likely result of chronic infection causing persistent leukocytosis.
Schistocytes likely from severe valvular disease.
Unclear etiology but could be related to chronic steroid use vs chronic infection.
# Failure to thrive: pt initially with poor PO intake from depression, which worsened in setting of AMS.
# Diarrhea: C diff and stool cultures negative.
Diarrhea resolved.
# H/o diastolic HF (past EF45%), clinically severe Aortic Stenosis s/p AO valvuloplasty: Cards consulted.
TTE showing decrease in EF to 35% with apical hypokinesis.
Cardiology reviewed previous caths and does not feel there are areas that potentially could be intervened on.
No evidence of volume overload on CXR or exam initially.
Cards said that pt is not candidate for revascularization after review of cath from [**8-/2156**] and valvular disease gradients not severe enough to merit valvular repair.
Imdur discontinued in the setting of restarting HD to allow more room with BPs for fluid removal.
>> Chronic issues: # S/p Renal/Liver Transplant: on tacrolimus and prednisone.
Pt continued on [**Name9 (PRE) **] and [**Name9 (PRE) 4532**] for hepatic artery stent.
Decreased glargine to 8U qhs for bottoming out fingersticks in 70s.
No signs of active bleeding.
Low iron in setting of normal ferritin and transferrin may suggest some component of iron deficiency anemia though seems less likely in setting of normal MCV and MCHC.
Likely some degree of anemia of chronic disease.
Started trial iron supplementation in setting of low iron sat.
# History of AFIB s/p PPM.
Endocrine consulted in re: to mgmt of hypothyroidism in setting of AMS.
Lactulose 30 mL PO Q8H:PRN constipation   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Acute on chronic renal failure Complicated UTI  Secondary diagnoses: s/p renal-liver transplant Chronic diastolic heart failure Systolic heart failure Severe aortic stenosis   Discharge Condition: Deceased
