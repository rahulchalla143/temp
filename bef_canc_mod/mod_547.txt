Per the patient and her mother, the patient had been having intermittent SOB and congestion for a couple of weeks, though no complaints of chest pain.
This morning the patient became persistently short of breath and complained of a substernal chest pain.
The pt had a CTA showing massive pulmonary emboli and RV strain.
She had an EKG showing sinus tach, partial RBBB, TWI inf ant/lat.
On the floor, the pt was VS afebrile HR 120s, SBP in the 90s, satting 99% on 3L.
She denied CP, endorsed mild SOB but said she felt improved from the am.

EKG: sinus tach 121 NA partial RBBB TWI inf ant/lat no STEMI c/w R heart strain .
This includes large saddle embolus, a portion which is folded in the left pulm artery and a portion of which extends into and occlude the descending R pulmonary artery.
Multiple segmental pulmonary emboli are seen in the R upper lobe and subsegmental pulmonary emboli are seen through the left lung, especially at the base.
Evidence of R ventricular straing with dilatation of the ventricle and bowing of the septum.
[**10-29**] CT head: no intracranial bleed .
+ non-occlusive DVT of right superficial femoral vein with reconstitution at the level of the popliteal vein 2. no DVT in left lower extremity .
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is "sparing" of the RV apex from systolic dysfunction because of tethering to the LV, consistent with acute pulmonary hypertension ("[**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign").
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, most c/w acute pulmonary hypertension.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-6**], RV dilation and systolic dysfunction are new.
[**Hospital1 18**] Microbiology: [**2145-10-30**] Urine culture: > 100,000 E. coli   Brief Hospital Course: 33F with hx of NHL (at 3yo) s/p XRT in remission, radiation induced Meningioma s/p resection [**6-16**] c/b L pontine stroke who presents from OSH with complaints of CP and SOB, found to have saddle PE and RLE DVT.
# Saddle PE: The pt presented with SOB and CP at outside hospital and found to have saddle embolus.
She had a new 2-3L O2 requirement, sinus tachycardia to the 110s-120s, and dilated right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction.
Given her hemodynamic stability and her recent brain surgery, she did not meet criteria for lytic therapy.
However, given her severe RV strain and RLE DVT, an IVC filter was placed on [**2145-10-29**].
She was transferred to the general medicine floor on [**2145-10-30**] after resolution of her oxygen requirement, though had mild persisting tachycardia related to her RV failure.
Heme/Onc felt that this Pt's blood clots count as a provoked event given her immobilization due to her stroke.
# RLE DVT: Pt with RLE DVT likely [**3-10**] hemiparesis and immobility.
Heme/Onc consult felt that IVC filter should ideally be removed after several months of anticoagulation if Pt does not have any further symptoms to minimize long-term consequences of retained IVC filter (further clot formation behind the filter).
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  She had plentiful leuks and bacteria on UA.
# Meningioma s/p resection c/b stroke: Patient has significant deficit subsequent to surgery, however improvement of strength and independence with rehab.
# s/p Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (at 3yo): Deemed to be in remission by inpatient Oncology consult.
No further imaging necessary.
She complained of urinary retention on presentation to the medicine floor.
Her oxybutynin was discontinued in light of recent urinary tract infection out of concern that the patient's urinary retention may have contributed.
Pt's oxybutynin was restarted after she completed her course of ciprofloxacin for UTI due to incontinence.
# chronic hypokalemia: thought to be due to several month course of steroids for her meningioma and post-op causing adrenal suppression.
