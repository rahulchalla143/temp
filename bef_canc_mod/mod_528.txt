Admission Date: [**2151-6-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2151-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old woman with a history of locally advanced Stage 3B gastric cancer status post subtotal gastrectomy who presents with febrile neutropenia and diarrhea.
The patient was initially diagnosed in [**2151-2-14**] when her workup of weight loss and abdominal distention led to a GI evaluation.
She had a subtotal gastrectomy in [**Month (only) 958**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] postoperative course including sepsis, intubation and small bowel obstruction requiring several re-explorations.
VRE infection and HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA, without clear evidence of thrombosis.
Since starting chemotherapy, the patient has noted worsening fatigue, nausea and diarrhea.
The night prior to admission, she spiked a fever to 101 with chills and came in on the day of admission for further evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was positive for shortness of breath, nausea, URI symptoms since the 5-FU started.
She is status post subtotal gastrectomy in [**2151-3-15**] that was complicated by sepsis and respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, encephalopathy and abdominal abscess.
HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA without thrombosis.
Polycystic kidney disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Status post lower mandible resection with prosthesis several years ago.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history if negative for malignancy.
Father has polycystic kidney disease.
In general, she was tired but in no acute distress.
Head and neck exam showed mild thrush but moist oropharynx.
Neck showed no jugular venous distention.
Lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases but no crackles or wheezes.
Heart was regular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest film showed patchy atelectasis of the left base.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Febrile neutropenia:  There was no clear identifiable source.
Given the patient's copious mucus secretion and mucositis and neutropenia, she was covered empirically with cefepime.
After several days, her absolute neutrophil count rose and she became afebrile and there were no further infectious disease complications over the course of her admission.
Altered mental status/neuro:  Towards the end of the first week of her admission, when her counts had recovered, the patient became delirious.
At first, she was inattentive and this progressed rapidly to becoming very altered and nonresponsive.
Initially, the concern was for infection and so she had a torso CT with contrast which did not show any evidence for abscess or infection in her chest or abdomen.
She then had a head MRI which did not disclose any acute abnormality or explain her altered mental status.
There was no evidence for metastases.
The following day, the patient became rigid and was very lethargic.
At this point, a neuro consult was obtained who thought the differential diagnosis included paraneoplastic disease leading to altered sensorium.
The following day, the patient became progressively more unresponsive and so an EEG was performed.
The patient was started on Dilantin, while improving her EEG, did not improve her mental status.
There was no evidence for further status epilepticus on the EEG and her mental status slowly improved.
She is significantly below her baseline but improved from when she initially developed these symptoms.
She is at risk for aspiration.
