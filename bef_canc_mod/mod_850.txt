Chest x-ray showed a left lower opacity.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for hemodialysis for Lithium toxicity.
Schizophrenia diagnosed at age 17.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Schizophrenia and a father deceased at age 52 secondary to coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was intubated, unresponsive to pain with myoclonic jerks in all four extremities.
He did not have a dulls eye reflex, no corneal reflex, minimal gag, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, [**1-21**] crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the base.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
No edema or clubbing.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves as above, no deep tendon reflexes times four.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe collapse, resolved on sequential chest x-rays following a bronchoscopy.
Echo showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%; mild left ventricular hypertrophy; severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 23 to 27.
EEG showed slow voltage, no epileptic activity.
Bronchoscopy showed thick, purulent secretions in the right main stem bronchus.
He was, thus, repeated on hemodialysis an additional two times with Lithium levels following three episodes of hemodialysis ranging anywhere from 0.8 to 0.9.
Haldol was restarted with a prn order for severe agitation; however, use of this medication was judicious to avoid further clouding of his mental status.
Renal failure.
The patient was admitted with an initial creatinine of 4.6, thought to be secondary to Lithium toxicity versus a prerenal state.
This was thought to be consistent with chronic renal insufficiency.
Urine sediment was checked and was found to be bland; no suggestion of acute tubular necrosis.
The patient was found to have a calcium of 10.4 on admission.
This normalized following hemodialysis and was thought to be secondary to Lithium toxicity versus renal failure.
PTH was found to be 405 which per renal was consistent with either chronic renal insufficiency or possibly the Lithium toxicity.
The patient was admitted with a serum potassium of 6.1, thought to be secondary to his acidosis.
The patient was admitted with serum sodium of 144, thought to be secondary to dehydration versus diabetes insipidus.
The patient was admitted with an initial pH of 7.33, thought to be secondary to RTA with his acute renal failure versus a hyperthymic acidosis, secondary to the five liters of normal saline he received.
His acidosis improved following these interventions.
His change in mental status was attributed to likely Lithium toxicity; however, seizure activity could not be ruled out.
An EEG later, following his admission, only showed slow voltage, no epileptic activity.
A toxic screen was done to rule out any other ingestions, possibly responsible for his change in mental status.
It is their opinion that the patient's change in mental status is most consistent with Lithium toxicity, possibly with a contribution of metabolic encephalopathy.
They also expressed a concern for possible cortical blindness in the context of a possible hypoxic damage, considering that the patient was found unresponsive.
The patient was found to have a left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray at an outside hospital.
Repeat chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 69**] showed a right sided collapse.
Bronchoscopy was done and showed thick, purulent secretions in the right main stem bronchus.
Culture grew out moderate coagulase positive staph.
He was dosed with Levo and Flagyl; however, in the morning, he remained afebrile without a white count, so further antibiotics were held.
He continues to be managed off of antibiotics and remains afebrile without a white count.
New [**1-21**] crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur on initial physical examination.
Echo showed no valve abnormalities.
However, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction.
Haldol 5 mg intravenous q. four hours prn for severe agitation.
The patient will need to follow-up with a cardiologist for the severe left ventricular outflow obstruction found on echo during this admission.
