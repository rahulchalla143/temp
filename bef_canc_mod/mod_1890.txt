Admission Date:  [**2109-7-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2109-8-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2053-6-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**] MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old white female with a history of right frontal craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a dysembryoplastic angioneural epithelial lesion with features of an oligodendroglioma who was started on Dilantin postoperatively for seizure prophylaxis and was subsequently developed eye discharge and was seen by an optometrist who treated it with sulfate ophthalmic drops.
The patient then developed oral sores and rash in the chest the night before admission which rapidly spread to the face, trunk, and upper extremities within the last 24 hours.
Benign right frontal cystic tumor status post right frontal craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**].
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
General:  The patient was an alert, ill-appearing woman with postsurgical occiput.
Head and neck:  Injected conjunctivae, greenish ocular discharge, ulcerative oral lesions.
Rapid rate.
Extremities:  No edema.
Skin:  Diffuse erythema and pustules on the face.
GU:  No genital lesions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's severe exfoliative skin involvement with rapid progression and extensive involvement of the body, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.
She began to have involvement of the genital area with continued desquamation of the exfoliative lesions.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, she was in sinus tachycardia which was felt to be secondary to her [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome leading to dehydration and insensible fluid losses.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was also found to be mildly hypoxic which is likely secondary to atelectasis because of the patient's immobility.
Lower extremity Dopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses were found.
Blood cultures on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**].
Her exfoliative lesions healed over the course of this admission.
She was able to open her eyes and use her vision without significant problems at the time of discharge.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On admission the patient was begun on TPN for nutritional support.
Cardiology/Pulmonology:  The patient was tachycardiac throughout this admission which was attributed to her fluid losses secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome; however, given the patient's immobility throughout the course of this admission, a CT angiogram was performed to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism, and none were found.
Neurology:  The patient has a history of cystic tumor status post resection in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year and was started on prophylactic Dilantin leading to presumed [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
At the time of this admission, the patient's Dilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants were started, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeks after her surgery was unlikely.
Five days before discharge, the patient did have a syncopal event while in the bathroom showering with the help of a nursing aide.
The likely etiology of this is orthostatic hypotension from her fluid losses; however, given the patient's neurologic history, Neurology was consulted to evaluate for possible seizure.
Neurology's recommendations were to obtain a repeat CT scan which was unchanged from previous showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensity which was stable.
They also recommended repeat MR imaging which was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axial lesion noted on CT scan.
Neurology therefore agrees with the primary team that the syncopal event was likely secondary to a vasovagal reaction.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome secondary to Dilantin.
Status post craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a cystic cranial lesion, likely dysembryoplastic angioneural epithelial lesion with features consistent with an oligodendroglioma.
DISCHARGE NOTE:  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO DILANTIN AND TEGRETOL GIVEN HER [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] SECONDARY TO DILANTIN.
