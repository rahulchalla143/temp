In the initial post-op period she had exposure of hardware and she was taken back to the OR for advancement of the radial free flap to cover the hardware exposure.
Earlier tofday she developed a fever to 102+ and a CBC was drawn demonstrating a WBC of 29.1.
She was also noted to have tachycardia and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On arrival she has no specific complaints other than "weakness."
She denies CP/SOB/N/V, no weight loss, no visual changes, no numbness/tingling/weakness, no diarrhea/constipation, no dizziness/lightheadedness.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Thyroid disease Squamous cell carcinoma High blood pressure Floor of mouth resection in [**2130**] with multiple biopsies Reconstruction of floor of mouth with left radial forearm free flap [**11-11**] following SCC excision placement of open gastrostomy tube Trach now on Passy-muir valve local flap advancement of mouth   Social History: She does not smoke.
Family History: Significant for diabetes and depression.
Physical Exam: VS: 102.1    142    158/84    100% on 28% TC Gen: NAD, AAOx3 CV: Tachy, RR, systolic murmur Resp: CTAB, no wheezes or crackles Head & Neck: Swelling over left lower cheek with blanching erythema/warmth - patient stated this swelling is normal since post-op, but notes the redness is new.
Flap is viable with incisions c/d/i except at the anterior base of the flap where it is pulled away from the gingiva and there is exposed hardware from the mandibular reinforcement.
The mandible has seen reconstructed with a metallic bar-like device.
The anatomy of the oral cavity is markedly distorted, with focal areas of fatty protuberance in the floor of the mouth and in the left buccal region.
There is diffuse enlargement and heterogeneity of the left parotid gland.
Multiple enhancing nodes are noted inside the enlarged left parotid gland, the largest of which measures 9 mm in the short axis.
There is diffuse swelling of the tongue and the floor of the mouth with diffuse fatty stranding of the soft tissues in the submental and submandibular spaces, most likely related to the recent operation.
There is asymmetry in the appearance of the tongue, with elevation of the left side.
Hyperdense curvilinear structures projecting inferior to the left parotid gland are most likely post surgical material.
No definite abscess cavity is visualized.
Left parotid gland enlargement.
A possible cause is obstruction of the parotid duct ([**Last Name (un) 38362**] duct) due to diffuse swelling in the left buccal space.
No radio-opaque calculus is seen.
Status post reconstruction of the mandible with a metallic bar-like device.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is limited imaging of the proximal left internal jugular vein, perhaps due to contiguous soft tissue swelling.
There are multiple prominent lymph nodes in the posterior cervical triangles, more evident on the left.
These could be either inflammatory or neoplastic.
The fatty stranding noted above could represent either post-operative edema or cellulitis- correlate clinically.
[**2134-1-4**]: TTE The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
She will require 8 more days of IV antibiotics (vanc and cefepime), but if the infection is not fully resolved, then the duration of antibiotics can be extended.
