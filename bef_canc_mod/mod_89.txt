Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.4 cm with decompressed colon and terminal ileum consistent with high- grade small-bowel obstruction.
Suggestion of swirling of the mesentery and abnormal configuration of small bowel loops raises the possibility of internal hernia.
Associated small amount of right lower quadrant and pelvic free fluid along with mesenteric stranding specifically in the right lower quadrant could be related to congestive change, although early ischemia is not excluded.
Interval increase in size of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, now measuring 3.4 cm where on [**2-24**] it measured up to 2.8 cm.
Diverticulosis without secondary signs of diverticulitis.
Bronchiectasis and reticulation could relate to chronic inflammatory/infectious changes within the bilateral lung bases.
Bibasilar right greater than left atelectasis without definite superimposed pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary edema is worsening since [**2115-12-31**].
Moderate bibasilar atelectasis is improved in the right and stable on the left.
Left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged since [**2115-12-31**].
Diffuse small bowel distention with gas seen within the colon and rectum.
CXR [**2116-1-6**]: In comparison with study of [**1-2**], there is decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion with persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
Increasing opacification at the left base could reflect worsening atelectasis or increasing pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen without definite effusion.
In the emergency department, the patient was resuscitated, and a foley/NGT were placed with moderate relief of abdominal pain.
On the morning following admission, the patient was complaining of increased abdominal pain and was focally and markedly tender with guarding in the RLQ.
Given his worsening exam and CT findings of high-grade SBO with potential internal hernia, the patient was taken to the operating room.
The operation went well without complications (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
While in the PACU, the patient experienced a 30 second run of ventricular tachycardia with a fall in SBP to the 60s.
EKG at that time showed sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-12-30**] there was no significant diagnostic change.
He was receiving IV dilaudid for pain control, which was switched to IV morphine and toradol.
He was placed in soft restraints, and he was given haldol with minimal effect.
His urine output was borderline, and he was bolused with moderate response.
CXR showed mild pulm edema, bibasilar atelectasis, and left pleural effusion.
[**2116-1-3**]: Mental status improved, but he was still confused at times.
He had a 10-beat run of Vtach, hemodynamically stable, no shock received.
An NGT was placed with immediate return of copious gastric contents.
KUB showed diffuse small bowel distention with gas seen within the colon and rectum, nonspecific pattern.
NGT in place with good effect, still returned significant amounts of bilious gastric contents.
No flatus or bowel movements.
No other events.
[**2116-1-6**]: The patient was triggered for respiratory distress and copious secretions.
[**2116-1-7**]: Additional runs of Vtach, hemodynamically stable, no shock received.
No copious secretions, saturating 97% on room air.
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Systems summary: Neuro: The patient received IV narcotics initially but was switched to tylenol only due to altered mental status.
Pulmonary: As discussed in the summary; intermittent doses of lasix for mild pulmonary edema; transfer to the unit for copious secretions, resolved with lasix.
Subsequently stable from a pulmonary standpoint, saturating well on room air; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The wound dressing was removed on POD2 and the wound remained c/d/i.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheeze.
Ciclopirox 0.77 % Cream Sig: One (1) application Topical once a day as needed for itching.
