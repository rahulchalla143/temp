States that since Thursday, her symptoms have been worsening, c/w previous Crohn's flareups but this is not as bad as she's had before.
She has been having fevers at home to 102.

While prepping for abd CT, the patient became tachycardic to 150s, ECG with afib.
She was given dilt 10 mg IV x 2, with decreased SBP to 90s and HR in 110s.
Due to the persistent hypotension and tachycardia, a RIJ was placed, and the patient was started on levophed, but prior to that she was transiently on dopamine.
CXR was without infiltrate.
Patient is being transferred to MICU for hypotension and tachycardia thought to be secondary to sepsis.
Otherwise the patient denies any melena, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Denies use of any recreational drugs  Family History: Her father has ulcerative colitis.
On her father's side, she has an aunt who was diagnosed at 70 with Crohn's, and a cousin who was diagnosed at 14 with IBD.
Her father had esophageal cancer, her maternal grandfather liver cancer and her maternal grandmother lung cancer.
A paternal aunt had breast cancer and her mother had basal and squamous cell carcinoma.
Physical Exam: GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: tachycardiac, irregular, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, well healed surgical scars; tenderness in LLQ with voluntary guarding.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Concentric thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon to a greater extent than prior study, with minimal surrounding stranding suggesting acute mild flare of inflammatory bowel disease.
No evidence of abscess or fistula formation.
Ventral hernia as before.
<br>  [**2176-3-6**] Flex-Sig:  Findings:  Mucosa: Segmental continuous granularity, erythema, friability, congestion and exudate with deep linear ulcerations with contact bleeding were noted in the rectum, proximal sigmoid colon and descending colon.
The mucosa was edematous causing luminal narrowing in the sigmoid and descending colon.
These findings are compatible with Crohn's disease.
Impression: Ulceration, granularity, erythema, friability, congestion and exudate in the rectum, proximal sigmoid colon and descending colon compatible with Crohn's disease (biopsy, biopsy, biopsy) Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to descending colon Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results, specifically evaluating for CMV.
Monitor abdominal exam.
<br>   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 51 year-old female with a history of fistulizing crohn's (with multiple ab surgies in past) and pAFib who presents with hypotension, fevers, diarrhea, and afib with RVR also with acute renal failure.
Pt overall presenting with crohn's flare with sig volume depletion with hypotension - initially not responsive to IVF - required brief period of levophed in ED - but off once admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt currently with treatment with abx, pain control, GI following with rec for colorectal [**Doctor First Name **] eval - staff recs currently pending for further intervention - though plan for future surgery - currently assessing pre-op nutritional status.
Issues of bradycardia earlier while on floor [**3-11**] more to pain medication - reduced and pt again doing well with good rate control.
Also per surgery - needing further cardiac eval - noted brief periods of NSVT on tele - last echo [**11-13**] - getting echo for tomorrow to eval for impaired systolic dysfunction.
<br>  # Crohn's Dz with active flare and fevers - failed 6mp, humera, prednisone, remicade tx in past, had flex-sig [**3-6**] - bxs taken to eval for CMV, currently pending.
# A-fib with RVR/CHADS1: likely in the setting of underlying infxn and hypovolemia.
Has had pAF in the past, not on anticoagulation as outpt just rate control with BB (lower [**Country **] plus ongoing GI blood losses from crohn's).
Patient had brief episodes or aysmptomatic bradycardia, and had one run of NSVT.
No evidence of ischemia.
She was discharged prior to repeat TTE and recommended to follow-up with her outpatient cardiologist.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine to 1.8 on arrival to ED.
This is likely prerenal in the setting of diarrhea and hypotension.
# Lymphedema - +L LE edema - noted prior surgical history - however pt here in ICU immobile, high inflammatory state.
- Left LE US done on [**3-7**] - NO DVT  # Anemia, Chronic Blood losses - H/H near baseline - and remained stable.
# HTN, benign - cont metoprolol and dilt; with addition of dilt, ace-i held, and was restarted prior to discharge  # GERD - cont ppi   Medications on Admission: Asacol 2400 mg [**Hospital1 **] Metoprolol 50 mg QAM and 100 mg QPM Lisinopril 20 mg qam Adalat 30 mg QPM Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily Folic Acid Humira ASA 325 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
