ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2165-1-17**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
[**2165-1-15**] 4:29 pm STOOL **FINAL REPORT [**2165-1-17**]**    FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2165-1-17**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2165-1-17**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
Imaging: Echo [**1-14**]: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Trace aortic and mitral regurgitation.
R knee xray [**1-12**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or dislocation.
No evidence of hardware failure.
CXR [**1-13**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared minimal right-sided pleural effusion.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, including the pre-existing interstitial markings and the partial atelectasis of the middle lobe.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
CT chest without contrast [**1-16**]: The heart is normal in size, with aortic valvular and mitral annular calcifications noted.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Central lymphadenopathy has increased, and is likely reactive.
Widespread bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening, most notable within the upper lobes and lingula, are associated with numerous bronchiolar nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, which are increased within the right lower lobe compared to the prior study.
There is also a new confluent opacification in the right lower lobe (4:157-174).
These findings progression of atypical mycobacterial infection.
Chronic collapse of the right middle lobe is stable in appearance.
Mucoid impaction within dilated bronchioles are notable within the lingula.
A small non-hemorrhagic layering right pleural effusion is new.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
The liver is diffusely low in attenuation, compatible with fatty infiltration.
Osseous structures reveal no suspicious abnormality with multilevel degenerative changes of the spine seen.
Interval worsening of diffuse airways disease, with a new confluent area of opacification in the right lower lobe.
The findings are suggestive of atypical mycobacterial infection.
New small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old woman s/p R total knee replacement in [**1-17**] with R knee liner exchange and wash out on [**2164-12-3**], with intra-operative cultures growing Streptococcus virdians on ceftriaxone who presented to the MICU with fever and hypotension.
Presumed sepsis: Patient presented with hypotension to 70's systolic in ED, improved to mid 80's to 90's systolic, MAPs 60's following 4.5 liters IVF.
Highest on differential included evolving sepsis due to combination of fever, elevated WBC to 13, tachycardia, tachypnea (meeting criteria for SIRS) plus suspected source of infection as PNA.
Patient was evaluated by the orthopedic team, who felt that her R knee was a less likely source of recurrent infection.
ID consultation was sought given the persistence of fever in the ICU.
The pt's knee was tapped by Orthopedics and returned with no organisms on gram stain or Cx.
As we were happy to see the right knee did not seem to have an active infx, we presumptively treated the pt for an HCAP for a 7 day course as that was thought to be the most likely source, especially given the poor pulmonary substrate.
The patient was prescribed Levoflox 750 mg PO daily x 3 months for continued suppressive therapy of strep viridans septic arthritis.
# Hypotension: See above for further details.
In short, pt was bolused with 4.5 L of NS in MICU, and became normotensive without need for pressors.
Lisinopril that pt is on as outpt was stopped as pt remained normotensive.
Most likely cause was sepsis, and other causes were ruled out (eg: hemorrhage r/o with stable Hct).
Pt spiked fever for first 3-4 days of hospitalization though Vanc/Cefepime/Levo.
Fevers stopped upon transfer to Medicine Floor and remained afebrile for >48 hrs.
Also on ddx is malignancy and rheumatologic process, however given improvement with [**Last Name (LF) 621**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] defer further w/u for now and can be reassessed as outpt if remaining concern.
There was thought for PE, however no right heart strain on EKG, and satting well, also on home O2 of 2L.
She was also continued on nebulizer treatments for her underlying obstructive lung disease.
ABGs were done to ensure the pt was not acidotic and that she was not retaining CO2 beyond respiratory compensation for her apparent metabolic alkalosis.
# History of Mycobacterium avium intracellularae - treated for MAC from [**2-/2157**] to 06/[**2158**].
This combined with her bronchiectasis does give her a poor pulmonary substrate that we feel contributed to the most likely HCAP causing her septic presentation.
Vaginal bleeding/hematuria: Pt is s/p TAH-BSO, and without pelvic pain.
No bleeding now.
her bleeding resolved after 1 day.
As above, orthopedics did not feel it was infected, and our exam is definitely underwhelming for a septic picture.
Nonetheless, given the foreign body after her TKR, she was still tapped by orthopedics and we were reassured that there was no active infx (WBC of 6500, no organisms on gram stain).
She still requires long term [**Month/Day/Year 621**] for the previous septic arthritis and was discharged on 3 months of Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily.
# Anemia: long standing issue and pt is on iron supplementation at home.
Iron labs were again sent during this hospitalization and were c/w Fe-deficiency anemia.
# Endometrial carcinoma s/p hysterectomy in [**10/2152**]: Stable per pt, and is followed by GYN at [**Hospital1 112**].
# HTN: holding lisinopril in setting of hypotension.

Diagnosis - COPD   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: 1. sepsis, felt to be hospital acquired pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
To rule out infection in the knee, fluid was withdrawn from your right knee.
