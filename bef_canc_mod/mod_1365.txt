[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 74 year old woman with elevated d-dimer.
INDICATION: Elevated D-dimer.
CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST: No filling defects are present within the pulmonary arteries.
There is a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion that is unchanged in size.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged.
There are emphysematous changes of the lungs and small bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural plaques.
The upper images of the abdomen demonstrate previous liver transplant and marked splenomegaly.
No evidence for PE.
Chronic pericardial effusion, moderate-to-large in size.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
In the subcostal view, the RV appears compressed - this suggests either localized tamponade or technical artifact.
Overt echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures/pulmonary  hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-5-13**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2112-5-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2112-5-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2112-5-16**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2112-5-13**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
She has an Apparently loculated and by echo characteristics complex pericardial effusion which may have some mild tamponade physiology.
An 8 cm incision centered around the xiphoid was made in the midline of the abdomen.
I needed then to remove some of the fascia closure stitches from the previous [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8314**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] abdominal incision from her liver transplant.
This was grasped with a [**Doctor Last Name **] clamp and then incised carefully with the knife so as not to injure any underlying grafts or right ventricle.
In addition, a 2x2 cm window was cut out of the inferior pericardium and this was sent to microbiology as well as pathology.
Because of the massive previous adhesions from the liver transplant, it was not possible to have free flowing space into the peritoneal cavity.
Then, a Surgicel gauze was placed on the raw surface of the transplanted liver where there was some mild oozing from the liver capsule.
After I learned of her discharge, I spoke with her nurse and was told she was doing very well and that she had no concerns.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  74 F on home O2 for sarcoidosis as well has h/o stable pericardial effusion and s/p liver Tx who presented with 2 days of worsening SOB after having been off oxygen for one week.
Patient's dyspnea was likely multifactorial as patient has known interstitial lung disease, known pericardial effusion, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Pt did note LE swelling, which has resolved overnight, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions noted on chest CT, which prompted an echo to be performed, which showed signs of early tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted, and recommended CT surgery evaluation for pericardial window.
Given that patient's symptoms were improved after prior percardiocentesis, patient was taken to the OR for pericardial window.
The window was performed with both cardiac and thoracic surgery, and window was placed into the peritoneal cavity.
This showed no significant change from baseline.
A pericardial biopsy was performed, and initial pathology showed reactive changes.
Patient did not have a pulsus on exam prior to or after her surgery, and she remained hemodynamically stable throughout.
Her oxygen requirement at discharge was her baseline of 2L.
Patient had three negative sets of cardiac enzymes.
Her echo showed no new RWMA and a preserved EF.
Pericardial effusion 2.
Sarcoidosis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If you develop increased shortness of breath, fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting, call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room.
You were diagnosed with a pericardial effusion.
