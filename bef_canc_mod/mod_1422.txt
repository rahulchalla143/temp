Pt had hyperkalemia to 5.2 on day of discharge, it was repeated prior to leaving and was 4.7 This may be due to her lisinopril and her BMP and Cr should be monitered for the next two to three days to ensure her electolytes remain stable.
Pt had a new occurance of wound hematoma on [**4-7**] during MICU stay during treatment for plasmapheresis, fibrinogen normal, no intervention at this time.
She was placed on ancef by vascular surgery due to drainage from the wound.
