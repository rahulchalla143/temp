He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn but continued to have recurrent fevers.
He was evaluated by hematology for a WBC ct. >150K, they stated this was due to a leukomoid reaction on top of his underlying MDS.
On [**5-21**] he developed SOB which CXR revealed to be due to CHF he was diuresed with Lasix.
Post-op he was admitted to the SICU for management of his low urine output/ARF.

He completed an 18 day course of vancomycin to treat sputum cultures which grew oxacillin resistant staph aureus.
He also completed a 14 day course of zosyn.His abcess grew beta lactamase positive Bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
The patient's antibiotics were then discontinued and the patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis until [**6-14**] when pt developed a temperature to 101.9.
CT imaging of his abdomen revealed multiple abcesses and thus the patient completed a 5 day course of IV vanc/cipro/flagyl/fluconazole during which time his abscess resolved without the need for drainage by IR.
Cardiovascular: While recovering from surgery the patient developed congestive heart failure.
An echo was performed and it demonstrated no significant changes since his last echo in [**2131**].
The patient has a history of hypertension and was continued on lisinopril 40 mg qd.
He quickly responds to Lasix for chest pressure d/t CHF.
The patient responded well to IV lasix and upon discharge his peripheral edema was much improved.
Nutrition The patient has had a long convalesence marked by poor po intake resulting a low albumin which contributed to his peripheral edema.
On D/C, we are holding Phos and Mg until these electrolytes normalize.
Pulmonary: CT scan of the thorax on [**6-15**] revealed bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral  lower lobe atelectasis and small percardial effusion.
His anemia was believed to be secondary to his myelodysplastic syndrome.
ITP: The patient has a history of ITP and was thus continued on 20 mg of prednisone qod with an increase to 20 mg qd when the patient was febrile to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
Dispostion: Since his fever on [**6-15**], the patient has remained afebrile and continues to improve.
