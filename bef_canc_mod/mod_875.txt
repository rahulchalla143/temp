HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] was admitted to the surgical service for evaluation of a possible acute abdomen and cholecystitis.
An ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis, but no fluid collection.
There was no wall thickening, and the common bile duct was 5 mm.
Therefore, based upon these studies Ms. [**Known lastname 45354**] was felt not to have acute cholecystitis.
She was transferred to neurology for plasmapheresis secondary to early signs of myasthenic crisis.
She underwent EGD and colonoscopy which revealed a large 3.5 cm ulcer at the distal bulb of the duodenum.
She was started on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] for treatment.
She had an episode of decreased hematocrit that was significant; therefore, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring, and received several units of packed red blood cells and FFP.
GI recommended further evaluation of the abdominal pain with MRCP which revealed cholelithiasis, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
The common bile duct was not dilated, but distally in the common bile duct there was an area that was suspicious for a tiny stone which appeared less impressive than the stones in the cystic duct.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Massive duodenal ulcer with significant hematocrit drop.
2) Myasthenic crisis.
