Admission Date:  [**2169-5-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-1-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma and is status post proctosigmoidectomy with coloanal anastomosis and loop ileostomy with multiple admissions for partial small-bowel obstructions who now presents with lightheadedness and vomiting.
The patient was last discharged from this hospital on [**2169-4-28**] after a 1-week admission for a partial small-bowel obstruction.
This was his third documented episode of a partial small-bowel obstruction since his surgery in [**2168-12-28**].
Moreover, over that period time he had been told by both his urologist and his primary care physician to drink plenty of water to help with his prostatic hypertrophy.
He denied any accompanying chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
Subsequently, this afternoon, he reports the onset of nausea with clear emesis times one (there were no coffee grounds or frank blood in the emesis).
His postoperative course was complicated by a partial small-bowel obstruction and postoperative leak.
Surgical pathology showed adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, grade II, with surgical staging T3 N0 M0.
He has had two subsequent admissions for a partial small-bowel obstruction with his last discharge on [**2169-4-28**].
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister with colorectal cancer.
No oral lesions.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with a well-healed surgical scar.
There was watery output in the bag with no blood.
Extremity examination revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Sensory examination was without focal deficits.
There was no pronator drift.
There was no dysmetria.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission revealed a sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern, 71 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular conduction delay.
A KUB revealed mildly dilated loops of small bowel with air/fluid levels, much less pronounced; consistent with prior study from [**2169-5-22**].
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The impression was that this is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of colon cancer, status post resection and loop ileostomy in [**2168-12-28**], now presenting with lightheadedness for two to three days, nausea for one day, with a sodium of 107.
HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hyponatremia was thought to be multifactorial secondary to decreased oral intake, slightly increased ostomy output, and increased free water intake (which was voluntary).
As we did not want him to correct any further, to avoid the risk of central pontine myelinolysis, the 3% saline was stopped, and the patient was continued on a normal saline intravenously.
His urine was sent for electrolytes, revealing a low urine sodium and chloride in conjunction with most serum osmolalities; pointing toward volume depletion as the most likely cause for his hyponatremia.
In addition, his fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1%; suggestive a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure as well as decreased oral intake as a cause for his hyponatremia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's fractional excretion of sodium prior to hydration revealed a fractional excretion of sodium of less than 1%; revealing prerenal cause for his acute renal failure.
ACIDOSIS ISSUES:  The patient had a predominantly anion gap metabolic acidosis.
As this could be contributed to his increased ostomy output, his urinary anion gap was positive; suggestive of a concomitant renal tubular acidosis.
As his acidosis did not improve with correction of his renal function, this was further evidence for a concomitant renal tubular acidosis.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  A KUB was done on admission which revealed nonspecific air/fluid levels.
The patient also had increased ileostomy output on admission.
During his hospital stay, he complained of no abdominal pain.
Although his amylase was slightly elevated on admission, his lipase was normal.
His diet was advanced, and he was placed on free water restriction for his hyponatremia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection on admission.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was found to have no acute changes in his mental status with a rapid correction of his sodium level.
