Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis Placement of lines CPR  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and autoimmune heptatis with a baseline MELD score of 32 and previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was brought into the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at the urging of her visting nurse this morning.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] acknowledges that at baseline she has some "confusion" due to her hepatitis, and sometimes "doesn't think clearly".
Her physical exam was notable for a mild abdominal fluid wave, and she was noted to be "slow speaking".
An initial work up for her fever was begun, which inlcuded an rapid influenza antigen test, and broad spectrum antibiotics to cover both possible meningitis (given her confusion) and spontaneous bacterial peritonits.
An LP was not obatined to rule out meningitis given her high INR (4.0).
A head CT and chest X-ray were read as normal, and an abdominal US showed no baseline change from recent imaging.
On reveiw of systems, she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits or urine habits (of note, she states that her urine has been "dark colored" for several years).
She did endorse of feeling of abdominal pain, which she states starts in her abdomen and radiates down to both feet bilaterally, and which she first noted in the ED.

-UCx ([**2137-10-10**]): <10,000 organisms/ml -BCx ([**2137-10-10**]): Pending x 2   Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE SERVICE COURSE:  56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and autoimmune hepatatis with a baseline MELD score of 32, on liver and kidney [**Month/Day/Year **] list and previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was admitted on [**9-27**] for fever and altered mental status.
The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone empirically for SBP from [**9-27**] to [**10-1**].
She has completed a 2nd course of ceftriaxone and 1 course of Vancomycin empirically for SBP on [**10-7**] to [**10-14**].
She has not had a documented fever during her nearly 3 week hospital stay.
She has had some mild vaginal bleeding during her hospitalization.
She triggered evening of [**10-12**] for altered mental status.
KUB performed for abdominal distension, though no SBO.
Diagnostic paracentesis was negative.
She was transferred back to the floor and noted to have slurred speech and tangential thoughts.
States she has chills and dry mouth.
Her INR was consistently elevated, and she required occasional doses of FFP to reverse her INR when she developed low-grade bleeding from the corner of her mouth and lips.
She also had regular vaginal spotting nightly, though no frank hemorrhage.
Her ascites worsened steadily, and she had tenderness to palpation/percussion.
Her diuretics were held for the duration of her time on the hepatorenal service, given her acute kidney injury.
# Right wrist hematoma: The patient triggered for altered mental status on the evening of [**10-12**].
She had an ABG performed, and subsequently developed a hematoma.
They did not believe she had compartment syndrome, and her U/S was negative for DVT or pseudoaneurysm.
# Angioedema: On [**10-10**] the patient was found to have periorbital and lip/face edema, concerning for angioedema.
She did not have any respiratory compromise.
The precipitant was unclear, and was ultimately believed to be a lidoderm patch that she had received 2 days prior, for abdominal pain.
After discontinuing the lidoderm, the patient did not have further episodes of angioedema.
# UTI: The patient's urine culture on [**10-5**] grew coag negative staph and enterococcus.
She had guaiac positive stool on [**10-14**].
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level was 2.6 on admission.
Her creatinine improved to 1.5 on day of transfer to the MICU, but her midodrine regimen was occasionally interrupted secondary to hypertension.
Her albumin infusions were stopped when the patient became hypertensive and volume overloaded.
Her urine output was low, but unreliably measured, and frequently mixed in with loose stools.
# Diabetes Mellitus: As the patient's blood sugars generally trended downward, her home basal glargine was steadily decreased from her home basal 35 units QHS, to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.
She has a history of lymphedema in her left arm, and blood draws were avoided in the left arm.
#################### MICU GREEN COURSE  On the floor, she was noted to be more confused and oozing blood from venous access sites, mouth and vagina.
There was no blood in rectal tube.
KUB showed distention of the stomach and colon w/o air-fluid levels.
She became hypotense to SBP 67.
CVP was noted to be elevated to 30s and heart was enlarged on CXR so stat echo was ordered and showed no effusion but PASP 40-48 with a normal LVEF.
She had EGD by GI which showed diffuse oozing in the stomach which had stopped.
No bowel obstruction and no free air.
SQ methylnaltrexone was given for trace stool.
KUB showed ground glass ascites, less distended stomach air bubble, no signs of free air or obstruction.
Her lactate was trending upwards into 8s; unclear etiology at this point, but probably bowel related vs. secondary to liver disease and inability to clear lactate.
On [**10-21**], she continued to have escilating pressor requirements.
She began to develop NSVT with associated blood pressure drops.
Pressors were continued but no further shocks were given.
Her blood pressure slowly declined and she passed away in no apparent distress at 6 AM on [**10-22**].
