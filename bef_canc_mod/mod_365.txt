History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 27785**] is a 39-year-old woman with a complicated medical history including acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 4, status post bone marrow transplant, radiation therapy complicated by lung fibrosis requiring living donor lung transplant from her father.
This was further complicated by left main stem stenosis requiring metal stent placement 5 years ago.
Since then she has been requiring repeated bronchoscopies for stent evaluation, clean out and granulation tissue removal.
Her cough is worse at night, and is not productive.
Her dyspnea is currently with mild to moderate exertion, like going up one flight of stairs.
She was brought in for rigid bronch and cryoablation of left main stem granulation tissue.
The patient also has esophageal stricture requiring past EGD with dilation.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
CXR [**2182-12-9**]:  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal improvement with better ventilation of both lungs and minimal regression of both the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe opacity.
No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] was taken to the operating room on [**2182-12-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] where she underwent EGD with dilation for her esophageal stricture and rigid bronchoscopy with cryoablation of the granulation tissue surrounding the left main stem stent.
The patient was ambulating oxygenating mid 90's on RA, stating she felt much improvement from the evening without shortness of breath.
Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation q 4 hours prn  as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
