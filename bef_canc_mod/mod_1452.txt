Course complicated by resp failure requiring BiPAP, no inubation, and hypotension requiring pressors.
Also with dCHF exacerbation.
Hypotension now resolved.
Course also complicated by delirium and malnutrition requiring NGT and tube feeds (haldol and restraints in this setting).
Also with thrombocytopenia to low of 37 over last 3 days, concern for HIT so stopped heparin and checked HIT ab (pending).
She is now DNR/DNI and no pressors, but wishes to continue aggressive medical care otherwise.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with h/o lymphoma, GERD, HTN, dCHF presented on [**8-28**] to [**Hospital3 628**] with shortness of breath and dxd with PNA, complicated by resp failure requiring BIPAP, hypotension requring pressors.
# Goals of Care: The was previously very independent and functional at baseline, now with AMS in the setting of sepsis and multiorgan failure (ARF and AMS).
At admission, discussions with the family reveal that they feel the patient is still in an acute phase of her illness.
They do not desire any further drastic measures such as CPR, intubation, or pressors, but are ok with the patient getting dialysis including CVVH and other medical interventions to aggressivly treat her PNA and renal failure.
# Healthcare associated Pneumonia: Course so far had been complicated by resp failure requiring BIPAP and hypotension requiring pressors.
# Catheter tip culture grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans at OSH: - cont Fluconazole  # CRF requring HD: The patient's current access is clotted and no longer usable.
The patient's family initially desired dialysis or CVVH, and the patient was tansfered to the ICU with the intention of getting CVVH, but was unable to maintain her pressure and was made comfort measures only.
# Delerium: The patient has multiple possible causes of altered mental status, and is likely encephalopathic.
The patient is septic from b/l pneumonia, and has evidence of end-organ failure (incl ARF), sepsis was the most likely explanation of AMS.
The patient also had CRF requiring HD, with elevated BUN.
Other DDx inclues non-convulsive status epilepticus, recent CVA, hypoxic damage, or meningitis.
# Nutrition: severe malnutrition.
Hct 29 at admission, no signs of active bleeding.
IV shortness of breath or pain.
