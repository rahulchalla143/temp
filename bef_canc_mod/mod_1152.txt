FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and  no aortic regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No definite abnormalities identified to explain the patient's symptoms.
No CT findings of bowel perforation, colitis, or pancreatitis.
Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval resolution of peripancreatic fluid seen around the tail of the pancreas.
Slightly atypical appearance to the right post-nephrectomy site with a thickened circumferential area that encases bulk fat.
Bilateral new small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Smaller postsurgical abdominal aortic aneurysm with atheromatous plaque.
Diverticulosis of sigmoid, without diverticulitis.
[**11-30**] Renal U/S No evidence of renal obstruction.
Normal-appearing renal vasculature.
[**11-29**] Abd U/S No evidence for common bile duct dilation, and moderately distended and sludge containing gallbladder but otherwise unremarkable without cholelithiasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 YO F with multiple medical problems recently including AAA [**6-17**] c/b pancreatitis, right nephrectomy and cystecomy with ilealconduit in [**9-17**], and MI s/p cardiac stenting in [**10-18**] initially admitted to the MICU with pancreatitis and ARF.
Pancreatitis - possible acute on chronic given chronic nausea and poor po tolerance in past; calcium not elevated, lipids not grossly elevated, no clear drug-related etiology, and U/S failed to reveal CBD dilation; CT abd did reveal GB sludge.
F/u MR abd revealed interval resolution of peripancreatic fluid around the tail of the pancreas, which correlated w/ pt's clinical improvement.
ARF - pt presented with BUN/Cr of 128/5.9 (well above normal baseline) with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia.
In setting of chronic HTN, pt will need continued f/u for possible underlying chronic renal disease, but her ARF was largely prerenal based on post-resuscitative improvement.
CAD - stable throughout course; continued lopressor, avapro, hydralazine but will held tricor/zocor given active pancreatitis at admission.
GI bleed - patient found to be guaiac positive on admission, no further evidence of bleeding.
Line Infection - Pt transferred back to the MICU on [**12-8**] because of fevers and concern for sepsis.
Central line and blood cultures grew multi-resistant coag negative staph sensative to vanc; PICC was placed under IR for long-term vanc (at least 2 weeks) given bacteremia and AAA vascular graft.
C-Diff Positive Stool - pt was asymptomatic with normal WBC and was afebrile when test posted as positive; pt began oral vanc and will continue as outpatient with close PCP f/u.
HTN - when NPO, utilized IV metoprolol and hydralazine for control; once ARF resolved and tolerating po's, continued oral lopressor, avapro, hydralazine with moderate success.
AAA - no active issues, but due to recent graft, pt's positive BCX was treated aggressively with vanc and close follow up.
At discharge, pt's PCP was notified regarding extended course of both IV and oral vancomycin; PCP welcomed [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u w/in the week of D/C for appropriate laboratory monitoring and clinical reevaluation.
