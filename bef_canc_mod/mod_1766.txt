History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 46-year old woman with a history of [**Location (un) **] syndrome diagnosed at age 23 and s/p colectomy ([**2121**]) and later small bowel resections with subsequent short [**Year (4 digits) **] syndrome on TPN since [**2123**].
She has had multiple line infections with mutliple organisms in past, multiple past UTIs who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Klebsiella bacteremia and Klebsiella [**Hospital1 **] refractory to treatment.
Patient reports feeling fatigued and "lousy" for the past month and a half.
About one week prior to transfer, she felt chills and vomited; there was no documented fever.
She initially went to an OSH hypotensive (71/48) on [**9-18**] with a sepsis picture with Klebsiella bacteremia and Klebsiella [**Month/Year (2) **] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and put on Linezolid and Zosyn.
Sh ehas had extensive venous occlusions with repeat stenting including right internal jugular vein, right brachiocephalic vein, IVC, right femoral and common iliacs.
s/p dermoid cyst removal, originally in small bowel, then extended to ovaries Fungemia/ staph epi sepsis fibromyalgia osteoporosis (no long term steroid use) s/p b/l hip fx, and b/l  ORIF scoliosis s/p repair s/p TAH BSO Right femoral vein thrombosis No upper access for central lines GI bleed in past Undergoing work up for potential SB transplant at [**Hospital1 41724**] in [**Location (un) 7349**]   Social History: Lives at home with her mother.
Mother and relatives with HTN and resulting CVA.
HEENT - Pupils quite dilated and sluggish (5mm --> 4mm).
No oral lesions.
PULM - Diminished breath sounds without obvious crackles.
Also mildly TTP in LLQ.
BACK - Severe scoliosis.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2145-9-30**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2145-10-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2145-10-1**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2145-10-1**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
No evidence of congestive failure.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ABD U/S ([**9-23**]):  No fluid collections identified.
No findings to suggest an abscess.
Mild splenomegaly.
Common hepatic duct at the upper limits of normal measuring 1.0 cm.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation seen.
CT L-Spine ([**9-24**]): Erosive endplate changes at L4/5 with disc space loss concerning for discitis/osteomyelitis.
Involvement of the adjacent bilateral common iliac venous stents cannot be excluded.
Upper Extremity U/S ([**9-27**]):  No right upper extremity DVT.
If spinal canal involvement needs to be assessed, MRI should be considered.
Her hospital course was complicated by hypotension and probable sepsis.
Klebsiella Bacteremia:  On presentation to OSH, patient was found to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
The patient developed hypotension and a sepsis picture.
# [**Month/Day/Year **]: The patient has a history of multiple line infections and UTIs in the past.
On admission, she was found to have Klebsiella and VRE in her urine, per OSH records.
# Discitis: The patient has been having increasing low back pain since last [**Month (only) 958**], complicated by L LE weakness.
She had a CT of her spine on [**9-24**] which demonstrated possible discitis of her lumbar spine.
The optimal study for illustrating discitis is unfortunately an MRI, which this patient may not have because of her multiple stents.
She tolerated this procedure without complication and the biopsy did not show evidence of bacteria or PMNs.
The patient was continued on fentanyl and lidocaine patches, and she received Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
She will continue on a 2-week course of Meropenem for possible Klebsiella discitis.
She has had multiple line infections and vascular occlusions.
She did not have any acute events in relation to her TPN during this admission.
# Hypotension: Patient had an episode of hypotension during this admission, which was most likely secondary to line sepsis.
# Hypoxia: Patient developed an oxygen requirement while in ICU.
CXR showed pulm edema/pleural effusions.
This was likely secondary to volume overload in setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation in ICU.
She was diuresed with IV Lasix and her O2 requirement has decreased over the past week.
# Fibromyalgia: Patient was previously on Celexa which was stopped this admission for concern for serotonin syndrome on linezolid.
Furosemide 10 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) mL Injection once a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Diphenhydramine HCl 50 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) mL Injection every six (6) hours as needed for itching.
Disp:*30 * Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Klebsiella Bacteremia VRE Urinary Tract Infection Discitis  Secondary: [**Location (un) **] Syndrome Short [**Location (un) **] Syndrome   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you felt very fatigued for a month prior to admission.
While you were here, you were found to have Klebsiella bacteria in your blood and urine.
You were also found to have VRE in your urine.
You were treated with antibiotics and your blood pressure dropped very low, which was most likely a result of the infection in your blood.
You had a CT performed of your spine, which showed that you may have an infection in your L4/L5 disc.
We biopsied this disc, which has not yet shown any signs of infection.
Please return to the ED or your health care provider if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, increasing back pain, fatigue, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
