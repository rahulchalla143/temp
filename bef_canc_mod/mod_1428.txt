[**1-9**] Contralateral third order arteriography with abdominal aortogram.
[**1-8**]   History of Present Illness: This 70-year-old female presented with a thrombosed and cold ischemic foot who underwent open procedure after an angiogram where they performed a thrombectomy.
Past Medical History: hypercholesterolemia ESRD on HD (M/W/F via RUE fistula) A-fib (on coumadin) DM Depression s/p R fem-ak [**Doctor Last Name **] w/?
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave decel time.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Near-hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild dilatation of ascending aorta.
Although there is still some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, the lungs are clear, the costophrenic angles are relatively sharp, and there is no evidence of pulmonary [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation  Low limb lead QRS voltages Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition Modest nonspecific precordial/anterior T wave changes These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 62 0 80 436/439 0 49 28    Brief Hospital Course: 78 F w/ RLE pain since 3 days PTA, presented to an OSH w/ a cold and pulsless leg.

You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  What to expect when you go home: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**1-18**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) ?????
