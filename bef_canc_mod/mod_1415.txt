During that hospitalization, the patinet was started on TPN for nutritional support, and an EGD demonstrated gastritis/duodenitis.
His creatinine only improved to 2.0 with rehydration, and nephrology believed that the renal failure was secondary to obstructed uropathy despite the MAG3 lasix renogram.

The patinet had done well since discharge, but began to feel unwell the days prior to presentation, with complaints of fevers and chills.

Cultures from the nephrostomy tube and blood were obtained, and his infection was empirically treated with with vancomycin and zosyn.
The patient was kept in the MICU for one full day for aggressive fluid resuscitation for sepsis from R obstructed pyelonephritis.
His left percutaneous nephrostomy tube was internalized to a JJ ureteral stent on [**2127-6-16**] after balloon dilation of a left uretero-iliac anastamotic stricture.
A right antegrade nephrostogram was also performed, which demonstrated a a R ureteroiliac anastamotic stricture.
