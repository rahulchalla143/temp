Admission Date:  [**2119-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-11-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, red-tinged sputum production  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bedside bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage Ebdotracheal intubation and ventilation Nasogastric tube placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 76 year-old [**First Name3 (LF) 24075**]-speaking male with h/o DM, infarct-related cardiomyopathy, CHF (most recent EF of 50% in [**Month (only) 359**], nadir of 20%), CAD s/p CABG x 2 ([**2091**], [**2099**]) & biventricular ICD ([**2110**]), and chronic atrial fibrillation (on Warfarin, INR 10.1 on presentation), severe MR s/p MVR in [**2115**], s/p AVN ablation in [**2114**], history of CRI with intolerance to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, history of carotid artery disease not amenable to operation, and a recent history cellulitis and erysipelas (finished a course of doxycycline at end of [**Month (only) **]) presents with increasing dyspnea for 1 day of worsening of SOB consistent with prior chf exacerbations.
Denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, cp or back pain.
Of note the patient has had three recent admissions for similar symptoms of dyspnea on exertion which improved with diuresis.
During his most recent admission, a CT scan was done and demonstrated generalized additional abnormality involving both lungs with associated areas of ground-glass opacity, which had slightly progressed since the prior study.
Overall, radiographically likely represented worsening pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease could not be ruled out.
There is cardiomegaly involving the left atrium and ventricle, pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as cholelithiasis.
Echocardiogram from that admission demonstrated an EF of 50% with a moderately dilated LV cavity mildly depressed LVEF and the normal RV and normal right ventricle aorta, minimal AS, MR, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] that was estimated as moderate.
Of note, eccentric jet of at least 2+ mitral regurgitation was seen and due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR could have been underestimated per report.
Spirometry and DLCO at that time also demonstrated moderate restrictive ventilator deficit with a severe gas exchange and no significant response with bronchodilator testing.
He saw pulmonary on [**2119-10-5**], who felt that he does not have PFTs supporting COPD and stopped his Advair and Spiriva.
They noted thrush that is likely secondary to the Advair and gave him a 7 day course of nystatin.
Physical exam was significant were crackles at the bilateral lower lung fields and erythema of the b/l lower extremity.
A chest xray demonstrated moderate congestive heart failure.
DRE was notable for mixture of bright red blood and brown stool -> ?
His saturation improved with BiPAP, however, his sats fell to the 90 and he developed retractions on trial off BiPAP.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

There is perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness and diffuse alveolar opacities compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
[**2119-11-7**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Since [**2119-9-12**], bilateral interstitial thickening and ground-glass opacities have progressed, new multifocal peribronchial consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions, right side more than left, are concerning for concurrent multifocal lung infection and pulmonary edema in the background of pre-existing interstitial abnormalities.

[**2119-11-8**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - There is an unchanged region of cystic encephalomalacia in the posterior left parietal lobe resulting from an old infarct.
This lesion is expectedly associated with volume loss and ex vacuo dilation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, new infarction, or hydrocephalus.
Mild sulcal prominence is consistent with age-related cerebral cortical atrophy.

BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2119-11-7**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS Abundant hemosiderin-laden macrophages and squamous cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 M w Hx of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 50% in [**2119-8-26**]), CAD s/p CABG (SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1), PCI with LCx, mitral valve repair in [**2115**] (28 [**Doctor Last Name **] physio ring), biventricular ICD implantantation, and atrial fibrillation s/p AV-nodal ablation in [**2114**] (on Coumadin, INR 10.1 on presentation), who presented with worsening shortness of breath x 1-days duration found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, coagulopathy and anemia with thrombocytopenia, which all fortunately resolved.
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE ??????
The patient presented with a known restrictive lung disease pattern based on previous PFTs; history of remote COPD and extensive prior smoking history with asbestos exposures.
On admission, he was acutely hypoxic with labored breathing and tachypnea, thus he was switched from his home nasal cannula to BiPAP with partial response initially.
Overnight on [**11-6**] he continued to have worsening oxygen desaturations in the setting of positive pressure ventilation and he began expectorating red-blood tinged sputum with worsening ABG values (acute respiratory acidosis in the setting of compensatory metabolic alkalosis).
He was also aggressively diuresed (with good diuretic response) on admission with a Lasix gtt and his CXR appeared worsened with worsening pulmonary status.
Etiologies considered: diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DAH) given coagulopathy and worsening CXR findings and acute hypoxia in the setting of adequate diuresis vs. lobar consolidation and pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary congestion vs. worsening diastolic heart failure with pulmonary congestion.
Given his worsening oxygenation and poor clinical response, he was non-urgently intubated on [**2119-11-7**].
The bronchoscopy demonstrated evidence of blood, although the hematocrit from the sample was < 2.0%.
A chest CT was obtained that demonstrated bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening and multifocal peribronchial opacities and moderate right and small left new pleural effusions suggest a combination of multifocal lung infection and edema.
These CT features did not favor pulmonary hemorrhage nonetheless.
He was also noted to spike fevers to 101F with negative culture data, but he was covered with IV Vancomycin, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone since admission -- and was broadened given concern for on-going fevers to Cefepime on [**11-9**].
He was conservatively supported to reverse his coagulopathy in the setting of his presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
# DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ??????
The patient presented with a known CHF history; 2D-Echo from [**8-/2119**] showing a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with mildly depressed LV systolic function and mid- and apical septal hypokinesis with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis (LVEF 34-50%, discrepancy with perfusion imaging and 2D-Echo).
U/A negative, urine and blood cultures drawn and CXR showing pulmonary congestion without focal consolidation on admission (but CT imaging later showing multifocal consolidation and edema), lower extremity venous stasis changed noted) vs. dietary indiscretion vs. medication non-compliance vs. uncontrolled hypertension (unlikely) vs. worsening valvular disease (s/p MVR repair with 2+ MR noted on 2D-Echo from [**2119-8-26**]) vs. ACS/MI (EKG stable, Troponin 0.02) vs. Bactrim interacting with his heart failure medications vs. progression of restrictive lung disease (PFTs showing restrictive ventilatory defect).
On exam, he appeared volume overloaded with pedal edema and inspiratory crackle to the mid-lung fields with elevated JVP.
We decreased his diuresis goal to even or 0.5L daily given the suspicion of a primary pulmonary process.
We entertained the possible need for right heart catheterization to evaluate his PCWP, filling pressures to better understand his diastolic function in the setting of his respiratory decompensation, but this was deferred.
Hif formal 2D-Echo/TEE showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation in spite of a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension; LVEF 50-55%.
Given these findings, we assumed his lung issues were the primary concern for his respiratory failure, with a component of diastolic heart failure.
We attempted to maintain his home heart failure regimen, but held many of his medications given his diastolic dysfunction and hypotension.
We intermittently dosed IV Lasix for diuretic effect given his diastolic failure.
He seems to be currently euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic.
# CORONARIES - The patient presented with 3-vessel coronary artery disease status post-CABG in [**2091**] and a re-do in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1), PCI with LCx proximal Cypher stent in [**2110**] ??????
stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging [**2119-9-1**] showing stable moderate predominantly fixed defect in the inferior, inferolateral walls and apex with inferior wall hypokinesia and an LVEF of 34% with no anginal symptoms on stress testing.
He presented with no chest pain this admission; EKG on admission was without ST-changes, V-paced.
# RHYTHM - The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is status-post ablation in [**2114**], with placement of a biventricular device and ICD previously.
Given his findings of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and hematuria issues in the setting of coagulopathy, his anticoagulation was initially held.
Given his 2 prior ischemic stroke events, we judiciously held anticoagulation when his INR dropped below 2, but his bleeding concerns were more of an issue at the time.
His Coumadin was resumed on [**2119-11-14**] after his INR and coagulopathy had normalized and his diffuse alveolar hemorrhage concerns subsided.
.. # SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR, COAGULOPATHY, ANEMIA AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA ??????
Patient presented on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation with a supratherapeutic INR of 10.1 given his recent initiation of sulfa drug (Bactrim) for presumed lower extremity cellulitis vs. chronic venous stasis changes.
His INR could also have been elevated in the setting of poor PO intake.
He had no evidence of bleeding on admission.
Given the concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (see above), his anticoagulation was held, we transfused him 2 units of packed red cells for a HCT of 21%, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma for INR reversal and dosed 5 mg of PO Vitamin K. An active type and screen with adequate IV access was maintained at all times.
He developed significant marcocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia to the 70s over his length of stay.
A DIC panel was overall reassuring, with some transient hyperbilirubinemia, but negative peripheral smear.
Hematology was consulted and felt that marrow suppression was most likely, but other factors were contributing, such as low iron utilization in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia and active infection.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ??????
The patient presented with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.5 based on our records; renal insufficiency has been attributed to diabetic nephropathy in combination with diastolic dysfunction and poor perfusion pressures.
His history of intolerance to ACEI/ARBs has been noted.
Now presented with creatinine of 3.0, hyponatremia to 132 and some hyperkalemia with evidence of volume overload on exam during admission ??????
urine lytes demonstrate FeUrea of 38.45% (FeNa of 1.73% but on diuretics) consistent with intra-renal or post-renal process ??????
concern for ATN vs. intrinsic renal process given poor forward perfusion pressures in the setting of acute congestive heart failure exacerbation vs. intrinsic renal process which could tie together his pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure (Goodpasture?????
?s vs. Wegeners or other medium-vessel vasculitidies).
# LOWER EXTREMITY PURPURA, PETECHIAE; VENOUS STASIS CHANGES ??????
He has evidence of chronic venous stasis changes of the lower extremity; was started on Clindamycin and then Bactrim by his PCP for presumed [**Name9 (PRE) 24093**] MRSA coverage and lower extremity cellulitis vs. erysipelas.
Exam on admission was notable for prominent ecchymoses in many stages of evolution with superimposed chronic venous insufficiency changes.
Dermatology was consulted given the irregular appearance and the concern for a vasculitis.
They thought the lesions could be venous stasis changes vs. coagulopathy-induced ecchymoses vs. capillaritis vs. a leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV).
# HYPERTENSION ??????
His Hydralazine was held given concerns for vasculitis, and his aldosterone antagonist was held given concerns for hyperkalemia initially.
# CONCERN FOR SEIZURE ACTIVITY - The patient presented with no history of seizure activity or epilepsy, but was noted to have a single episode of some mild, myoclonic jerking motions which prompted a head CT which showed a stable prior ischemic infarct in the left posterior temporal/occipital areas, unchanged from [**2115**].
There was no new hemorrhage, infarct or mass effect.
An EEG was obtained and was without epileptiform foci or concerning activity.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued him on Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily.
# GERD - We continued Ranitidine 150 mg PO daily intially, but this was switched to Protonix 40 mg IV daily in the setting of guiac positive stools.
An H pylori antigen returned positive, however after discussion with his PCP and gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**], we decided against triple therapy as the risks of infection outweighed the benefit of treatment.
# NUTRITION - On day 3 of intubation, while the patient remained NPO, we started Isosource tube feeds for a goal rate of 45 cc/hr given Nutrition's recommendations, which he tolerated well.
Heparin bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**12-29**]) for a fib with RVR (per his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 24094**] he should be on lifelong anticoaggulation.
