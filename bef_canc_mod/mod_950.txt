She states that since her surgery she has had continued intermittent abdominal pain located near her urostomy and N/V.
Today her urostomy started to produce purulent material and she was sent from the ED from her rehab facility for further treatment.
She denies fevers/chills or other complaints.

Dilated loops of small bowel with transition point in a large right abdominal wall hernia is consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Patient is status post ileal conduit urinary diversion and urostomy, adjacent to which is a moderate-to-large right-sided abdominal wall hernia.
High-density fluid within the right abdominal wall hernia is concerning for leakage of oral contrast.
Bilateral hydronephrosis appears increased compared to CT scan of [**2167-6-3**] but likely not significantly changed from [**2167-6-13**].
Atelectasis and minimal right lower lobe ground-glass opacity likely represents volume overload or positioning edema; however, mild infectious process cannot be completely excluded.
Interval development of multifocal ground-glass peribronchial opacities involving left upper lobe and the lower lobes, likely represent infection and/or aspiration.
Left predominant abnormality is consistent likely preferential left lateral decubitus position due to right sided abscess, and layering fluid within the upper esophagus, suggesting aspiration.
Persistent large rim-enhancing and gas-containing right lower quadrant subcutaneous peristomal abscess with significant adjacent inflammatory stranding.
No evidence for fistula formation.
No new abscess.
Persistent but decreased bilateral reflux hydronephrosis, longstanding and likely related to ileal conduit urinary diversion.
Bilateral renal cysts are unchanged.
[**2167-7-21**] CXR : Lung volumes are lower, the small bilateral pleural effusions are new, but the most important change is widespread multifocal peribronchial opacification--most likely widespread infection, perhaps embolic--almost nodular in the left upper lobe, a new large region of consolidation at both lung bases, the right anterior and the left posterior.
No pneumothorax.
Persistence of large rim-enhancing collection in the right lower quadrant, although the collection has decreased in size.
Interval improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities, with a new small left pleural effusion.
Persistent mild left hydronephrosis, likely related to ileal conduit urinary diversion.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
MODERATE GROWTH.

Plans were made for drainage of her abdominal abscess in Interventional radiology.
She also had multiple episodes of emesis requiring nasogastric tube placement for decompression.
On [**2167-7-17**] she had some hypotension and abdominal pain and was transferred to the Surgical ICU for further management.
Her initial wound culture grew gram negative and gram positive rods and eventual Lactobacillus.
A CT showed re accumulation of her abdominal fluid collection and she had a drain replaced under ultrasound guidance.
During this time she developed diarrhea and specimens for C difficile were sent on 3 different occasions.
Her Flagyl was discontinued but her oral Vancomycin remains as the plan for antibiotic treatment of her polymicrobial organisms including lactobacillus will continue indefinitely until her abscess is totally drained.
She remains afebrile with a normal WBC.
From a pulmonary standpoint she developed a congested cough on [**2167-7-20**] without fevers but her WBC was 19K.
A chest Xray was done which showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and she was already being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She underwent chest PT, incentive spirometry and nebulizer treatments and within 24 hours had symptomatically improved with a decreased cough and Room Air saturations of 94-95%.
