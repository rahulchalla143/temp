Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 61 year old male with multiple ED visits and admissions for alcohol intoxication as well as withdrawal symptoms and DTs who presented with obtundation secondary to alcohol intoxication requiring intubation.
Active Problems: # Respiratory Distress: He was intubated for airway protection in the setting of acute alcohol intoxication and GCS <8.
# Alcohol intoxication/withdrawl: He had elevated alcohol levels (482) in the ED and was put on a CIWA scale for withdrawal symptoms.
He never scored higher than 15 on CIWA and had no e/o seizure or DTs during his stay.
# Pancreatitis: He had elevated lipase on admission with some abdominal pain felt to be most consistent with pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use.
At the time of discarge he was still endorsing mild abd pain, but concern for ongoing pancreatitis was low given he was tolerating a diet with a good appetite.
Chronic Problems:  # Elevated LFTs: Had elevated LFTs in the setting of heavy alcohol use, but they were improved from previous.
# Hypotension: He had hypotension in the setting of intubation that was responsive to fluid and decreasing his sedation.
# Elevated lactate: Had elevated lactate to 3.1 which normalized with IV fluids.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Alcohol Withdrawl   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
We treated your withdrawl with a medication called Valium.
This could result in you having a seizure, hallucinations or even death.
You should return to the ED if you begin to feel worse, experience significant nausea and vomiting or lose consciousness.
