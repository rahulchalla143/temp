Admission Date:  [**2177-11-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-12-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**], complicated by pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
At that time he denied diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and bright red blood per rectum.
He had dark stools at baseline secondary to iron use.
The stool was found to be guaiac positive in the Emergency Department.
Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7 cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately 25 cm.
There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no stigmata of recent bleeding.
Of note, prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper extremity and complained of pain of the right upper extremity.
Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

No history of intravenous drug use.
General appearance:  Well developed, obese white male, pleasant, comfortable in no acute distress.
Sclera and conjunctiva anicteric.
Neck:  Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 heart sounds auscultated, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Chest x-ray was negative for any acute pulmonary process.
There was no free air in the abdomen.
There was a large amount of fecal material in the right colon.
There was no evidence of obstruction.
Later computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess, bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer, appendicitis or diverticulitis.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis, prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning.
He was in his usual state of health until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's gastrointestinal workup included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one without source of frank bleed.
However, in light of his initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.
Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis.
Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper extremity pain and swelling.
In light of his recent bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the functionality of his one remaining lung.
In particular there was concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep vein thrombosis formation.
Computerized tomographic venogram was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis, however.
The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.
On [**2177-12-4**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.
Examination was consistent with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet.
He was monitored for acute decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.
He was diuresed gently after arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.
At the time of discharge he was maintaining saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.
It was felt that a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital stay.
Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.
Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet, with q.i.d.
Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient dose of Amiodarone.
Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an elevated creatinine level above his baseline.
This was likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his acute bleeding episode.
His acute renal failure resolved after fluid hydration.
Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
At the time of discharge he was tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other incident.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without nausea or vomiting.
Anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleed.

He will decide on the timing and the necessity of any further testing or studies that will be required including any further gastrointestinal workup for bleeding.
