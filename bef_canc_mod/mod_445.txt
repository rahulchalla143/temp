Admission Date:  [**2134-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-9-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with placement of three stents and IABP.
History of Present Illness: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87 yo M with chronic kidney disease s/p AV Graft placement [**8-2**], stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and shortness of breath.
He reports that his chest pain began approximately one week ago.
It is associated with shortness of breath.
He came to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**9-6**].
He has also noticed a cough recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he feels congested).
An CXR at the time to evaluate possible CHF showed "No evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
ESRD secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis s/p right upper extremity AV graft 9'[**56**]'[**33**] in preparation for dialysis.
CVA, with residual weakness of his left side 6.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism 8.
Chronic anemia on procrit injections 9.
Has help with cleaning, other chores.
Family History: Coronary artery disease  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 97.2, HR 75, BP 112/55, RR 28, Sao2 97%/4L O2 NC HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, dry mucous membranes, OP clear Neck: JVP elevated approx 4cm above sternal notch CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Pulm: diffusely decreased BS on R. Bibasilar crackles.
CXR [**2134-9-11**]: Interval development of perihilar patchy opacities consistent with left ventricular heart failure.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided pressures.
Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic hypertension.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.
The left anterior descending artery had diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.
The left anterior descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal segments.
The left circumflex coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid, and distal segments.
There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
There was total occlusion of the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.
No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and stenting using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion reduction from 80% to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow in the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any vessel.
Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Monomorphic VT thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from previous MI.
However, given the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons, and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat his arrhythmia medically.
Of note, the QT interval was prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.
Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease, subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and IABP placement.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with severely depressed systolic function.
Patient was initially started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
His swan and sheath were discontinued without complications.
Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V graft.
Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was positive for yeast.
Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic renal disease.
Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.
DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale with Accu-Check to monitor.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome Congestive heart failure chronic renal disease urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Good- patient hemodynamically stable and afebrile, heart rate and rhythm has been well controlled.
Discharge Instructions: We have started you on a new medication to help control your heart rhythm, and a new medication to help control your blood pressure.
In addition, we have started you on a medication to help treat a urinary tract infection.
