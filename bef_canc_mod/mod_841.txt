Admission Date:  [**2154-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-4-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-4-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**] Chief Complaint: Descending Aortic Dissection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2154-3-20**] Redo sternotomy, Endovascular Stent Placement to Ascending, Arch and Descending Aorta, Right Axillo-femoral Bypass Grafting, with Reconstruction of Innominate and Left common carotid artery.
He underwent an aortic valve replacement and replacement of his ascending aorta in [**2153-5-20**] at the [**Hospital1 18**] for an acute aortic dissection.
His postoperative course at that time was complicated by respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis.
A CT scan in [**2153-12-20**] was notable for an extensive aortic dissection extending into the great vessels of the chest.
Unfortunately, the diameter of the descending thoracic aorta increased substantially, which was suggestive of continued leak from the true lumen into the false lumen.
Additionally, the early enhancement of the false lumen relative to the true lumen was also consistent with continued leak into the false lumen.

He had evidence of increased dissection of his descending thoracic aorta by CTA of the chest in 12/[**2153**].
Postoperatively he continued to have significant bleeding for which he was taken back to the OR.
The innominate artery stump was found to be bleeding and was sutured.
Overnight he had a low SVO2 and hemodynamic instability for which a bedside TEE was obtained and showed a possible pericardial tamponade.
On POD2 A CT chest and lower extremity U/S did not show evidence of thromboembolism.
On POD4 He became hypertensive requiring nitroglycerine for BP control.
He became febrile to 101F for which blood and urine cultures were sent and antibiotics started.
On POD7 Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed copious brown sternal drainage.
On POD 9 He developed new onset aphasia and mild right sided weakness.
He became agitated and combative requiring sedation for diagnostic CTA.
CTA did not reveal any acute hemorrhage.
A postoperative embolus was suspected for which cerebral angiogram, lower ext doppler, and carotid U/S were performed which did not show any evidence of embolus or occlusion.
On POD 11 the infectious disease service was consulted for fever and leukocytosis.
On POD 12 a chest CT revealed sternal dehiscience for which he was taken back to the OR for sternal rewiring and mediastinal exploration.
No signs of mediastinitis were seen.
Pan cultures remained essentially negative except for a mediastinal culture which grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus.
His fevers and leukocytosis gradually resolved.
