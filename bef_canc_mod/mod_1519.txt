Admission Date:  [**2148-3-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2148-3-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2073-7-27**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and cough.
He presents with fever, cough and chills with a temperature to 102.0.
He is not forthcoming as a historian but denies any recent vomiting.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for fever, cough, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but no lower extremity edema.
He denies any melena or bright red blood per rectum.
It was noted by the nursing staff that he has poor oral intake.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post partial gastrectomy.
The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general, the patient is in no acute distress.
Slight decrease in breath sounds t the right base with occasional expiratory wheezes.
Extremities:  NO edema and warm.
Small blood, 30 protein, trace ketones, small bilirubin, 0 to 2 white blood cells, rare bacteria.
Chest x-ray reveals no effusion, no congestive heart failure.
A right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 113, normal axis and intervals and no ST or T wave abnormalities.
Based on his initial chest x-ray, it appeared that his fevers were secondary to a pneumonia, questionable aspiration pneumonia.
It was found that he is on a mechanical soft diet with the nursing staff not aware of any gross aspiration.
Blood and sputum cultures were obtained, of which the sputum culture grew out moderate growth of coagulase positive staph aureus which was Oxacillin sensitive.
24 hours with suspected aspiration pneumonia.
A bedside swallowing evaluation was obtained on hospital day number two which revealed severe oral motor weakness and difficulty initiating swallows, probable aspiration of apple sauce and water and was, therefore, placed n.p.o.
The neurology service was consulted for further evaluation of the etiology of his oropharyngeal dysphagia.
They recommended performing an egrophonium test during a repeated speech and swallow to evaluate for possible myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation with this tensilon was performed with similar results to his initial evaluation -- namely considerable aspiration with inability to propel pureed foods as well as inability to protect his airway.
Oxacillin was added to his antibiotic regimen for further coverage of his aspiration pneumonia and his persistence of a leukocytosis.
With this antibiotic regimen, he continued to remain afebrile and completed a two week course in total of these antibiotics.
He continues to remain a chronic aspiration risk and was started on Bactrim DS p.o.
IN regards to further work-up of his oral and motor weakness, an otorhinolaryngology consult was obtained to rule out further involvement of his gingival cancer.
It was difficult to determine the baseline mental status of this patient and given the possibility of neuroleptics causing dystonia, interfering with his oral motor weakness, his psychiatric medications were held, though upon further review of his history, he had speech and swallowing difficulties prior to admission.
The psychiatry service was consulted in regards to further evaluation of his dementia as well as recommended medications that would not interfere with his oral and motor function.
An arterial blood gases was drawn during this event which revealed a pH of 7.17, Pc02 of 87 and P02 of 104, indicative of a respiratory acidosis.
It was thought that the etiology of his dyspnea was secondary to a possible aspiration event, super imposed on his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
After approximately 24 hours of mask ventilation, the patient clinically improved with good oxygen saturations and was significantly less labored in terms of his respiratory status.
He was discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit after a three day stay and sent back to the floor, with continuation of treatment for aspiration pneumonia as primary treatment of his dyspnea.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, Psychiatric Unit, where he will have further evaluation of his mental status and indication for Trilafon.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
