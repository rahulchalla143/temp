Admission Date:  [**2161-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-9-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Minoxidil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7281**] Chief Complaint: Fever, vomiting, coffee-ground emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD ([**2161-9-24**])  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 54-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus s/p kidney/pancreas transplant in [**2157**], presenting with a one day history of fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting.
He was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission ([**2161-9-21**]) when he developed chills and fevers to 103F.
He subsequently developed significant nausea, with vomiting x10-20 times - initially clear, but then became dark-red with coffee-grounds.
He denies sore throat, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, dysuria, constipation, or diarrhea.
Two of his children have a viral syndrome with cough but no nausea or vomiting, and he denies any recent travel or any raw or old uncooked food ingestion.
Of note, the patient works outside on a golf course and had a recent malleolar fracture ([**8-11**]); he has also had several bites by mosquitoes - 1 of which was recently infected (completed a full course of Keflex).
He continued to vomit several times, some with coffee-ground emesis.
He was guaiac positive on exam, and he had a single transient episode of abdominal pain that self-resolved.
ESRD s/p CRT [**3-/2157**] - post-op course complicated by delayed graft function and hydronephrosis s/p ureteral stent and percutaneous nephrostomy in [**3-7**].
Now with renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 2.0.
Pancreas transplant [**9-/2157**], rejected [**2158**] 4. h/o Partial SBO - treated conservatively 5.
Hypertension 6.
Coronary Artery Disease s/p stent of Ramus Intermedius in [**2156**] 7.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 8. s/p ventral hernia repair with mesh in [**2153**] 9.
Orthostatic hypotension 10.Medial malleolar fracture [**8-/2161**] - treated with Keflex and Vicodin.
Ortho evaluation [**9-21**] - no infection, no ulcer.
Studies: - portable CXR: The lungs are now well-inflated and clear, without infiltrate or effusion.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic air.
- AXR: Extensively fecoloaded colon, with no evidence of obstruction.
- Renal transplant US: No evidence of hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney.
Rounded fluid structure superomedial to the transplant kidney, may represent an exophytic cyst, but was not seen on the prior studies from [**2158**] (most recent available for comparison).
- ECG: NSR @ 97, nl axis, nl intervals, 1mm STD 1 (old), II, V4-V6 (new), TWI aVL (old) - TTE: Moderate to severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic dysfunction with elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
- EGD: Gastric erosion (biopsy); Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy); Possible small, healing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear at GE junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 54-yo Male with Type I DM s/p kidney / pancreas transplant, presenting with fever and vomiting.
This may be related to gastroenteritis from food-borne illness, which is consistent with nausea and vomiting on admission.
UA and urine Cx were negative, and there was no evidence of PNA on CXR.
The patient continued to be afebrile since admission, and his leukocytosis resolved.
ID felt that the Bacillus was likely a contaminant from the lab, as other [**Doctor Last Name **] culture bottles were also growing Bacillus in other patients, who also had no clinical reason to have Bacillus growing in their [**Doctor Last Name **].
Surveillance [**Doctor Last Name **] cultures were sent on the morning of discharge, and the patient was sent home with a prescription to complete the full 10-day course of empiric Levofloxacin.
Vomiting/coffee-ground emesis: The patient presented with coffee-ground emesis in the setting of nausea/vomiting and wretching, making it likely that the cause was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear.
NG lavage was done in the ED, which was negative for persistent bleeding.
The patient was admitted to the MICU for monitoring, and was noted to have a stable hematocrit and to be hemodynamically stable throughout his course there.
GI was consulted, and EGD was done on [**2161-9-24**], which showed gastritis and a gastric erosion, as well as small healing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear at GEJ.
The locations of the gastritis and gastric erosion were biosied, and results are pending.
He may take Tylenol for pain or fever, and may continue on Reglan for nausea.
ECG changes: The patient's initial ECG on admission ([**9-21**]) showed new ST depressions in V4-V6, also with elevated cardiac enzymes.
Repeat ECG done on hospital day #2 ([**9-22**]) showed much less pronounced ST depressions in V4-V6.
TTE was done, which showed no wall-motion abnormalities or vegetations.
Dobutamine Echo was done on [**9-25**] to risk stratify the patient, and the patient had no anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.
The results showed a stable, moderate fixed inferior wall perfusion defect, marked LV cavity dilatation, and markedly depressed LV function (EF 48%).
Hypertension: The patient's Lisinopril was held while in the MICU given his acute renal failure.
As the renal failure resolved, the patient was restarted on [**1-6**]-dose Lisinopril, and then titrated up to full-dose Lisinopril once he was on the floor.
Coronary Artery Disease Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Diabetes Mellitus Type I 2. s/p pancreas transplant 3. hypertension 4. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 5. medial malleolar fracture [**8-/2161**] s/p casting   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable, without nausea or vomiting, tolerating POs, hematocrit stable without evidence of bleeding.
The results showed a small tear from the vomiting, but also some inflammation and an erosion in the stomach, which were biopsied and should be followed up as an outpatient.
You were found to have bacteria in your [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] you were started on antibiotics to treat the bacteria.
If you develop any fevers, chills, worsening nausea or vomiting, or abdominal pain, you should return to the emergency room immediately.
