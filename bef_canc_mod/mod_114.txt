Reportedly, pt also with low back pain over the past week and adominal pain which is chronic.
Past Medical History: Subdural hematoma Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Essential thrombocytopenia s/p placement of GJ tube infected GJ tube insertion site h/o C diff infection (diagnosed in [**Month (only) **] admit)   Social History: Pt is haitian Creole speaking.
No M/R/G Lungs: CTA b/l anteriorly.
Diffuse tenderness without rebound or guarding >er LLQ and suprapubic areas.

No acute abnormality.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no new mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Stable appearance of old infarct in the right posterior cerebral artery distribution is noted.
Stable periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with small vessel ischemic change is seen.
[**2111-5-28**]-EEG-: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
Medications,  metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no epileptiform features.
[**2111-6-4**]-EEG-This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background rhythm in the theta frequency range with occasional intermixed, generalized delta frequency slowing.
These findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with an encephalopathy.
Common causes include infections, medication effects, and metabolic disturbances.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were identified.
If clinical concern for seizures persists, a repeat study after the patient's mental status improves, may be of benefit to better discriminate focal abnormality that can be obscured by an encephalopathic pattern.
Sinus bradycardia was noted.
New focus of increased susceptibility in the peripheral right cerebellar hemisphere, which may be artifactual, but could represent a small area of hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute ischemia.
Enhancement of the pachymeninges along the entire right convexity, likely related to previous subdural hemorrhage.
Developmental venous anomaly in the right frontal lobe, a benign finding.
No evidence of acute ischemia.
No cerebral masses.
That same day patient had 2 large melenic stools.
EGD was initially attempted but could unsuccessful to visualize bleeding b/o old clot.
EGD repeated on [**2111-5-29**] and showed small ulcer w/ signs of recent bleeding at gastrostomy site.
Additionally, pt was found to have a pseudomonal UTI and mental status improved.
Then pt had two unresponsive episodes on the floor.
Altered mental status/unresponsive- Pt was initially pulling at his foley and IVs pulling them out when he was initially hospitalized.
He eventually was found to have a pseudomonal UTI and was fully treated with Zosyn (see below).
Thus, his altered mental status when he was in the hospital was attributable to his UTI and has now resolved to his previous mental status.
Pt also had with two episodes of unresponsiveness on [**2111-6-3**] and [**2111-6-7**].
Repeat MRI with gadolidium showed no acute stroke.
EEG was repeated and was only consistent with encephalopathy.
Neurology was consulted on pt who thought that pt may have seizures but it was unclear.
The 1:1 sitter was taken off a few days before discharge and pt did well, with no agitation.
GI Bleed-Pt had a GIB secondary to ulceration at PEG tube from pulling it out.
[**Name (NI) 12007**] Pt grew pseudomonas in his urine which was sensitive to Zosyn.
FOley placement was difficult therefore no voiding trials were done.
Flomax was started for urinary retention.
Depression- we d/cd paxil in setting of altered mental status.
C. diff- Pt with c. diff positive on prior hospitalizations with persistant diarrhea.
He had peripheral IVs otherwise.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Delirium Gastrointestinal bleed Urinary Tract Infection Inability to pass foley Clostridium difficile  Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension Essential thrombocytosis Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Pt is doing significantly better.
They note that he has had intermittant delerium since SDH in spring, now baseline, does not require inpatient care.
Discharge Instructions: Call your doctor or go to the ED if you have change in your mental status, bright red blood per rectum, black stools, have fever >101, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, problems breathing, shortness of breath, or any other health concern.
