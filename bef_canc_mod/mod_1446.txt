Of note he was sent to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2188-9-19**] for hypotension (BP 86/50s), vomiting, and diaphoreseis, but had negative workup and sent home.
He was noted to have moderate leuks on UA, so infectious cause of delirium/psychosis was thought to be likely.
Also, he had troponin of 0.05 with new TWI in V2-V6, but no chest pain.
CXR negative for acute process.
Admitted for UTI and ROMI.
ROS: Denies recent fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.

suprapubic catheter in place, erythema ~1 cm surrounding, also opaque white discharge from site, tender when probed BACK: No CVA tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: No edema, strong distal pulses NEURO: alert and oriented x 3 but with persistent paranoid delusions, [**6-16**] upper and lower extremity strength   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: .
[**2188-9-25**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in leads I and III.
ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2 with T wave inversion in leads V2-V6.
However, ST segment elevations were seen in leads V1-V2 on prior tracings.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
man with h/o CAD, suprapubic catheter, here with likely catheter infection and new ischemic EKG changes.
Pelvic pain: On presentation, the patient complained of new pain at the site of his suprapubic catheter.
He later complained of penile and perineal pain.
UA showed bacteria and WBC.
He was persistenly afebrile, with no elevated WBC count, and no CVA tenderness.
They changed the suprapubic catheter and commented that the bacteria represented normal colonizers of a bladder with an indwelling catheter and were unlikely to be pathologic and did not require treatment beyond 24 hours past the time of catheter change.
CAD:  EKG showed ischemic changes new from previous tracing 06/[**2188**].
Troponins were mildly positive at .05.
The most likely cause of the EKG changes was deduced to be an ischemic event around the time of that ED visit.
Given the patient's multiple medical comorbidities and the fact that he was asymptomatic, no stress test was performed.
Medical management of CAD was optimized, including continuation of ACEI, BB, increase of statin (LDL 136) and addition of ASA.
Pulseless arrest and ICU course:  Pt was transfered to the MICU after being found unresponsive and pulseless on the floor.
The most likely cause of the arrest was thought to be long-QT-induced arrhythmia secondary to the combination of ciprofloxacin and olanzapine, although there was no telemetry documentation of any abnormal rhythm.
Labs were drawn and he was settled in, after which he complained of vague mild abdominal "soreness" that had resolved.
He later became agitated and confused and required redirection and zyprexa.
Head CT from prior admission was notable for evidence of microvascular ischemia, prominent ventricles, and a single focus of likely chronic blood product in the L frontal [**Hospital1 3630**].
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency (iron 40 mg, TIBC 348).
