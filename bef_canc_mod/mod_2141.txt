Name:  [**Last Name (LF) 18267**],[**Known firstname **]                 Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 18268**]  Admission Date:  [**2132-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-8-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-5-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10790**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis Protocol admit Pneumonia Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation & mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 71 year-old man with a PMH significant for type II diabetes, cirrhosis, alcohol abuse and HTN who was in his usual state of health until 2 days prior to admission when he developed URI symptoms.
Patient also reported increased fatigue, non-productive cough, neck stiffness, decreased PO intake and increased NSAID use in the setting of recent vocal cord surgery.
Also of note is that the  patient has had several episodes of hypoglycemia over the past 3 days.
At approximatley 12:30PM on the day of admission he was found by his daughter short of breath at home with complaint of left-sided chest and arm pain.
At this time he was noted to be taking rapid shallow breaths.
He was given 25mg IV Dilt and became hypotensive.
Patient was again treated with 20mg IV dilt and SBP dropped again again to the 60s.
Hypotension in ER was treated with 6L NS.
CXR showed LLL pneumonia for which he received a dose of levaquin and was eventually intubated with worsening ABGs.
Patient remained hypotensive with MAPs <60 and HR 140's.
Due to persistently low MAPs unresponsive to IVF while on 3 pressors the patient was cardioverted with 200J.
Vocal cord polyp removal.
Bilateral cataract surgery.

However, when an endotracheal sample grew out Strep pneumoniae his antibiotic regimen was switched to ceftriaxone.
The following day the sensitivities for this organism were complete and it was found that the Strep pneumoniae was sensitive to penicillin.
This showed a left upper and left lower lobe consolidation with patchy infiltrates consistent with pneumoniae, bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, cirrhosis and findings consistent with portal hypertension.
On [**7-24**] he became hypotensive with inc WBC & inc temp.
His sputum eventually grew out MRSA, presumed to be ventilator associated PNA.
Since the d/c of antibiotics he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
He was weaned to room air on [**8-19**] and reported no dyspnea.
Acute renal failure:  The patient on presentation had acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.8.
His renal failure was felt to be secondary to his long-standing diabetes and hypertension in the setting of NSAID use, decreased p.o.
intake, dehydration and persistent hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitor use and low blood pressure in the setting of pneumonia/sepsis.
Initially the patient became oliguric making only approximately 5 cc/hour of urine.
However, he eventually entered a polyuric phase of ATN with increased urine output.
Due to his septic shock and hypotension, he received many fluid boluses and was net + over 30 liters.
At the time of extubation, he was approx 10 L +, he demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Acidosis:  The patient had a combination of respiratory and metabolic acidosis at presentation to the MICU.
His metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to sepsis as evidenced by his elevated lactate greater than 10.
The patient's respiratory acidosis was secondary to hypoventilation in the setting of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given his significant tobacco history.
Lastly, the patient received multiple liters of normal saline infusion and does likely have a non anion gap acidosis from this.
On [**7-24**], when he became hypotensive, he was restarted on pressors, eventually requiring dopamine to maintain adequate MAPS & urinary output.
[**Month (only) **] platelets/WBC:  The patient had a diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia at the time of dictation.
This revealed that he did, indeed, have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 33,000.
The thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to hypersplenism as evidenced on his CT scan.
Hematology was consulted and followed for several days.
It was thought that his decreased platelets & WBC were secondary to hypersplenism and decreased thrombopoietin production, combined with his sepsis, and possibly low WBC secondary to cirrhosis.
He also developed a worsening of his thrombocytopenia in the setting of receiving heparin.
Atrial fibrillation:  At presentation to the Emergency Room the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
This was felt to be secondary to increased cardiac output demand in the setting of infection.
He was not anticoagulated given his increased bleeding risk secondary to likely esophageal varices.
In addition, this was his first episode of atrial fibrillation and it was felt that the factors contributing to this event were resolving.
Diabetes: The pt required close management of his blood sugars throughout his stay, and was on an insulin drip for most of the time he was intubated.
Coagulopathy:  The patient had an elevated INR at the time of presentation.
This was thought to be secondary to his liver disease.
At this time he received vitamin K. Initial HIT panel showed HIT+, another cause of his thrombocytopenia.
Thrombosis/hepatoma:   Given his liver disease an abdominal ultrasound was obtained.
Signs of portal hypertension with a markedly enlarged spleen containing a small cyst.
The patient was also found to have a distended gallbladder containing a large stone but no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Lastly, there was a very abnormal liver with focal areas of mass light configuration particularly evident within the left lobe lateral segment where there was a five times 5 cm apparent mass.
These were just minimally elevated above normal.
Possible etiologies included sedation, tachybrady syndrome given his recent history of atrial fibrillation, slow heart rate secondary to sepsis, some [**Last Name **] problem with his  conduction system such as endocarditis or abscess.
