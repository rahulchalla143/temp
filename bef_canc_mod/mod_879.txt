Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Dry MM, No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVP unable to assess given cordis on RIJ.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: well healed surgical scars, soft, + tenderness periumbilical and lower abdomen, no RUQ tenderness and no tenderness over implant site.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
IMAGING: RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION: At least no diastolic flow with suggestion of reversal of diastolic flow within an arterial branch within the renal hilum.
Stable elevated resistive indices seen in more peripheral branches involving the upper pole, interpolar region, and lower pole.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2 cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-12-7**], the severity of aortic stenosis has slightly progressed.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly lower.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo F with a-fib on coumadin, dCHF, mod-severe MR improved to mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**12-17**], IDDM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, NASH & ESRD s/p liver and kidney [**7-/2153**] presented to [**Hospital1 **] with high degree 2:1 AV block and acute renal failure.
# High Degree AV block/syncope: Pt with syncopal episode and found to have HR 20-30's at OSH.
Likely high degree 2:1 AV block as p waves appear to be conducted on the OSH.
The patient had a transvenous pacer placed at the OSH and was hemodynamically stable when being paced at 70.
The cause of her heart block was most likely electrolyte abnormalities and renal failure in a patient who is predisposed to heart block given her history calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification.
She did not have any evidence of acute MI on ECG or by cardiac enzymes or myocarditis.
She had a [**Company 1543**] dual chamber pacemaker placed on [**2-5**] without complications.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt s/p kidney transplant 6/[**2153**].
Her [**Last Name (un) **] was thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion and diuresis in the setting of heart block.
Lactate 2.2 and fever to 101.6.
Patient was covered broadly with vancomycin, meropenum and flagyl given her immunocompromised state and history of infections with resistant organisms.
The patient had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis given her abdominal pain and nausea.
She did not have any cause of infection visualized on CT scan.
# Bladder: The patient had significant blood clots passed through her foley catheter.
She occasionally complained of severe pain in her suprapubic area, generally relieved with continuous bladder irrigation.
Her pain recurred while on CBI, on [**2-6**].
Her foley was irrigated vigorously with manual flushes.
# CAD:  The patient had a history of 3 vessel CAD, but no evidence of ACS.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure:  The patient has a history of dCHF (EF >55).
# NASH s/p liver transplant: Her LFT remained stable without evidence of acute rejection.
They felt her abdominal pain was at her baseline.
# HTN: Pt BP was SBP 140-130's on admission with a paced rhythm.
Bradycardia s/p pacer placement 2.
Hematuria secondary to foley trauma 3.
Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable for discharge.
While you were in the hospital we also noted that you had a urinary tract infection.
Following this, you developed blood in your urine, which was probably because of the blood thinning medication in combination with the Foley catheter.
We made the following medication changes during your hospitalization: (1) Started [**Last Name (LF) 49799**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibiotic for your urinary tract infection.
(4) You should take simethicone for gassy or abdominal pain.
(5) You can take oxycodone 5 mg every four hours as needed for pain until your spasms improve.
If you have any questions or want to reschedule this appointment, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**].
