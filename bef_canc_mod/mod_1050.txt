Admission Date:  [**2178-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: worsening SOB and chest pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 78 M with PMH HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's Disease, CRF (baseline Cr 1.2-1.5), presents with worsening SOB, chest pressure, N/V, sweating.
Pt denied fever, chills or cough.
He notes PND and orthopnea.
No cough, no sputum, no F/C.
+PND, +orthopnea, worsening SOB since discharged from [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt was recently discharged 1 wk ago for sepsis secondary to MRSA aspiration pneumonia (requiring pressors, intubation), stress dose steroids (adrenal insufficiency).
Hospital course complicated by hypertensive episodes and acute renal failure.
Past Medical History: [**Last Name (un) 3562**] disease Hypertension Chronic lower back pain Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creat 1.2-1.5) CAD h/o melanoma s/p resection 20yrs ago Gerd BPH  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with his wife.
Moderate congestive failure.
Unchanged parenchymal opacities bilaterally within the lower lobes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Echo [**7-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal septal/anterior, apical and basal inferior hypokinesis (estimated ejection fraction ?35-40%.
No definite apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Stress MIBI [**7-10**]: Moderate fixed inferior wall perfusion defect.
Transient ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle.
Moderate global hypokinesis with LV EF of 38%.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant circulation demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LMCA was very short versus dual ostia.
There was a 50% proximal stenosis and then a 70% stenosis after the takeoff of the D1.
The distal LAD had moderate diffuse disease.
The D1 had moderate diffuse disease proximally.
The LCx had a 60% ostial stenosis and then a serial 70% stenosis in the proximal segment.
There was moderate diffuse disease in the distal LCx.
The OM1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin.
The L-PL had mild diffuse disease.
There were moderate left to right collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization demonstrated mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP=13mmHg, mean PCWP=17mmHg).
There was moderate pulmonary and systemic arterial hypertension (PA=47/17mmHg, Ao=170/67mmHg).
The calculated cardiac output by the Fick method was 6.4 L/min with a cardiac index of 2.8.
Moderate hypoxemia was noted with an arterial oxygen saturation of 88% on 2L O2 by nasal cannula.
This would allow identification of a major area at risk for ischemic which then can potentially be intervened upon via PCI.
NSTEMI: Though it was a NSTEMI, his echo shows a large area of hypokinesis which is new.
He was pain free after admission and his CK trended downward.
His ace-i was held secondary to his worsening renal function but restarted once his kidney function normalized.
He had a stress MIBI showing global hypokinesis with transient ischemic dilitation suggesting that a focused PCI would not be effective.
He was able lie flat and his O2 requirement was weaned.
Anemia: On admission, the pt had a baseline HCT of 27-33 and iron studies c/w an anemia of chronic disease.
Tachyarrhythmia: He had an episode of afib on the day after admission that was self limited and never recurred.
He was maintained on bblocker for rate control throughout his admission and had no further episodes.
Refills: 3   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: NSTEMI  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please return to the emergency room if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations.
