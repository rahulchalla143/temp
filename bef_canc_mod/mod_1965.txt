Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 5832**] an 81 M with history of AF on coumadin until recent  UGIB (gastritis) in the setting of INR 22, prior history of PE, MR/TR, recurrent pleural effusion who was transferred back to [**Hospital1 8**] from [**Hospital3 **] with persistently dropping hct and melena.
At last admission, he presented with a HCT of 12.5 and confusion in the setting of INR 22.
On prior admission, an EGD was performed which showed only mild gastritis and no active bleeding.
A colonoscopy showed moderate diverticulosis but also no signs of active bleeding.
His hospital course was complicated by subacute L superior cerebellar stroke, and he was placed back on lovenox and coumadin.
Since his discharge, the patient is complaining of dyspnea with exertion over last 2 days but no rest dyspnea.
In ED, + melenic stools with positive guaiac.
Pt did not tolerated NG lavage due to deviated septum with obstructed L nare.
There was a question of ST depression laterally and 1st cardiac enzymes were negative.
Small bowel enteroscopy and EGD which showed gastritis and a small angioectasia in the proximal ileum which was treated with thermal therapy.
On arrival, pt has no complaints.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 2.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 55% 4.
Hypertension 5.
Ventricular fibrillation w/ AICD 6.
Macular degeneration 9.
Valvular heart disease (severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]) 11.
Osteoarthritis w/ decreased mobility from pain 12.
Recent UGIB [**2-5**] gastritis 15.
Recurrent pleural effusion- unclear etiology, cytology negative in the past.
Asbestosis exposure.
Family History: Notable for a father who had macular degeneration.
There is no family history of any memory disorders.
Gen: pleasant male in NAD Heent: OP clear, + conjunctival pallor, Lungs: Decreased BS at left base with crackles [**1-7**] way up, decreased breath sound at R base, otherwise clear.
Cardiac: irregularly irregular S1/S2, [**3-8**] holosystolic murmur radiating to axilla Abdomen: obese, soft NT NABS Ext: nonpitting edema of LE b/l, + venous stasis changes Neuro: Awake, alert, oriented to place, MS R>L [**5-6**]+ UE.

Echo [**5-9**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is  mildly dilated.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+]tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small inferolateralpericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-9-21**], minimal aortic stenosis is now suggested and a very small inferolateral pericardial effusion is now identified.
[**2112-5-11**] Colonoscopy:  Protruding Lesions A single sessile 6 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal rectum at 14cm.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with medium openings were seen in the proximal sigmoid colon and mid-sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Impression: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Polyp at 14cm in the proximal rectum (polypectomy) Diverticulosis of the proximal sigmoid colon and mid-sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
[**2112-5-7**] EGD: Erythema in the fundus compatible with mild gastritis .
[**2112-6-9**] Small Capsule Endoscopy Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Angioectasia in the proximal ileum (thermal therapy) Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to proximal jejunum  Brief Hospital Course: 8A/P: 81yo M with recurrent left-sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology, afib on anticoagulation, recent embolic stroke  (while off anti-coagulation), admitted with recurrent GI bleed, transferred to ICU with acute respiratory failure.
# Respiratory failure (hypoxic and hypercarbic):  The patient with history of chronic left sided pleural effusion s/p several taps in the last year.
The source is unknown but concerning for malignant process given history of asbestos exposure, but cytology has been negative.
The acute respiratory event is most likely secondary to left sided pleural effusion reaccumulation vs. hemothorax in the setting of anticoagulation.
Bedside thoracentesis was attempted but aborted due to difficulties with aspiration.
On [**2112-6-15**], pt intubated for increasing hypercarbia & work of breathing.
A left sided thoracentesis was performed by IP with drainage of 600cc of bloody fluid.
Large right sided effusion w/ associated atelectasis +/- consolidation.
Pt's acute respiratory failure thought to be due to worsening left hemothorax, which may have worsened spontaneously with bleeding on anti-coagulation vs pleural bleeding after unsuccessful thoracentesis on [**2112-6-15**] vs malignancy.
Other contributors to pt's respiratory failure include possible hospital acquired PNA, ?
Patient was offered surgical options, but pt and family declined and wanted pursue thoracenteses for right-sided effustion.
