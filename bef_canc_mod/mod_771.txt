FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there has been interval development of new patchy density in the right middle and lower lobes.
This could represent either atelectasis or new pneumonia.
In addition there is focal consolidation of the left lower lobe.
There is perihilar opacity as well.
There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
The aorta is somewhat ectatic and tortuous.
New bibasilar consolidation since the prior study.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
