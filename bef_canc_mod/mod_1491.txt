Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent aggressive diuresis and treatment of her heart failure preoperatively, which included an intra aortic balloon pump and inotropic therapy.
Post operatively she was started on epinephrine, milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide, continued with her IABP and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
She was started on fluconazole postoperatively because it was noted that she had a rash consistent with yeast on her chest, this was continued for 14 days postoperatively per the infectious disease team.
Her nitric oxide and milrinone were weaned over the next several days, her support from the ventilator was decreased, and she was extubated on POD#4 without difficulty.
She had been started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, which she had a few short episodes postoperatively.
She underwent an echocardiogram on [**5-7**] which showed an LVEF of 60, mildly dialated LA/RA, LVH dialated RV with normal function and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV overload, moderate to severe TR, and normal MV prosthesis.
Although she remained volume overloaded, it was felt by the cardiology service, the cardiac surgery service and the medicine service that she could continue diuresis at rehab.
