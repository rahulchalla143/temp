Given her presentation of pleuritic chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, recent history of aspiration, and negative cardiac enzymes it was felt that she was most likely suffering from aspiration pneumonia.
She did well on the floor except for one episode of Atrial fibrillation that occurred as a result of a missed beta blocker dosage (held per protocol because of low systolic blood pressure).
During the entire episode, she never endorsed chest pain, dizziness, or palpitations.
Because she remained mildly tachycardic, she was transferred to a higher level of care for observation and converted to Sinus rhythm overnight.
The primary team scheduled a EGD for further evaluation of her aspiration and patency of her esophagectomy anastomosis.
The EGD showed widely patent esophago-gastric anastomosis, large amount of retained food in stomach and a normal appearing pylorus that was dilated to 18mm.
