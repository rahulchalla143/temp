She was also noted to have several episodes of bradycardia to the 30s with spontaneous resolution.

There is no pneumothorax.
There is stable scarring or atelectasis at the left lung base as well as calcifications at the costochondral junction.
IMPRESSION:  New left IJ catheter with tip in the upper SVC, no pneumothorax.
CT head w/o contrast [**8-8**]: Evolution with encephalomalacia due to a prior left ACA infarction, without evidence of hemorrhage or new infarction.
EEG [**2153-8-9**]: This is an abnormal waking EEG because of frequent intermittent left temporal slowing with moderate amplitude polymorphic delta and theta.
These findings are indicative of subcortical dysfunction over left temporal region but of non-specific etiology  TTE [**2153-8-9**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to ventricular interaction, with a pressure/volume overloaded right ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no right pneumothorax after failed internal jugular vein catheter placement.
No evidence of mediastinal widening.
No other changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 81-year-old female history of atrial fibrillation, CHF s/p mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] c/b ACA infarct presenting from rehab with AMS and hypotension following a syncopal episode, transferred to the ICU for hypotension requiring pressor support.
Initially suspicious for septic shock from presumed urinary source given pyruria/hematuria and recent h/o proteus UTI.
Her presentation was also concerning for cardiogenic shock given acute onset following presumed syncopal episode.
TTE [**2153-8-9**] showed EF 45%, dilated LA, abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure compared to prior.
Cardiology was consulted and felt her syncopal episode may have been precipitated by a conversion pause (see Syncope below).
#Syncope: Differential included syncope secondary to hypotension in the setting of urosepsis vs. cardiogenic shock vs. bradycardia.
Cardiology consulted, and felt syncope may have been secondary to conversion pause.
#AMS: Patient p/w somnolence/decreased responsiveness and confusion.
CT head neg for acute process.
DDx included decreased cerebral perfusion in setting of hypotension, seizures/post-ictal state, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, recrudesence of prior stroke symptoms and recurrent stroke.
No h/o seizures and no involuntary movements per report; EEG obtained and on prelim read showed no e/o seizure activity.
Did show focal slowing in left temporal region.
Neurology consulted, as patient had recurrent lethargy/decreased responsiveness in context of no longer being hypotension.
Felt recurrent CVA unlikely as patient's mental status had improved back to baseline w/o intervetion.
#UTI: Hematuria and pyruria on urinalysis in ED.
Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-25**] on amoxicillin for UTI which was changed to ceftriaxone x 5 days for planned 7 day course the following day when urine culture showed resistant proteus, but it is unclear if patient completed the full course of ceftriaxone based on rehab documentation.
Due to concern for resistance given possible inconsistency in ceftriaxone therapy, started treatment with cefepime to which the prior culture was also sensitive.
TEE is contraindicated due to h/o prior failure to pass probe due to resistance in upper esophagous (pt has h/o achalasia).
TTE [**2153-8-9**] showed EF 45%, dilated LA, abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure compared to prior.
No evidence of acute decompensation this admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been dilutional effect in setting of aggressive volume resuscitation for hypotension.
Glycerin Supps 1 SUPP PR PRN constipation 12.
Warfarin 2.5 mg PO DAILY16   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Heathwood - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis:  - Loss of consciousness  - low blood pressure  - Recovery from stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for loss of consciousness and low blood pressure.
The cause of low blood pressure was considered multifactorial.
You had a urinary tract infection, you were dehydrated, and it was possible that you had low heart rate during this episode.
A head CT was done to ensure that there was no extension of stroke and an EEG was done - revealing no seizures.
Neuro was involved and felt that there was no new stroke.
