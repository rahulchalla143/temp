Admission Date:  [**2131-1-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-1-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-10-20**]     Sex:  F  Service: CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to bronchiectasis and likely pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37 year-old year-old woman with a complicated past medical history including respiratory distress syndrome, aspergillus and tuberculosis leading to left pneumonectomy, bronchiectasis, congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy.
The patient was in her usual state of health until approximately two days prior to admission when she noticed an increase in her baseline shortness of breath, increased sinus drainage and secretions, increased coughing, which was productive of green sputum.
over the last week and upon contacting Dr.[**Name (NI) 21360**] nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2875**] Amoxicillin yesterday for symptoms she attributed to sinusitis.
There was no improvement in her symptoms for the past day.
There were no chills or rigors.
No chest pain.
No pleuritic pain.
No increase in orthopnea of three pillows baseline.
No change in lower extremity edema.
No headache, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, abdominal pain, urinary or bowel changes.
She noted decreased po intake and decreased appetite recently.
General, thin young female in moderate distress with accessory muscle usage.
Slightly dry mucous membranes.
No rales or wheezes.
G tube in place with some erythema and induration.
Extremities 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, purplish color bilaterally.
Chest x-ray, possible early pneumonia at right lung base, patchy increased density, some right pleural thickening versus small effusion, status post left pneumonectomy.
Respiratory:  The patient has a baseline elevated CO2 likely due to bronchiectasis with VQ mismatch as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12794**] effect and decreased respiratory drive.
The CO2 is now elevated above baseline likely secondary to infection.
The patient was transferred to the floor, but returned to the Intensive Care Unit on [**1-18**], with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary to decreased ability to suction the patient, provide chest physical therapy and respiratory treatment on the floor.
After intensive suctioning and chest physical therapy the patient could tolerate even 1 liter transtracheal O2 with an oxygen saturation on 100%  Subacute decline necessitated reintubation [**2131-1-21**], and eventually patient underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy placement to facilitate ventilation and allow adequate suctioning.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had no signs of pulmonary edema on chest film.
There was no increase in lower extremity edema or rales or JVD on admission.
However, over time it was felt that she was gaining weight above her baseline of approximately 112 to 114 pounds and should be diuresed especially given the development of crackles in the right lower lung base.
Infectious disease:  The patient was given Ceftazidime and Levo empirically for coverage of gram negative, Pseudomonas and pulmonary gram positive and atypical pathogens.
She completed a fourteen day course, but appeared to have some increasing patchiness in her right lower lobe on chest film of [**2131-1-18**] and was restarted on Levo and Ceptaz after a fourteen day course had just completed.
In addition her sputum grew out Stenotrophomonas from the culture and was sensitive to Bactrim.
However, she has a sulfa allergy and a repeat culture was sent to determine the sensitivity as the initial plate had been discarded by the laboratory.
On [**1-21**] she remained afebrile with temperature of 98.6.
However, there were no witnesses of this episode of severe aspiration.
FEN:  The patient was initially thought not to be fluid overloaded, but over time it was noticed that her weight was increased and a goal was established to diurese her back to approximately her normal outpatient weight of 114 pounds.
She was seen by psychiatry consult who found her to be in acute delirium and having both passive and active suicidal ideation with plan to drown herself in the bathtub at times.
