She was discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-14**] following a prolonged hospitalization with respiratory failure and left pneumonectomy.
Her course at [**Hospital1 5593**] was complicated by pneumonia (for which she was treated with Levaquin), left lower extremity DVT (for which she is Coumadin), C. difficile colitis and altered mental status (thought secondary to cerebral hypoxia during her long surgery), prerenal azotemia, and most recently hypotension.
However, given persistent hypotension and multiple medical problems she was transferred back to [**Hospital3 **] MICU for further management.
A chest x-ray was notable for a right upper lobe infiltrate and right pleural effusion.
She was also noted to have increased secretion.
No fevers reported.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Tobacco abuse (100-pack-year), stage III lung cancer diagnosed in the Fall of [**2148**], status post left pneumonectomy complicated by respiratory failure and tracheostomy placement, status post chemotherapy and XRT, status post J-tube insertion, thrombocytopenia with possible HIT, hypothyroidism, DVT of left upper extremity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, CHF, pleural effusions, C. difficile colitis, pneumonia.
Lungs with decreased left breath sounds.
Scattered rhonchi and exploratory wheeze, predominantly on the right.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities with 2+ lower extremity edema and 2+ left upper extremity edema.
Right upper lobe and right lower lobe alveolar opacification.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Throughout course the patient    remained dependent on ventilator despite treatment with    antibiotics and diuresis of pleural effusions.
INFECTION: Treated for nosocomial pneumonia with broad    spectrum coverage.
Remained afebrile for most of stay.
MIXED ACID BASE DISORDER: With respiratory acidosis and    concomitant metabolic alkalosis either due to compensation    contraction alkalosis and benign prerenal azotemia    secondary to hypovolemia.
MEDULLARY BLEED: On [**2150-5-31**] the patient was noted to    have asymmetric pupils and decreased responsive.
A STAT    head CT revealed medullary bleed with cervical cord and    possible pontine involvement.
She was given Decadron for possible edema    and appropriate blood pressure control.
The family was    made aware, and after an extensive family meetings it was    decided to make the patient CMO.
