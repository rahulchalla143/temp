Pt was in her USOH until this past Tuesday ([**10-22**]) evening when she reports voluminous grossly bright red diarrhea and associated dizziness, lightheadedness and fatigue.
Her diarrhea resolved by Wednesday morning although she continued to feel fatigued throughout the day.
This morning she awoke feeling relatively well and received scheduled HD where routine lab tests revealed h/h drop.
During this last admission she was also started on 2 week course of fluconazole to cover any possible [**Female First Name (un) **] infection from HD catheter site.
Following the most recent hospitalization she had cough, phlegm and shortness of breath which have since resolved.

However, there is a newly appeared left-sided pleural effusion of moderate extent.
The effusion is not associated with a substantial elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
However, atelectasis at the left lung base has developed.
Small left pleural effusion with coursing along the parietal pleura.
Multiple areas of bronchiectasis, particularly in the right upper and left lower lobes, suggesting chronic infection.
Trachea changes consistent with tracheomalacia.
Coronary artery disease   Brief Hospital Course: 42F w/ ESRD on PD and CHF referred from hemodialysis for asymptomatic H/H drop.
#Anemia/GI bleed: Acute anemia (drop of 9.0/28.9 to 7.2/24.4) most likely secondary to lower GI bleed given guaiac positive stools and history of bright red diarrhea 2 days prior to admission, however no evidence of active bleeding.
Pt does not have h/o hemorrhoids/fissues (not noted on ED rectal exam), diverticuli or AVM.
No symptoms of GI bleed prior to transfer to the medicine floor.
However, by the time that was resolved, the patient had no peripheral IV access (which she would have needed for anesthesia during scope) and had had a stable HCT for several days.
Pt c/o severe chronic generalized itching [**3-7**] ESRD w/ associated scratching and excoriations for which she takes benadryl at home.
There was a concern of infection of the dialysis line, cultures growing [**Female First Name (un) **].
Renal felt that it is likely a superficial site infection rather than a tunneled infection so they will hold of on pulling the line while patient was in the ICU.
After speaking with renal/ID, all agreed that the left HD tunneled catheter line should be removed due to the fungal infection.
She completed the fluconazole course and showed no other signs or symptoms of line infection.
This was a concern given need of volume resuscitation in setting of anemia/GI bleed while in the ICU.
With ESRD and HD-dependent, the patient was cautiously volume resuscitated.
#h/o HCAP: Recent admission [**Date range (1) 17940**] w/ HCAP and CXR notable for right upper and possibly right lower lobe pneumonia.
No signs of active infection in ICU: afebrile, w/o cough, SOB, O2 requirement, leukocytosis (currently WBC 10 from 19 on recent HCAP admission).
CT chest was obtained for better evaluation, which showed a small left pelural effusion (could not rule out empyema).
We held off on tapping the pleural effusion in light of normal VS, afebrile, and no leukocytosis.
Effusion could also have been due to CHF.
#h/o Staph Epidermidis Bacteremia from prior hospitalization: Her last positive blood culture was [**10-6**] which subsequent blood culture on [**10-9**] showing no growth.
The patient did become febrile to 102 and was started on vanc and cefepime, but these were stopped when cultures from this hospitalization were all negative.
#CAD: h/o NSTEMI in [**2111**], takes ASA 81mg QD at home.
Continued ASA but held carvedilol given GI bleed while patient was in the ICU.
#Hypertension: Held carvedilol in setting of acute GI bleed/anemia.
Started on protonix ggt on admission for GI bleed then transitioned to PO pantoprazole and to PO omeprazole before she was discharged.
Alternative treatments for pruritis should be considered in the outpatient setting.
- EGD and colonoscopy can be considered in the outpatient setting.
Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Infected HD Catheter Secondary: Diabetes Type 1, Peripheral [**Location (un) **] Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were then transferred to the regular medicine floor, where you were found to have an infected HD catheter.
You were treated for the line infection with anti-fungal medications because we found fungus growing at the site.
You had a fever after the temporary HD line was placed in your groin.
The fever was concerning for a bacterial infection, so we treated you with antibiotics.
Fortunately, your red blood cells were stable, and there was no evidence of active bleeding after you were transfused blood.
