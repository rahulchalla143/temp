Admission Date:  [**2138-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: coronary catherterization  History of Present Illness: 81 y old male with hx of dyslipidemia, HTN, CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**] s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1 presented to ED by ambulance with acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, was found to have STE >5mm in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 along with 3-4mm ST depression in I and aVL.
In cath lab pt had successfull bare metal stenting to proximal RCA and was also found to have new diffuse aneurysmla dilatation of his vessels.
Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the cath lab and required atropine x2.
States onset of chest pain was in the setting of the culmination of a 16 day editing project he had as a composer.
Per pt he was told to stop taking the ASA and never had a GI w/u for the bleeding as he states "it was assumed that the bleeding was due to apirin".
At home pt exercises by "speed-walking" on a treadmill for 30 minutes almost every day and never experiences any anginal sx's or SOB.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, recent black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems when seen on the floor is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**] s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1 # HTN # Dyslipidemia # Hx of ulcers on feet bilaterally # R eye blind after traumatic injury at age 11  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Also with superficila fungal infections of toes and nails.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Echo ([**9-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2130-12-21**], the regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality is new and the ascending aorta and arch are now identified as dilated.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt with presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] as mentioned above, taken to cath; in cath lab pt had successfull bare metal stenting to proximal RCA and was also found to have new diffuse aneurysmal dilatation of his vessels.
Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the cath lab and required atropine x2.
On the second day the pace was briefly needed but then heart rate remained in to 60-s and 70s, therefore the pacer was removed after 48hrs, lopressor was again started after 72 hrs without a drop in the heart rate (bradycardia improved as expected since RCA reperfused) Enzymes were negative in the emergency room, but second set came back VERY elevated at CK 2713, Trop T 11.23, CK-MB 363 and MB index of 13.4.
ACEI was held on presentation due to concern of droing BP with bradycardia but restarted on HOD#2.
An echo was done to r/o wall motion abnormalities determine EF demonstrating mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction, and LVEF = 45-50 % c/w CAD.
Pt was evaluated by PT who found patient fit to go home since pt ambulated for 15 minutes at a fast rate without any CP or SOB.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction (Inferior STEMI)   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The following changes has been made to your medications: - please start taking aspirin 325mg daily for secondary cardiovascular prevention (to prevent another heart attack) and atorvastatin 80mg daily for your heart and for your cholesterol.
- please stop taking isosorbide mononitrate If you develop chest pain, jaw pain, or chest pressure with pain radiating into arm, or if you for any reason become concerned about your medical condition please call 911 or present to nearest ED.
