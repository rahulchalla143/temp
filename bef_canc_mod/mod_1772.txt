Admission Date:  [**2127-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-2-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11892**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC Placement ([**2128-1-6**])   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 60 year old man with no significant PMH who presents with a one-week history of increasing fatigue, cough, and chest pain.
Over the past week, he has felt increasing fatigue and has been unable to perform his work at home.
He states that he has had associated chest pain, which started three days ago and has since resolved.
He described it as a dull, constant, [**4-20**] pain that was located on the right side of his chest and occasionally radiated to his LLSB.
Of note, the patient has had a 20 lb weight loss in the past 3 weeks.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST elevation in V2 and V3.
On the floor, the patient denies current shortness of breath but states that he has been very "run down" recently.
He also states that he has a ventral hernia, which bothered him tremendously this past week whenever he coughed.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T: 98.0, BP: 141/92, P: 117, R: 24, O2: 95% on RA General: Cachectic appearing man, pleasant, in NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear  Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bronchial breath sounds in the RUL with minimal inferior wheezing.
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, ?mottled skin on hands Neuro: oriented x3, CNII-XII intact, no gross sensory or motor deficits, negative pronator drift, gait not assessed .
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No M/R/G appreciated.
Diffuse coarse breath sounds and rhonchi.
No organomegaly detected.
Ext: WWP, no cyanosis or clubbing.
No LE edema.
Skin: No rashes, ecchymoses, or other lesions noted.
Followup radiographs after interval treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
# CT CHEST ([**2127-12-28**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive consolidation, which may be chronic, involving primarily the right upper lobe with smaller ground-glass opacities seen in the left upper lobe and right middle lobe and lymphadenopathy.
The presence of underlying discrete mass is not well evaluated.
Progression of right-sided pneumonia with cavitation in the right upper lobe and progression of consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Heterogenous ground-glass opacity in the right middle and upper lobe and perihilar left lung are suggestive of new pulmonary edema.
New bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions.
New left lower lobe atelectasis.
There has been interval extubation and removal of an orogastric tube.
There still is residual opacification and cavitation from cavitary pneumonia with improvement in the patchy area of opacification in the left perihilar region.
Mild improvement of persistent cavitary pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: ===================================== FLOOR COURSE ([**2127-12-27**] to [**2127-12-29**]) The patient is a 60 yo man with no significant PMH who presents with a 3-week history of cough and fatigue and was found on XRay to have a RUL consolidation concerning for PNA vs. mass, or postobstructive PNA.
# RUL PNA/Respiratory Distress: Mr. [**Known lastname 4020**] presented with a 3-week history of dry cough and 1-week history of fatigue and chills.
On CXR, he was found to have a RUL consolidation, concerning for PNA.
He has a significant smoking history and recent 20 lb weight loss, which is very concerning for an underlying lung malignancy.
On discussion with radiology, it is difficult to assess for a mass, given his large consolidation; however, there are no obvious secondary signs of malignancy at present.
A CT Scan was done out of concern that there was an underlying mass given his significant smoking history, and out of concern that there would be a need to treat for a post-obstructive PNA.
The CT Chest revealed consolidation without obvious mass in the RUL, however unable to r/o mass.
His BP remained normotensive--> elevated during his floor course, and thought was that level of insensible losses was high requiring fluid repletion.
He remained afebrile starting HD2, and his white count normalized on HD2--> to mildly elevated on HD3 (11.3).
The am of HD3, pt noted to have increasing respiratory distress.
Repeat set of vitals at the time showed hypoxia to 60s on 3L, increased to low 90s on 100% NRB mask.
ABG done at time showed severe retention of CO2 and acidosis.
TSH/Free T4 sent given h/o weight loss as well, however seem to be WNL.
Notably, HR would decrease to 90s with some fluid boluses.
Chest pain: The patient states that he had chest pain for the past 3 days, but it is now resolved.
His characterization for the pain is very atypical for ACS and more likely is secondary to underlying PNA.
CE negative x 2, EKG no ST-T changes.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia: Patient was found to have multifocal consolidations with extensive consolidation of the right upper lobe, which is concerning for an infectious vs. malignant process.
Acute decompensation was thought multifactorial including PNA with superfluous secretions causing mucous plugging.
Significant weight loss is concerning for Tb vs. malignant process.
Sputum cultures revealed gram positive cocci and GNR on gram stain, but nothing has grown out so far.
In setting of long standing smoking history and wheezing on exam, may be element of bronchospasm contributing to respiratory decline.
A sputum culture with cytology showed no malignant cells.
A Chest CT was repeated to look for empyema or other cause of worsening ventilatory status which showed progression of right sided PNA with cavitation in the right upper lobe and progression of consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Also with heterogeneous ground glass opacity in the right middle and upper lobe and perihilar left lung suggestive of new pulmonary edema.
He was diuresed and underwent bronchoscopy on [**1-3**] which showed some purulent sputum which was suctioned and cultures were sent.
He was extubated on [**1-5**] without complications and was weaned down to NC O2 and transferred to floor.
# Seizures: Patient found to be seizing upon arrival to MICU, likely secondary to transient hypoxia.
However, in the setting of alcohol consumption and persistent tachycardia, there was some concern as well for DRs.
Head CT without acute process.
# Tachycardia: Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of aggressive infection.
# Hyponatremia: Improved with IV fluids, consistent with hypovolemic picture.
# LUE edema and erythema: Patient was noted to have erythema and edema worse on the left upper extremity around the wrist than on the right.
Upper extremity u/s revealed superficial thrombophlebitis involving the left cephalic vein with no deep venous thrombosis present so his PIV was pulled and heat packs/elevation were started.
Comm:  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 96454**] [**Name (NI) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96455**])-> main contact, no assigned HCP.
# Pneumonia: Multilobar PNA with cavitation s/p 10 days of Vanc/Levo/Zosyn.
He remained afebrile with stable WBC count after returning to the floor.
# HTN: He was initially hypertensive but his BP was better controlled after starting HCTZ.
