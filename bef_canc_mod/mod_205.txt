He has had no significant complications of dialysis, although he does note that he feels fatigued for several hours after the treatments.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation-recently diagnosed, noted to be back in sinus on discharge (DCed on [**11-7**]) Acute on CRF - chronic proteinuria, baseline Cr 1.6-2.0 until last week when Cr acutely increased: at that time +rbc casts on sediment, renal ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis, Fe-urea = 33.53 <35% c/w pre-renal, ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, C3 wnl, C4 wnl, SPEP with IgG 474, other IgG's wnl, UPEP: multiple protein bands seen, no monoclonal bands, renal consulted and felt most confident this reflected progression of Wegener's CAD - multiple stent, most recent stent in [**10-21**] Chronic angina Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Wegener's granulomatosis (renal/pulmonary involvement) diagnosed [**2143**] s/p cytoxan/prednisone x 1y initially, ANCA neg.

There is significant chronic donor vascular disease particularly in larger arteries.
The medullary changes are insufficient for a definite diagnosis of acute cellular rejection.
There was a large hernia defect just above the umbilicus that was included in the incision.
Dressing over incision required frequent changes due to bloody dressings.
An abdominal CT done on POD 3 showed no evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
No CT finding to explain abdominal pain on this limited non-contrast evaluation.
On POD 4 his creatinine was noted to be rising (highest value on POD 6 of 5.5) Transplant U/S showed minimal simple-appearing perinephric fluid collection, with otherwise normal transplant ultrasound with appropriate arterial and venous waveforms and resistive indices.
Patient was still continuing with distention and abdominal pain.
KUB on POD 5 showed persistent air distention of the cecum and transverse colon with less distention of the distal colon and sigmoid compared to a day prior.
This was concerning for Ogilvies Syndrome.
Biopsy also performed on [**5-20**] for the rising creatinine, it was determined that the kidney disfunction was a result of donor problems and was not rejection or TMA.
Abdominal incision was opened in two areas which will rewuire dressing changes upon discharge.
