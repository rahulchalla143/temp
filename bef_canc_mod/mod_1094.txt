He developed left sided chest pain around 2pm and it occurred intermittently throughout the day.
Each episode lasted a few minutes at a time.
The pain is described as a "pressure" that is relieved with rest and worsens with exertion.
The pain did not radiate and he denies SOB, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, nausea, palpitation, pleurisy.
He denied pleuritic chest pain, LE edema or pain.
he is comfortable and reports his chest pain is much improved.
Past Medical History: - h/o papillary urothelial carcinoma, low grade, s/p transurethral resection of bladder tumor [**1-/2126**] c/b clot formation requiring clot evacuation and fulguration & s/p BCG treatment in [**2125**] - h/o GIB, likely lower with negative EGD result (superficial antrum erosion) [**7-/2127**] - prolapsed internal and external hemorhoids - h/o colon polyps, last colonoscopy [**2132-11-29**] - diverticulosis - headache - h/o PNA - gout  Social History: Retired, used to work at [**Company 22916**] in sales.
Family History: No history of early MI, diabetes.
- colon cancer - brother with ?
liver cancer - father died at 88, mother died at 94  Physical Exam: VS - T- 97.0, HR- 63, BP- 134/78, RR- 20, SaO2- 100% on RA GENERAL - Alert, interactive, well-appearing in NAD HEENT - EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - Supple, no JVD HEART - RRR, nl S1-S2, no MRG LUNGS - CTAB, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, no focal deficits, gait deferred.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-2-8**] no change.
The heart size is normal, and there is no appreciable pleural abnormality.
There is no interstitial pulmonary abnormality.
Bronchial and parenchymal changes in the left lower lobe accompanying small hiatus hernia and areas of esophageal distention suggest aspiration, and raise question of esophageal motility abnormality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There were no significant ST segment changes throughout the study (normalization noted in lead V2 during exercise).
The rhythm was sinus with rare, isolated apbs and vpbs throughout the study.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes to achieved worload.
INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is mildly enlarged.
Attenuation corrected resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Mild left ventricular enlargement.
Normal LVEF = 52%  Brief Hospital Course: 74yoM with h/o papillary urothelial carcinoma admitted on [**2132-2-9**] from [**Hospital1 **]-N for acute onset CP (trop peaked at 0.16, no ischemic EKG changes) who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for fevers /hypotension and was found to have Pseudomonal sepsis.
# Pseudomonal sepsis: Overnight on HD 2 the patient developed high fevers and became persistently hypotensive.
He was transferred to the ICU where cultures were sent but patient had no obvious source of infection based on exam.
Chest imaging suggested possible aspiration pneumonia, but urine culture from [**2-11**] was negative and u/a from [**1-/2049**] was negative.
He was initially given a dose of Vanc and Zosyn on the floors, which was switched in the ICU to ceftriaxone and Azithromcin to cover for possible lung sources and atypical coverage.
He remained normotensive and was transitioned to Levofloxacin, and was transferred back to the medical floors.
Abdominal source of infection was considered as the patient had a history of  diverticulosis, however, in the absence of associated symptoms or exam findings, further evaluation with imaging was not pursued.
The patient remained afebrile from [**2-11**] and w/o leukocytosis from [**2-12**].
# NSTEMI: Patient presented with anginal symptoms and found to have elevated troponins with normal CK-MB with no significant EKG changes.
Cardiac echo later revealed no wall motion abnormalities.
Exercise stress test with Sestamibi revealed no anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes and normal myocardial perfusion.
Upon further review, in the absence of significant underlying CAD risk factors and presence of bacteremia, the patient's presentation was felt to be more likely representative of demand ischemia.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 20137**],  You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and suspected to be having a heart attack.
You were treated first with medications with plan to get a cardiac catheterization to check for a blocked artery.
Before this could be done, you developed a severe bloodstream infection for which you had to be transferred to the intensive care unit.
Based upon this test, we suspect that you may not have had a heart attack but rather had heart muscle stress in the setting of a bloodstream infection.
