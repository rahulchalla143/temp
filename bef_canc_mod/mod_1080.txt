The hila are again prominent, consistent with known adenopathy.
There is no focal consolidation or edema.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: COPD, no acute changes.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT [**2114-2-21**]: No left lower extremity DVT .
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No color-low Doppler evidence of significant right-to-left shunting at atrial level.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-3**], no definite change seen.
Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of stage IV COPD on 4L home O2, history of paradoxical embolic stroke, factor V Leiden heterozygosity and PFO, diastolic CHF, and dyslipidemia, who presented with chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
#  Chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypoxia [**1-9**] COPD Flare: Patient initially recieved IV solumedrol which was switched to oral prednisone 60 mg daily on Day 2.
Given lack of improvement in his symptoms, a CT chest was ordered and showed no signs of infection.
In the MICU, the BiPAP was initiated without complication.
His IV solumederol was transitioned to prednisone with a slow taper.
#  Chronic Diastolic CHF: His diuretics was initially continued due to evidence of total body volume overload.
His home lasix was held and should be restarted if his weight increases by 3 pounds or more, along with his home potassium.
#  Sinus Tachycardia: Likely [**1-9**] pulmonary etiology, could alternatively be [**1-9**] albuterol and volume depletion, as he was consistently negative in terms of his fluid balance.
He denied chest pain through the course of his admission.
# History of embolic stroke/Factor V Leiden Heterozygosity: Patient was anticoagulated on coumadin with therapeutic INR on admission.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
BiPAP BiPAP 12/6 at 4 Liters of Oxygen to be used while sleeping at night   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: COPD Secondary: Diastolic CHF History of embolic stroke History of PFO Factor V Leiden heterozyogsity Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) Needs 4 to 5 L oxygen at baseline, need to titrate to pulse oxygen of 90-93%.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had low oxygen levels recorded at home.
This was felt to be due to your severe COPD.
