Mr. [**Known lastname 23686**] is a 61 year-old man with PMH notable for right parietal lesion (initially thought to be stroke vs. low grade glioma; has been stable on multiple repeat MRIs with the most recent being [**2130-3-6**]), followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] in [**Hospital **] clinic and seizures (unclear if post-traumatic s/p motorcycle accident or if seizure precipitated the accident; he was previously on AEDs, but this was recently stopped) who was transferred from OSH with IPH and seizure.
Per transfer report, he was having headaches beginning last night.
He was also reportedly complaining of left arm numbness.
He underwent NCHCT which showed right temporoparietal hypodensity, likely edema, with hemorrhagic component.
It is possible a seizure was the inciting reason for the accident, though this is not confirmed.
He has been on AEDs in the past, some of which were stopped due to side effects; keppra resulted in short-temperedness, topiramate in diarrhea and weight loss and phenytoin caused fatigue.
He was most recently on Zonisamide, but this had been stopped earlier this month as he had remained seizure free.
Per family, he has been increasingly fatigued recently.
Also possible weight loss as he has dropped 2 pant sizes; unsure over how much time this occurred.
Unable to elicit patellar or Achilles reflexes.

In the ICU he was hooked up to LTM EEG and he did not have any further seizures.
His CT head from the OSH showed the area of edema around his known lesion with a question of small area of blood.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure secondary to brain lesion - low grade glioma vs stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Cranial nerves intact, normal motor/sensory, gait normal, able to tandem with mild difficulty   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an episode of confusion which evolved into a seizure.
We think this occured because of the lesion in your brain which can cause seizures.
You were recently taken off your seizure medication Zonegran to see if you no longer needed it, as it was not clear if you having seizures.
