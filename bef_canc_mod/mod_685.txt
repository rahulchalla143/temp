Admission Date:  [**2199-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-10-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 293**] Chief Complaint: Seizure activity and hypertensive urgency  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation in ICU Intrajugular vein IV access   History of Present Illness: 83 y.o with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems who initially presented to OSH with N/V and confusion and was given neurontin and ativan for restless legs.
While in EW, she ruled in for MI, R inguinal hematoma following femoral line attempt with subsequent HCT drop from 34 to 28 in ED.
Patient's head CT [**10-9**] showed left occipital density possible c/w infarction but no focal neuro findings; MRI [**10-10**] r/o?????
?d CVA, CT findings thought [**1-14**] hypertensive changes.
LP showed no blood and neg CSF culture.
HTN controlled w/ Lopressor, nifedipine, clonidine, and isosorbide dinitrate ??????
weaned from nitro drip [**10-13**] NSTEMI was felt to be likely [**1-14**] demand ischemia,EKG showed no further ischemic changes.
Pt also had fluctuating sensorium in ICU which appeared resolved at time of transfer to the floor.
Past Medical History: Recent adm ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**6-16**]) for pna, CHF excerb, CRF (baseline Cr 1.4) CHF ([**3-17**] echo BIDN: mild LVH, nl LVEF, 1+ MR) Anemia (Hct range 3/04 ??????
[**8-17**]:  24.0-35.6) CAS s/p MI in 64 with normal dobutamine echo ([**6-16**]) Hypercholesterolemia HTN DM-2 Achalasia Hiatal Hernia Hypothyroidism S/p Right mastectomy for breast CA Colon CA in [**2171**] Depression with psychosis   Social History: lives in [**Location 620**] with husband and is an ex nurse.
At [**Hospital1 42457**], pt was intubated and taken to CT scanner; a R. femoral line attempt was complicated by an inguinal hematoma with subsequent Hct drop.
Pt was transfered to MICU for dropping Hct and continued hypertensive urgency.
Pt was ruled in for NSTEMI by enzymes.
Anemia was corrected with 3U PRBC and Hct stabilized.
Pt was treated with Vanco, Levo, and Ceftriaxone for clinical signs of sepsis and  UTI (positive UA/negative cultures) prior to adm. Pt was transfered to medical floor (FAR7)once stabile on [**10-13**] for monitoring.
remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile, mental status improved to baseline, there was no seizure activity, and pt was discharged to home with services in good condition.
Hypertensive emergency - treated with mutliple agents in MICU, BP improved and remained stable during course on FAR7 and was discharaged on PO medications only.
Seziure activity - EEG showed underlying structural abnormalities, no antiepileptics were given at [**Hospital1 18**] as per neurology recommendations.
NSTEMI - probably secondary to demand ischemia during MICU course.
Pt has remained hemodynamically stable during course on FAR7 with one episode of angina (with no changes in EKG) that pt.
describes as typical of her 20yr pre-adm history.
No signs/sx of CHF during course on FAR7 5.
Anemia - pt experienced acute drop in Hct during MICU course, most likely secondary to R. inguinal hematoma.
L. occipital lobe cerebral ischemia - findings on CT during MICU course ruled out for CVA by MRI scan.
CT findings most likely secondary to hypertensive episode.
Pt was asymptomatic on adm to FAR7 and remained so throughout rest of hospital course.
Ropinirole Hydrochloride 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for restless legs.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for headache.
