Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for having blood in your urine and low blood oxygen levels.
The blood in your urine was likely caused by an infection which was treated with antibiotics.
Your low oxygen levels were caused by heart failure and fluid around your lungs which was seen on chest x-ray and chest CT.  On admission, it seemed possible that you had an infection so you were given IV antibiotics until infection was ruled out.
You had an echocardiogram which showed worsening of your heart function.
------- The following changes were made to your medications: Your lasix dose was increased from 20 mg by mouth daily to 40 mg daily ------- You should seek medical attention at your facility if you experience any of the following symptoms:  increased confusion, fevers, shortness of breath, chest pain, increased swelling in your legs, blood in your urine or burning upon urination, light-headedness to the point of feeling like you may pass out.
If the patient becomes short of breath or drop her oxygen saturation, please give a dose of 40 mg of lasix by mouth and monitor for improvement.
