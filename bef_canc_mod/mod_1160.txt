Subsequently, his posttransplant course was complicated by hepatic artery stenosis resulting in biliary strictures and recurrent cholangitis.
He was maintained on prophylatic doxycycline but has been off antibiotics for the past four months and has been doing very well without evidence of cholangitis.
He was told to come to the ED immediately with any fever or signs of recurrent cholangitis.
Yesterday evening, he had a fever to 101.4 at home.
This was associated with RUQ pain and nausea without vomiting.
He denies CP, SOB, melena, or hematochezia.
This presentation is similar to prior episodes of cholangitis.
He is on rapamycin only given renal failure secondary to calcineurin toxicity.
He has had prior resistant organisms cultured from his bilomas including VRE, e.coli, and b. fragilis.
In addition, he has had prior episodes of bacteremia and has required pressors for BP support in the past.
He denies recent cough, dysuria, or diarrhea.
He denies chills and nausea at home.

Right inferior superficial collection (segment VI) is mildy increased in size.
Right superior collection (segment VII) grossly stable.
Mild increase in peri-hepatic free fluid.
No evidence of intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilitation.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep using a free-hand technique.
Diffuse strictures were seen at the intrahepatic biliary tree.
Small amount amount of sludge/pus was removed by balloon sweep ( 8 mm balloon used).
Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old male with history of EtOH cirrhosis and HCC who is s/p OLT in [**2114**] complicated by biliary strictures, bilomas, and recurrent cholangitis presented to the ED yesterday with fever and RUQ pain likely representing cholangitis.
# Cholangitis:  PT presented with acute increase in RUQ pain, fever, and fluid-responsive hypotension concerning for recurrent cholangitis and/or acute biliary obstruction.
Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods suspicious for previous infective organisms.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine baseline is 1.2; it was elevated on admission to 1.5, now resolved.
Likely acute Creatinine bump was due to poor PO intake and fever with insensible losses prior to admission, with resolution on IVF.
# Hx CAD: Pt had MI with PTCA in [**2099**].
Asymptomatic in ICU.
Continued ASA 325 mg, held beta blocker given hypotensive episode in ED.
Monitored on telemetry, no events.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **],  You came to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were having fever and abdominal pain, which was similar to your previous episodes of cholangitis.
Your blood cultures were positive for bacteria so you were given antibiotics (meropenem).
An [**Hospital1 **] was done to evaluate your biliary tract - it did not show obstruction of your bile duct, but did show signs of infection.
You also had drainage of a fluid collection (biloma) in your liver, and analysis of the fluid showed it was also infected with bacteria.
