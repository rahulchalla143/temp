Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: HPI: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-complaince presents with SOB.
Ate dinner of fried fish around 8pm and took all of her medications (reports no lapses recently).
At 10pm, she went to bed and noted a 'gurgling' sensation in her chest/throat with fluid 'dripping from her mouth' that she has had before with CHF exacerbations.
She awoke 1 hour later with SOB acutely and called 911.
Denies associated CP or nausea, but did feel diaphoretic.
No recent PND or peripheral edema.
ST segment changes in V1,2 thought to be due to J-point elevation.
CXR showed mild congestion consistent with CHF although PNA could not be excluded.
Admitted for CHF, hypertensive urgency.
No nausea, CP, diaphoresis, or other complaints.
ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy in [**2169**] s/p renal transplant [**2173**] with acute on chronic rejection, resumed HD [**1-25**]; per priro renal notes, there may have been a component of non-compliance with immunosupression meds 2.
Malignant HTN complicated by seizures ([**5-26**]) not on anti-epileptics and seizure free since this time; denies h/o CVA 3.
Depression 4.
Rheumatic fever in childhood 5.
Afib (recently diagnosed [**9-28**], not on coumadin) 7. h/o bleeding duodenal ulcer  Social History: Social History: Single, never married British female with no children.

CXR: *prelim* prominent vascular markings with ?slight increase in right base opacity compared to [**2195-8-31**], improved left lung aeration .
Echo ([**3-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-compliance presented with SOB and hypertensive urgency.
# CHF: Diastolic.
Exacerbation likely due to dietary indiscretion.
Severe HTN contributed to exacerbation.
During hemodialysis 3L of fluid taken off with subsequent resolution in respiratory symptoms.
# Hypertensive urgency: History of med noncompliance and HTN emergency complicated by seizures.
Question of ECG changes although appear to be consisent with priors and no other symptoms consistent with angina.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, and she received morphine PRN for pain serial ECGs, and fluid and Na restricted diet with monitoring of both.
# ESRD: Due to IgA nephropathy s/p failed transplant.
# Headache: Likely due to nitro gtt and temporally coincided and worsened with improved control of HTN.
No other neurologic symtpoms.
# Afib: Stroke risk factors include HTN, currently on ASA 325 daily.
Also has h/o bleeding duodenal ulcer.
