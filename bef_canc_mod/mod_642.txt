Initial MRI showed an area of restricted diffusion in the left subcortical parietal region in area supplied by superior division of MCA,  absent left ICA and poor filling of left MCA with collaterals from right ACOM.
Examination after MRI showed NIH stroke scale of 2 with right lower facial droop.
Due to the improvement in his symptoms, small size of stroke, and presence of vertebrobasilar aneurysm, thrombolysis with tPA was not pursued.
No recent of history of surgery or trauma.
Course complicated by respiratory failure.
Unclear what his symptoms were at that time, but no residual deficits.

MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in entire left MCA territory; lesion not yet visible on FLAIR.
Hospital course has been remarkable for difficulty weaning from ventilator due to volume overload, difficulty handling secretions and aspiration pneumonia.
After extubation, he was tachypneic and had several episodes of respiratory distress which responded to IV lasix.
He developed a painful left knee effusion.
Since the patient had been on antibiotics for PNA, it was immpossible to rule out a partially treated septic arthritis.
His knee was re-tapped x2 by rheumatology service; both subsequent taps revealed negatively birefringent crystals c/w gout.
He has been evaluated and treated by PT and OT while in the hospital, his deficits have remained largely static, but he has had some improvement in the last several days in terms of increased speech production and decreasing right neglect.
He was seen by the CHF service while in the hospital for episodes of respiratory distress due to CHF.
