Patient was in her USOH until 2 week PTA when developed sub-sternal chest pressure w/ radiation down both arms while raking leaves.
She rested after onset of pain, and pain resolved after 5 minutes.
Again, pt rested and pain resolved after [**10-29**] minutes, but she was nervous about pain, so presented to [**Hospital 2538**] on [**2102-4-3**].
At that time she was r/o for MI with negative cardiac enzymes and underwent stress ECHO that was negative after going 7 minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, achieving 91% of maximum HR.
She then again had a similar episode of this pain last night, associated w/ N/V x 1, but then was able to fall asleep without sxs.
Pt then reports this evening, developed same type of substernal chest pressure, but more severe.
Patient states she was baking pies when had onset of [**9-24**] sub-sternal chest pressure, + radiation down arms b/l, associated with N/V x 1 and diaphoresis.
Found to have EKG with ST elevations in inferior leads with reciprical ST depressions in aVL, V1-V2.
R sided EKG demonstrated ST elevations in V4, indicating RV involvment.
Also received benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid prior to cardiac cath given hx of dye allergy.
In cath lab, patient found to have lesion in RCA extending into PDA and PL - patient had 1 x stent placed in RCA-to-PDA, jailing the PL, which was then rescued with balloon angioplasty (TIMI 3 flow demonstrated).
Also noted to have 50% LAD lesion after D1, 70% L Cx lesion, 40% proximal RCA lesion.
Also had hypotension with SBP = 90's intra-cath, given fluid boluses for total of 1.8L in cath (2.8L total with 1L fluid bolus in ED).
Post cath pt noted to have small groin hematoma.
Post cath EKG notable for resolution of ST elevations, q waves in leads III and aVF.
Patient had resolution of pain in cath lab.
ROS also negative for orthopnea, PND, LE edema.

EKG on presentation:  ST elevations in leads II, III, aVF with reciprical ST depressions in aVL, V1-V2.
R sided EKG with ST elevation in V4.
Post cath EKG:  Resolution of ST elevation, q waves noted in III, aVF  Pertinent Results: [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   WBC-12.4* RBC-4.75 HGB-14.7 HCT-42.6 MCV-90 MCH-31.0 MCHC-34.5 RDW-15.1 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   NEUTS-50.9 LYMPHS-41.1 MONOS-5.5 EOS-2.2 BASOS-0.4 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   PLT COUNT-279 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   PT-11.6 PTT-19.2* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   GLUCOSE-156* UREA N-24* CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-3.0* CHLORIDE-95* TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-18 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   LD(LDH)-224 CK(CPK)-87 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   cTropnT-0.01 [**2102-4-8**] 09:20PM   CK-MB-NotDone .
CXR ([**4-8**]): Prominence of bilateral vasculature, which may represent early volume overload versus mild CHF.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 50% stenosis after D1.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided pressures (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg, mean PCWP 20mmHg).
There was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  Patient is a 68 yo woman with PMH tobacco use, presents with inferior/posterior STEMI with RV involvement.
Ischemia:  Patient presents with inferior/posterior STEMI with RV involvement.
Course complicated by some hypotension noted in cath lab, responsive to IVF boluses.
Pump:  Patient with EF=65%, no wall motion abnormalities noted on stress ECHO done at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2102-4-4**].
Intra cath hemodynamics consistent with mild fluid overload, with PCWP=20, RA=15, PAP=46/22.
TTE on [**4-10**] with EF 70-75%, no wall montion abnormality, 1+ MR, and borderline PA systolic hypertension.
Given RV involvement, was felt to be high risk for arrythmia.
No signs of nodal block on EKG.
# Hematoma:  Small hematoma noted in groin site post-cath.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Patient on prednisone as outpatient.
