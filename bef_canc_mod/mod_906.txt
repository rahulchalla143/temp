Admission Date: [**2110-11-24**]       Discharge Date:  10//25/[**2110**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis with a question of coronary artery disease who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 9683**] on [**2110-11-20**] with a clotted arteriovenous fistula.
On [**2110-11-24**] the patient had an episode of dyspnea with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.
He subsequently developed chest pain with that arrhythmia and ruled in for troponin-positive myocardial infarction.
His atrial fibrillation was resolved with Beta blocker treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal disease, hypertension, question of remote myocardial infarction as well as new myocardial infarction, obstructive sleep apnea.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for cigar smoke and alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for heart disease or cancer.
Generally he was an elderly thin male in moderate respiratory distress.
Neck was soft and supple with right internal jugular Quinton catheter.
No thyromegaly.
Heart was regular with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
His lungs revealed bibasilar crackles with decreased breathsounds on the right without egophony.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, bilateral lower extremity edema, 1+, left upper extremity fistula site was edematous with palpable thrill.
His carotids revealed no bruits.
His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with ST inversions in 1, 2 and V4 through V6 with left ventricular hypertrophy or stream pattern.
Chest x-ray revealed mildly flattened diaphragms with a question of a right middle lobe density.
Cardiac - The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and developed congestive heart failure from this.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed diffuse left anterior descending disease with 50% stenosis of the circumflex and a total occlusion of the right coronary artery with multiple collaterals.
The patient was started on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation anticoagulation.
He had no further issues with congestive heart failure during his hospitalization once he was rate-controlled with beta blockers, ACE inhibitor and nitroglycerin prn for dyspnea.
Pulmonary - The patient had a question of an aspiration pneumonia with right middle lobe and right upper lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
The patient never had a cough or fever during his hospitalization.
A question of aspiration chemical pneumonitis was raised.
He was sating 90 to 99% on room air without dyspnea throughout his hospitalization.
The patient's tachypnea resolved with hemodialysis subsequent to the relief of his metabolic acidosis.
Renal - The patient does have end stage renal disease.
He was dilated multiple times while at [**Hospital6 1760**], subsequent to the use of his Hickman Port-A-Cath.
The patient initially had a small leak from his Hickman Port-A-Cath so he had to undergo a serial hemodialysis to correct his hyperkalemia.
It was thought the patient tolerated the hemodialysis without difficulty.
Infectious disease - It was noted that the patient had a question of pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary edema on his chest x-ray.
He subsequently underwent a chest computerized tomography scan which revealed bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the left and subsequently underwent thoracentesis which revealed fluid of a transudative nature without any organisms and a negative gram stain.
The patient has remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization and has had multiple blood cultures drawn which all were negative for growth.
His antibiotic of Levaquin and Flagyl were stopped and the patient remained afebrile and without complaints.
The question was raised of a possible vascular infection.
The patient has remained afebrile without positive blood cultures throughout his hospitalization which makes the possibility of endovascular infection unlikely.
The patient was noted to have an increased leukocytosis throughout his hospitalization with an average white blood cell count of 10 to 15 going as high as 30.
It was noted that the patient had persistently elevated white blood cell count throughout his hospitalization with an increase of a high of 30 subsequently to the beginning of Prednisone for pretreatment for his computerized axial tomography scan.
It is possible the patient has an occult infection that has not been detected with serial blood cultures as well as chest computerized tomography scan.
However, it is also possible the patient had a leukemoid reaction secondary to the multiple insults of myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema and several vascular interventions.
She was also on heparin during his one episode of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient had no melena or bright red blood per rectum.
The patient has remained afebrile with negative blood cultures throughout his hospitalization.
The chest x-ray was questionable for a possible pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis with a negative thoracentesis.
The patient is on Coumadin for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
He will need Coumadin anticoagulation for a total of 30 days status post his episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He also had a left forearm arteriovenous fistula placed status post surgery at [**Hospital3 **].
It is recommended the patient follow up with his surgeons at [**Hospital1 **], prior to the use of his arteriovenous fistula.
He had a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1 which established the diagnosis of a new onset diabetes.
Access - The patient had a venogram and arteriovenous fistulogram while hospitalized to elucidate the possibility of future use of his left arteriovenous fistula.
It is recommended that the patient see his vascular surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44747**] at [**Hospital3 **] prior to the use of his arteriovenous fistula.
Status post troponin-positive myocardial infarction 2.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response now in normal sinus rhythm on Coumadin 3.
Diabetes mellitus, new onset 4.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis 6.
Status post right middle lobe pneumonia versus pneumonitis 7.
Hypercalcemia resolved, the patient has a parathyroid hormone level pending at discharge.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44748**] his Nephrologist in hemodialysis on Saturday as well as to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44748**] more closely, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44749**].
RECOMMENDATIONS:  The patient will need full follow up secondary to his new diagnosis of myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular responses.
It is recommended the patient receive a cardiologist as an outpatient for follow up of his myocardial infarction as well as for Amiodarone management.
The patient also needs close follow up secondary to his new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and possible medication and/or diet control.
