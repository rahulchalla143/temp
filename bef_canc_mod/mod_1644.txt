On [**7-15**] of this year, the patient had increased edema of the vocal cords as well as tenderness and edema of the left side of her neck, and was subsequently admitted to the ENT Service at [**Hospital1 1444**].
End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with apparent restrictive picture.
Thyroid cancer, status post thyroidectomy in [**2148**] complicated by left vocal cord paralysis.
"Irregular heart beat."
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, history of ventricular ectopy.
The patient's larynx was found to have swelling over the arytenoid, and there was swelling over the left arytenoid and diffuse erythema as well as general edema throughout both vocal cords.
The neck was found to be soft and nontender.
Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with intermittent rales.
There was some question of possible tracheal deviation in the mediastinum, and the patient was thought to have a very very small pleural effusion on the left.
A bronchoscopy revealed her airway diameter to be approximately 3 mm, which was insufficient for intubation.
Because the patient's neck edema, her Coumadin was briefly discontinued on [**2153-7-15**], and her right arm AV fistula subsequently clotted.
She also was seen by Interventional Radiology who performed a fistulogram which revealed that the patient had some stenosis in the central brachial vein at the site of the surgical patch.
It was felt that this are would not be amenable to PTA because of the recent surgical intervention.
It should be noted that initially the patient was under the care of the ENT Service and in the Intensive Care Unit because of her airway instability.
However, following administration of steroids and antibiotics, her laryngeal and neck edema and tenderness decreased significantly such that she was felt to be stable enough to be transferred to the floor.

End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

On examination, the patient was noted to be watching television and receiving dialysis, in no acute distress.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her neck incision was clean, dry and intact with no increased swelling or erythema.
