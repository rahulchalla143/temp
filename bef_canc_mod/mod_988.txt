Given pts multiple AMA's and noncompliance with HD and medical treatment, pt's outpt HD SW feels that pt has an underlying psychiatric disorder that makes him incompetent to make medical decisions.
Therefore, plan (developed by outpt renal Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] and SW)was to section the pt for HD and psychiatric eval.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No evidence for venous thrombosis in the bilateral iliac vessels or IVC.
Vascular calcifications, greater than expected for a patient of this age, likely reflecting history of diabetes.
Within the limits of non-contrast and delayed phase imaging, no acute pelvic pathology.

[**2176-6-9**] LEFT KNEE, THREE VIEWS There is deformity and increased density in the right tibial plateau consistent with a tibial plateau fracture, with depression.
There is minimal spurring about the patella.
There is an ossific fragment along the medial border of the patella, which appears well corticated, and which could represent a either fracture fragment or heterotopic ossification in the medial retinaculum.
No dislocation is identified.
Dense vascular calcification is noted.

Had return to MICU later in hospital course for more intensive HD treatment secondary to hypoxia and fluid overload.
Patient was having a manic episode and was given Haldol prior to being called out to the floor.
Hypoxia resolved with [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] and patient was placed on fluid restriction of 1L.
Has hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, and so HD was initiated in the ICU.
On [**6-6**], pt had acute hypoxia requiring non-rebreather mask.
Sx resolved with fluid removal.
Hypoxia resolved.
Patient initially denies pain with ambulation or knee joint manipulation.
Had three negative sets of lower-extremity Dopplers and a pelvic CT to rule out DVT.
Patient was on antibiotics at presentation, but this is not consistent with a cellulitis.
Pt later began complaining of more knee than leg pain and xray showed tibial plateau fracture and small patella fracture.
Out pt HD SW concerned re: psychiatric process such as bipolar disorder or similar leading to non-compliance.
Psychiatry evaluated patient and agreed he does not have capacity and the medical team should consider guardianship.
