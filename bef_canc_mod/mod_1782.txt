Hyperdensity in the right parieto-occipital lobe with surrounding edema is again seen and demonstrates evolution of the known intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Overall, the blood products and edema measure 6.5 x 3.7 cm compared to 9.0 x 5.4 cm previously.
There is mild mass effect on the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Evolution of known right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with overall decreased size and mass effect.
Again noted is a large right parietooccipital lobe hemorrhage with a clear acute component and surrounding edema measuring 3.5 x 5.8 cm.
There is mild mass effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and stable 6 mm of right-to-left midline shift.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Again noted is an area of polypoid mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  Stable size and appearance of known right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and stable 6 mm of right-to-left midline shift.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  [**2146-11-26**]: FINDINGS: Again is noted a right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.7 x 1.8 cm compared to prior 3.7 and 1.9 cm.
There is associated peri-hemorrhagic edema, unchanged since the prior study.
There is minimal leftward mass effect without subfalcine herniation.
There is mild mass effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle causing anterior displacement of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] without significant ventricular compression.
There is mild encephalomalacia in the territory of the right parieto-occipital prior infarct which is also partly accounting for the rightward deviation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
A focus of high attenuation at the apex of the lateral cerebral fissure is unchanged since the most remote comparison of [**2145-3-23**] and is likely a parenchymal calcification.
There are no other foci of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
Atelectasis at the base of the left lung is mild.
More substantial atelectasis at the right lung base is slightly more pronounced today.
Vascular stent traverses the superior vena cava.
No pneumothorax.
Small left pleural effusion may be present, but there is none on the right.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are [**Month/Day/Year 3841**] [**Month/Day/Year 39707**] but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension detected.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced.
Again noted is a right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, currently measuring 3.7 x 1.7 cm with evidence of evolution of blood products as evidenced by the diminishing size of the hyperdense central focus.
Also noted is associated perihemorrhagic edema and mild leftward mass effect, not significantly changed from the prior study.
There is stable mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle in addition to encephalomalacia within the territory of the right parietooccipital prior infarct.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
There are stable areas of encephalomalacia within the periventricular white matter, which are unchanged.
No extra-axial collections are identified.
No new loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is noted.
The basilar cisterns are preserved, without evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
IMPRESSION:  Evolution of right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding edema and mass effect on the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
No new foci of hemorrhage identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old woman with extensive past medical history, most significant for paradoxical thromboembolism, recent embolic CVA c/b hemorrhagic conversion presents with bilateral DVT and new PE.
She had mild tachycardia, but no chest pain, and she maintained good oxygen saturation on 2L NC.
On [**2146-12-5**], patient complained of a bilateral frontal headache, similar to that when she had her intracranial hemmorhage.
A repeat head CT showed evolution of the prior ICH, but no increase in size or new hemmorhage.

To be instilled into central catheter port for local dwell.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for high heart rate and were found to have a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in your lungs.
