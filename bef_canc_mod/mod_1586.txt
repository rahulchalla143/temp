No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
No palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm or audible bruits.
Genitourinary - No costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities - No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Musculoskeletal - Tenderness with hip compression bilaterally.
Skin - No rashes, pigmentation changes.
No focal deficits.
Free calcium 1.37.
Urinalysis revealed specific gravity 1.009, trace blood, negative nitrites, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, urobilinogen, leukocytes.
Microbiology:  Urine culture no growth.
IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  Left hip radiograph - no fracture or dislocation detected involving the left hip.
Mild degenerative spurring is present.
AP pelvis - no fracture or dislocation is detected about the pelvis.
There are multiple radiation seeds overlying the prostate as well as surgical sutures and a right lower quadrant ostomy.
Electrocardiogram - sinus bradycardia at a rate of 44 beats per minute, first degree AV block, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, wide QRS complex and peaked T waves, consistent with hyperkalemia.
FEN - Hyperkalemia - In the Emergency Department, the patient was administered Calcium Gluconate, insulin, an ampule of D50, intravenous normal saline with two ampules of Sodium Bicarbonate.
A renal consultation was then called, and a double lumen Quinton catheter was then placed in the patient's right groin in anticipation of hemodialysis to dialyze off the patient's elevated potassium.
The etiology of the patient's hyperkalemia was felt to be multifactorial, including a combination of baseline elevated potassium, noncompliance with outpatient Kayexalate, diet at home, and medication induced with recent prescription of ace inhibitors at the outside hospital.
Other traditional causes of hyperkalemia include advanced renal failure, marked volume depletion and hypoaldosteronism.
The patient's clinical and laboratory examination provided little evidence for either advanced renal failure or marked volume depletion, raising the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology.
With these thoughts in mind, the patient subsequently had an aldosterone level drawn, and he was started empirically on Fludrocortisone, for presumed hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients 50 to 70 years of age with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
In addition, it was noted that the patient may have been on Heparin while at the outside hospital, and that Heparin has been known to have a direct toxic effect on the adrenal zonaglomerulosa cells.
Hypercalcemia - At the time of his admission, the patient's free calcium was noted to be 1.37.
The elevated calcium occurring in the context of hyperkalemia raised the question of multiple myeloma, and the patient subsequently had an SPEP and UPEP sent.
These tests revealed no specific abnormalities, and there was no monoclonal immunoglobulin seen.
Endocrine - The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.
Hypoaldosteronism - As mentioned previously, the patient's presentation with hyperkalemia raised the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology.
Given the patient's history of type IV RTA, it was thought that the patient's hypoaldosteronism might be due to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients in their 50s to 70s with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
Renal - After the patient's one episode of hemodialysis on [**2167-5-12**], the patient's right Quinton catheter was subsequently pulled and he required no further episodes of hemodialysis.
Cardiovascular - Coronary artery disease - From the time of his Emergency Department presentation on [**2167-5-12**], the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, all of which were negative.
Infectious disease - Conjunctivitis - The patient was continued on his Erythromycin strips for bilateral conjunctivitis.
Musculoskeletal - Hip/groin pain - The patient's radiographs at the time of presentation in the Emergency Department provided no evidence of either hip or pelvic fracture or dislocation.
While the patient continued to complain of some right groin pain, this pain was treated to good effect with heat packs and Acetaminophen.
Weakness - While the patient's weakness precipitating his fall on [**2167-5-12**], might have been attributed to his hyperkalemia, the patient was also ruled out for hypothyroidism.
In addition, the patient was seen by physical therapy, who felt that much of his weakness was due to deconditioning.
Following several sessions with the patient, physical therapy felt that the patient was safe to be discharged home with 24 hour supervision.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Peripheral nephropathy.
History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
