HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 71 year old Caucasian male with a history of myocardial infarction in [**2152**], status post catheterization times three, most recent in [**2163-1-31**], showing three vessel disease.
He had noted weakness and chills for approximately two days with heart rate up to 110 one day prior to admission.
He denies light-headedness, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
It should be noted that the patient had mild nausea with stable vital signs.
Coronary artery disease, status post anterolateral myocardial infarction with known three vessel disease in [**2152**], ejection fraction of 20%, apical hypokinesis and ?
Most recent catheterization in [**2163-1-31**], showed 60% left anterior descending lesion, midsegment, 30 to 40% left circumflex lesion, OM1 which was totally occluded, right coronary artery which showed 70% diffuse disease and ejection fraction of 27%.
Benign positional vertigo.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of coronary artery disease, and father died when he was young of unknown disorder.
In general, this is a moderately obese Caucasian male lying in bed in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes are slightly dry, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities - no swelling.
The patient is diaphoretic and clammy, 2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial femoral pulses, no bruits.
Echocardiogram from [**10-30**], showed left atrial enlargement, dyskinetic apex, positive clot, inferolateral and anterior hypokinesis.
There was a mildly sclerotic aortic valve with trace aortic regurgitation.
There was mild to trace tricuspid regurgitation.
Electrocardiogram showed pseudonormalization of T wave inversions in V5 and V6.
There is mild J point elevation in leads V1 to V6 which are the same as previous.
Syncope - The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three consecutive negative CKs.
His presentation was very unlikely to be secondary to arrhythmia and more likely to be secondary to vasovagal etiologies.
The patient was diaphoretic with slightly decreased blood pressure with nausea and feeling of fatigue and fever.
He likely had viral illness.
The patient was at risk for ventricular tachycardia secondary to history of three vessel disease and ejection fraction less than 30%.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on Aspirin, Lipitor, Atenolol, Vasotec and Procardia.
Norvasc was considered but the patient has known allergic reaction.
Hematology - The patient had history of left ventricular thrombus on Coumadin.
Echocardiogram was repeated on [**2164-5-17**], showing the following:  mildly dilated left atrium.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic function.
Resting wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle and dyskinesis of the true apex.
The ventricular inflow pattern suggested mild impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion or left ventricular thrombus noted.
