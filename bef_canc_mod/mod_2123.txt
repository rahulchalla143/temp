The patient has done extremely well in respect to severe biventricular failure and meeting his fluid goals.
ATRIAL FLUTTER:  The patient was initially admitted with atrial flutter.
The patient had a TEE which showed no thrombus in atrial appendages.
It was thought that the patient would greatly benefit from being in sinus rhythm considering his severe CHF and his reliance on atrial contraction.
and then changed 200 mg but eventually Amiodarone was stopped as daily EKGs showed severe PR prolongation.
The patient was taken to the EP Laboratory and EPS showed no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was induced with trigger stimulation.
The patient also had atrial flutter ablation at the same time.
The patient is planned to have an implanted biventricular pacemaker or biventricular ICD at a later date after the patient is weaned off the tracheostomy.
The patient self-extubated himself and suffered a hypercarbic respiratory arrest with PC02 in the high 70s.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  We attempted oral feeding but the patient was shown to have significant aspiration by dye test.
The patient does have anemia which appears to be hemolytic by decreased haptoglobin and increased total bilirubin.
However, this can be explained by the presence of large retroperitoneal hematoma with intrahematoma hemolysis.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  Recommend to continue Allopurinol and colchicine for gout as shown by the presence of uric acid crystals from elbow aspirate.
During this admission, the patient did have hypernatremia with sodium up to 152.
This was attributed to heavy diuresis with his free water deficit which was replaced with D5W 75 cc an hour as well as free water boluses per NG.
Biventricular severe congestive heart failure.
Status post atrial flutter ablation.
