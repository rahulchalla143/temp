[**2115-9-17**] Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: 68 year old gentleman with past medical history of AVR, MVR and septomyomectomy in [**2112**] who now has atrial fibrillation/flutter which is extremely symptomatic and has been very difficult to control.
He underwent 2 cardoversions in [**Month (only) 956**] and feels quite well when in normal sinus rhythm however reverts back to atrial tachycardia after a few days.

Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
It is difficult to evaluate the left ventricle due to reverberation artifact from the mechanical mitral valve and suboptimal transgastric views but function appears to be within normal limits.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A small pouch (at most several millimeters deep) remains without evidence of flow on color Doppler.
The mechanical mitral and aortic valves continue to appear normal without regurgitation.
