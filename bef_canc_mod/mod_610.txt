Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Patent umbilical vein suggestive of underlying portal hypertension.
No ascites or biliary ductal dilatation.
No evidence of vascular occlusive disease.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Diffuse cerebral brain atrophy.
These findings are suggestive of chronic sinusitis with a mucocele.
Hyperdense material within the left maxillary sinus could represent inspissated secretions, blood, or perhaps be due to fungal infection.
No masses or areas of abnormal enhancement identified.
11 mm left submandibular lymph node, likely reactive in nature.
Other scattered subcentimeter cervical lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Focal airspace opacity within the superior segment of left lower lobe, which could represent an area of atelectasis or inflammation.
Two, 2 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules in the right middle and right lower lobes.
EGD: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Blood in the stomach body Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenal bulb and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Esophageal Varices - Secondary to cirrhosis - nadolol - alcohol cessation - Grade 1 on EGD - will need outpatient hep a/b vaccination and serologies negative - outpatient Bx  2.
ID - Pt had likely aspiration pneumonia along with sinusitis - treated with augmentin with resolution  4. conjuncitvitis - Patient had purulent drainage out of right eye.
Thrombocytopenia - unclear duration - Likely secondary to direct toxic effects of EtOH on bone marrow and nutrition - resolving in hospital  6.
Coagulopathy - underlying liver disease along with likely scurvy - Vitamin C 1000 qd  7.
Anemia - Hct 36 from 44 earlier last month.
Likely secondary to active bleeding exacerbated by chronic direct BM toxicity, possible splenic congestion with hemolysis, and hemodilution from fluids on arrival - Now 39   Discharge Medications: 1.
