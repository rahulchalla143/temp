Following extubation, there remains small-to- moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
[**2182-3-23**]: MRI head - Slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe with subtle enhancement, these findings would indicate subacute infarct.
Diffuse increased signal in the sulci and fluid-fluid levels in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles are indicative of proteinaceous material within the CSF spaces and correlation with lumbar puncture is recommended to exclude infection.
Diffuse soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells.
There is slight deformity of the spinal cord seen, which could be secondary to focal adhesions, which is more pronounced since the previous study.
Subtle increased signal suspected within the spinal cord at C7 level could be due to myelomalacia, but could not be confirmed on the axial images.
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis is seen.
TTE [**3-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.

An 8 to 9 mm hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the proximal pancreatic body is indeterminate but may represent a small cystic area.
Several subcentimeter renal cortical hypodensities are too small to characterize but likely small cysts.
[**2182-3-4**]: CT Cspine There is left lateral fusion at C6-C7 via pedicle screws and a spinal rod.
There are no signs for acute fractures.
No immediate complications were encountered.
Comparison with the prior study reveals persistent extensive posterior fluid within both the interspinous and paraspinous soft tissues.
There is persistent, moderately longitudinally extensive epidural enhancement spanning the area of the laminectomy, with a mild degree of associated compression of the spinal cord along its dorsal surface.
Similarly, it is not possible to tell whether the extensive paraspinous and interspinous fluid is either sterile or infected, either.
There may be a slight quantity of prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this time.
There is no sign of abnormal T2 signal either within the vertebral bodies or intervertebral disc spaces to suggest osteomyelitis or discitis, respectively.
The findings could represent the effects of known meningeal infection and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Evaluate for worsening pulmonary process.
There is still evidence of consolidation with air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonia in the left lower lobe .
Patchy airspace opacity is also again seen in the dependent portion of right lower lung, slightly decreased from prior study, again possibly representing a small infectious source or atelectasis.
Again seen are multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes that do not appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement, unchanged from prior study.
Coronary artery calcification appears unchanged.
There has been mild decrease in the previously seen pleural effusions.
Small amount of fluid again seen surrounding the spleen.
Hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver appears unchanged.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size of left lower lobe consolidation.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis with oral but without IV contrast.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Persisting left lower lobe consolidation with small stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Within the left lower lobe consolidation, there is a linear hyperdensity, which was present on multiple prior CTs but appears more prominent on the current study.
This may represent a calcified granuloma with adjacent streak artifact though, it is difficult to further characterize.
Coronary artery calcification.
Ill- defined hypodense lesions in the right lobe of the liver and kidneys are not well characterized on this non-contrast study.
Diffuse pancreatic parenchymal calcifications likely the sequela of chronic pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pt is a 70yM with h/o CAD status post fall on [**2182-1-2**] with R C7 fx s/p ORIF and laminectomy with fusion on [**2182-1-23**] admitted to the SICU on [**2-8**] with sepsis.
His post op course was c/b ARF (which resolved w/ IVF and holding ACEI), UTI tx with cipro.
He was discharged on [**1-30**] and did well until [**2-8**] when he developed [**9-24**] posterior neck pain with N/V.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 8**] ED where he was found to have C spine MRI which revealed a posterior fluid collection from C2 to T1 without evidence of epidural abscess, intraspinal fluid collection or cord compression.
LP done [**2-10**] consistent with bacterial meningitis complicating the wound infection and CSF leak.
The pt developed confusion on [**2182-2-16**].
MRI/A of the brain showed new signal in occipital horns, infection vs. SAH, and MRI Cspine showed persistent, extensive fluid collection in the intra/paraspinous soft tissues, persistent epidural enhancement, mild sc compression along the posterior surface.
LP was attempted [**2-18**] --unsuccessful, so LP under fluoro was performed [**2182-2-19**] as well as drainage of C spine fluid collection.
On [**2-22**] the pt went to OR for repair of CSF leak and I&D of cervical wound.
ID agreed to treat for six weeks from most recent attempt at repair of CSF leak (ie through [**4-6**]) with vanco/rifampin and ID signed off [**2-28**].
The pt started tube feeds with [**Last Name (un) 616**] following for strict glucose control.
Incision healing well without pus/drainage.
The pt continued to spike low grade temps.
Pt pulled out PICC and it repeat PICC was deffered in setting of low grade temps.
He was noted to have a pulm embolism and was started on heparin gtt and transferred to medicine floor team for further management.
AM of [**3-15**] patient had tachypnea, fevers, tachycardia and altered mental status and was transferred to the MICU.
**** Respiratory **** # Respiratory Failure: Upon transfer to MICU, pt found tachypneic to 40's w/ ?altered mental status on shovel mask.
Initial ABG 7.43/39/85 and pt CXR not revealing for new infiltrate.
Brief trial of BiPAP halted when follow-up gas revealed profound acidosis with large component of hyercarbia.
Intubated for management of hyercarbia thought related to meds (narcotics prior to BiPAP and ?resp fatigue).
Although initially improved with intubation, pt became increasingly difficult to ventilate and developed profound metaboic lactic acidosis.
Although initially did not tolerate  AC/PSV, pt has shown mild improvements in ventilation w/ increased sedation.
Given high minute ventilation, attempts to correct metabolic acidosis included sodium bicarbonate.
In addition to metabolic acidosis, pt had possible evidence of LLL PNA and was growing Staph in sputum.
He also has history of RUL PE and u/s on [**3-17**] did demonstrate evidence of a thrombus on right superficial vein.
He had a transient episode of hypoxia/tachycarida/hypotension on [**3-21**] which may have been caused by recurrent PEs.
He was started on CVVH and then HD when his BP stabilized for fluid removal.
He was noted to have fevers and increased LLL consolidation and meropenam was added [**4-6**] Patient completed 14 days of meropenem.
Lates Ct Scan chest showed sligly decrease of left lower lobe consolidation.
#  PE - Maintained on heparin gtt.
#  Oropharynx bleeding - Patient had poor mouth care in setting of oral care he was noted to have bleeding from the oropharynx during .
ENT was called to evaluate the patient and just prior to ENT eval patient had an episode of desaturation.
**** Cardiovascular **** # Hypotension/Hypertension: Although initially normotensive in the micu following intubation patient developed hypotension requiring max doses of Levophed as well as vasopressin.
The etiolgy of hypotension not entirely clear but thought most likely secondary to sepsis vs drug hypersensitivity.
# Atrial fibrillation: Noted to have transient episode of afib on [**3-15**] and [**3-16**].
TTE did not show evidence of focal WMA.
New global HK thought to be secondary to cardiac depression from sepsis.
Suspect component of demand ischemia w/ decreased clearance of enzymes in setting of renal insufficiency.
This was transient and thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone from the ultrasound probe.
**** ID **** # Fever:  Patient was febrile in the ICU and had a leukocytosis to 25K w/ profound bandemia and eosinophilia and has mixed venous sats in 80's.
Aggressive search for a source of infection was unrevealing which included RUQ US, repeat LP, MRI/CT of C-spine, MRI head, and multiple blood, urine and stool cultures.
Sputum cultures have grown MRSA, but given no definite infiltrate and scant sputum, it was thought more likely to be a colonizer.
Rifampin was discontined given concerns about generalized erythrodermic rash, peripheral eosinohilia and urine eosinophilia concerning for a drug hypersensitivity reaction.
After transfer to the floor he was continued on linezolid and remained afebrile for several days and then spiked again on [**4-3**].
After culturing over the next two days and repeat LP without meningitis meropenam was added on [**4-6**] for nosocomial PNA.
Blood cx on [**2182-4-15**] showed [**Female First Name (un) **], patient was started on Caspo and then switch to voriconazol given elevated Alk phoph and LDH.
Ofthalmology was consulted and there was no evidence of eye involvement.
CT abdomen no liver or spleen abnormalities.
TTE no evidence of endocarditis.
**** Neuro **** # Altered mental status: Pt noted with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 2364**] ms on floor that was presumed secondary to increased fevers, metabolic stress.
Repeat LP did not show evidence of continued meningitis.
Head CT did not show evidence of acute hemorrhage.
MRI head showed evidence of a small subacute left occipital infarct.
Neurology was consulted and did not think that it was the cause of his mental status changes.
His mental status has wax and wainin thought to be multifactorial.
MRI was attempted 4 times and it was unable to be performed due to cooperation.
Last Ct did not reveal any gross abnormality but was limited [**1-17**] motion adn lac of contrast.
Patient has been afebrile and last CSF sample was clean.
# Weakness: Pt having weakness that is more proximal than distal, R>L.
DDx included ICU myopathy or steroid myopathy.
His impression was that the C7 lesion near the hardware was not worse then before and this would not explain his neuro exam.
When patient is off sedation and clinical "stable" his deficts are slightly improved  which is hopeful that aggressive PT/OT and resolution of his myriad of medical problems will confirm a better neurologic prognosis.
# L occiptial infarct:  On repeat MRI of head, L occiptial lesion had persistent T2 hyperintensity and there was concern for abscess.
***MRSA Meningitis with cervical stablizing hardware: Cont Linezolid (start [**3-26**] to be continued until ID appt [**4-30**], switched to PO [**4-6**]) Day 58-  switched  to suprresion therapy on [**2182-4-23**] with doxicicline.
Pt has had progression of renal dysfunction during MICU and became anuric.
Etiology thought to represent sequalae of septic shock and interstitial nephritis given urine eos.
Urine lytes did initially show pre-renal physiology.
Renal u/s negative for obstructive physiology.
Pt does have severe metabolic acidosis but o/w not significant hyperkalemia.
Also started on Calcium Carbonate/Renagel for phos binders.
Hyperkalemia: Receieved Kayexalate on [**2182-4-22**] with K+ 5.5-->5.1-->5.0 No EKG changes.
K slightly elevated in last morning labs, 5.5, no EKG changes, kayexalate was given.
**** GI **** Has a history of Hep C, and now on anti fungal therapy.
elevated alk phoph--Patient with elevated alk phosph but currently trendings down.
**** Derm **** # Rash: Pt noted to have blanching macular morbilliform rash on initial transfer to MICU.
His rash on BUE progressed to blistering lesions which were thought to be due to edema from fuid overload.
He was started on Bactroban ointment for these lesions.
Iron studies with likely anemia of chronic disease.
More likely secondary to his heparin therapy.
Explained to family that exact etiology of his waxing & [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status, R US and bilateral LE weakness has not been fully elicited.
We still do not know the full etiology of his neurogic compromise (SC infectious involvement, stroke, or ICU myopathy) his mental status is hard to determine to what functional level he will return to given the multitude of metabolic encephalopathic insults (MRSA/[**Female First Name (un) 1441**] infections, Cerebritis, Sepsis, Renal failure, ?
He will also continue on Heparin for his PE as his HCT is stable and his repeat CT of his RP bleed is stable.
We now have a window for him to pursue aggressive PT/[**Hospital **] rehab in hopes that we will see the potential of his neurologic recovery.
We did discuss that if he were to become reinfected, or succumb to yet another complication, it would make his chance of any recovery very guarded and that future goals of care would be broached at that time.
