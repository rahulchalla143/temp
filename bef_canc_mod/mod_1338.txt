Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic.
Diffuse T wave changes which are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-11-19**] no significant diagnostic change.
CXR [**2135-4-15**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Small amount of fluid between liver and right kidney and spleen and left kidney.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2135-4-18**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 44 year old female with history of DM1, CKD, HTN who now presents with lower extremity edema and was found to have significantly worsened renal function requiring initiation of HD.
Patient initially admitted to the medical ICU given hypertension on admission and was then transferred to floor medical service.
End Stage Renal Disease: On admission Cr noted to be 9.8 up from 3 ([**5-23**]).
Thi was felt to be advanced chronic kidney disease rather than due to an acute process.
HTN: In the emergency department patient found to be hypertensive with SBPs to the 200's.
Patient had no further episodes of hypertension during this hospital course.
# Volume overload: Prior to admission patient noticed increasing lower extremity edema.
On admission she did not have any evidence of pulmonary edema or elevated jugular venous pressure.
Lower extremity edema improved slightly with intravenous lasix and patient felt more comfortable ambulating prior to discharge.
Notably, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild LVH, severe pulm HTN and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
# Pulmonary Hypertension: ECHO demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension.
There were no studies for comparison.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] the patient does not have significant left heart disease would suggest further work-up such as PFTs and polysomnography.
This was felt to be secondary to chronic kidney disease.
Disp:*45 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: End Stage Renal Disease, Hypertension Secondary: Type I Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you noticed increased swelling in your legs.
We determined that you had significantly worsened kidney disease which was likely contributing to the fluid in your legs.
If you experience lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptom please contact your primary care physician or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
Diabetologist: You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] on [**2135-4-26**] at 9:00am at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
