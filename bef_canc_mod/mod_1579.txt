He was found to have an equivocal UA and was discharged back to the nursing home for 14 day course of Bactrim.
Foley was placed and hematuria cleared with irrigation with hct remaining stable with coumadin held.
Cystoscopy was performed this am which revealed and enlarged hyperemic prostate with hemorrhagic bladder mucosa but no tumor.
CXR on admission also revealed known chronic left sided effusion which was aspirated and found to be an exudate(serum) with glucose 282(321) LDH 110(152) and protein 3.4(6.3).
Bactrim was discontinued due to negative urine culture.
Due to no available dialysis at [**Location (un) 620**] and possible definitive treatment for his chronic pleural effusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Large left pleural effusion with lingular and left lower lobe collapse.
Mild-to-moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
[**2172-4-26**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis.
[**2172-4-28**]: The overall volume of the moderate left hydropneumothorax is unchanged since [**4-25**] following surgical procedure, but the fluid component has increased.
Lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
Widespread interstitial abnormality in the right lung is unchanged.
Azygos distention indicates elevated central venous pressure.
No right pneumothorax.
No evidence of obstruction.
Slightly thickened bladder wall.
Unchanged moderate left hydropneumothorax and left lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
[**2172-5-2**] MRI: IMPRESSION: No significant change since the previous study.
Moderate ventriculomegaly indicating predominant central atrophy is again seen.
Mild- to-moderate changes of small vessel disease noted.
No acute infarct.
[**2172-5-6**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate left hydropneumothorax.
[**2172-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Almost complete resolution of pneumothorax.
initially came into hosptial w/ chronic pleural effusions that were followed by IP (see below).
w/ multiple episodes of tachypnea and difficulty breathing w/ increased work of breathing.
noted to be unresponsive w/ ?
of seizure activity, fever and hypotension.
At that time, concern for respiratory process and ABG was performed 7.11/104/94.
always tired out on PS and had poor NIFs.
had a h/o trach in the past and decision was made to have a trach placed.
## Pleural effusions: Pt has known hemothorax s/p parietal pleura decortication causing poor venous and lymphatic drainage.
Labs of effusion suggest exudate but with his multiple surgeries c/b his uremia there is no clear cause but it does not appear to be empyema.
On [**4-25**], IP performed a paracentesis of L side w/ improved breathing - found that lung ws trapped and no evidence of hydroptx.
This tap did NOT show empyema and effusion may be due to uremic effusion.
w/ no subjective complaints of dyspnea so decision was made by IP not to performa pleuridex as pt.
w/ chronic altered mental status secondary to vascular dementia, but had been oriented on the floor.
also w/ seizure disorder history on dilantin.
Most MS changes noted during dialysis or infections.
was noted to be unresponsive and had twitching of his face.
EEG showed seizure activity, but this stopped the next day.
w/ no acute changes on CT/MRI.
came w/ fever of unknown source -urine originally?
Suspect urinary source given recent cysto, and growth of enterococcus and proteus (in blood [**2172-4-24**]) but unclear of source.
had blood ctx on [**4-24**] that showed enterococcus/preotesus bacteremia.
was started on vanco/zosyn and fevers resolved over the next few days.
was found unresponsive on floor w/ hypotension and fever to 102 - [**1-23**] GNR sepsis.
TTE w/ no evidence of endocarditis.
w/ a few episodes of hypotension in MICU which responded to fluids and MAPs usually above 55 during those times.
Due to fluid loss vs. sepsis?
remained afebrile since [**5-3**] and pt.
## ESRD: THERE WAS AN INCORRECT H/O RENAL TRANSPLANT.
HAS NOT HAD A TRANSPLANT.
has ESRD [**1-23**] diabetic nephropathy.
has been receiving HD for approximately 1 year for renal failure.
At time of admission renal has recommended treating through bacteremia with dialysis line in place.
## Hypernatremia - Pt.
w/ increased sodium in MICU.
## CAD s/p PCI: Pt.
w/ no CP or SOB during hospital stay.
No active ischemia.
on insulin drip when he appeared to be septic and was transferred to the MICU.
## h/o DVT: Pt's coumadin and anticoagulation was held in setting of hematuria and then in anticipation of procedure.
originally sent for hematuria.
However, cystoscopy showed hyperemic prostate, no bladder tumor and hematuria resolved at [**Hospital1 **].
No evidence of UTI on multiple cultures.
Px- PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen, pain control.
NOTE: 1. patient has NEVER had a transplant (per renal attending) and he has been on HD only x 1 yr. 2.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5 mg IV Injection q 4-6 hrs PRN as needed for agitation.
