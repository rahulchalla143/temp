There is an underlying chronic small vessel ischemic disease with periventricular white matter hypoattenuating changes extending into the corona radiata bilaterally.
No intraparenchymal hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage is identified.
No hydrocephalus is noted, although there is expected mass effect on the left-sided frontal,temporal, and occipital horns.
The globes are intact with no significant soft tissue edema noted.
No underlying bony fractures are present.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within the ethmoid air cells bilaterally, and there is bilateral circumferential mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses.
Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Small polyp is also present within the sphenoid sinus.
CXR [**11-27**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Exam positioning is somewhat limited due to lordotic technique.
Given these limitations, the exam still appears normal without evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, edema, or pleural effusions.
No displaced rib fractures are identified with chronic grade 3 right AC seperation with heterotopic bone formation noted.
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**11-26**]: The degree of lumbar lordosis is somewhat accentuated but there is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
No prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes consisting with anterior and posterior osteophytes as well as disc space narrowing and irregularity is present most marked at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 interspaces.
Anterior well corticated osseous fragments are also likely degenerative in nature.
Visualized lung apices are clear with mild centrilobular emphysematous changes noted.
CT Brain [**11-28**]:  Mild interval increase hyperdense material along the left frontal extra-axial space consistent with likely increased subdural bleeding; small epidural bleeding.
CT Brain [**11-30**]: Mild interval improvement in the amount of pneumocephalus with persistent bilateral low-density extradural collections.
Soft tissue post-surgical changes at the craniotomy site are unchanged.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI [**2141-1-16**]: FINDINGS: This single sequence is compared with the multiplanar post-contrast MR examination obtained the preceding day, which was extremely motion-limited, as well as the more diagnostic study of [**2141-1-6**].
There is persistent thick dural enhancement overlying the left cerebral convexity and along the anterior aspect of the falx, as on that study, likely related to previous left frontoparietotemporal craniotomy.
The enhancing lesions in the right parietal corona radiata and at the superficial left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, demonstrated on the T1-weighted spin echo sequence on [**1-6**] are not seen as such on the present examination; however, at these sites, there are now faint rim-enhancing lesions with low, relatively hypointense centers, with an overall appearance consistent with active demyelinative plaques.
Allowing for the limited nature of this study, no new enhancing lesion is identified.
In the context of the numerous round and ovoid low-signal foci,in a pattern most suggestive of underlying demyelinative disease (consistent with the apparently known diagnosis of multiple sclerosis), these two lesions likely represent foci of more active demyelination.
Relatively uniform frontoparietal dural thickening and enhancement overlying the left cerebral convexity, likely related to previous craniotomy.
CT scan [**2141-1-16**]: FINDINGS: There is a right parietal craniotomy defect with right frontal pneumocephalus and air in the right lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is within the spectrum of post-surgical change.
There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage with minimal left extra-axial fluid collection/meningeal thickening representing the residua of prior subdural hemorrhage that is unchanged since five hours prior.
Extensive bihemispheric white matter hypodensities likely correspond to known multiple sclerosis.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly unremarkable, except to note minimal maxillary sinus thickening.
Findings are within the spectrum of post-surgical change.
No acute cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage.
Extensive bihemispheric white matter hypodensities likely correspond to known multiple sclerosis.
Minimal left extra-axial fluid collection/ meningeal thickening likely represents the residua of prior subdural hemorrhage, unchanged since five hours prior.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a left sided craniotomy for subdural removal.
Post operatively he was extubated, follow up CT scan showed decrease size of subdural and pneumocephlus.
On POD#2 his exam continued to be obtunded with eye opening only to pain and continued weakness on left side though his legs seem to be moving more than the previous day and nursing reported more sponteous movement on right side.
On [**12-3**] Sputum cultures resulted positive as the pt continued to produce copious amounts of thick yellow secretions.
Head CTs followed during hospital stay showed interval improvement.
Evaluated on multiple attempts by speech and swallow and failed trials requiring feeding tube placement.
He was evaluated by psychiatry for possible depression and competency.
During the week of [**12-24**] his diet was advanced to thin liquids and pureed diet on [**12-26**] he had a video swallow and his diet was again advanced to ground solids.
On [**1-5**] there was right orbital redness and erythromycin was started.
His dobhoff was replaced for poor calorie counts.
They recommended an MRI, which showed new brain lesions on [**1-7**].
The steriotactic biopsy was done on [**2141-1-16**] and it indicated that the mass was an MS lesion but the final pathology report is pending at time of discharge.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain/fevers.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
