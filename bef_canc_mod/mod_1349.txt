Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized in CCU for CHF exacerbation between [**2203-10-23**] and [**2203-10-27**].
At baseline, the patient is quite limited by exertional dyspnea and shortness of breath at baseline.
She has 23 steps at home, and is able to get up those stairs but only very slowly.
Her exertional dyspnea is predictable and rapidly resolves with cessation of activities.
She also had a recent admission to [**Hospital 2586**] for a CHF exacerbation in [**Month (only) 956**], at which time she also had a cardiac catherization which per the patient showed patency in 3 of her 4 bypass grafts.
After that admission, she was weaned off of her lasix by [**Month (only) 547**] due to drops in blood pressure- as noted above, this was restarted on last admission.
She had a stress test in [**Month (only) 216**] which showed possible perfusion abnormalities.
She denies fevers, chills or rigors.
No change in bowel habits.
No symptoms of claudication.
No recent weight gain or change in eating habits.
Past Medical History:  Coronary artery disease s/p coronary artery bypass graft in [**2190**], (stress test [**2199-8-12**] @[**Hospital3 **], under Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98231**] shows mild ischemia LV RCA distribution consistent with old finding.)
Carcinoid tumor of right middle lobe s/p resection.
NO Bpap 7. obstructive sleep apnea.
8. restrictive lung disease 9. carpel tunnel syndrome b/l, [**2179**] 10. congestive heart failure (left atrium is mildly dilated.
LVEF 67%/[**2199**]) 11.Anemia of Chronic disease, baseline Hct=30-33.0/Hb=10.
Family History: Mother - diabetes  Physical Exam: Admission Exam: GENERAL: Well appearing woman in NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
3/6 systolic murmur radiating to apex, possible [**2-2**] diastolic murmur.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Mild bilateral edema L>R.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid-septum.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2199**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is a surgical candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.
Longstanding sternal nonunion following prior sternotomy, with fragmentation of multiple sternal closure wires, and well-corticated bony fragments in the sternotomy defect.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving both the native and graft coronary vessels.
No atherosclerotic calcification involving the ascending aorta.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Small hiatal hernia.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Heterogeneous plaque at the ostium of the right internal carotid artery as well as slightly more significantly in the proximal left internal and external carotid arteries.
No significant stenosis noted on the right side.
Suspected 60-69% stenosis involving the proximal left internal carotid artery.

# Acute on chronic diastolic Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation: CHF exacerbation was attributed to severe Aortic Stenosis seen on echo.
# Severe Aortic stenosis: Pt found to have severe Aortic Stenosis with aortic valve area: 0.8-1.0cm2.
Echo also revealed mod-severe MR. CT surgery was consulted and reccomended surgery.
Pt had CT chest (revealing small bilateral pleural effusions and extensive atherosclerosis).
Carotid US performed which showed 89% stenosis on left side and no sig stenosis on right side.
PFTs returned showing mixed restrictive and obstructive disease.
No significant chest pain during hospital stay.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Sugars in the 170-350 range.
# GERD: Continued Esomeprazole .
Pt noted to have enlarged flat tongue with MCV in low 80s.
7. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as directed as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Critical Aortic Stenosis Coronary Artery Disease Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure that was a result of a very tight aortic valve.
We have done many tests here to get you ready for the surgery including a CT scan of the chest, Pulmonary function tests, a sleep study, and a carotid ultrasound.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
