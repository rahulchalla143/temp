Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory Failure - Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and tachypnea on presentation to the ED.
PE was ruled out by CTA, which also showed RLL pneumonia with tree [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities throughout lungs.
In ED, she acutely worsened in setting of tachycardia, thought likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
She was given diuretics, placed on BiPap with some improvement, however ultimately required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was extubated after 24 hours with steady improvement in her oxygen requirement over the course of her admission.
# Pneumonia- Atypical distribution on CT with a RLL consolidation.
While intubated, bronchoscopy was performed which showed thick secretions, but no other pathology.
Per ID, antibiotic regimen was changed to Ceftriaxone given no positive cultures.
Oxygen requirement improved throughout admission.
# Chest pain/NSTEMI - Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] presented with persistant, pleuritic chest pain over lateral left chest in setting of pneumonia on CT.  EKG in the ED with SD depressions, first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
Catheterization showed diffuse coronary artery disease; no internvention was done.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 108232**] [**Name (STitle) 10708**] was discontinued due to continued orthostatic hypotension and restarting should be readdressed as an outpatient.
# Orthostatic Hypotension- Reportedly manifest as orthostasis and lightheadedness over several weeks as patient tried to self taper her prednisone that she has been on since last bout of PNA in [**12-20**] - concern for adrenal insufficiency.
Two days prior to discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] experienced asymptommatic hypotension in the morning that responded to small IV bolus.
# Anemia - Anemia below baseline on admission, stable throughout admission.
Transfused 1 unit PRBCs with no side effects.
# History of PE - Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] continues outpatient warfarin for prophylaxis after PE approximately 10 years ago.
She became supratherapeutic during admission and this was held.
