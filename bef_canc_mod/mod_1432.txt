Pertinent Results: [**2127-7-9**] 03:56AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-4.03* Hgb-11.9* Hct-33.5* MCV-83 MCH-29.6 MCHC-35.6* RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-119* [**2127-7-9**] 03:56AM BLOOD Glucose-113* UreaN-17 Creat-1.2 Na-141 K-3.5 Cl-109* HCO3-24 AnGap-12 [**2127-7-8**] 02:34AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-102 [**2127-7-8**] 02:34AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 [**2127-7-9**] 03:56AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-3.4 Mg-1.7 [**2127-7-8**] 02:34AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.7 [**2127-7-8**] 02:34AM BLOOD Triglyc-107 HDL-44 CHOL/HD-2.0 LDLcalc-22  MRI/MRA of Head and Neck:  Multiple small acute infarcts in the right frontal precentral and right parietal postcentral subcortical in location, with patent major intracranial arteries, likely related to embolic etiology.
Atherosclerotic disease, involving the right common carotid artery bifurcation, left anterior cerebral artery and bilateral cavernous carotid artery segments.
MRI OF THE BRAIN: There are multiple FLAIR hyperintense foci, in the cerebral white matter, subcortical and periventricular in location, predominant subcortical white matter, in both cerebral hemispheres.
On the diffusion sequences, there are multiple, [**2-18**], small areas of restricted diffusion, in the right frontal (precentral) and one in the right parietal postcentral subcortical location, the larger one in the right precentral location measuring 1.1 x 0.7 cm, and representing acute infarcts.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells reveal increased signal in the anterior ethmoid air cells on both sides, in the right mastoid air cells, with small amount of fluid versus mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: The distal left vertebral, basilar, posterior inferior cerebellar, and the posterior cerebral arteries are patent.
The intracranial internal carotid, anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm, within the resolution of MR angiogram.
There is contour irregularity of the cavernous carotid arteries on both sides, related to atherosclerotic calcifications.
The A1 segment of the elft anterior cerebral artery is irregular and small inc aliber likely due to atherosclerotic disease.
However, the origins of the vertebral arteries are not clearly evaluated, due to overlapping artifacts.
Patient shas bilateral carotid artery stents in the distal common carotid and proximal internal carotid arteries, evaluation of which is limited on the present study.
Though there is decreased signal along the presumed course of the stents, with some hypointense areas on the medial aspect of the right cervical internal carotid artery which can be due to atherosclerotic calcifications, assessment is limited on the present study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61450**] is a 72 year old male with history of CAD s/p stenting, s/p left ICA stent, s/p right ICA stenting on this admission admitted to the CCU for montoring of hypotension and then observed for new left-sided upper extremity weakness.
No additional vasopressors or fluid boluses were required to maintain blood pressure.
As he had a history of sinus bradycardia the rhythm was expected post-procedure and he was monitored on telemetry.
# Urinary retention: Pt has a history of BPH, and Flomax was held immediately following stenting in order to maintain cerebral perfusion.
Pt had poor urine output following the procedure that improved when a foley was placed.
# Neurologic: On day 2 of admission the pt developed left shoulder "weakness" s/p stent to right ICA with 4/5 proximal left upper extremity strength.
His EKG was unchanged and the patient had no cardiac symptoms.
CT of the head did not reveal any acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI/MRA of head and neck showed multiple small acute infarcts in the right frontal precentral and right parietal postcentral subcortical in location, with patent major intracranial arteries, likely related to embolic etiology.
The patient had serial neuro checks which did not reveal additional neurologic deficits.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Internal Carotid Stenting CVA  Hypertension Coronary Artery Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable.
After the procedure you experienced some weakness and heaviness in your left arm that was determined to be due to a small stroke.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9832**] if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or slurred speech.
