Native three vessel coronary artery disease with extensive bridging collaterals of the RCA.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Mild right common-femoral vascular disease.
Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system showed native three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities.
Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD, supplying the distal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and r-PDA.
Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left subclavian stent.
Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with more pronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
There was trace mitral regurgitation.
Limited left ilio-femoral peripheral angiography showed a mild 30% stenosis of the common femoral artery.
EKG: afib, left axis deviation, ST depression and TWI in V2-V6.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Depressed LVEF.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**12-26**] cath: PROCEDURE DATE: [**2149-12-26**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: EKG changes.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND.
INDICATION: 74 year old female with abdominal pain, increased LFTs.
Evaluate for gallstones, or liver disease.
The liver shows no focal abnormalities.
The liver parenchyma is mildly hyperechoic in echotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration.
There is a mild hyperechoic focus within the interpolar right kidney, with no evidence of posterior shadowing, possibly representing a small parenchymal calcification Within the lateral aspect of the right kidney, in the interpolar region, there is a 1.2-cm anechoic focus, most likely representing a simple cyst.
The left kidney measures 8.1 cm, with no focal abnormalities.
2) The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty liver.
However, other forms of liver disease, and more advanced liver disease, including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
[**12-24**] chest x-ray: INDICATION: Shortness of breath, s/p extubation.
The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement.
There is evidence of a prior CABG procedure.
No pulmonary infiltrates are seen.
There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and slight widening of the minor fissure consistent with a small effusion.
IMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion.
No other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], stent to left subclavian in [**6-17**], re-cath in 02 as above, history of CHF, depressed EF,  hypertension, afib astham/COPD who presents now with increasing SOB and anginal episodes after URI last Friday.
Patient was ruled out for MI on admission.
After stabilization of her pulmonary issues, given her history and an echo which could not fully assess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac catherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA to LAD.
D/ced calcium channel blocker with likely systolic dysfunction and definite diastolic CHF.
Had been on Mavik for unclear reason, tolerating ACE here--would titrate up for heart failure as below.
Continues to have seom angina with stress.
b)pump: Patient noted to have depressed EF in past-35%?
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
On admission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly volume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily due to astham/copd exacerbation.
Given that she was acutely decompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded when echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of baseline status.
Maintained on beta-blocker, ACE for ischemia and HF.
POor control now and had sensation of palpitations on night PTA.
Unclear if ratelead to CHF or CHF lead to increased rate and component of ischemia?--Increaed demand leading to ischemia vs. ischemia leading to tachy-- Patient maintained on metoprolol for rate control with good affect.
Concerning anti-coagulation, we are holding coumadin until patient has outpatient colonoscopy-had guiac positive stools and crit drop (also with neck hematoma after central line placement.)
Shortness of breath/hypoxemia: CHF vs. post URI Reactive airways disease vs. COPD vs. PE vs. pneumonia--ON admission, SOB felt secondary to astham exacerbation-Patient acutely decompensated, wheezy on exam, sent to unit on day 2 of admission for intubation.
Anemia at baseline/Crit drop/guiaic positive: Patient had crit drop while in ICU.
She had a hematoma after central line placement as well as guiac positive stools.
She stabilized after transfusion in ICU, and needed no further transfusions.
Neck hematoma is resolving.
Elevated LFT's, tbili and PTT: After being off heparin (on it for afib), stopped for crit drop in [**Name (NI) 102488**] PTT remained elevated.
WAs on subcu heparin, lft's obtained which showed mild transaminase elevation and t bili elevation.
Lipitor was increased from 10 to 40 given significant coronary disease--although unlikely to cause acute elevations.
Hypothyroidism: Levoxyl continued, TSH normal  GERD: PRotonix continued, no acute issues.
