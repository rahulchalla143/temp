Pulmonary embolus.
Right ventricular function.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened with focal calcification of the noncoronary cusp.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2134-6-29**], there is no significant change.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: r/o PE Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old man with concern for PE.
EXAMINATION: CT of the chest with and without contrast dated [**2136-1-13**].
FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta and great vessels.
There is no pericardial effusion.
After administration of IV contrast there is evidence of thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery as well as segmental and subsegmental branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary arteries.
No thrombus is seen within the left pulmonary arteries.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are demonstrated which are numerous but not enlarged by CT criteria.
Scattered air space disease is seen within the right middle lobe and right lower lobe which may represent atelectasis, infection, or infarction given evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen demonstrates evidence of splenectomy with small fluid collection in the left upper quadrant measuring 3 cm which contains gas consistent with post-surgical changes.
Evidence of pulmonary embolism on the right as described with air space consolidation within the right middle and right lower lobes which may represent atelectasis, infection, or pulmonary infarction given evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Limited evaluation of post-surgical changes in the left upper quadrant as seen on prior CT abdomen and pelvis.
Reason: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 7.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA ([**2136-1-12**]); 44.0 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ([**2136-1-12**]); HISTORY: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE  INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate marked central clumping consistent with airways disease.
There is diffuse irregularity of tracer uptake within the lung parenchyma.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show multiple large peripheral wedge-shaped defects in the right lung.
Chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe opacity.
While the above findings may in part be attributed to airways disease, they are concerning for pulmonary embolism and consistent with a moderately high probability for pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-High Likelihood for pulmonary embolism.
He underwent a lung scan which revealed moderate to high probability of pulmonary embolus.
CTA of the chest was done following the lung scan which revealed a thrombus in the right pulmonary artery.
On HD #5 he experienced episode of increased shortness of breath and chest pressure after performing morning ADL's; EKG and CXR were all normal; his CK and troponin were flat.
On HD #8 he was noted to have guaiac positive stool via his ileostomy.
We reached 50 cm and found no blood and normal ileal mucosa with bile.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Date Range **]: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Colace 100 mg Capsule [**Date Range **]: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Date Range **]: Ten (10) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] rehab [**Location (un) 3915**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call or return if you have a fever >101.5, severe pain, inability to pass gas or stool, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, drainage from the wound, or any other concerns.
