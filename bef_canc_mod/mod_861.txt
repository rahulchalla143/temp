HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 68 year old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertension and questionable history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] from an outside hospital for further work-up of bilateral upper lobe consolidation.
In short, the patient was treated for a left mastoiditis at the end of [**Month (only) **], early [**Month (only) 359**].
After finishing treatment, the patient had severe headache and self treated this with high doses of aspirin, approximately 12 tablets per day for seven days.
He had persistent weakness and fevers at home with documented temperature to 102.0 F., orally, and presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**9-9**].
A chest x-ray there showed bilateral upper lobe opacities and he was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia and sent home on azithromycin.
The patient returned on [**9-11**] with continued weakness and had some EKG changes over leads V3 and V4, and was admitted to Telemetry but circumstances for that admission are unclear from present records.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for presumptive pneumonia and he apparently was hypoxic requiring four liters, had a negative VQ and lower extremity Dopplers.
The patient had two chest CT scans that showed evidence for pneumonia versus malignancy in the left upper lobe.
Given these atypical opacities, he was ruled out for tuberculosis by sputum and had a negative PPD, and after two days of ceftriaxone, he was switched to Unasyn.
The patient has also developed some hemoptysis during his stay at [**Hospital3 **].
Bronchoscopy at that time was postponed secondary to an increased bleeding time.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up of pulmonary infiltrates.
At [**Hospital 487**] Hospital, the patient also had renal failure, normocytic anemia and hyponatremia.
The patient denies history of renal disease.
A renal consultation at the outside hospital stated that his acute renal failure was secondary to effective hypovolemia secondary to low albumin.
Congestive heart failure.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
He does have a documented history of hypertension.
Questionable history of chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.
He is a pleasant gentleman, mildly diaphoretic.
Neck with no jugular venous distention.
Chest with mildly coarse breath sounds in the upper lung fields; otherwise clear and resonant to percussion.
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   While the patient was on the floor, he had experienced some back and abdominal pain and had a hematocrit drop from 29 to 22 over a six hour period.
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a new acute hemorrhage, in the right peri- nephric area.
The patient also responded to fluid boluses for brief episodes of low systolic blood pressures.
The patient also had episodes of respiratory difficulty requiring an increased oxygen requirement, including 4 liters nasal cannula and scoop face mask.
The patient also had acute renal failure with a creatinine which bumped into the low 3 range.
Work-up of his renal mass demonstrated by MRI that his hematoma was stable.
The patient had a horseshoe kidney with good blood flow throughout.
There was no enhancing lesion with gadolinium contrast and there were multiple small cortical infarctions throughout the kidney which was consistent with a vasculitis type picture.
In terms of his respiratory difficulties, the patient received cultures and was presumptively treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, however, culture data did not support a diagnosis of pneumonia.
Review of records from the outside hospital revealed an elevated C-ANCA which would help to explain both his respiratory and his renal issues.
A presumptive diagnosis of Wegener's was made and Rheumatology was consulted.
The patient did have good urinary output and self diuresis with improving renal function on high dose steroids.
This was encouraging in the setting of starting Cytoxan and urinalysis after starting Cytoxan did not demonstrate microscopic hematuria.
On his discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit receiving no intravenous fluids, with a stable blood pressure.
