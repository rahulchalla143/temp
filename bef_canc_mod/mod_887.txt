Admission Date:  [**2200-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-3-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-10-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOLOGY  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Shortness of breath and hypoglycemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188**], and [**2196**], atrial flutter, status post ablation, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, status post AICD placement, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2200-3-2**], with the chief complaint of shortness of breath times three days.
He states that for the past month prior to admission he noted anergia and increasing dyspnea.
Six months prior to admission, he was able to walk twelve steps without difficulty.
He also notes increasing orthopnea from two pillows to three pillows over the past month as well as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
In late [**Month (only) 956**], he was seen in the Electrophysiology Device Clinic and begun on Lasix 20 mg once daily for congestive heart failure.
On [**2200-2-28**], he noticed that he was "washed out" with increasing shortness of breath and decreasing p.o.
He then became diaphoretic, light-headed, put his head between his knees and fell over into his bed without any head trauma.
When he awoke after an unknown period of time, he was not lethargic, had no postictal signs.
Of note, he had no sensation of palpitations or chest discomfort throughout this episode.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, status post AICD placement in [**2199-8-26**].
Atrial flutter, status post ablation in [**2199-10-26**].
Multiple myeloma diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy in [**2199-1-26**], with aspirate smears demonstrating a MTE ratio of 3:1, less than 1% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 5% myelocytes, 7% metamyelocytes, 31% bands/neutrophils, 30% plasma cells, 8% lymphocytes, 16% erythroid cells.
The plasma cells appear to be dysplastic with prominent nucleoli and there were multinucleated plasma cells seen as well.
He had been treated for multiple myeloma prior to this biopsy with Thalidomide as well as Methylprednisone in the past.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2178**], and [**2196**], with an episode of mediastinitis complicating one of the bypass surgeries.
His last coronary catheterization was on [**2199-10-9**], which demonstrated patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and saphenous vein graft to R1/OM1 and right posterior descending artery, as well as severe three vessel coronary disease of a right dominant system, moderate diastolic ventricular function, left ventriculogram was not performed secondary to renal insufficiency.
Congestive heart failure, left and right sided, with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, left atrial moderate dilation, left ventricular moderate dilation, mild pulmonary hypertension by echocardiogram performed on [**2199-10-9**].
It is unclear how the patient got this diagnosis, however, he has been on Glipizide and Metformin for approximately one year with no episodes of hypoglycemia in the past.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with laryngeal cancer, history of depression and history of gynecologic cancer in two or more relatives.
In general, the patient is lying in bed, speaking four to five words at a time secondary to shortness of breath.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur best auscultated at the apex, heard throughout the precordium, nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
Jugular venous distention at nine centimeters.
The lungs revealed crackles one half up bilaterally, no wheezes.
Chest x-ray showed findings consistent with congestive heart failure, more confluent opacity in the right infrahilar region, may reflect asymmetric edema or underlying pneumonia, read by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Congestive heart failure - The patient was initially continued on 40 mg of Lasix per day, given the findings on lung examination and the peripheral edema.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed once the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and demonstrated diffuse segments of akinesis/hypokinesis in the apex, septal region, inferolateral region and inferior region, as well as moderate right ventricular systolic depression and an unchanged ejection fraction, unchanged mitral regurgitation at 2+.
Hypoglycemia - The patient was initially treated with an insulin sliding scale.
The Glipizide and Metformin were held and one amp of D50 was given for isolated low glucose levels.
However, on the evening of [**2200-3-3**], the patient had persistent episodes of hypoglycemia despite 9 amps of D50 and 1 mg of Glucagon on the floor.
An endocrine consultation was obtained which suggested that most likely the hypoglycemia was secondary to decreased excretion of Sulfonylureas in Metformin in the setting of acute renal failure, as well as possible contribution to Hydrochlorothiazide induced insulin resistant.
The D10W drip was eventually titrated down to D5W drip and then after the patient developed hyponatremia was changed to D5 normal saline and was then weaned off on the morning of [**2200-3-2**], at which time fingerstick glucose remained within normal limits and fingerstick glucose checks were changed to q4hours and then to q6hours.
Of note, the patient did have one episode of hyperglycemia in the 400s during this period of time and was covered with six units of regular insulin before transfer to the medical floor.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of Aspirin, beta blocker, statin and ace inhibitor.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia - The patient had two episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during his hospitalization.
The patient had an episode of symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on the morning of [**2200-3-5**], while being examined by the Medical Intensive Care Unit team.
He had some presyncope with light-headedness, was found to have a fingerstick glucose of 184.
This was in the setting of bradycardia to 50 beats per minute on telemetry, which resolved after ten seconds.
Acute on chronic renal failure - This was felt to be secondary to an increase in the Lasix dose five days prior to admission as well as the use of Levofloxacin, see below, as well as the use of ace inhibitors as well as decreased p.o.
Urinary tract infection - The patient was felt to have urinary tract infection by urinalysis on admission and was started on Levofloxacin which was subsequently renally dosed.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient was continued on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.0.
Apical akinesis - The patient was continued on Coumadin.
