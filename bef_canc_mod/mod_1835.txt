She was initially admitted to medicine on [**1-1**] with "failure to thrive" in the setting of poor PO intake.
Initial findings were significant for tachycardia and hypertension with orthostatic hypotension and guaiac positive stool.
Labs revealed a lactate of 4, a metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 24.
On the evening of [**1-1**], the patient developed coffee-ground emesis.
She had 2 episodes of 100-200cc red-tinged emesis with maroon flecks.
She was then transferred to the unit because of GI bleed in the setting of poor IV access.
Of note, the patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 12260**] with chest pain in the setting of cocaine abuse.
Also, she had an episode of GI bleeding during an admission for hypoglycemia in 07/[**2172**].
Work-up at the time revealed a small gastric ulcer and a small colonic polyp that was not removed.

No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
No pneumothorax, apical hematoma, or pleural effusion is demonstrated.
Calcifications projecting over the left upper abdomen correspond to pancreatic calcifications, most likely consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
EGD [**2175-1-2**]: Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema and erosion of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Erythema and congestion of the mucosa were noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia Erythema and erosion in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 62yo woman with h/o polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, SBO s/p 2 small bowel resections, and GI bleed in the past transferred to the MICU for care of GI bleed, stabilized and transferred to the floor for monitoring of her anemia.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Acute Gastritis: She was admitted to the MICU.
They saw gastritis but no varices.
She had no hemodynamic instability.
On the floor her hematocrit and platelets remained low but were stable, however she was without evidence of acute bleed or hemodynamic instability.
# Cirrhosis, coagulopathy, Chronic hepatitis C, alcohol dependence.
An abdominal ultrasound confirmed cirrhosis but showed no portal flow defects.
# Anion Gap Acidosis:  Primary alcoholic/starvation ketosis and renal failure.
Likely secondary to liver disease.
Discharge to rehab was recommended by PT as patient is at risk for bleed with fall, however patient declined after a discussion of the risks and benefits.
# Depression: On outpatient sertraline.
Diazepam provided for anxiety and CIWA while inpatient.
# Chronic pancreatitis: No acute issues.
# Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled without complications: Pt received insulin sliding scale while inpatient.
# Elevated troponin: Troponin elevation on admission was likely due to CKD.
Tox screen negative for cocaine.
