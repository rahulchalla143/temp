Admission Date:  [**2109-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-1-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents / Coumadin / Percocet / Anesthesia Tray  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive at hemodialysis.
F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis who was at scheduled hemodialysis session when she was noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs and was bag-mask ventilated.
No history of sz disorder per daughter.
Unsure if pt became incontinent, but daughter states that this unresponsiveness has happened in past with incontinence.
In the ED, the patient followed simple commands and moving all extremities, but reportedly with diffusely tender abdominal exam.
She did not have any more episodes of non-responsiveness during that hospitalization and remained normotensive on the medical floor.
CXR with cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
1 L IVFs given.
CT torso could not be completed as pt without any PIV and cannot run contrast through any central access or PICC.
On admission to the ICU, the patient was only slightly responsive to yelling with moaning and groaning.
End stage renal disease on HD T,Th,Sat 2.
Hypertension 4.
Coronary artery disease 5.
Asthma 7.
Atrial fibrillation 8.
Obstructive sleep apnea 11.
Ventral hernia 12.
Multiple fistula revisions 15. s/p unilateral oophorectomy 16.
Septic arthritis (left knee) 17.
Hypothyroidism  Social History: She was previously living with her daughter, however after a recent hospital stay for septic arthritis was undergoing rehabilitation at a specialty hospital.
GEN: somnolent, only moaning and groaning to yelling HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP - unable to examine, no LAD, JVD could not be asessed due to anatomy CHEST: CTAB anteriorly, no w/r/r CV: irreg irreg, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: large ventral midline hernia that is reducible, obese, TTP of epigastric area EXT: no c/c/e NEURO: moving all extremities, screaming in pain during blood draws, attempts at a-line, saying "you put me in hell", otherwise, incoherent DERM: no rashees noted.
Pertinent Results: CXR's: [**2109-8-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-13**], the opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema have worsened.
Again, the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Opacification persists at the left and possibly right base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
This is consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis, though supervening pneumonia can certainly not be excluded, especially in view of the clinical history.
[**2109-8-13**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-12**], there is again diffuse pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Echo [**2109-8-13**]:  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-4**], probable vegetation (vs. torn chordae) is now seen on the tricuspid valve and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has markedly increased.
In addition, the right ventricle is now more dilated (was dilated on review of the prior study) with free wall hypyokinesis and the interatrial septum is now deviated towards the left atrium.
EEG  [**2109-8-13**]: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the slow background.
These findings suggest widespread moderate encephalopathy.
No lateralizing or seizure activity was seen.
Cholelithiasis with mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, without evidence for pericholecystic fluid or biliary ductal dilatation.
Findings could reflect sequela of chronic liver disease or third spacing from CHF or low albumin.
Unchanged nonmobile gallstones in the gallbladder neck, without gallbladder distention or pericholecystic fluid.
Mild thickening of gallbladder wall is also unchanged.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No etiology for patient's altered mental status identified.
Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and extensive worsening of diffuse anasarca.
Extensive bilateral nodular opacities predominantly within the upper lobes may be sequela of the patient's known sarcoidosis or represent an acute infectious process.
Scattered ground-glass opacities, resulting in mosaic attenuation in the lung is likely related to underlying airtrapping or mild alveolar edema.
Unchanged large ventral hernia without CT findings to suggest  incarceration/strangulation although this is a clinical diagnosis.
CT Head: [**2109-8-9**] There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is mild diffuse atrophy which is most pronounced in the cerebellum.
There are also calcifications of the basal ganglia bilaterally and calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally.
There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
[**2109-8-19**]: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema or mass.
Again noted is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells, not significantly changed from prior studies when accounting for differences in technique.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
UE US [**2109-8-15**]: Patent upper extremity surgical AV fistula, no thrombus or fluid collection is seen, greater than 50% stenosis at the level of the venous anastomosis.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis who was at scheduled hemodialysis session when she was noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs.
# Unresponsiveness/Altered Mental Status: Occurred for 8 minute duration at HD with normal VS.
Per recent discharge summary, pt has history of unresponsive episodes that occur frequently at HD.
Hypercalcemia present, likely chronic.
EKG with no acute changes.
CE x 3 negative, at baseline chronically elevated from ESRD.
EEG showed slowing consistent with toxic encephalopathy not seizure disorder.
TSH mildly elevated, most likely not contributing.
Second episode of change in mental status on [**2109-8-19**], repeat ABG, no hypercarbia.
Repeated CT scan showed no acute change.
Most likely mixed etiology of delirium secondary to infection with c. diff and hypoxia from OSA, pulmonary edema (volume overload) and baseline pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Patient developed new O2 requirement, however saturations in the high 90's on 1L NC, wearing CPAP at night, seems to have helped tremendously.
Patient trasnfered to the MICU on [**8-19**] after concern for respiratory distress and inability to get a pleth so unable to assess oxygenation.
Her chest x ray showed pulmonary edema.
There was initial concern for pneumonia given her WBC and cough, however, the improvement of her CXR after dialysis argued against pneumonia.
She had ongoing delerium while in the intensive care unit.
She was subsequently found to have C. diff so vanco/zosyn for pneumonia were stopped and patient was started on flagyl.
There was concern for PE, given the improvement of her oxygenation with dialysis, a workup for PE was not pursued.
# Tricuspid valve vegetation: Found incidentally on echo while working up for unresponsive episode.
ID consulted, unlikely to be truly infected, held antibiotics, until second episode of unresponsiveness on [**2109-8-19**] and restarted vancomycin and zosyn empirically.
Patient never mounted a fever or leukocytosis.
Had to be very careful with fluid boluses, and only gave when absolutely necessary as patient has tendency to become overloaded easily.
# C. Diff colitis:  Toxin positive on [**2109-8-20**].
# GIB: Patient had documented melena on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Once sent to the floor, no more documented melena or drop in Hct.
Monitored Hct and guaiced all stools while in patient with no further evidence of GI bleed.
# ESRD on HD: patient getting HD on M, W, F at rehab facility.
# Hypercalcemia: unclear etiology, but most likely primary hyperparathyroidism as patient's PTH was abnormally high for the level of calcium.
Other etiologies included breast ca, sarcoidosis, calcium supplements, or immobility.
# DM:  Pt was getting half dose of NPH, 5 units, however she had hypoglycemia during admission, held NPH.
# Elevated LFT's, Amylase and Lipase, and direct bilirubinemia: Chronically elevated for unclear reason.
Patient has had elevated amylase and lipase since [**2107**] but for brief time lipase normalized.
Abd u/s completed showed cholelithiasis and gb wall thickening but no biliary ductal dilitationdid not visualize the pancreas well.
Repeated Abd US with no evidence of obstruction.
This could have been due to volume overload and congestion.
Also, anastrazole can cause elevated transaminases and alk phos.
If patient develops abdominal pain in the future, would consider reevaluation with possible evaluation by GI medicine.
No evidence of DVT in arm.
Swelling most likely secondary to fluid shifts and positioning.
Trended CBC while inpatient, no levels less than 20's, no spontaneous bleeding.
Checked SPEP, UPEP with no specific abnormalities seen.
# Anemia: resolved, had decreased Hct in the ICU down to 22, but has been stable.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Hypothyroidism: patient has history of hypothyroid, on synthroid.
# Sarcoid: stable, CT scan that showed diffuse nodular opacities.
Unclear if this was due to volume overload or sarcoid.
# CAD: Unable to restart lisinopril or metoprolol as pt's blood pressure so labile.
# Access: picc in left arm, AV fistula in the right .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaulation of unresponsiveness during hemodialysis.
You were presumed to have had a drop in your blood pressure secondary to fluid being taken off quickly.
We checked for signs of infection in your blood, but nothing made us think you had a true infection.
If you experience any change in your mental status, neurological symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptom please seek medical attention.
