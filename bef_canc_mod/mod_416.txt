Admission Date:  [**2173-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-4-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**] Chief Complaint: s/p 8 foot fall from roof.
NAD Head: Normocephalic/Atraumatic Eyes: 3mm pupils equally round and reactive to light Nose: normal Ears: normal OP: clear, no evidence of trauma or blood Neck: full ROM, no point tenderness Chest: CTA bilaterally.
Multiple acute and chronic rib fractures and two vertebral fractures as above.
The acute fractures are at the bilateral first ribs and right 2nd, 4th, and 5th ribs.
Right posterior flank hernia (likely [**Doctor Last Name 40166**] hernia).
This is age- indeterminate but may be an acute traumatic sequela.
Right fluid collection overlying the iliac crest.
This is non-specific with broad considerations included a seroma, hematoma, or abscess.
Not typical of an acute traumatic injury.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR L SPINE  [**2173-6-4**] CONCLUSION: Extensive spinal cord compression in the cervical area due to spondylosis.
Extensive multilevel vertebral signal abnormalities, raise the possibility of neoplastic disease, as opposed to trauma.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Chest xray [**2173-6-7**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-6**]: Lung volumes have improved, but bibasilar atelectasis persists, as does a small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
No mediastinal widening.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained for several days.
Because of his rib fractures and pain associated with this he has not been able to effectively cough, deep breathe and use the incentive spirometer and therefore has required supplemental oxygen at 2 liters/ minute via nasal cannula.

Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Multiple rib fractures - right [**12-7**]; left 1 L1, T5 body fractures Acute blood loss anemia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, pain adequately controlled.
Followup Instructions: Follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma Surgery for your rib fractures.
Inform the office that you will need and end expiratory AP chest xray for this appointment.
