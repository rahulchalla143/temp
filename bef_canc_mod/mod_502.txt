Admission Date:  [**2117-8-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-8-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 -year-old female who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] following resolution of an upper gastrointestinal bleed which was found to be secondary to gastric ulcer.
She now returns to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
One week prior to her first admission, she reports having had a cough and shortness of breath, but denied any production of sputum.
During her first hospitalization, she was hospitalized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit drop to 22.3 and she was found to have a nonbleeding ulcer at the gastroesophageal junction.
After her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her hospital course was notable for worsening dyspnea on exertion and hypoxia with saturations equal to approximately 90% on three liters of oxygen.
She was felt to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, versus fluid overload and was started on Albuterol, Atrovent, and Flovent inhalers, as well as Lasix 20 mg q day.
She had partial resolution of her shortness of breath and was discharged with the diagnosis of likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and given metered dose inhalers and two liters of supplemental oxygen at home.
Following discharge, the patient developed further progression of her dyspnea on exertion and worsening lower extremity edema, for which she returned to the hospital on [**2117-8-9**].
At that time she denied any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, fever or chills, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or black stools.
She did at that time complain of some pleuritic chest pain.
Cerebrovascular accident, which occurred eleven years ago.
The patient has minimal residual leg weakness on examination.
Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral symptoms.
Peptic ulcer disease, nonbleeding gastric ulcer, Helicobacter pylori positive.
General: a moderately obese woman in respiratory distress.
Neck: supple, obese, no lymphadenopathy, anterior scar visible.
Lungs: decreased breath sounds at the bases, right side greater than left, bibasilar crackles, otherwise decreased breath sounds, no wheezes.
Cardiac: tachycardic, regular rhythm, distant heart sounds, S1, S2 normal, no S3 or S4, no murmurs, no jugular venous distention.
Chest x-ray: mild congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size from prior study.
[**Street Address(2) **] depression in leads I and V4 through V6.
Chest CT scan: no evidence of pulmonary embolus, partial collapse or consolidation of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe, question pneumonia, large right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural effusion.
She had a chest CT scan which revealed right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient underwent thoracentesis of the right lung which showed loculated pleural effusions, exudative in nature, with a high white blood cell count.
400 cc of yellowish fluid was drained at that time.
On hospital day eleven, the patient's chest tubes were removed and x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.
This was thought to be related to a combination of resolving pneumonia as well as atelectasis.
Cardiovascular:  Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% as well as septal and inferoseptal wall motion abnormalities.
Elevated troponin at the time of admission raised the possibility of a recent myocardial infarction; however, it was thought that this was more likely secondary to congestive heart failure and related myocardial stretch.
The patient's shortness of breath and increased lower extremity edema were thought to be partially related to congestive heart failure, and the patient was therefore diuresed accordingly.
At the time of discharge, the patient continued to have some moderate lower extremity swelling; however, her lung examination was unremarkable for significant signs of congestive heart failure.
During her hospitalization, the patient's electrocardiograms remained stable and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK enzymes, although troponin was elevated as mentioned above.
She was found to have a pneumonia as well as bilateral loculated pleural effusions, which were exudative in nature.
She was subsequently started on levofloxacin, clindamycin, and ceftriaxone for broad coverage of her pneumonia and empyema.
When she left the Medical Intensive Care Unit and returned to the floor, her white blood cell count had decreased significantly, and cultures of the pleural effusion revealed alpha streptococcus.
The patient was also found to be Helicobacter pylori positive and was started on a fourteen day course of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and Protonix.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was recently hospitalized for an upper gastrointestinal bleed on [**2117-8-2**].
During her current hospitalization, her hematocrit remained stable and she revealed no signs or symptoms of further bleeding.
Prior to discharge, she was restarted on her Avandia; however, the Glucotrol was held as the patient experienced mild hypoglycemia when this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was restarted.
During her hospitalization, her creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.6; however, remained stable.
The patient was discharged on Lasix 40 mg po q day for treatment of her congestive heart failure related symptoms.
