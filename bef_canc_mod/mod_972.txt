Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes.
GUIDANCE FOR PARACENTESIS Successful diagnostic ultrasound-guided paracentesis yielding 1 L of straw-colored ascites.
Minimal thickening along the right minor fissure.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Hepatofugal flow in the right portal vein with evidence of thrombus within.
Prominent patent left portal vein with hepatopetal flow which drains into a patent umbilical vein.
Right pleural effusion.
Near-occlusive thrombus within the right portal vein, extending into the right anterior and posterior portal veins.
The left portal vein is widely patent, draining into a dilated recanalized paraumbilical vein.
Mild splenomegaly and ascites suggest the presence of portal hypertension.
Decreased size of now nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion, with small residual right basilar atelectasis.

You were admitted after a clinic visit because you were found to have elevated liver tests.
We did several tests while you were in the hospital, including an ultrasound and a cat scan which showed a clot in your right portal vein (the vein going to your liver).
You were started on some blood thinning medications for your clot, however your levels became very elevated requiring you to stay in the hospital a few additional days while this value (INR) corrected.
