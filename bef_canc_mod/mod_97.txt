Admission Date:  [**2154-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amlodipine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, altered mental status, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right femoral CVC.
History of Present Illness: 85-year-old female with history of diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG x 3 in [**8-31**], and s/p multiple orthopedic procedures most recently a L total shoulder replacement [**9-19**] who has been in rehab and recently discharged to home.
She was last hospitalized in [**2155-9-23**] for a segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism involving the right lower lobe and right upper lobe with subpleural consolidation in the right lower lobe suggestive of pulmonary infarct.
She presented to the ED today via ambulance (field records unavailable) with fevers (not quantified), chills, ?rigors, nausea, vomiting, and new oxygen requirement.
The patient was in her otherwise normal state of health except for joint-associated pains at baseline.
She denies sick contacts and aspiration although some difficulty swallowing pills at time.
Labs were suggestive of acute renal failure.
Patient denied any overt complaints and felt much better.

FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: New opacification extending from the left hilum to both the upper and lower lobes is concerning for developing pneumonia.
A  small left pleural effusion may be present.
A question of luceny over the  left mid thorax is seen and PA and lateral views may be useful to exclude  cavitation.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
There is no free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis to suggest an RP bleed.
A right-sided femoral line is appropriately positioned with no iatrogenic complication seen.
Cardiology A. EKG Sinus tachycardia with poor baseline.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-9-22**] no diagnostic interval change.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
Possible small secundum atrial septal defect.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-9**], the right ventricular cavity size is larger, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is increased, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Microbiology [**2154-11-9**] 10:19PM URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen Detection-PND [**2154-11-12**] 2:27PM C. Diff Toxin A & B Negative [**2154-11-10**] Urine Legionella Negative x 2 [**2154-11-9**] : Bld Cultures x 2 negative, pending final results DIRECT [**2154-11-10**]: Influenza DFA A&B negative  ### Pending studies: URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen   Brief Hospital Course: 85-year-old female with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure along with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABGx3, history of PE in setting of immobility, and multiple recent orthopedic procedures that presents with fever, hypotension requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressor support thought to be secondary to septic process and decreased PO intake, resolved altered mental status, and infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia that is improving clinically.
Pneumonia: Pt was admitted to ICU in septic shock as well as hypoxia requiring 6L of Oxygen.
Chest xray showed multifocal pneumonia which was thought to be cause of her sepsis.
After 2 days in the ICU she was transferred to the medical floor where she had no oxygen requirement.
(She was diagnosed with a Pulmonary Embolism last month and was in rehab following discharge, she was home several days before presenting for this hospitalization).
Other causes of her hypoxia were also evaluated, she had an Echo performed which showed a larger RV cavity size and tricuspid regurgitation however her clinical exam was notable for hypovolemia.
Her hypotension was likely a combniation of her sepsis, hypovolemia and taking her anti-hypertensives.
Her cortisol level was 5.81 in the ICU but did not require steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
Given her recent hospital course and antibiotic coverage a C. Diff toxin was sent and was ultimately negative, she also had no evidence of fevers or leukocytosis.
She was started on Maalox for her diarrhea.
- recommend continuing Maalox for diarrhea - recommend rechecking C. Diff toxin assay, complete blood count for leukocytosis if diarrhea is persistent .
Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine of 2 on admission with baseline around 1 consistent with pre-renal acute renal given responsive to fluids and FeUREA of 25 %.
#  Supratherapeutic INR: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] was diagnosed with a segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism involving the right lower lobe and right upper lobe, as well as a possible pulmonary infarct of the right lower lobe on [**2154-9-23**] in the setting of immbolity from recent shoulder surgery.
# Hypertension Prior to discharge Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] was noted to be hypertensive with systolic pressure ruanging from 160 to 180.
# Anemia: On admission Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] had an admission Hgb of 10.8 with subsequent drop to 7.6, which was initially concerning for a bleed in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
The patient also had a CT abdomen/pelvis which did not show any retroperitoneal bleed, this was checked as she had a femoral line placed for her septic shock.
Her hgb has remained stable for the past 2 days, her Hgb decrease may have been dilutional secondary to her fluid resuscitation.
# Altered Mental Status: Patient had altered mental status initially in ED likely from hypoperfusion and acute illness.
She was fully orientated following stabilization of her pressures.
# Hypercholesterolemia Patient was continued on statin.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 685**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septic Shock Multifocal Pneumonia  Secondary: Anaemia requiring blood transfusion Acute Kidney Injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you had become weak after being so sick you were recommended to [**Hospital 5511**] rehab.
You were also noted to have diarrhea which we think may be related to your antibiotics.
