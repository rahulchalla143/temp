Admission Date:  [**2189-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-1-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**] Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation central venous line placement   History of Present Illness: 68yoM, nursing home resident, w/ pmh sig for Alzheimer's dementia and hydrocephalus s/p shunt who was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from the NH today because of five days of diarrhea, one day of vomitting, and increased confusion/agitation.
Found to have partial SBO, aspiration pneumonia, now with blood cultures positive for GPC.
On CTX/azithro/vanco/Flagyl There have been no recent fevers or chills, sob.
He has had a dry cough today.
There has been no blood in diarrhea or melena.
Neurosurg evaluated pt and noted milf increase in ventricular size, but felt that shunt malfuntion or infection was unlikely.
In addition, the surgical team evaluated the patient out of concern for partial sbo given vomitting and ct abd with ?
Per surgical note, pt has likely partial sbo or ileus.
In the ED patient had a fever to 103, leukocytosis, no other abnl vital signs, lactate > 2.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's dementia, Bipolar disorder, PVD, DM2, Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt (son says it was placed 3-5 years ago at [**Hospital3 **] with no revisions, unknown cause of hydrocephalus), H/o subdural hemorrhages (unknown if before or after shunt placed), Hearing loss with hearing aids, Cataracts, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia, SIADH with fluid restriction of 1L per day.
NG in place with bilious output.
HEENT:  No conjunctivitis or discharge, mucous membranes moist and pink, neck supple, no LAD.
CV:  Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs Pulm: Mild wheeze, decreased bs b/l, transmitted upper airway sounds.
Bilateral airspace disease reflecting evolving pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
CXR: Interval removal of nasogastric tube.
Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia and asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Air-filled dilated loops of small bowel, with collapsed distal loops, suggesting partial small bowel obstruction.
No free air or free intraabdominal fluid is identified.
Confluent consolidative opacities in the right middle and lower lobes.
Differential includes pneumonia versus aspiration.
Compared to previous study dated [**2187-3-6**], the ventricles appear slightly more dilated and therefore recommend evaluation to rule out shunt malfunction .
Interval resolution of right subdural collection.
No aspiration was seen throughout this examination.
Bolus formation with swallow initiation were appropriate with no premature spillover or retention.
No penetration or aspiration occurred.
No acute intracranial abnormality including no sign of hemorrhage.
Resolved partial obstruction of small bowel.
No free air or free intra- abdominal fluid is noted.
Resolving right middle and lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration.
Diffusely mild thickened bladder wall.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2187-3-6**], the pericardial effusion has resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) HTN: Had severely elevated BP while in house even >200/100 at times.
He also complained of chest pain and headache at times with this, so he was started on long acting medications due to him refusing meds at times.
3) Diastolic CHF: Had slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, but no ECG changes.
TnT peaked at 0.24, although MB fraction negative: likely demand ischemia in the setting of HTN.
TTE showed preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities.
7) Diarrhea: C. diff (-) X 3, no diarrhea.
8) Aspiration PNA: developed sudden respiratory arrest while eating dinner.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Partial Small Bowel Obstruction aspiration Pneumonia Severe Hypertension Diastolic CHF CAD Alzheimer's dementia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please continue meds as listed.
