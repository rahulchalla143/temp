His renal failure was felt to be due to post-obstructive vs. ATN.
His foley was changed to a #20 in the ED and he had large amounts of urine output.
His mental status decline was likely due to uremia and hepatic encephalopathy and improved with lactulose.
He had large amounts of stool output.
ID, vascular surgery and podiatry were consulted for management of his right heel which was the only possible source of his sepsis.
He had a CT of his abdomen due to abdominal distension which showed stool in the colon.
He was given small doses of Dilaudid for pain which was changed to Percocet when he was able to eat.
On the floor: # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to acute renal failure.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely related ot hypotensive episode causing ATN.
No hydronephrosis on ultrasound.
Patient had elevated CKs but not high enough to be considered rhabdo.
# Hypotension: [**Month (only) 116**] be hypovolemia vs. sepsis.
Cultures in the past were positive for MRSA and patient was on cipro/clinda at rehab.
blood pressure becomes unable to control, would consider calcium channel blocker or beta blocker.
# Mental Status Changes: Differential diagnosis includes uremia from acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, toxins, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, sepsis.
The patient had a hypoglycemic event at rehab which seemed to trigger the mental status changes, unclear if this ever resolved.
Treating patietns renal failure, as above, caused the patients symptoms to improve.
We held the mirtazapine & melatonin, and attempted to wean oxycodone and other pain medications.
# Pt has HCV infection, but no prior evidence of ascites.
was initially treated as having cirrhosis, but there is no fibrosis evident on exam or imaging.
We did not administer Lantus or Metformin.
Per vasc, pt was poor flow distal to the ankle.
