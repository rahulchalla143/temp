Admission Date:  [**2190-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-9-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-1-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Fistulogram and failed thrombectomy IJ dialysis catheter Tunnelled dialysis catheter   History of Present Illness: 82 yo M with history of CAD s/p NSTEMI, ESRD on HD, DM2, HTN, HL, Hep C, presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath.
He put out small amounts of urine to the lasix.
Patient was also noted to be hypertensive and was given metoprolol 25 mg PO and 5 mg IV, but without much response from his blood pressure.
Initial EKG in the ED showed ST elevations and there was concern for STEMI.
- NSTEMI in [**2183**].
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Hepatitis C virus - Glaucoma - Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet-controlled.
- Chronic renal insufficiency, now on hemodialysis; stage IV CKD secondary to hypertension and FSGS - Status post nephrectomy right-sided for suspected cancer, pathology benign.
- Status post hernia repair.
Lying in bed during dialysis HEENT: supple, no JVD at 20 degrees.
CV: RRR, II/VI holosystolic murmur,  no thrills.
No S3-4 RESP: CTAB, no audible wheezes.
ABD: flat, NT, hypoactive BS, no tenderness.
EXTR: tunneled line c/d/i, papule in sacral area, no erythema, no open wound, no drainage noted.
No penile lesions noted.
Borderline resting sinus tachycardia at a rate of about 100 beats per minute.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Slow R wave progression with possible underlying anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
CXR [**8-29**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are bibasilar hazy opacities, compatible with increased interstitial edema, atelectasis and pleural effusions.
There is minimal pulmonary vascular prominence.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-4-27**], minimal aortic valve stenosis is now present.
Biventricular systolic function remains preserved.
IR thrombectomy: IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of a left upper extremity AV graft with recurrent stenosis at the venous anastomosis of the graft.
Flow could be restored temporarily, but rethrombosis occured twice, despite mechanical thrombectomy, chemical thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, [**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy and stenting of the venous anastomosis.
Cardiac Cath [**9-2**]: COMMENTS: 1) Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates three vessel coronary artery disease.
The circumflex artery had a 70% ostial lesion.
The first obtuse  marginal bifurcated, and one of these branches was totally occluded with a lesion believed to be the culprit lesion.
2) Hemodynamics measurements demonstrate normal cardiac output, and biventricular filling pressures.
Recommend secondary prevention of CAD including plavix 75mg daily for 6 months, and medical management of the patient's ACS.
Unsuccessful vascular closure with Mynx  Tunneled Cath pending   Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with history of CAD s/p NSTEMI, ESRD on HD, DM2, HTN, HL, presents with shortness of breath due to volume overload  #Shortness of breath/volume overload: Likely due to ESRD with insufficient volume removal on HD.
His fistula for dialysis was found to be clotted so an IR fistulogram and thromectomy was attempted but failed with immediate reclotting so an IJ temporary dialysis catheter was placed with plan for tunneled catheter in 2 days.
# CAD: patient has history of CAD with NSTEMI in [**2183**] requiring DES to mid LAD.
Troponin on admission was slightly elevated at 0.06 but in setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
Ekg from [**2190-8-31**] 0800 showed marked T wave inversions in precordial leads, concerning for anteroseptal MI, different from prior EKGs.
ECHO was completed showing no wall motion abnormality and preserved LVEF.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which showed a distal lesion in his OM that was unable to be intervened upon due to the vessel being too small.
# HTN - elevated BP on admission, was given metoprolol in the ED without much effect, but also in setting of volume overload.
# ESRD - history of right nephrectomy for suspected malignancy, but found to be benign pathology.
ESRD thought to be secondary to HTN and FSGS, is currently on HD qMWF at home.
# Herpes - The patient had a lesion on his buttocks that was felt to be a herpes lesion.

You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were found to be volume overloaded and you were treated with diuretics and dialysis.
There were some EKG changes seen that were concerning for a blockage in one of your heart arteries.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed a small blockage in one of the arteries that supply the heart.
You may take one more day of pyridium to treat burning in your bladder and penis.
