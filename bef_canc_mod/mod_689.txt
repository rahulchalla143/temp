Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypertension: Patient has history of extremely labile hypertension on an aggressive outpatient regimen.
Her hydralazine was increased from 75mg to 100mg TID with mild improvement.
Her blood pressure also seemed to improve when her pain decreased and was normal in the middle of the night.
2) Abdominal pain: CT scan showed increasing ascites, but no acute pathology.
Due to the proximal location of her old venous thrombi, she was started on a heparin gtt.
4) Anxiety: Patient noted feeling short of breath and anxious around the time of her recent admissions.
Her nephrologist felt this may be contributing to her recurrent pain and hypertension, so psychiatry was consulted.
They felt her symptoms were suggestive of anxiety and panic attacks, recommended checking TSH and metanephrines as above, and starting citalopram 20mg, which was done.
She was advised on breathing exercises, which seemed to have benefit, and given lorazepam 1mg q8h PRN.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
