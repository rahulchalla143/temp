The patient had complications of pancreatitis, duodenal stump leak and stricture.
Postoperatively the patient developed difficulty in eating secondary to post prandial nausea and vomiting and dumping syndrome as well as cholangitis.
Computerized tomography scan and upper gastrointestinal series showed BSBO, a long distal roux limb or a jejunostomy.
On [**2153-2-8**] exploratory laparotomy was done and lysis of adhesions with small bowel resection and jejunostomy and lymph node biopsy.
In [**2153-2-10**] the patient had continued nausea and vomiting and upper gastrointestinal series revealed persistent dilatation of the proximal jejunojejunostomy between the pancreatic limb site.
At that time, he underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection times three, redo jejunojejunostomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history of obesity, malnutrition, status post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass revision in [**2152-12-10**], history of pancreatitis, history of status post jejunojejunostomy, status post multiple small bowel resections for small bowel resection revisions, jejunostomy and gastroesophageal reflux disease, right Porta-cath.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No smoking, no alcohol, no intravenous drug abuse.
Generally, the patient was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen, soft, nondistended, mildly tender right upper quadrant, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities were without edema and pulses 2+.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed air leak, pneumobiliary in left lobe adjacent to the portal vein and without free fluid.
He was admitted to Surgery Intensive Care Unit for short gut and dumping syndrome, recurrent cholangitis.
After a while in the Surgery Intensive Care Unit magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was used to rule out stricture and HIDA scan to evaluate biliary system.
HIDA scan was planned for rule out functional obstruction.
[**Hospital1 **] also followed the patient for sugar control.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography result showed no obvious stricture or ductal dilatation.
Ultimately the patient had no evidence of infection, no evidence of leak.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cholangitis status post percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography placement  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
FOLLOW UP:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and to continue total parenteral nutrition and Vancomycin at home, Ciprofloxacin to be started instead of Zosyn and return to the hospital should the patient experience any more rigors, fevers or abdominal pain.
