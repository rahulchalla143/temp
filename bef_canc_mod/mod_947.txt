The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen (good-quality study).
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
RADIOLOGY: CXR ([**4-6**]) - preop: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Low volumes with right basilar atelectasis.
Left lower lobe opacity increased, could be due to atelectasis.
Right basilar opacity is unchanged, likely atelectasis.
There is no other change.
CXR ([**4-26**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], allowing for differences in technique, there is little interval change.
Low lung volumes persist.
Retrocardiac opacification is again seen as well as a probable small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Quantified pleural effusions.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are greater on the left side.
There is mild fluid overload.
There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis greater on the left side have worsened.
LENI ([**2168-5-11**]):  No left lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis awaiting liver transplant, HCC status-post RFA, originally admitted on [**2168-4-6**] for umbilical hernia repair in the setting of ascites leakage, transferred to the hepatorenal medicine service for management post-surgery, with prolonged hospital course c/b MRSA peritonitis leading to sepsis, s/p MICU stay, ATN s/p temporary hemodialysis, as well as ?
ESLD:  Patient has HepC/HCC cirrhosis with multiple complications in the past.
Admitted for umbilical hernia repair because of ascites leakage through hernia ([**2168-4-7**]), subsequently transferred to medicine.
Pt then developed fulminant MRSA peritonitis (ascites fluid PMN > 6000 on diagnostic paracentesis, fluid cx growing MRSA) with leukocytosis to 19.4, worsening renal failure and hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.
Zosyn switched to ciprofloxacin at first, then restarted for a 7-day course ([**Date range (1) 75692**]) for a possible HAP, given low-grade fevers and ?
Last therapeutic paracentesis was on [**2168-5-10**] with 4.5L removed; no evidence of SBP.
Acute renal failure:  Baseline creatinine 1.4, currently at 1.1.
He developed oliguric ARF in the setting of hypotension from large-volume paracentesis and sepsis.
Likely ATN [**2-15**] hypotension and poor flow, +/- HRS.
Hyponatremia:  Possibly a component of pseudohyponatremia from high blood sugars.
Diabetes mellitus type II:  Prior to admission he was diet-controlled, however, with infection he became difficult to control and started on insulin drip in the setting of infection.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA peritonitis Decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis End-stage liver disease, awaiting liver transplant Refractory ascites Diabetes mellitus, type II  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
Mentating well; no evidence of encephalopathy.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with ascites fluid leakage from your umbilical hernia.
The hernia was repaired successfully; however, you developed a serious abdominal infection (MRSA peritonitis), for which you had to be treated in the intensive care unit.
If you have fevers, chills, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or any other concerning symptoms, please call your physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
