ECG [**2104-2-24**]: AF with a rapid rate, extensive non-specific ST and T changes, cannot rule out ischemia .
Precordial ST-T wav abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be less prominent but persistent.
Moderate LA enlargement 4.
No AS/AI 6.
Right atrial enlargement.
Mild RV enlargement.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery pressure equals 70mmHg plus the CVP indicating severe pulmonary hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with unusually small left ventricular cavity and hyperdynamic systolic function.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Most valves were not well-visualized due to poor image quality and tachycardia.
Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower, which may be due to technical differences rather than true change in pulmonary artery pressure.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets.
Mild MVP.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-9-7**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased.
CXR [**2102-2-23**] FINDINGS: There is a somewhat heterogeneous but generally diffuse mild interstitial abnormality suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.
One of two views shows a slightly more confluent right upper lobe opacity of uncertain significance, quite vague, and there is also focal left infrahilar opacity.
There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
More focal patchy right upper lobe and left infrahilar opacities of uncertain significance but possibly due to coinciding atelectasis or scarring.
If developing infection is a clinical consideration then short-term followup radiographs could be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: # Atrial fibrillation: new onset, pt has no history of Afib, was on tele at rehab and flipped into afib @2:44pm [**2102-2-23**].
Etiology likely multifactorial in setting of hypoxia, CHF exacerbation and PNA.
Has been on heparin TID at rehab making PE less likely, however it was considered in setting of new atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, hypoxia and evidence of right sided overload on ECHO with preserved LV function.
Pt has had multiple GI bleeds in the past and history of CVA so it was felt appropriate to DC anticoagulation.
#hypoxia - pt uses oxygen at the rehab facility.
Initially was hypoxic and required facetent and nasal cannula to maintain saturation.
Occasionally during sleep he continued to desaturate but it was felt that this was secondary to positioning abnormalities.
Also has component of chronic aspiration, see pneumonia below.
# CAD: s/p reported NSTEMI on [**2-10**] in setting of demand but no clear documentation of this.
Has past history of MI as well.
EKG on presentation with ST depressions in the anterolateral leads and TWI in the inferior leads, resolved with slowing of the rapid rate.
Given his history of GI bleed plavix was also held.
#congestive heart failure: TTE [**2102-2-23**] showed increased mitral and tricuspid regurg, see results section above.
This decompensation most likely secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Pt was aggressively diuresed with resolution of volume overload.
# Hypoglycemia/DM2: on presentation tube feeds had been stopped and pt had repeated FS in the 40s, 50s.
# possible PNA: vanc and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] had been started at rehab [**2102-2-22**] for possible pneumonia as pt was short of breath.
It was felt that this pt did not have pna given lack of cough, fever, or chest xr findings of infiltrate, however he completed a 7 day course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].
However, white count was slightly elevated on presentation with somewhat of a left shift.
There was significant concern for aspiration pneumonitis as pt is a known aspiration risk.
#hypernatremia - pt presented with hypernatremia which improved with stabilization of fluid status.
Was likely secondary to dehydration Free water deficit was calculated and repleted with resolution of hypernatremia.
# Dementia/Psych: hx of severe dementia, is incontinent of bowel/bladder at baseline and dependent of all ADLs.
# HTN: relative hypotension initially here in setting of CHF exacerbation and atrial fibrillation.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - we DCd home isordil, amlodipine, and hydralazine as pt was hypotensive on admission.
- KEEP HEAD OF BED at 30 degrees - pt with history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
4. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) vial Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for dyspnea, wheeze.
5. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) vial Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for dyspnea, wheeze.
