He denies any loss of consciousness during the fall and was able to get back into the chair.
He began to develop worsening pain in his right leg several hours later, and presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital for evaluation where a CT scan demonstrated a right intratrochanteric fracture.
During positioning on the OR table on [**9-22**] he had NSVT for ~3 beats (no strip available), followed by monomorphic sustained VT with hypotension (SBP of ~40) during preparation of the operation site.
An echocardiogram showed new posterior and inferior wall abnormalities compared to a previous echo ([**2131-2-13**]), with a LEVF of 40-50%.
EKG did not show any evidence of new infarct.
He was cleared for surgery the following day when no new arrhythmias developed.
Per OMR and patient, his weakness was diffuse in both the upper and lower extremities, but was most prominent in his deltoids bilaterally (1+/5 L deltoid strength, 0/5 R deltoid strength).
Neurosurgery was consulted, and noted subjective and objective improvement in muscular strength compared to previous neurological exam, but with persistent diffuse weakness.
He was placed in a C-spine collar and received CT C-spine per neurosurgery recommendations which showed substantial narrowing of spinal canal which could represent old stenosis but would be potentially worrisome for acute cord impingement.

General: Very pleasant man, appeared stated age in no apparent distress.
HEENT: Thyromegaly and lymphadenopathy could not be assessed due to C-spine collar.
Grade III/VI systolic murmur heard best at right sternal border at 2nd intercostal space.
Abdomen: Large midline scars from sternotomy and AAA repair visible.
1+ pitting edema in LE bilaterally.
Several bandages (including on right deltoid and left forearm) covering ruptured blisters from bullous pemphigoid, several other lesions visible.
Mild facial asymmetry (lip droop) which patient states he has had since a child.
Diffuse weakness present throughout, especially in UE extensors and IPs.

Faint lucency at the right hip suggesting intertrochanteric fracture.
Extensive degenerative change.
Atherosclerotic disease.
CT head/c-spine ([**2132-9-23**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
A bone fragment in the posterolateral canal on the right at T2 is likely chronic in etiology, although not unambiguously characterized in this study.
Florid degenerative changes predispose this patient to spinal cord trauma with minor injury.
Recommend MR for further evaluation.
MRI C/spine w/o Contrast ([**2132-9-25**]):  Provisional Findings Impression: BLjb FRI [**2132-9-26**] 9:37 AM Similar, though slightly progressive multilevel degenerative changes demonstrate ongoing multilevel cord compression with abnormal cord signal within the mid cervical spine as well as moderate-to-severe multilevel bilateral foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hip fracture - patient intially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital where a right two-part intratrochanteric fracture was demonstrated by CT on [**9-22**], and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ORIF.
# Pulseless VT - occurred in OR; likely in the setting of being immediately post-HD and anesthesia induction.
The patient had PVCs but no other signs of ectopic activity or abnormal rhythms during his time in the unit, nor after transfer to the medicine floor.
# Neurologic weakness - The patient experienced transient weakness of his upper extremities, including his deltoids bilaterally immediately post-operatively after extubation.
Given his h/o severe cervical stenosis and recent h/o intubation/extubation, Ortho/NSGY were consulted.
The CT c-spine showed known severe spinal foraminal narrowing but no clear evidence of acute injury, with MRI showing no bone edema, no ligamentous damage, but substantial degenerative changes worsened mildly since previous MRI ([**2130-12-1**]).
Over several hours post-operatively the patient had slow but spontaneous improvement of symptoms and returned to his baseline strength (per his report).
# CAD - Continued ASA, BB, statin.
# ESRD - Patient received hemodyalsis at [**Hospital1 18**] on Wednesday and Friday.
Hemodynamically stable throughout stay except for mild hypotension post dialysis that responded well to fluids.
# Supratherapeutic INR - pt was on coumadin 2 mg daily post-operative per ortho; however, after 2 doses, INR climbed to 8.6.
