Admission Date:  [**2198-9-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-10-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Trazodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: Skull Defect - s/p craniectomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cranioplasty placement of external ventricular drain   History of Present Illness: This is a 52 year old male who presents to clinic today for admission for an elective cranioplasty tomorrow.
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 67736**] has a history of a recurrent hemangiopericytoma s/p resection that was complicated by a bone flap infection and tumor recurrence.
The patient now presents for discussion of definitive cranioplasty.
He He remains at his baseline neurological functioning, and has no new symptoms or concerns to address.
He denies any recent fevers, vision changes, new headaches, motor or sensory changes.
Language: Significant expressive aphasia Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm bilaterally.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact l side, numbness to R side.
L side full.
Status post cranioplasty of the left frontoparietal region with postoperative changes of air and fluid level in the region.
New hemorrhagic  foci in the brain with one in the right caudate region extending to the lateral ventricles.
Subarachnoid blood in the posterior fossa and cerebellar hemorrhage together produce obliteration of the fourth ventricle and quadrigeminal cistern indicating posterior fossa edema.
Mild new dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] indicate developing hydrocephalus.
Little overall change in multiple foci of intracranial hemorrhage including extensive parenchymal, intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior fossa edema.
Unchanged mass effect on the fourth ventricle and quadrigeminal cistern and asymmetric enlargement of the left lateral ventricle relative to the right, suggestive of developing but stable hydrocephalus.
[**9-22**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic mass.
Postoperative changes with cranioplasty as seen on the recent CT examination.
Multiple areas of hemorrhage in the supra- and infratentorial region with extension into the ventricle.
Most of these areas demonstrate no definite nodular enhancement except for subtle enhancement in the right basal ganglia and left cerebellar region.
The finding is not typical for metastatic disease, but it is unclear if due to hemorrhage, the enhancement is not well visualized.
No acute infarct is seen.
Overall, minimal change from the most recent comparison study with redemonstration of multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage as well as intraventricular and extra-axial hemorrhage.
While the overall volume of blood appears similar to that seen previously, as does the size and configuration of the ventricles, with marked asymmetric dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, perhaps reflecting hydrocephalus superimposed on ex vacuo effect.
Gas and fluid-containing subgaleal collection, also appears minimally changed over the interval.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of the ventricles with asymmetric dilation of the left lateral ventricle.
Stable size of fluid-containing subgaleal collection with decreased amount of gas over the interval from [**2198-9-26**]  MRI Head [**10-9**]  Postoperative changes with cranioplasty in the left frontoparietal lobe are largely unchanged.
Further evolution of the extra-axial collections and right basal ganglia and left temporo-parietal hemorrhage.
No new sites of intracranial hemorrhage or slow diffusion are seen.
He was seen and cleared by anesthesia for general anesthesia.
He was placed on vancomycin upon admission for surgical prophylaxis, and an ID consult was obtained for specific guidelines for post operative antimicrobial management.
He was taken to the operating room on [**9-21**] for cranioplasty and repair of cranial defect.
[**9-21**]- Pt taken to OR for cranioplasty and repair of cranial defect.
Pt was taken to CT from the OR and it showed multiple metastatic lesions had hemorrhaged and there was interventricular extension.
He had minimal movement in RUE which was consistent with his pre-operative exam.
There was a question of CSF in the JP drain as his EVD was noted to be putting out only 15cc for a 24 hour period.
He had no episodes of increased ICP and they ranged from 0-3.
His exam did improve and was following commands with his left side and was more awake.
[**9-25**]- CT head showed slight interval decrease in subgaleal fluid collection and his JP drain was removed by the plastic surgery team without difficulty.
9/8-9 No elevated ICP at 5cm above tragus and EVD raised to 10cm above tragus on [**9-27**].
In the evening he had decreased O2 sats and suction at bedside showed he was aspirating his tube feeds and they were held.
On [**9-30**] the patient had one episode of fever and respiratory status did not seem to improve.
CXR showed no new infiltrate or fluid overload.
This study was negative and consistent with pneumonia.
His O2 saturations did improve and had no further episodes of decreased sats.
On [**10-10**], MRI was obtained to evaluate metastatic lesion and revealed no evidence of tumor progresison.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed  Followup Instructions: Follow-Up Appointment Instructions  ?????
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
Please follow up with the Plastic surgery team on [**10-19**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 3:15 for a wound check.
Until this time please continue with light kerlex wrap of the head and change daily.
