CT scan ([**2105-3-15**]) demonstrated some minimal wall thickening of deep loops of small bowel.
GI was consulted and felt that the patient's history was most consistent with partial SBO.
A small-bowel follow-through demonstrated a slightly thickened, irregular, aperistaltic loop of small bowel in the distal pelvis but no evidence of obstruction.
Her last CT in [**Month (only) **] showed an obstruction at a deflection point in the left lower quadrant.
She now returns with similar symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since day prior to admission and again is found to have a partial SBO on CT. She has not had a BM in 10 days.
She complains of pain worse in RLQ.
No melena or hematochezia.
No hematemesis.

MRI was notable for a 4.0 x 4.3 x 7.2 cm heterogeneous cystic and solid pelvic mass anterior to the bladder.
Biopsy was consistent with poorly differentiated malignancy.
MRI on [**2104-12-18**] was notable for interval decrease in size of the soft tissue density immediately adjacent to and posterior to the pubic symphysis, compatible with scar and no evidence of disease recurrence  elsewhere in the pelvis.
2) Cerebrovascular accident x 2 (cerebellar) 3) Anemia: B12 deficient 4) Asthma 5) Hypertension 6) Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy  Social History: She is from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 43251**] was admitted to the hospital on [**6-1**] for partial small bowel obstruction.
She treated with a nasogastric tube, IV fluids, nothing by mouth, and pain control.
On POD#1 she had an episode of hypotension and responded well to fluid boluses only transiently so was transferred to the ICU.
Again on [**6-13**] the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy to r/o anastomotic leak/peritonitis.
No leaks or peritonitis was found on laparotomy.
One episode of tachycardia was responsive to fluid bolus, otherwise the patient was hemodynamically stable the remainder of the hospitalization.
She was evaluated for confusion and serial neuro exams showed no focal or cognitive deficits below baseline.
Pain was controlled on oral pain meds.
