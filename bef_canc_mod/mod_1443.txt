There was no maternal fever or fetal tachycardia.
He required CPAP via Neopuff for increased work of breathing.
Abdominal exam significant for significant abdominal distention with hypoactive bowel sounds and a left hydrocele with concomitant left inguinal hernia.
Left inguinal hernia as noted above.
[**Doctor First Name **] was started on caffeine citrate on day of life 2 for apnea of prematurity.
A murmur was noted on day of life 24 and an echo was performed on day of life 28 to rule out a patent ductus arteriosus.
