Admission Date:  [**2160-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-5-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with transfusion-dependent anemia attributed to autoimmune hemolysis & chronic GI bleeding on coumadin for a mechanical aortic valve admitted with Hct drop and shortness of breath.
Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**] has been hospitalized frequently at [**Hospital1 18**], most recently in late [**2160-4-1**] with recurrent anemia attributed to GIB without hemolysis (negative Coombs test and normal LDH.)
Of note those previous hospitalizations have identified component of autimmune hemolysis.
He complained of shortness of breath at rest and mild chest pressure.
He was not given blood b/c his extensive cross-matching requirements have not yet been completed.
No imaging obtained.
Guiaic positive brown stool.
Of note, the patient has had extensive workup in the past for GI bleed(EGD x4, [**Last Name (un) **] x2, capsule x3, CT abd/pelvis, bleeding scan) without clear source or site, and felt to be most likely bleeding from an UGI source that is not possible to reach endoscopically.
On the floor, the patient denies any recent BRBPR, melena or hematemesis.
He denies any dizziness or confusion either at the moment or over the last few days.
He denies any chest pain but does have some shortness of breath over his baseline.

No evidence of edema.
Small left-sided pleural effusion remains unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin and recurrent GIB and admissions for anemia presenting from rehab with anemia.
Anemia: Most likely related to recurrent ongoing GIB given recent hx of the same; of note, he had not had any large bowel movements to explain this bleed on admission to the ICU.
Other possible etiologies of his HCT drop are recurrent autoimmune or mechanical hemolysis, but this seems unlikely with LDH and bilirubin nl range.
This is likely the etiology of his elevated MCV and RDW.
# Dyspnea: Patient presented with dyspnea that was likely secondary to anemia.
There was no concern for ACS given nl EKG and No concern for PNA clinically or on CXR.
# Mechanical Aortic valve: The patient has a goal INR of [**3-5**].5.
# Acute on CKD: Cr currently at baseline (1.2-1.5) .
Held carvedilol in  setting of GIB and stable blood pressures during admission but resumed home dose of medications prior to discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia, secondary to chronic GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with a hematocrit drop at rehab.
