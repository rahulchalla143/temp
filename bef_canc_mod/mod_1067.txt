During this time he only noted mild cramping in the abdomen.
Denied any abdominal pain prior to this bleed.
On [**7-21**] underwent a colonoscopy showing a site of active diverticular bleeding estimated at 45cm.
No other active sites were identified to the level of the cecum.
5 clips were placed at the site of diverticular bleeding and epinephrine was injected.
Reportedly, pt also had a bleeding scan which was negative however I have not seen this report.
CXR with concern for worsening left lung opacity and right hilar opacity.
Patient was started on Clindamycin, zosyn sp colonoscopy with concern for aspiration event.

Left atrial abnormality.
Occasional atrial ectopy.
Downsloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion in leads I and aVL.
Biphasic to inverted T waves in leads V2-V6 with slight Q-T interval prolongation.
Non-specific ST-T wave flattening in the inferior leads.
These findings are consistent with active anterolateral ischmeic process.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Assess also for volume overload.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
Very large left lung consolidation could be due to aspiration/pneumonia.
Left pleural effusion is small.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
[**7-28**] HISTORY: 78-year-old male with COPD, CAD, presenting with GI bleeding, now with aspiration versus hospital-acquired pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: The heart size remains mildly enlarged, but there is no evidence for new pulmonary edema.
Large consolidation in the left lung, now predominantly lingular and lower lobe, is only subtly improved from one day prior but is again noted to be substantially improved, especially in the left upper lung, compared to [**2188-7-22**] and [**2188-7-23**].
There is mild opacity remaining in the right lower lobe.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is probable small unchanged left pleural effusion.
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine, as well as vascular  calcifications and cholecystectomy clips.
IMPRESSIONS: Left lung consolidation subtly improved from 1 day prior, but substantially improved since [**2188-7-22**].
There may be variation in precordial lead placement.
However, the Q wave before the transition remains and the ischemic appearing T wave abnormalities previously recorded have resolved.
Rule out interim myocardial injury.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 80 98 104 404/439 18 -21 80    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 87434**] is a 78 yo man with a PMH of DM, HTN, HLD, and prior diverticular bleed who presented to [**Hospital3 12594**] on [**7-19**] complaining of bright red blood per rectum.
Colonoscopy there revealed bleeding diverticulum and 5 clips and epinephrine were applied with control of bleeding.
#Diverticular bleed- His bleeding was likely related to the bleeding diverticulum identified on colonoscopy.
The EGD did not reveal bleeding from above.
Aspiration Pneumonia vs. Pneumonitis: His aspiration event with subsequent fever is most likely attributable to aspiration pneumonitis given the history and documented desat.
His chest X rays also improved though he still had a  opacity of the right lower lobe still present on CXR [**7-28**].
Kept all medications the same except for discontinuing HCTZ and starting chlorthalidone on the first day after discharge.
GERD/Barretts: EGD at [**Location (un) **] without evidence of upper origin for bleeding.
# Tachycardia-Transient SVT: Noted in MICU for seconds and on [**7-27**] lasting approx 2 min which was associated with ambulation, diaphoresis and palpitations.
During this episode his vitals remained stable and he only complained of palpitations.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diverticular bleed Aspiration Pneumonia Superventricular tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were brought to the hospital because of bleeding from your colon and a pneumonia which you developed while at another hospital.
The bleeding was treated at the other hospital with diverticular clipping.
During this admission you experienced no further bleeding and were treated with antibiotics for your pneumonia.
We made the following changes to your home medications list: Increased Lisinopril from 20 to 40mg Stopped hydrochlorthiazide.
Started chlorthalidone for high blood pressure.
