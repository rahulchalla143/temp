It would be important to simply his pain and anxiety medication regimen.
Although there was concern for an intracranial bleed at OSH, CT head here was negative.
Polypharmacy in the setting of numerous sedating medications vs. infection was determined to be the most likely etiology of AMS.

You were started on an antibiotic for your urinary tract infection and your blood pressures improved.
