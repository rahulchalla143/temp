History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with a history of high grade invasive transitional call carcinoma of the bladder s/p lap cystectomy and neobladder formation [**2-24**] and multiple complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia presenting for elective bilateral ureteral stent change.
He has had bilateral nephrostomy placements in the past few months for obstructive pyelonephritis and sepsis.
He has also undergone ureteral balloon dilation by interventional radiology.
Past Medical History: 1. h/o MI - 17 yrs ago, treated at [**Hospital **] Hospital, per patient treated with a "clot busting medication" (possibly tPA), hospitalized x 6 days and discharged.
Has recurrences of AF/RVR during last hospitalization.
3.High-grade invasive transitional cell carcinoma 4.Osteoarthritis of ankles 5.C.
Gastritis/duodenitis 8.Left Percutaneous nephrostomy tube for presumed obstructive uropathy.
9.Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube, emergent, for obstructed pyelonephritis.
ICU course was significant for:  # SEPSIS Mr. [**Known lastname 53270**] was admitted to the ICU in septic shock after bilateral ureteral stent change.
He had an elevated lactate, rising white blood cell count, fevers and hypotension not responsive to fluids.
He has a history of chronic infection in the GU tract, in addition to VRE colonization.
He has been admitted for severe sepsis after GU procedures on multiple occasions since his neobladder surgery in [**Month (only) 956**].
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient presented to the ICU from the PACU with heart rates in the 130s-150s, which appeared consistent with prior post-op course and contributing to his hypotension.
An Echo showed that his left atrium is mildly dilated, and there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
He has some mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Mr. [**Known lastname 53270**] was in rapidly worsening acute renal failure post-operatively with oliguria and hyperkalemia, most likely from Acute Tubular Necrosis secondary to hypotension.
A renal ultrasound showed no concern for obstructive post-renal etiology.
# DIARRHEA The patient presented with stool incontinence.
Due to history of severe C. difficile infection, he was treated empirically with metronidazole and per oral vancomycin.
