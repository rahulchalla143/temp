She had no further episodes of hematochezia.
Then, 2 days prior to admission, after eating lunch (soup, crackers, cheese) she developed N/V with over 30-40 episodes of non-bloody, bilious emesis.
Then, on day of admission, she had LLQ crampy abd pain ([**6-24**]) and had 1 marroon BM.
CT abd revealed a soft tissue mass at root of mesentery and duodenum dilated before narrow 3rd portion with wall thickening.
She was seen by surgery for obstruction and ?
new soft tissue mass below duodenum.
She had no EKG changes.
She denied any further bloody/tarry BM, no further N/V or abd pain.

Moving all extremities  Pertinent Results: ***** [**2188-5-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS: FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lungs are unremarkable and there is no pleural effusion or mass.
There is right atrial cardiac enlargement.
In the abdomen, in the liver, there is unchanged pneumobilia and small hepatic hypodensities, likely cysts.
Again seen are splenic and hepatic calcifications consistent with granulomas.
Immediately inferior to the duodenum and contigous with it is a retroperitoneal soft tissue mass measuring 2.5 x 3.6 cm.
There is no free air or abdominal free fluid, but the vasculature is prominent in the mesentery and there are multiple shotty mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes.
Pelvic loops of bowel do not contain much oral contrast and evaluation is limited; however, there is apparent wall thickening of the rectum and sigmoid.
There is no pelvic pathologic lymphadenopathy and no free air.
There is severe sclerosis of the SI joints bilaterally and a right femoral head screw.
Dilatation of the stomach and proximal duodenum with a marked caliber change with wall thickening at the third portion of the duodenum.
Interval enlargement of retroperitoneal soft tissue mass just inferior and contigous to this abnormal portion of the duodenum, and the soft tissue mass affecting the adjacent dudoenum is likely.
The origin of this soft tissue mass could represent fibrosing mesteritis, metastasis or carcinoid.
Apparent rectal and sigmoidal bowel wall thickening which may relate to prior radiation treatment for cervical cancer or an acute colitis.
Evaluation of the bowel is limited by decompression and lack of oral contrast; consider direct visualization.
Stable appearance of pneumobilia and compression fractures of the lumbar spine.
Limited views of the esophagus and stomach demonstrate normal filling and emptying without gross abnormalities.
Linear opacity overlying the mid portion of a vertebral body in the expected location the third portion of the duodenum was seen under fluoroscopic evaluation to be associated with the vertebral body rather than the overlying bowel.
IMPRESSION: Obstructing mass in the third portion of the duodenum.
Differential diagnosis for the mass include carcinoid or sclerosing mesenteritis.
Adenocarcinoma of the duodenum seems less likely  ***** [**6-2**] PMIBI: The image quality is adequate.
Stress images demonstrate a mild defect in the inferior wall which shows partial reversibility on the rest images  Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
IMPRESSION: Partially reversible mild inferior wall defect.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4427**] was admitted to the medical service on [**2188-5-24**] for chief complaint of maroon colored stool, nausea, and vomiting.
A CT scan in the ED revealed a soft tissue mass in the root of the mesentery near the duodenum, 3-4 cm in size, with narrowingg of the 3rd portion of the duodenum.
This revealed just mild gastritis, with no stigmata of bleeding or lesions, and the initial report was the the scope was passed to the jejunum without difficulty.
This was followed by a SBFT, which confirmed an obstructing mass in the 3rd portion of the duodenum, with delayed passage of contrast only after 15 minutes.
On [**5-27**] she had a brief episode of rapid Afib, which was treated successfully with IV lopressor.
Her cardiac treatment was complicated by occasional episodes of bradycardia with increasing doses of lopressor.
She had an endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy of the paraduodenal mass on [**2188-5-30**], the results of which were still pending at the time of this summary.
She underwent a PMIBI on [**6-2**] which revealed a partially reversible inferior wall defect with EF of 64%.
