Without IV contrast, we cannot assess for active bleeding/extravasation.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74 y/o M w h/o CAD (s/p CABG), aortic regurg (s/p mechanical valve replacement), chronic combined systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 45%) [**1-24**] ischemic CMP s/p ICD placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who originally presented w fall and was diagnosed with R hip fracture.
He was transferred to BIMDC on [**2128-7-18**] for R hip ORIF.
His course has been complicated by post-op bleeding in the setting of required anticoagulation for the presence of a mechanical valve.
The bleeding resulted in a R gluteal hematoma, hypotension (resolved with fluid resuscitation), acute anemia (treated with transfusions), ARF and transaminits (likely [**1-24**] to hypoperfusion of kidney/liver).
Hip Fracture / Trauma / Hematoma: Imaging was repeated on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], which confirmed right hip fracture.
Due to complain of neck pain, CT c-spine was performed and did not reveal any concerning findings.
Stress test was obtained and revealed fixed deficits without reversible ischemia.
While in the ICU, the patient did have a noticeable Hct drop following anticoagulation, but had an appropriate Hct bump after being transfused 2UPBRCs.
On examination, R gluteal hematoma was found and confirmed with CT imaging.
[**Date Range 1957**] has been following to eval for compartment syndrome and wound infection, doing serial exams to ensure no foot drop or other concerning findings.
On discharge, surgical wound healing well with no complications.
Fall / Syncope: History was very suggestive of syncopal episode, with prior history of orthostatic hypotension and recent medication change (may have predisposed to medication error).
Differential diagnosis however includes non perfusing arrhythmia, myocardial infarction (leading to arrhytmia), acute valvular disease (although highly unlikely with normal exam), massive pulmonary embolus, and seizure.
Patient was ruled out for MI, had a CT with old cerbellar infarct and ECHO without significant change from prior.
ICD was interrogated and no VT/VF episodes had been detected.
Fall likely secondary to orthostatic hypotension.
Acute anemia: In setting of fracture and extensive hematoma, as above, patient responed appropiately to blood transfusions.
Given relative hypotension on admission, we held antihypertensives with exception of metoprolol.
pMIBI negative for reversible ischemia.
# Chronic syst/diast CHF, fluid overload: Pt received copious amounts of IVFs while hypotensive and became severely volume overloaded (dependent edema), which made physical therapy difficult.
Coumadin restarted very cautiously on [**2128-8-2**], however, having trouble increasing INR, so Coumadin increased to 6mg PO daily for now.
Afib: Patient's rate has been controlled with a low dose beta blocker and he has not had a significant bp drop from this either.
We discussed possibly starting Coreg as it would be better for his cardiac health, however, we deferred this change until his anti-coagulation and bleeding issues have been further resolved.
Coumadin was held for bleeding issues and surgery, restarted on [**8-2**].
Acute Renal failure: Baseline Cr ~1, pt developed ARF [**1-24**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in the setting of hypotension from hemorrhage.
Possible shock liver from hypotension from bleeding.
RUQ U/S showed absent GB (s/p cholecystectomy), no ductal dilation/stones.
Pt has no abd pain and no tenderness on exam, LFTs downtrending on discharge.
# Delirium/Confusion: After the operation, the pt became disoriented with slowed speech, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Head CT on [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
Recommend avoidance of narcotics/sedative (used tramadol prn for pain and haldol prn for hyperactivity or agitation).
# Fever/Leukocytosis: After the surgery, the pt had low grade temps to 99-100.
He was also started on keflex for ?cellulitis around groin site.
He has had a RIJ line since [**2128-7-21**] and this may be source, so it was d/c after peripheral access was attained.
Pt also developed an asymptomatic UTI by UA and culture (growing pan-sensitive Pseudomonas), however, he was not started on abx given that he did not spike a fever and did not become hemodynamically unstable.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.

- tylenol and tramadol - we have started these medications to help your pain control.
Should you have fever > 101, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, bleeding or any other symptoms that concern you, please call your physicians immediately.
