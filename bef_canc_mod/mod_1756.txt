It was severe [**9-23**] and felt nauseated and vomited small amount.
His family noted that he was somewhat unsteady on feet and possibly had some difficulty in looking at the objects on the left side.
CT head in ED showed IPH in Right temporal area with edema.
No prior attacks, No falls trauma.
Past Medical History: - HTN - HL - CAD s/p CABG, currently a plan for elective cardiac catheterization for unstable angina - BPH  Social History: quit smoking several yrs ago, Rx heavy smoker  Ex alcoholic, No drugs, Lives with family, owns a restaurant.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals: 99 70 161/81 16 100% Gen: well appearing, in no acute distress HEENT:  NCAT, MMM CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: soft,  nondistended, no organomegaly Ext: warm and well perfused.
Follows  midline and appendicular  commands .No right left confusion, No apraxia or hemineglect.
Visual fields suggest left sided field cut , fundi show no papilledema.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally no nystagmus V1-3: Sensation intact V1-V3 to touch and pain VII: Facial movement symmetric.
No extinction to DSS  Reflexes: +2 and symmetric throughout.
The thyroid gland is somewhat difficult to visualize due to the patient's body habitus.
Multiple small confluent nodules are identified throughout the right and left lobes and also within the isthmus.
None of the numerous nodules visualized demonstrate any worrisome features by ultrasound criteria based on size and appearance.
No son[**Name (NI) 5326**] suspicious or dominant mass identified within the thyroid.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-12-10**] the ischemic-appearing anterolateral and apical ST-T wave changes have improved, although there is persistent lateral ST-T wave change.
These findings are consistent with ongoing ischemic process.

After contrast administration rim enhancement was seen around which is concerning for a malignant process.
The degree of neighboring edema causing sulcal effacement is unchanged from prior.
Again note is made of mild anterior displacement of retropulvinar cistern.
Otherwise, there is no midline shift apparent.
There is no overlying fracture.
There is no evidence to suggest re-bleeding.
Rim enhancement of unchanged 3.7 x 5.3 cm right temporo-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage concerning for bleeding within a primary neoplasm, bleeding within a metastases or hematoma.
Unchanged neighboring edema and mild neighborhood mass effect.
There is no evidence of midline shift or herniation.
MRI of the brain [**12-10**]: FINDINGS: MRI BRAIN: There is a rim-enhancing heterogenous lesion in the right parietotemporal lobe which demonstrates heterogenous internal foci of enhancement and irregular rim enhancement posteroinferiorly.
There is extensive susceptibility within this lesion with extension of susceptibility into the adjacent right lateral ventricle, susceptibility is also seen in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is extensive T2 and FLAIR abnormality surrounding this lesion.
There are no other lesions identified.
The lesion is causing local mass effect without evidence of midline shift.
There is displacement of the adjacent right lateral ventricle.
The FLAIR abnormality extends anteriorly into the right temporal lobe and posteriorly extends into the right occipital lobe.
There are no other intracranial lesions identified.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses.
There is no abnormal marrow signal.
MRA HEAD AND NECK: There is a bovine arch.
The cervical carotid and vertebral arteries appear unremarkable without evidence of significant flow-limiting stenosis or an aneurysm.
The intracranial internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries and basilar artery and their branches are widely patent without evidence of significant flow-limiting stenosis or an aneurysm.
Large heterogenous rim-enhancing lesion with surrounding T2 and FLAIR abnormality.
The differential considerations are a hematoma, hemorrhage in a primary brain neoplasm or hemorrhagic metastasis.
The cervical and intracranial arterial vasculature appears unremarkable.
TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
NCHCT on admission: FINDINGS: A 37 x 52 mm hyperdense mass is present within the right temporal-parietal region (2:15), compatible with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is a broad rim of neighboring edema, which causing sulcal effacement.
There is mild anterior displacement of the right retropulvinar cistern, but the quadrigeminal cistern is preserved.
There is no overlying fracture.
IMPRESSION: 37 x 52 mm right temporal-parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with neighboring edema, causing mild neighboring mass effect.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or herniation seen.
An underlying mass or vascular malformation cannot be excluded, as opposed to an unusual site for a primary hemorrhage.
Repeat Head CT on [**12-10**] showed no recurrent hemorrhage.
The right temporo-parietal enhancing lesion appeared stable.
A complex Cardiology and Neurosurgical outpatient management plan was elaborated in consultation with his [**Hospital1 **] Cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 111604**] who was covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] his outpatient cardiologist) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery, as described below.
He will return for a non contrast head CT on [**Last Name (STitle) 766**] [**2191-12-18**], and then go to his Cardiologist for an elective cardiac catheterization/angioplasty on Wednesday [**2191-12-20**].
He remained in NAD on our floor service, and was discharged to home without incident in the afternoon of [**2192-12-13**].

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe headache.
However, you will need to have your cardiac problems addressed before you can have a brain biopsy.
You should also take a new medicine to reduce heart pain (ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE 30mg, once every morning).
