HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16762**] is a 73-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for CAD, status post three vessel CABG in 3/00 with non Q wave MI in [**7-29**], status post proximal LAD OM1 stenting with PTCA of the left circ, also with metastatic renal cell cancer status post bilateral nephrectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.
The patient initially presented [**3-/2163**] with chest pain and inferolateral ST elevations.
Cardiac catheterization showed the following:  Inferolateral inferior hypokinesis, EF 45% with an LVEDP of 24, proximal RCA 100%, proximal LAD 80% with diffuse distal disease, 80% D1, 30% proximal circ, 50% mid circ with 70% OM1.
The patient had a TTE [**2164-4-27**] which showed left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement, EF 20-25%, continues to have minimal anginal symptoms and was referred for an exercise mibi on [**2164-4-30**] for preoperative evaluation.
Nuclear images showed inferior apical lateral partially reversible perfusion defects with global hypokinesis in the context of preoperative for right nephrectomy he underwent elective cardiac cath [**8-17**] and [**8-20**] which showed an LVEDP of 30 mmHg, severe native three vessel disease, sequential 50% and 70% proximal LAD with small aneurysm proximal to D1, severely diseased D1 with twin LAD up to 95% proximal stenosis, rotablated PTCA stent in origin of the mid C1, left circ 90% proximal, 40% diffuse in the lesions, proximal lesion involving OM1 origin, SVG 100% proximal discrete lesions times three.
Cath [**8-20**], left circ intervention, PTCA stent OM1 with rescue PCA left circ, 70% stenosis distal to proximal LAD stent, PTCA stent of LAD.
The patient had left brachiocephalic AV fistula placed [**5-29**], hemodialyzed since [**3-29**].
Today the patient went to hemodialysis, had substernal chest pain and noted one episode prior to that evening, relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
There was a questionable aspiration event.
The patient was subsequently found to have ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V6 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 1.
The ST elevations resolved after cardiac arrest.
He had PTCA and kissing balloons of the left circ and OM1 lesions, also had PTCA of the LAD and D1 lesions.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post three vessel CABG in 3/00, systolic heart failure, recent [**State 531**] Heart Association class II, EF 20-25%,renal cell carcinoma, status post left nephrectomy in [**2153**] with high dose IL-2 for pulmonary mets [**2153**], status post resection of penile recurrence [**2158**], right renal mass in [**2162**], status post IL-2 low dose, acute renal failure secondary to right renal hemorrhage treated with embolization [**3-29**].
The patient had adrenal sparing right nephrectomy and has been on hemodialysis, had an AV fistula in the left arm which has been undone due to poor maturation.
No alcohol or tobacco.
Cardiovascular, brady with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and S3 at the apex.
EKG showed 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in 2, 3, AVF, V6 and 1 mm depressions in 1 and also had [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V1 through V3, status post cardioversion, these elevations somewhat resolved.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit status post a catheterization during which he had PTCA of the LAD, D1, left circ and OM1 with kissing balloons at the left circ and OM1.
He had left circ AV groove side branch dilated full expansion 3.5 with persistent 90% lesion likely strut.
Beta cath brachytherapy delivered to both left circ with overlapping margins and no angiographic mist and delivered to proximal LAD, transient hypotension with both brachytherapies.
He was brought back to the floor on a Dobutamine infusion with a heart rate of 75/minute, no ectopy and systolic blood pressure of 100-120.
The patient was intended to be on Dobutamine for 24 hours and weaned if severely bradycardic.
It was thought that the patient was in possible septic shock or hypovolemic shock given recent dialysis and his vasodilation.
The morning following the Swan placement the patient had a lower GI bleed which required transfusion of 18 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient's EGD was inconclusive with no active areas of hemorrhage noticed.
The duodenal bulb was edematous without evidence of ulcerations.
The patient had a large hiatal hernia, no old blood was seen.
Over the next 24-48 hours the patient had his pressors weaned off.
It was ultimately determined that the patient had a right groin fistula status post sheath removal which may have contributed to his elevated MBO2 and a potentially falsely elevated cardiac output.
Given the patient's fresh stents and brachytherapy, Heparin was introduced 48 hours after the bleed with no bolus and he subsequently had Aspirin and Plavix reintroduced.
The patient had no subsequent episodes of bleeding throughout the hospitalization.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient denied any chest pain throughout the entire hospitalization following his interventions.
His EKGs remained unchanged without any evidence of active ischemia in the days after his acute arrest.
Given the patient's persistent bradycardia throughout the hospitalization with heart rates in the high 30's to low 40's, a pacemaker was placed on [**2165-1-2**].
There were no complications with this procedure.
Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of a V fib arrest.
The patient had mild congestive heart failure and fluid overload on chest x-rays which were subsequently improved after hemodialysis throughout the hospitalization.
Renal:  The patient is a chromic hemodialysis patient in the setting of bilateral nephrectomy.
GI:  The patient had a rapid GI bleed resulting in loss of 18 units of blood.
The patient's bleed was thought to either be a rapid upper GI bleed or a lower GI bleed.
The patient did not have colonoscopy during this hospitalization as he was post V fib arrest and MI and it was thought to be a risky procedure.
The patient had no subsequent episodes of bleeding despite being on Heparin, Aspirin and Plavix.
Status post V fib arrest, status post MI with two cardiac interventions, catheterization resulting in stenting of multiple vessels as previously indicated with the second procedure on [**12-28**] during which he underwent brachytherapy and redilatation of previous stenotic areas.
Renal failure.
Questionable aspiration pneumonia with normal white blood cell count and no fevers following extubation.
Bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement.
Low ejection fraction with congestive heart failure.
