In particular, there is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia or significant pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old man with diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, pre-diabetes, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and severe obstructive sleep apnea, presented from his skilled nursing facility for hypoxia.
CXR showed no significant interval change from prior films, and there was no radiographic or clinical evidence of worsening pulmonary edema (note BNP was 1184 which is improved prior levels) or pneumonia.
His hypoxia appears to be at baseline, and there was no clear evidence of an acute exacerbating process.
ABG showed 7.3/76/76/47 which is consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation.
He was given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments for possible bronchospasm (he may have underlying obstructive component, possibly asthma, although recent pulmonary function tests would be needed to confirm this), 80mg IV lasix, and was placed on his home Bipap settings overnight.
He reported improvement in his shortness of breath on the day of [**Month/Day/Year **] and was at baseline for his oxygen requirements and saturations.
We discussed placement of a tracheostomy tube as a means of a more effective therapy for his severe hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea, however, the patient declined.
Of note, he had mild acute renal injury with elevated creatinine 1.3 upon admission, which was attributed to pre-renal azotemia (supported by FeUrea 32%).
Initially lactate was elevated at 2.0, but this normalized on the day of [**Month/Day/Year **] as well.
7. benztropine 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for dystonia.
9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
10. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
[**Month/Day/Year **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon [**Hospital 1268**] Extended Care Center  [**Hospital **] Diagnosis: Chronic obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome Diastolic congestive heart failure Hypertension Pre-diabetes Schizophrenia Bipolar disorder   [**Hospital **] Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**],  You came to the hospital because of shortness of breath and low oxygen levels.
We believe your shortness of breath is due to your chronic obstructive sleep apnea.
We discussed placement of a tracheostomy which would be an effective intervention for your shortness of breath, however you declined.
We made the following changes to your medications: - Please start albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing  It was a pleasure caring for you.
