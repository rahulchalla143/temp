Admission Date:  [**2186-4-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Ciprofloxacin / Ertapenem / Meropenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: Acute renal failure, urinary tract infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bedside HD line placement, IR guided HD line placement, IR guided tunnelled HD line placement, PICC line placement, paracentesis, central line placement, intubation, NG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 60 year old woman with cirrhosis [**3-13**] methotrexate (for psoriatic arthritis) and hepatitis C who initially presented with acute on chronic renal failure; her course has been complicated by UTI, bacteremia, respiratory distress requiring ICU transfer as well as worsening ARF requiring HD who is now stable for call out of the ICU to the floor.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-8**] to [**2186-3-14**] for an infected bullae.
The patient was then discharged to rehab, where she was feeling well and had no specific complaints.
On admission she was found to have a UTI which grew Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and ESBL E. coli on straight cath.
She was initially treated with first with Unasyn but developed a diffuse rash.
She was then switched to aztreonam due to allergies to cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones but the culture ultimately grew resistent ESBL Ecoli and Pseudomonas.
She was switched to meropenem but developed diffuse erythroderma with eosinophilia after 3 days.
The meropenem was stopped but a repeat UA and Cx was notable only for yeast and no signs of ongoing infection.
She then became increasingly encephalopathic and developed a fever.
She also being treated for hepatorenal syndrome with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide.
She has some post procedure bleeding and was transfused 2U pRBC the following day.
She developed respiratory distress thought to be due to volume overload on Sat [**4-15**].
She developed a large hemorrhagic bulla at the site of her HD cath.
Her course has further been complicated by ongoing encephalopathy which responded to lactulose.
She has no particular complaints but is A&O x 1.
She continues to require HD with poor UOP.

Low precordial lead voltage.
Brief Hospital Course: 60F with ESLD [**3-13**] HCV and MTX for psoaritic arthritis who presented initially for ARF then developed a UTI which was treated.
The renal failure persisted consistent with HRS and she was started on HD.
She then developed coag neg Staph bacteremia and ?VRE bacteremia versus contaminated BCx.
Of note, she has severe skin break down [**3-13**] unknown etiology (?psorasis and cirrhotic edema and chronic steroid use).
She had completed treatment for bacteremia with vancomycin but the bacteremia with coag neg Staph recurred almost as soon as the vancomycin was stopped.
She has been de-listed for liver trasnplant.
Goals of care: Given inability to treat her infections [**3-13**] skin breakdown and severe bleeding from heparin at HD, as well as the reality that [**Known firstname **] will never be eligible for liver or kidney [**Known firstname **], she and here family agreed to comfort care.
Anemia / bleeding: Pt with ongoing bleeding from skin with minor trauma.
Less bleeding on exam [**4-30**] and [**5-1**] off heparin for HD.
Skin breakdown: She has a large hemorrhagic bulla at the site of her HD cath.
She continues to have extensive skin breakdown of unknown etilogy but presumed to be from edema and psorasis.
Minimized dressing changes and adhesives.
# Bacteremia: BCx positive coag neg Staph starting on [**4-11**] for which she was initially on vancomycin.
Then developed VRE bacteremia x1 BCx and was switched to daptomycin on [**4-17**].
She completed treatment for coag neg Staph bacteremia on [**2186-4-21**] with vancomycin.
Her skin fragility/breakdown seems like the most likely source for her recurrent bacteremia.
She developed a drug reaction with eosinophilia to meropenem, which was then DCed.
Repeat UCx with yeast only so DC'd foley as only small amount of urine produced.
BCx from HD line on [**2186-4-21**] grew coag neg Staph in [**3-13**] bottles.
Her Cr did no respond to increasing doses of octreotide, midorine, and albumin and she was unable to manage her volume status with a Cr around 3.
She was ultimately started on HD for respiratory distress [**3-13**] hypervolemia.
Goals of care are palliative at this point, discontinuing HD for ongoing severe hemorrhage from heparin from lines.
# Respiratory Distress: Patient transferred to ICU with respiratory distress on [**4-15**], thought to be [**3-13**] volume overload.
Her respiratory symptoms improved with initiation of HD.
Continue management of hepatic encephalopathy as above.
Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Lantus only with QAM fingersticks.
ICU course: Was transferred to the MICU on HOD 11 ([**2186-4-16**]) for worsening respiratory distress and fatigue with tachypnea to 30's, hypoxemia requiring 4L NC (previously on RA).
CXR c/w volume overload and team requesting ICU transfer.
The patient received 2U PRBCs and it was thought that fluid overload and renal failure played a role in the respiratory distress.
Blood cultures were positive for VRE and the patient was started on daptomycin.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] Nursing and Rehabilitation Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Urinary tract infection, recurrent bacteremia, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy .
You were admitted for renal failure and a urinary tract infection.
You ultimately needed to start dialysis for your renal failure.
Your hospital course was complicated by multiple infections attributed to your skin problems.
You have had several infections of your blood which have been treated with antibiotics.
Because of your ongoing bleeding we cannot continue with dialysis.
