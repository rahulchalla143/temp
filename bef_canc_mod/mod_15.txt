Of note, her lung cancer involves the right upper lobe mass and adjacent hilar/mediastinal/supraclavicular nodes.
She triggered for respiratory distress.
After intubation, VS were 95, 125/59, 25, 99% on vent  CXR revealed RUL opacity.
Patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL showing RL apical segmental occlusion (?

Physical Exam: Vitals: T 100.9 HR 94 BP 126/88 RR 25 SaO2 99 on CMV, FiO2 50 PEEP 8 PIP 28 Vt 500 with vent settings of Tv 400 RR 20 PEEP 8 FiO2 50 General: intubated and sedation HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops  Port on right-side of test.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: warm, well perfused UE, LE cool, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Left arm graft without bruit or thrill.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to intraventricular conduction delay, left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2200-7-29**] sinus tachycardia is now present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
There is diffuse and severe pulmonary edema.
A dense consolidation on the right may indicate confluent edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate to severe global hypokinesis.
No significant mitral regurgitation seen.
The findings are consistent with interval development of atelectasis but there is potentially some additional cause that precludes significant volume loss such as hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage IV NSCLC involving RUL, DM2, HTN who presents with acute hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress and RUL opacification secondary to possible post-obstructive pneumonia in addition to initial neutropenia.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress Ms. [**Known lastname 784**] was originally intubated and ventilated in the ICU setting upon admission.
Cause of the respiratory distress thought to be likely multifactorial with RUL opacification representing post-obstructive pneumonia given bronchscopy and ?
pulmonary edema contribution although not clinically evident (?lymphangitic spread of cancer).
# Sepsis secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia with subsequent pan-sensitive E. Coli bacteremia.
Patient with leukocytosis and fever (100.7) during MICU stay.
The source of her bacteremia was thought most likely [**12-24**] pulmonary system.
# Non-gap mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
Metabolic acidosis resolved s/p dialysis.
Continued to have respiratory acidosis likely secondary to hypoventilation post-extubation.
# Hypotension: Patient had issues with pre-load dependent hypotension during her MICU course.
Patient appeared adequately resuscitated and a recent ECHO showed moderate to severe hypokinesis, which may represent myocardial depression [**12-24**] to sepsis and acute illness vs. baseline heart disease.
# EKG changes: TWI different from prior on admission.
In state of acute illness, demand ischemia possible.
Acute plaque rupture very unlikely.
# Chronic kidney disease requiring HD.
# Stage IV NSCLC - discussed with primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who thinks chemotherapy unlikely to provide patient any benefit.
# Anemia Baseline Hgb ~ 11.
No evidence of acute blood loss.
# Chronic heart failure, systolic, EF 30 % with MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] does not have active signs of heart failure although transient diastolic function can cause pulmonary edema.
# Diabetes - pt did not receive oral hypoglycemics, but rather was placed on a SSI until this was stopped when she was made CMO.
Per HCP, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**] with no pressors.
Given that her health deteriorated during her MICU stay, the patient was made CMO by the family including her HCP in light of the post-obstructive pneumonia difficult to treat in the setting of Stage IV NSCLC.
