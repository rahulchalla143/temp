CXR admission INDICATION: 59-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer and multiple pneumonias in the past presents with shortness of breath and cough with wheeze and rales.
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: There is bilateral multifocal airspace opacity which is most pronounced in the left upper lobe and concerning for pneumonia.
There may be a small right pleural effusion.
Two crescentic opacities projecting over the right upper mediastinum are likely related to prior gastric pull-through.
The aorta is slightly tortuous, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is a persistent unchanged right- sided pleural effusion.
There is also some thickening of the right apex, which is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old man with a history of esophageal and prostate cancers in remission and recent admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 359**] for pneumonia who presents with two days of rapidly progressive shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow and black sputum in the setting of recent crack cocaine use.
# Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Initially concerning for PNA, therefore pt was started on treatment for HAP given a recent hospital admission two months ago.
There was initially some concern for sepsis given elevated lactate, therefore pt was admitted to the ICU.
He did not manifest septic physiology or symptoms.
He has had two presentations for pneumonia since [**Month (only) **] of unclear etiology, raising concern for atypicals and chronic processes.
Alternatively, interstitial pneumonitis and acute lung injury from crack use is possible, perhaps with a superimposed infection, a repeat CXR later in admission showed improvement of opacities; however, the pt still had an oxygen requirement (no WBC, afebrile) which was ultimately weaned off to room air.
Given his rapid clinical improvement, we felt comfortable changing antibiotics to levofloxacin.
He was watched for one day on this regimen, and as he remained stable he was discharged to complete an eight-day course total of antibitics for probable CAP versus crack lung.
# Transaminitis: Elevated LFTs, ALT>AST, however enzymes trended down during the admission without a clear etiology for the transient elevation.
Iron studies were not consistent with iron overload or deficiency.
RUQ ultrasound was deferred given the rapid resolution of his transaminitis.
# Abdominal Pain: Likely rectus soreness from cough ??????
as worsened pain over muscle when coughing.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pre-renal, likely related to infection/poor PO intake, but markedly improved during the admission with fluids.
# Alcohol Abuse: hx of alcohol abuse without hx of withdrawl.
# Esophageal cancer: s/p chemoradiation and esophagectomy in [**2122**], in remission.
# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were initially held out of concern for sepsis, then restarted on transfer to the floor given that pressures were stable.
# Hypothyrodism: home levothyroxine 100 mcg daily was continued  # Pain: patient given Rx for 15 tablets of oxycodone which he states he takes at home for chronic pain secondary to operations undergone for his esophageal cancer.
# Social: pt has questionable social/housing situation and is expressing interest in moving in with his girlfriend.
he expressed interest in enrolling in a addictions program and this should be followed up by the pt's PCP.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: pneumonia SECONDARY: poly-substance abuse, acute renal failure, transaminitis, anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and were treated for pneumonia and lung injury thought to be form crack cocaine use.
Additionally, while in the hospital you were found to have elevated liver enzymes and renal failure, both of which improved with treatment for your pneumonia.
Finally, you can take benzonatate for cough relief.
