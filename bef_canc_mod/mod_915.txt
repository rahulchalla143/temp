Admission Date:  [**2151-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-3-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Darvocet-N 100 / Codeine / Fosamax / Darvon / Doxycycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**] Chief Complaint: Femoral fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ORIF of right  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with multiple medical problems including CAD, HTN, aortic stenosis, and hyperlipidemia, who was transferred from an OSH ED for management of a spontaneous R femur fracture.
Per the patient, she was standing and felt a snap of her right leg and fell to the ground.
No head trauma or LOC.
She presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] and was found to have a right femur fracture about cemented right hemiarthroplasty.
Her evaluation in the ED was notable for a leukocytosis to 13 with left shift and also an elevated creatinine of 1.4.
Her baseline creatinine is not known, however the patient has no known history of renal disease.
Medical consult is requested for pre-operative risk assessment and management of her renal failure.
She denies chest pain with exertion or at rest.
She does have chronic ankle edema, for which she was started on a water pill (presumably lasix) in the past year.
She also notes a remote history of a syncopal event many years ago while at a church event, but reports that her doctor evaluated her without finding a clear cause.
Denies recent fevers or chills.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
Denies prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Past Medical History: -Aortic stenosis-- last TTE in our system from [**2144**] with mild-mod AS and [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.3cm, EF 70% -Coronary artery disease-- no history of MI per pt -Hyperlipidemia -Hypertension -GERD -Colon CA s/p ileocecectomy in [**2144**] -Breast CA s/p bilateral mastectomy -Glaucoma -History of skin cancer -Spinal stenosis s/p back surgery -s/p R oophorectomy -s/p appendectomy   Social History: She is a widow.
Sclera anicteric.
Dry MM, OP clear, no exudates or ulceration.
CV: RRR with occasional skipped beats, [**4-3**] harsh systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium without radiating to the carotids or axilla.
Chest: Crackles bilaterally up to the mid-lung fields, no wheezes appreciated.
No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: R leg is externally rotated, 1+ pitting edema in the bilateral LE to mid-calf.
Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3, deferred strength exam due to pt discomfort with exam   Pertinent Results: ==================   ADMISSION LABS ==================  [**2151-2-25**] 09:00PM BLOOD WBC-13.6* RBC-3.41* Hgb-12.0 Hct-36.9 MCV-108*# MCH-35.1*# MCHC-32.4 RDW-16.5* Plt Ct-239 [**2151-2-25**] 09:00PM BLOOD PT-13.6* PTT-24.2 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2151-2-25**] 09:00PM BLOOD Glucose-188* UreaN-44* Creat-1.4* Na-140 K-5.1 Cl-104 HCO3-27 AnGap-14 [**2151-2-26**] 06:50AM BLOOD Calcium-9.3 Phos-5.1*# Mg-1.8  ECHO ([**2151-2-26**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
A right-sided pacer with its leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle are stable.
There is improvement in vascular congestion without evidence of effusion, consolidation, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema since [**65**] hours prior.
There is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
ORIF right femur: ([**2151-3-1**]) There is a right hip arthroplasty.
The fracture components are in near anatomical alignment.
There is no evidence of hardware complication.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, CAD, and HTN, now with an acute spontaneous right femur fracture with post operative hypotension .
# HIP FRACTURE: Patient with spontaneous femoral head fracture at home.
Patient was medically optimized in the medical service given her severe aortic stenosis and volume overload.
Patient had no bleeding at surgical site and pain was adequately controlled with scheduled acetaminophen and PRN Morphine IR.
Patient was able to transfer to chair with assistance and at time of discharge she was weight bearing as tolerated with assitance.
# POST OP HYPOTENSION: Multifactorial in this elderly woman with severe valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute blood loss, and sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration.
Given estimated loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia was the most likely contributor to hypotension.
Lastly, although sinus tachycardia / atrial fibrillation is compensatory in setting of hypovolemia, given her fixed cardiac output she may have benefited from more agressive rate control, however difficult to do in setting of vasopressor requirement.
Course complicated by acute renal failure (see below) however without development of pulmonary edeme.
# Hypoxia: Noted during admission, improved with pre-operatively diuresis.
No significant oxygen requirement at this time, at time of discharge she did not require any.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Most likely result of poor forward flow from AS and also from hypovolemia and anemia.
# CAD: No clear documentation, however given age calcific atherosclerosis is highly likely.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Unclear how long she has had this arryhtmia, however more prominent in setting of acute pain and peri-op.
She also was given zyprexa zydis 2.5mg with much improvement.
# FEN/GI: Low sodium diet .
# PPX: Heparin [**Hospital1 **] given low body weight.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia: agitation.
