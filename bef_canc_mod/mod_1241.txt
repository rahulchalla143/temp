The patient has a long history of chronic GI bleeds which have been attributed to an undetected AVM that have been bleeding due to the dual anti-platelet agents.
He has been previously thought too-high risk to undergo EGD or colonscopy based on his coronary disease so complete diagnostic evaluation for his source of bleeding has not occurred.
He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 95898**] for chest pain and ruled in for NSTEMI that was exacerbated by his bleeding.
During that admission he had several melanotic stools, and his Hct nadir was 20% and peak Tnt was 0.2.
He was found to have dark brown guaiac + stool.
With his son as interpreter, he was asymptomatic denying chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath.
He stated that he was feeling weak but no other symptom.

EKG: sinus @65 with RBBB, LAFB, biventricular hypertrophy and extensive lateral ST depressions (w/o significant change from [**2123-9-5**])  TTE: [**2123-9-3**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo male with history of CAD s/p multiple PCI, systolic and [**Age over 90 7216**] CHF, aortic stenosis and chronic GI bleeding admitted for GI bleed and hypotension.
GI bleed:  Patient's anemia appears to be likely related to a slow and chronic GI bleed, which was thought related to an undiagnosed AVM, however unable to get colonoscopy considering CAD.
His bleeding likely exacerbated in the setting of dual anti-platelet agents- plavix and ASA 325mg.
Coronary Artery Disease:  No evidence of acute ischemia with unchanged EKG, has ST depressions chronically in V2-V6, and no elevation in cardiac enzymes, times three sets.
Patient remained chest pain free once sent to the floor.
As patient has chronic UTI's, started ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for a total of 7 days.
PPx: bowel regimen; holding DVT prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed .
