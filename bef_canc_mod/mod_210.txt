Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central venous catheter placement Arterial line placement G-Tube placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 16847**] is 57-year-old man with NSCLC/adenocarcinoma of lung with metastases to brain, s/p resection ([**2139**] and [**2140**]), seizure disorder ([**2140**]), CVA ([**2156**]) with residual right-sided hemiparesis and slurred speech/expressive aphasia presenting with lethargy and altered mental status.
She reports that on Friday [**2160-4-25**], he received his routine Botox injection for muscle spasticity from his stroke, which he has tolerated well in the past.
The patient's wife notes that the Baclofen had recently been started during his recent admission to [**Hospital1 69**] with a subsequent reaction to the medication, including agitation and a fall.
The patient's wife reports she presented to rehabilitation on Saturday [**2160-4-26**] to find the patient very lethargic and less interactive, sitting in his wheelchair and staring into space.
Of note, the patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] Neurology Service from [**2160-3-3**] to [**2160-3-11**] for difficulty walking with worsening ataxia, and worsening encephalopathy.
He was found to have avascular necrosis of bilateral femoral heads that was presumed to cause pain with weight bearing.
He was also found to have an enterococcus UTI and was treated with a 7 day course of Macrobid.
His worsening mental and neurologic status was also thought to be due to delayed radiation induced encephalopathy.
Additionally, he also became over-sedated and drowsy with vomiting on standing oxycodone, which improved with PRN oxycodone.
During the hospitalization, patient also sustained an unwitnessed fall from a chair with resulting eyebrow laceration, CT head and c-spine done without fracture.
His general examination was significant for minimal responsiveness, squeezes hands, rightward gaze and right sided weakness which are old per mergency department report.
Patient was given 1mg IV lorazepam given for questionable seizure and 1 liter of normal saline.
His diagnostic workup revealed left temporal metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
on [**2152-8-8**] - Admission to OMED Service [**7-/2158**] for worsening gait and encephalopathy, found to have subacute hemorrhage on MRI.
Other Past Medical History: - Seizure disorder s/p resection of brain metastasis ([**2140**]) - s/p CVA with residual right-sided weakness since [**2157-1-9**].
The patient's wife states that he had slumped over, later developed severe weakness on the right side, with right facial droop and increased right lower extremity weakness.
She does not recall any tonic-clonic activity or any other seizure activity with this episode.
- Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension  Past Surgical History: 1. s/p thoracotomy for lung cancer.
- Prior to his fall and this episode of worsening gait in [**2-/2160**], patient was able to ambulate independently with right AFO and with supervision.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2160-5-7**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MODERATE GROWTH.
CT head: [**2160-4-29**] IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
CXR: [**2160-4-29**] IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Right lower lobe consolidation, consistent with pneumonia, with mucus plugging of the segmental and subsegmental bronchi.
Ground-glass opacity in the right middle and left lower lobe likely represents additional infectious/inflammatory change.
No evidence of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage as questioned.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall, distal anteroseptum and apex.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 16847**] is a 57-year-old with NSCLC/adenocarcinoma of lung with metastases to brain, s/p resection ([**2139**] and [**2140**]), seizure disorder ([**2140**]), CVA ([**2156**]) with residual right-sided hemiparesis and slurred speech presenting with lethargy, altered mental status.
(1) Lethargy/Altered Mental Status:  This is likely secondary to medication effect.
Unclear etiology of the patient's acute mental status changes.
An infectious work up was negative, making an infectious cause of toxic metabolic encephalopathy unlikely.
The patient has also been in the process of being tapered off baclofen, and as per Neuro-Oncology, baclofen withdrawal can present with mental status changes.
The patient initially received IV ativan in the ED, and initially was somnolent secondary to the medication.
Finally the acute onset of these findings makes progression of his disease less likely as well, as that would likely be a more indolent course.
Of note, the patient was recently discharged in mid-[**2160-2-24**] after being admitted for ataxia, at which time his worsening mental and neurologic status was thought to be due to delayed radiation induced encephalopathy.
There was also suspicion for an aspiration event that may have contributed to him going to the intensive care unit for hypoxic respiratory failure (see below).
The patient failed multiple speech and swallow evaluations during this hospitalization, and subsequently had an IR guided G tube placed.
(2) Aspiration Pneumonia:  On HD 4 patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Respiratory failure was attributed to an aspiration event and subsequent aspiriation pneumonitis/pneumonia.
There was initally concern for PE and the patient was breifly started on a heparin gtt.
In the setting of transient hypotension the patient underwent a CT abdomen pelvis which was negative for bleeding.
Labs were not consistent with hemolysis.
(4) History of Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Lung:  The patient has been monitored with serial CTs, and there is no evidence of recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma on imaging.
(5) Seizure Disorder:  The patient has history of seizures, and during his last hospitalization in [**2160-2-24**], the patient has EEG and LP with [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus and Herpes virus studies, which were negative.
As his mental status improves, he will have to have repeat swallow evaluations.
DuoNeb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One(1) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia Lung Cancer Seizures  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
We did not find a source of infection that could account for your symptoms.
You had an EEG to look for seizures which did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
While you were admitted you became short of breath and needed to go to the intensive care unit.
We think that you may have aspirated some food or saliva into your lungs and caused an infection.
We made the following changes to your medications STOP Baclofen  START Ritalin 15 mg by mouth twice daily another four days INCREASE Ritalin to 20 mg by mouth twice daily on [**2160-5-20**]  START thiamine 100 mg by mouth daily START Duonebs every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing  Followup Instructions: Department: NEUROLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2160-5-29**] at 2:00 PM With: [**Doctor Last Name 640**] [**Doctor First Name 747**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.
