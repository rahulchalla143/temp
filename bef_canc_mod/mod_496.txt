Admission Date:  [**2147-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-10-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-9-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old Russian male with no significant past medical history who presents to the Emergency Department with new acute onset of substernal chest pain of several hour duration with radiation down the left arm.
Patient was reportedly in his usual state of health when he reports acute onset of left arm pain associated with "pins and needles" sensation while at rest.
The patient's arm pain persisted for approximately 30 minutes before onset of substernal chest pain and pressure.
The chest pain progressively worsened over several hours with associated nausea and diaphoresis.
The patient denies shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, palpitations, as well as lightheadedness.
The patient was transported to the Emergency Department by EMS and on route was treated with aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin with persistent chest pain.
On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was started on nitroglycerin drip, heparin, Plavix, and Integrilin (Lopressor was held secondary to sinus bradycardia).
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 114/68, heart rate 52, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air, 97% on four liters nasal cannula.
The patient's initial electrocardiogram demonstrated antero-septal ST elevations with persistent chest pain.
Anxiety disorder.
Degenerative joint disease.
Status post inguinal hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is a retired mechanical engineer and emigrant from [**Country 532**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  No significant coronary artery disease or diabetes reported.
In general, patient is a well-developed, well-nourished elderly male lying flat in no acute distress.
Neck with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally, no jugular venous distention, supple, no lymphadenopathy appreciated.
Cardiovascular exam:  Distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Pulmonary exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Abdominal exam:  Soft, normal active bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ distal pulses throughout, right groin with arterial and venous catheterization sheaths with small hematoma (marked) with pressure dressing, no bruit appreciated.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no overt failure, no infiltrate appreciated.
Initial electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 86, right bundle branch block with intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevations in V2 and V3, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads V4 and V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.
Catheterization demonstrated a right dominant system with multivessel disease including mildly diseased left circumflex, moderate (40-50%) occluded right coronary artery, 20% left main occlusion, and total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.
The patient ruled in for an ST elevation anterior wall myocardial infarction with peak CK of 4396.
The patient remained chest pain free during the remainder of the hospital course.
The patient also remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry without signs of arrhythmia.
A post myocardial infarction echocardiogram demonstrated severely decreased systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe hypokinesis of the inferior and anterior septum, as well as anterior free wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
The echocardiogram also demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild pulmonary hypertension, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
No thrombus was seen on echocardiogram and the patient was started on anticoagulation for akinetic/poor left ventricular function with heparin and Coumadin, goal INR [**1-1**].
There was no evidence of bleeding, complication or groin hematoma.
The patient's lipid panel demonstrated a total cholesterol of 172, elevated LDL of 124, low high density lipoprotein of 25, and triglycerides of 114.
The patient was started on a statin (LFTs only remarkable only for an elevated AST likely secondary to cardiac origin).
Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-30%.
Anxiety disorder.
Degenerative joint disease.
Status post inguinal hernia repair.
The patient was instructed to follow-up with [**Hospital1 **] Cardiology on [**11-14**] for further risk stratification including a T wave alternans test in the stress laboratory, a signal average electrocardiogram, and 24 hour Holter monitor.
The risk stratification is part of an ongoing Electrophysiology study for potential placement of ICD.
