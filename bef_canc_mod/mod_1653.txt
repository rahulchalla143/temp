The cardiac index/output were within normal limits, as were the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances.
Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function without wall motion abnormality.
He does have a history of heavy alcohol abuse, and he formery drank 5 martinis/night and Grand Marnier, would drink more on the weekends.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
His father had an MI at age 62, and his older brother died last week at age [**Age over 90 **] from emphysema.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY); ABDOMINAL FLUORO WITHOUT RADIO Reason: [**Month/Day/Year **] [**Month/Day/Year **]: Seven spot fluoroscopic images were obtained without a radiologist.
These demonstrate filling defects in a slightly dilated common bile duct, consistent with choledocholithiasis.
Cholelithiasis in a mildly distended gallbladder with associated gallbladder wall edema and a common bile duct at the upper limits of normal.

There is left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent atelectasis, consolidation or combination of both.
Left pleural effusion is again seen.
Mild prominence of interstitial markings persist consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
He presented c/o RUQ pain, fever, and chills x 1 day.
Initially he was admitted to Medicine and he still had [**4-30**] Abdominal pain when he hit the floor and he still has an uneasy filling in his stomach.

He underwent RUQ U/S on arrival to MICU, which demonstrated gallbladder wall edema but no pericholecystic fluid, with a CBD of 6mm diameter.
He met the SIRS criteria - fever and tachycardia and bands from the GNR's bacteremia from the cholangitis, decreased urine output, and borderline MAP > 55 despite volume resuscitation.
Hypovolemia was less likely given persistent hypotension despite IVF and clinical appearance.
Cardiogenic shock [**1-22**] rapid afib causing poor LV filling was initially considered but the patient's tachycardia did not respond significantly to diltiazem gtt.

His abdominal pain improved and he passed a swallow evaluation and was allowed ground solids and thin liquids.
Afib c RVR: Ddx includes pain vs. hypovolemia vs. infection driving high catecholamine state vs. rebound tachycardia from disruption of home medications.

EKG shows atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.7, Cr was 1.4 on admission.
