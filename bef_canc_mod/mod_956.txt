There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2172-8-26**]-spirometry-Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are mildly reduced, while the FEV1/FVC ratio is   elevated.
Flow-Volume Loop: Reduced volume excursion.
Volumes: The TLC and RV are mildly reduced, while the FRC is moderately   reduced, and the RV/TLC ratio is within normal limits.
Impression:   Mild restrictive ventilatory defect.
The reduced diffusing capacity   suggests an interstitial process.
There are no prior tests for comparison.
Pathology tissue BKA [**2172-9-3**]-Concentric capillary calcification involving panniculitis as well as large vessel calcification with thrombosis is noted.
This picture is most consistent with an advanced stage of calciphylaxis, however a combination of calciphylaxis and "metastatic calcification" cannot be excluded.
ECG Holter [**2172-9-8**]-Long-term ECG monitoring was performed using a Continuous-Loop Recorder ("[**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts") to evaluate this patient with palpitations to rule out significant arrhythmia.
The baseline recording was sinus tachycardia at rates 102 to 104  BPM with 8 isolated APBs and 1 atrial couplet.
There were no recordings transmitted during this monitoring session.
Nonspecific predominantly bilateral upper lobe ground-glass opacities may be infectious or inflammatory in etiology, including atypical or viral infections, especially if patient is still immunosuppressed.
Minimal bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compression atelectasis.
Likely stable atypical enhancement of the splenic periphery compared to a non-contrast [**2171-12-30**] exam, but not definitely present on non- contrast [**2171-12-4**] exam.
The etiology is unclear but may represent sequelae of prior infection or infarction.
Increased hydronephrosis involving the transplant kidney.
Slightly prominent enhancement to distal collecting system and ureter suggests infection/inflammation in this patient with known UTI/colonization.
No radiographic findings to suggest pyelonephritis.
[**9-11**] abdominal u/s-Mildly distended gallbladder containing a prominent stone within, however, no definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
[**9-13**] CT head w/o contrast-No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Small apparently new hypodensity of the left corona radiata which may represent a lacunar infarct.
[**9-13**]-EEG-This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the frequent triphasic waves and slow and disorganized background rhythm.
These abnormalities are suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy, which may be due to toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or infections.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were noted.
Severe atherosclerotic disease and arterial calcifications as described above.
Of note, the patencies of these vascular structures, especially penile arteries could not be assessed on this study.
Bilateral hydroceles and edematous testicles.
Soft tissue stranding surrounding the penis with calcification, likely due to necrotic penis  on the physical examination as noted in the history.
Transplanted kidney in the left lower pelvis, with persistent fat stranding surrounding collecting system with slight decrease of the hydronephrosis, consistent with known UTI.
Diffuse anasarca.
Slight increase of pleural effusion with atelectasis.
[**9-21**]-scrotal u/s-No focal fluid collection.
Infection cannot entirely be excluded; however, no defined abscess or fluid collection is seen.
No evidence of osteomyelitis on CT. 3.
Diffuse atherosclerosis of the vessels.
[**2172-9-24**]-bilateral lower extremity U/S-No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

The patient was initially admitted on [**2172-8-24**] to the vascular service for management of gangrenous wounds involving the left>right toes and fingers.
He had lesions that were dry, indurated and black on his left fingertips, and left and right toes, his penis and scrotum, as well as small lesions on his ear.
The necrotic areas were thought most likely to be due to metastatic calification/calciphylaxis.
He had an elevated calcium phosphate product on admission, ESRD, DM and coumadin use, all of which are risk factors for this.
His imaging studies showed calcification of the medium and small sized vessels.
His course in the vascular ICU was complicated by mental status changes, EEG and head CT were negative and the cause was attributed to his pain medications.
On the medical floow he was febrile with a low blood pressure and was then transferred to the MICU.
The patient had a persistent left-shifted leukocytosis.
He also had fevers and altered mental status (of unclear etiology though thought perhaps related to pregabalin toxicity).
After transfer he remained afebrile and his blood pressure was stable.
He continued to have pain and chronic pain service was consulted.
Urology continued to follow him, a bladder scan showed 900cc urine and a coudet catheter was placed.
Over the course of his hospitalization the pain in this area became subdued.
He also had a new plaque on his right medial thigh that was similar.
Please call our office nurse if you have any questions.
But try not to exert to much pressure on the site when transferring and or pivoting.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:  Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection.
These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site.
If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.
?re amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days.
You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
(Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.)
Eat small balanced meals throughout the day.
CAUTIONS:  NO SMOKING!
DIET:  There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor.
