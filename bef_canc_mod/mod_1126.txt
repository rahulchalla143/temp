DISCHARGE LABS:   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the cardiac suite on [**2161-9-3**] to assess for acute cardiac issues and was found to be negative for coronary artery disease.
The operation proceeded without complication and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the floor thereafter.
His vitals remained stable throughout his hospitalization and showing only mild agitation which included him attempting to climb out of bed at night in the first few nights after his operation.
These episodes and his agitation was treated at appropriate moments with ativan.
He was also given a low-bed to prevent fall risk.
The [**Name (NI) 60563**] scale was discontinued on POD 6 after several days of low score ratings, no further episodes of agitation or acute symptoms of withdrawal.
Cardiology continued to follow his rythym abnormalities which consisted of episodic runs of asymptomatic SVT.
This was eventually discontinued on POD 6 after TTE was negative for cardiac embolic source and patient was deemed very high risk for anticoagulation therapy considering his history of drinking and falls.
From a rehabilitation standpoint, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unsteady with poor balance and a high fall risk during ambulation sessions with physical therapy.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
