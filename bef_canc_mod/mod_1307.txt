Admission Date:  [**2168-10-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-10-9**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, hypercholesterolemia, anemia, with a recent admission for congestive heart failure and new onset atrial fibrillation, failed cardioversion times two, and received biventricular pacemaker, and recently started on Coumadin.
He [**Year (4 digits) **] any syncope, falls, bright red blood per rectum, or a history of gastrointestinal problems prior to this admission.
He said that he had been feeling weak since he was discharged in [**2168-7-26**] and has noticed several black stools on the days prior to admission.
He [**Year (4 digits) **] any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**10-8**] which showed nodularity and petechiae in the esophagus, antral erosions in the stomach; consistent with aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced erosive gastropathy.
There were no other problems in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and his hematocrit rose after the transfusions, and he was hemodynamically stable.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20%).
Peripheral vascular disease; status post arthrectomy.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Renal artery stenosis.
History of femoral-popliteal bypass and aortofemoral bypass.
Atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed no scleral icterus.
There was no conjunctival pallor.
His oropharynx revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
There were no lesions or exudates.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at left upper sternal border.
He had no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.
He had a well-healed midline scar.
Extremity examination revealed no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
He had Helicobacter pylori serologies pending from his esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Of note, an echocardiogram in [**2168-7-26**] revealed an ejection fraction of less than 25%, left atrial mild dilation, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
His esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2168-10-8**] revealed no blood in the stomach, small prepyloric benign ulcerations with no evidence of active bleeding, small duodenal ulcerations, and mild diffuse gastritis.
In the middle third of the esophagus was noted patchy nodularity and petechiae of the mucosa with a stigmata of recent bleeding.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  Given his history of upper gastrointestinal bleed and admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was followed by the Gastrointestinal Service when he came out to the floor.
He was hemodynamically stable the whole time, and his stools remained occult-blood positive.
There seemed to be no other signs of rebleeding.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 25%.
It was felt appropriate at this time to restart his beta blocker given the stability of his blood pressure and his hematocrit and no further evidence of bleeding.
He also has a history of recent new onset atrial fibrillation; status post biventricular pacemaker placement.
He was continued on his amiodarone, and his Coumadin was held in the setting of a recent gastrointestinal bleed.
There was no evidence of atrial fibrillation while he was admitted.
He also has a history of coronary artery disease and ruled out for a myocardial infarction on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Lastly, the patient also has a history of hypertension.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, as previously mentioned, with an ejection fraction of less than 25%.
He was given Lasix with transfusions in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with no evidence of pulmonary edema or hypoxia.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and on transfer to the floor his creatinine was 2.4.
It was felt that this was most likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed; likely secondary to erosive gastropathy.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
