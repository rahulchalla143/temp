Admission Date:  [**2127-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Occipital wound drainage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Occipital Wound exploration   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 67 y/o right handed female who underwent an occipital craniotomy for resection of cerebellar mass found to be metastatic adenocarcinoma.
She presented with visual hallucinations and discharge from her crainotomy wound.
There is some green drainage with dehiscence at the superior aspect of the wound.
The patient recently moved to a different nursing home, and the nursing home became concerned when the patient occasionally complained of visual hallucinations (she saw people dancing at night, saw her granddaughter dancing, though people were ice skating across her room at night).
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: She has a history of dermatomyositis and non-small cell lung cancer, left deep vein thrombosis, and right  breast cancer.
Past Surgical History: She had a right mastectomy for her breast  cancer and a wedge resection of the lower lobe of the left lung for adenocarcinoma.
Family History: Her mother is alive but she has a history of deep vein thrombosis and diabetes.
Her father died at the age of 41 from a myocardial infarction.
She has 2 sisters; one has breast cancer but she is alive.
Her brother died at age 49 from a myocardial infarction.
HEENT: Patient has 4 inch healing vertical craniotomy scar on her occiput, the top of the wound has detached and some slight white fluid can be seen draining, there is slight erythema around the outside of wound Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.

Again noted, there is an area of air and fluid collection at the location of previously seen brain mass with adjacent small amount of pneumocephalus and hypodensity of the cerebellum, mildly decreased in size since prior exam.
Prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial spaces is related to age-appropriate atrophy.
Multiple periventricular and subcortical hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
There is a 5.7 x 2.6 x 5.8 cm air and fluid collection within the subgaleal region of the posterior scalp at the location of prior surgery, which is new since prior exam.
Adjacent mild inflammatory changes and punctate foci of air extending in the subgaleal space are also seen.
No fracture is seen.
Cranioplasty and metallic plate placement is seen, stable.
Fluid in the right mastoid air cells is unchanged since prior exam.
A new area of fluid collection in suboccipital subgaleal region measuring up to 5.8 cm.
Stable air fluid collection in the posterior cranial fossa.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2127-7-18**] FINDINGS: There are postoperative changes seen with suboccipital craniectomy.
There is a fluid collection identified in the suboccipital region which contains areas of low signal which could be secondary to air.
There is edema seen in the right cerebellar hemisphere which appears to have increased from the previous study.
In addition, the enhancement at the margin of the surgical cavity on the surface of the cerebellum has also increased with thickening of the wall of the enhancement.
There is no significant change in mass effect on the fourth ventricle seen.
No supratentorial areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
There is fluid within the right mastoid air cells and the petrous apex cells.
No acute infarcts are seen within the brain.
IMPRESSION: Increase in size of the fluid collection in the suboccipital region which as measured on the sagittal post-gadolinium images has a thickness of nearly 3 cm compared to 2 cm on the previous study.
The vertical extent of the fluid collection has also increased from 5 cm to 6.5 cm.
Given the absence of restricted diffusion within the fluid collection, it is less likely to be a frank abscess.
However, the increased enhancement at the margin indicates increase in inflammation or recurrent neoplastic lesion.
Otherwise no new enhancing brain lesions or hydrocephalus seen.
There is pneumocephalus and some hyperdense material at the site of evacuation likely representing blood products.
There is no significant midline shift.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction differentiation, mass effect, or edema.
Periventricular white matter changes likely secondary to chronic microvascular disease are again seen.
On the right, there is intraluminal thrombus filling the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins, with minimal color flow demonstrated around the thrombus, compatible with nonocclusive DVT.
Minimal color flow is demonstrated within the left common femoral vein, suggestive that the thrombus is nonocclusive.
However, within the left superficial femoral vein, no color flow is demonstrated, compatible with an occlusive thrombus.
The left popliteal vein demonstrates normal flow and compressibility, without evidence of DVT.
On [**7-19**] she was taken to the OR for exploration and washout.
Post op CT images showed no EDH and normal post-op changes.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Heparin Infusion Please continue heparin IV infusion at rate to yeild PTT goal of 60-80, NO BOLUSES.
