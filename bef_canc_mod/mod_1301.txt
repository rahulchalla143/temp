male with history of AVMs and diverticulosis who noted frank blood with a bowel movement yesterday.
Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness or syncope, F/C, N/V with this bleeding.
As mentioned, patient has a history of GIB with multiple hospitalizations and is s/p a remote right hemicolectomy in [**2176**] for colon cancer.
A CTA abdomen showed extravasation of constrast from the sigmoid colon and patient was admitted to the MICU for further management.
Upon arrival, he was rapidly given 3 units of PRBCs and taken to IR where an angiogram showed no bleeding.
He was then brought back to the MICU for further observation, with the plan to involve GI and surgery and proceed to a tagged RBC scan if bleeding recurred.
His activity at home is limited by his spinal stenosis and resultant R leg neuropathic pain   Family History: His father died elderly of lung cancer; his mother had hypertension, and died at age 67 of a CVA.
Physical Exam: General: Awake, alert, NAD HEENT: NC/AT; PERRLA, EOMI; OP clear, nonerythematous Neck: Supple, no LAD Chest/CV: S1, S2 nl, III/VI systolic murmur heard best at apex w/ radiation into axilla Lungs: CTAB Abd: Soft, tender to palpation throughout without rebounding or guarding, + BS, no organomegaly Rectal: Frankly bloodly stool Ext: No c/c/e   Pertinent Results: CBC: [**2192-8-30**] WBC-11.0 RBC-5.28 Hgb-16.3 Hct-45.6 Plt Ct-197 [**2192-8-25**] Hct-33.0* [**2192-8-25**] Hct-37.5* Plt Ct-149* [**2192-8-25**] WBC-19.5*# RBC-3.55* Hgb-11.4* Hct-30.8* Plt Ct-112* [**2192-8-28**] Hct-44.4 [**2192-8-29**] WBC-11.3* RBC-5.33 Hgb-16.2 Hct-46.4 Plt Ct-193 .
CXR [**8-26**]: No definite pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum, but this study is limited in semiupright position.
Compared to prior study performed a day earlier, mild intersitial pulmonary edema has almost completely resolved.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There are no enlarging pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe opacity persists consistent with atelectasis.
An AVM is also possible in this patient with a history of duodenal AVM.
Slightly increasing size of mesenteric soft tissue masses with tethering of adjacent bowel loops.
There are also new soft tissue masses elsewhere in the mesentery.
These findings are nonspecific and may represent confluent lymphadenopathy related to lymphoma or other process, a primary mesenteric mass such as carcinoid or desmoid tumor, or mesenteric fibrosis.
RBC scan [**8-25**]: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with active bleeding, within the sigmoid colon, probably corresponding to area of hemorrhage noted on recent CT evaluation.
male with history of recurrent GIBs in the setting of known AVMs and diverticulosis, who presents with a chief complaint of hematochezia.
# LGIB: presented with hematochezia as above.
Pt has a history of AVMs and diverticulosis.
Initially question/concern for perforation given CT findings & tender abdomen.
Tagged red cell scan confirmed sigmoid colon source: active bleeding seen there.
Pt taken for angio, however, by that time, no bleeding was seen and no intervention was done.
The bleeding stopped on its own.
Hematocrit never dipped below 30, and remained stable (>40) when the bleeding stopped.
# Lymphadenopathy: Pt found to have progressive mesenteric lymphadenopathy on CT.
Pt had concerning symptoms (weakness and long term weight loss) and CT scan with worsening mesenteric LAD and matting concerning for metastasis of his prior malignancy.
Currently no plan for scope given recent significant bleed but may be reconsidered as outpatient.
# CAD: s/p stent (unsure of what kind) and not on Plavix/ASA.
Currently without chest pain, SOB and EKG unremarkable.
# Cellulitis: Patient developed erythema and warmth of the foot near the first MTP joint.
He was started on vancomycin x 1 dose with some improvement.
Full and currently painless joint ROM, unlikely to be septic arthritis.
He has no MRSA risk factors or past history; therefore empiric vancomycin was not given but his foot should be reassessed daily to monitor for worsening which might suggest need for MRSA coverage.
# Hypertension: Blood pressure meds held initially given concern for potential hemodynamic instability with large GI bleed.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed Acute blood loss anemia Hypertension Cellulitis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a GI bleed.
A bleeding scan showed that you had some bleeding in the colon.
The bleeding stopped on its own.
You wer started on Antibiotics for a small concern of bacteria moving from your gut into your blood.
Your vital signs were stable and as there was no evidence of re-bleeding you were transfered to a general medical floor.
Your right toe developed what appeared to be an infection although it may also be a first episode of gout.
