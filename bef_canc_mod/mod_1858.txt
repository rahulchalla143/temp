There is no focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.
Minimal increase in left basal opacity is noted that might be consistent with atelectasis/aspiration, although developing infectious process cannot be excluded.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without signs of overhydration.
Marked asymmetry caused by scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
CXR [**2128-7-16**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-13**]: Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.
Small right pleural effusion has increased since [**7-13**] and pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but there is no pulmonary edema.
In the MICU, she was kept on mechanical ventilation until upper airway edema decreased and vocal cords could be visualized.
2) Hypertension: Hypertensive on arrival to MICU.
4) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: While on ventilator, she developed leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR and sputum 4+ for GPC in pairs and clusters which ultimately grew MSSA and 2+ GNR consistent with haemophilus.
She will need to receive prednisone 20 mg daily x3 days in rehab for her angioedema and then she should be maintained on prednisone 10mg daily which is her home dose for her RA.
