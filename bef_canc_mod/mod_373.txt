Labs on discharge: [**2152-2-28**] ================== BUN: 51, creat: 1.4, bicarb: 34 Na: 139, K 3.9 Hct: 29.6, WBC: 7.2, Plt: 318  Ca: 9.7 Mg: 2.1 P: 4.6     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**] is a 72 year-old man with h/o CVA with expressive aphasia, OSA, AS, CAD, OSA on BiPap, chronic systolic CHF (EF30-35%) and thalassemia who was admitted for a CHF exacerbation.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient with chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure admitted for acute exacerbation.
He was very volume overloaded on admission with weight 138kg (dry weight ~122kg).
He was initially diuresed with torsemide 40mg IV and lasix gtt with very low urine output and worsening Cr.
His respiratory status worsened, likely in setting of pulmonary edema complicated by his underlying pulmonary process.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**2152-2-8**] for further management and was inubated for poor oxygenation on non-rebreathing mask.
He was then transitioned to po torsemide and was discharged on torsemide 40 mg po daily along with a 1.5 L fluid restriction.
#RESPIRATORY: Patient has several underlying respiratory comorbidities including OSA, pulmonary hypertension, Obesity hypoventilation syndrome who has baseline hypercarbia and relative hypoxemia.
He was intubated on [**2152-2-8**] and he was difficult to extubate, likely in setting of underlying comorbid pulmonary issues and decompensated CHF.
On discharge, he was no longer requiring nasal cannula.
#Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Patient developed ventilator associated pneumonia with sputum growing 2 species of enterobacter cloacea and one species klebsiella pneumoniae.
He completed an 8 day course of cefepime with resolution of his symptoms.
# Aortic stenosis - severe, area 1.0cm2 in [**11-18**] with repeat TTE showing valve area 0.8cm2.
Prior to admission, pt reports transient episodes of dizziness and pre-syncopal symptoms which are likely related to AS.
He was seen by CT [**Doctor First Name **] who identified him as a poor candidate for surgery and was subsequently evaluated by the Aortic Stenosis Service for possible percutaenous AVR who also felt that he was a poor candidate for an intervention.
It was explained to the family that pt would likely continue to have acute CHF episodes despite maximal medical treatment and suggested that family and pt consider DNR/DNI and possible comfort care.
Patient had no sign of ACS on presentation.
Troponins elevated on admission were most likely related to CKD.
# Acute renal failure - His baseline is a Cr 1.0 in from a [**11-18**] history of acute failure to Cr 7 in setting of diuresis.
Fe Urea was 4% indicating poor renal perfusion, likely in the setting of CHF.
# CVA: In [**2145**], he had a left MCA stroke with with 2/2 expressive aphasia, motor planning deficits, right-sided neglect.
He was on coumadin in the past, but stopped due to GI bleed.
At present, he has guiaic positive stools but a stable hct.
He is not a candidate for a colonoscopy.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath.
You had a great deal of volume overload with fluid in your lungs which likely worsened your breathing.
An echocardiogram was done of your heart which showed worsening heart failure.
You will need to weigh yourself every day in the morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - Decrease Torsemide to once daily - start senna, miralax, bisacodyl and colace to prevent constipation - Discontinue albuterol and atrovent nebs - Increase Metoprolol to 50 mg daily - Increase omeprazole to twice daily  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Location: [**Hospital1 641**] Address: [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 718**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2258**] APpt:  We are working on an appt for you and the office will call you at home with the appt.
