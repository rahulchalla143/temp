Echo [**10-19**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the ventricle.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Aortic stenosis is not suggested.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a bipolar left hip hemiarthroplasty with cemented femoral stem.
A poorly visualized fracture of the proximal femoral shaft has been fixated by apparent large osseous allografts with associated cerclage wires and long lateral plate (with four screws below the tip of the femoral stem).
Overall appearances are unchanged from [**2128-10-8**] with no focal bone destruction or evidence of hardware loosening.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change.
No radiographic evidence infection or loosening.
[**10-22**] LLE U/S UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT Reason: please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid collection .
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with grp B strep bacteremia with history of left hip fracture last year, hardware in place.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid collection INDICATION: Left leg swelling.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
# Grp B strep septicemia: this was felt to be likely due to GU source given active urinalysis, though urine cx negative.
Of note, a Left hip plain film and LLE u/s to r/o fluid collection showed no significant findings.
The longer course was recommended by ID as the exact source of the bacteremia was unclear and endocarditis was not fully ruled out.
Pump:  the patient was slightly overloaded after fluid resusciation in the ICU.
Per the family, the patient has a history of several falls.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2351**] his ICU admission, given relative bradycardia, he had his pacer interrogated and the settings were modified to increase his baseline HR.
Per discussion with his sons, the patient gets extremely confused during most hospital admissions.
Detrol was discontinued d/t possibility for anticholingeric effects.
Given the patient's immoblitiy, a CT scan was ordered which did not show a PE, but only RLL atelectasis and evidence of emphysema.
The etiology was felt to be from atelectasis and immobility.
The patient would likely benefit from outpt PFTs to characterize the degree of his obstructive lung disease.
Atrovent 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
