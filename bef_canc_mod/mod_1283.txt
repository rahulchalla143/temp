The patient now presents with increased shortness of breath x1 day even at rest, worsening with orthopnea, also complaints of right-sided chest pain, 5- [**8-8**], different from her myocardial ischemic pain, which is left-sided at baseline, no anginal symptoms, able to walk 2 blocks before getting short of breath, baseline blood pressure runs at 170/100, prior to dialysis and 150/80 to 90, postdialysis.
