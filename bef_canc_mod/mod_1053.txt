Admission Date:  [**2182-12-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-1-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-4-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery Service  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease (status post a myocardial infarction in [**2167**]) who presented to [**Hospital3 9683**] on [**12-20**] with progressive shortness of breath.
He had been treated for a presumed bronchitis approximately three weeks prior to the admission and experienced minimal relief of symptoms.
He was admitted with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and was aggressively diuresed.
The patient denied any chest pain, nausea, diaphoresis, or dizziness.
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2167**].
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Aortic stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   The patient's review of systems was positive for increased fatigue for the last three weeks.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, his heart rate was 82 (in atrial fibrillation), and his respiratory rate was approximately 20.
On general examination the patient was an obese white gentleman in no apparent distress.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with a [**3-8**] murmur heard best at the apex.
No jugular venous distention.
No bruits were noted.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was obese and softly distended.
There were hypoactive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram was done at that time which showed the patient was in atrial fibrillation at 93 beats per minute with a left bundle-branch block.
The cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of approximately 29%.
The 3-vessel disease included the proximal left anterior descending artery with an 80% stenosis, the left circumflex with a 70% stenosis just after the first obtuse marginal, an 80% stenosis before LPL and the left posterior descending artery, an 80% stenosis between the L-A and left posterior descending artery, and a 90% stenosis of the right coronary artery.
The patient was then referred to the Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint and was gently weaned off his ventilatory support and eventually extubated on [**12-29**].
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with his rate controlled between 85 and 90 beats per minute.
The patient's insulin drip was quickly weaned to off, and the patient was started on a heparin drip due to his chronic atrial fibrillation.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with rare premature ventricular contractions noted.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation with heart rates approximately in the 90s.
On postoperative day four, the patient experienced a moderate amount of nausea and vomited once in the morning.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated erythema and friability of the mucosa of the stomach with contact bleeding noted in the fundus.
By postoperative day five, the patient had further bouts of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
The patient still complained of a fair amount of diarrhea and fecal incontinence.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation and was started on beta blockade.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with heart rates dropping down to 40 to 50 beats per minute.
It was determined that there was no indication for a pacemaker at this time, but the patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service throughout his hospital stay.
The patient was tolerating this diet well and not experiencing any further bouts of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
The patient was restarted on a heparin drip at 500 cc per hour for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient continued to be followed by Physical Therapy and was making slow but steady progress.
The patient continued to be mildly unsteady with a wide gait.
There were some questionable mental status changes that were noted throughout the day.
This was manifested by short-term memory loss and poor recollection of surgery.
As a result of this, the patient was extensively examined for infectious or metabolic causes.
Carotid Doppler studies were also done to examine whether or not a poor blood flow was the culprit.
Over the next couple of days the patient continued to have transient short-term memory loss but regained orientation to time, place, and self.
The patient underwent a head computed tomography to rule out a hemorrhage or infarction.
This results of this study indicated a few scattered low attenuations within the centrum semiovale suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There were no hemorrhages noted.
The magnetic resonance imaging indicated no evidence of acute ischemia, but did reveal an increased signal of the cortex of the left frontal lobe which was consistent with a small prior infarction.
There were also hyperintensities noted within the periventricular white matter indicating chronic microvascular infarction.
Over the next few days, the patient continued to do well with few instances of memory loss or disorientation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and irregular rhythm.
His sternal wound was clean, dry, and intact only with Steri-Strips present.
His lung examination revealed that his breathing was even and nonlabored.
The patient's lower extremities revealed 1+ edema with no erythema or rashes.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING ON DISCHARGE:  A chest x-ray showed a very small left pleural effusion with no signs of infiltrate.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge was good; the patient was afebrile, ambulating independently, pain well controlled on oral medications, and tolerating a regular diet without difficulty.
Haloperidol 1-mg tablets one tablet by mouth twice per day as needed (for agitation or anxiety times 10 days).
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2167**].
Status post gastrointestinal bleed in [**2179**].
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
