Admission Date:  [**2154-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-12-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-10-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Palpitations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 16063**] is a 75M with history of atrial fibrillation on aspirin, non-small cell lung cancer status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation and excision, ulcerative colitis, and bladder cancer status post radical cystectomy and neobladder who presents from an outside hospital with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Of note, he was admitted recently to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Date range (1) 16065**], during which time he developed rapid atrial fibrillation to 140s-150s in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia.
On that admission, he was transferred to the medical ICU after he became hypotensive following 5mg IV metoprolol x3 for attempted rate control.
Upon awakening on the morning of admission, he felt lightheaded and dizzy and later developed an intermittent dull ache in his left chest, radiating to the ipsilateral shoulder, [**5-21**] in intensity and not reliably associated with activity.
He endorses chills without documented fever, as well as mild shortness of breath at rest unchanged from baseline and without cough.
He denies weight gain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea/orthopnea, or peripheral edema.
He has been exposed to relatives with upper respiratory symptoms, but has not himself experienced upper respiratory symptoms and denies dysuria/hematuria; chronic diarrhea in the setting of ulcerative colitis has been consistent with baseline.
His son notes that his father typically develops atrial fibrillation in the setting of infection, however.
CTA demonstrated no pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology, but did reveal post-treatment changes to the left lung with trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, which may reflect aspiration or atelectasis/scarring.

EKG ([**2154-11-23**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Right axis deviation.
Low limb lead voltage.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has appeared and the axis is more rightward.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 112	0	86	322/413	0	95	3  EKG ([**2154-11-24**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Low limb lead voltage and right axis deviation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-11-23**] no diagnostic interim change.
Stable top normal heart size with evidence of volume overload consistent with provided diagnosis of right ventricular regurgitation.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Changes of prior left upper lung and chest wall resection due to non-small cell lung cancer with multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes concerning for recurrence with bibasilar septal thickening potentially related to pulmonary edema, with lymphangitic tumor infiltration is a less likely consideration.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar and lingular opacities, which could reflect aspiration or an infectious process.
Due to nodular nature of the lingular opacity, short term interval follow up (6-8 weeks) is recommended, to assess for resolution.
In the right lung, there is an increase in interstitial markings, notably at the lung bases and in the right lower lung.
In addition, there is blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, suggesting the presence of a small right pleural effusion.
The findings in the right lung might represent a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
CXR [**2154-11-27**] Patient has had left upper thoracoplasty, usually for tuberculosis or lung cancer.
Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung has worsened since [**11-23**], probably pulmonary edema, accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion.
Predominant abnormality in the axillary region of the right upper lobe could be concurrent pneumonia, but I am not surprised by asymmetric distribution of edema in this patient with moderate-to-severe emphysema and scarring at the right lung apex.
No pneumothorax.

<< Active Issues  # Atrial fibrillation: On admission, patient was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation, largely to 110s and transiently to 140s-160s with activity, but remained hemodynamically stable on short-acting diltiazem 60mg qid in place of home diltiazem ER 240mg daily, with blood pressures in the 100s-110s systolic.
Although no clear reversible cause was initially apparent, he later developed signs of a possible community-acquired pneumonia, for which he was treated with antibiotics as below.
On the morning of hospital day 2, he became transiently hypotensive (SBP mid-80s) and hypoxic (mid-80s% on room air), with improvement in blood pressure to the high-90s systolic and oxygen saturation to the low 90s% on room air on recheck.
Following conversion to sinus rhythm on hospital day 2 without dedicated intervention, amiodarone load 400mg tid was initiated along with dabigatran 150mg [**Hospital1 **]; use of dabigatran was discussed with gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], given known ongoing refractory ulcerative colitis.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: Although admission CTA chest demonstrated bibasilar and lingular opacities possibly reflective of aspiration or infection, antibiotics were held initially in the absence of clinical signs clearly attributable to pneumonia, including lack of fever, leukocytosis, or productive cough.
When patient developed low-grade fever to 100.3, increased Wbc (6.8-6.9 to 10.5), and nonproductive cough in association with possible right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone/azithromycin was initiated.
Unfortunately the patient became progressively more hypoxic despite adequate rate control for his atrial fibrillation and on [**2154-11-26**] was broadened to vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin for HCAP coverage.
He remained afebrile/hemodynamically stable without leukocytosis for the remainder of admission and was discharged on cefpodoxime and azithromycin, for a total 10 day antibiotic course.
# Chest ache: In this patient with no known history of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome in the setting of dull left chest ache was excluded on the basis of serial EKGs without acute ischemic changes and absence of troponinemia.
Chest ache resolved without dedicated intervention.
# History of non-small cell lung cancer: In this patient with history of non-small cell lung cancer status post chemotherapy/radiation and multiple operative interventions, CTA chest on admission revealed multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes concerning for recurrence of malignancy, with bibasilar septal thickening potentially related to pulmonary edema, with lymphangitic tumor infiltration a less likely consideration.
# Normocytic anemia: Hct remained 29-32 throughout admission, consistent with recent baseline.
He remained largely hemodynamically stable, with the exception of transient hypotension as above, without active signs of bleeding throughout admission.
# History of non-small cell lung cancer: CTA chest on admission revealed findings concerning for possible recurrence of malignancy, which were shared with the patient and family members.
CT also demonstrated a nodular lingular opacity, with short-term interval follow-up (6-8 weeks) advised to assess for resolution.

As you know, you were admitted  for atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia.
Yout atrial fibrillation initially was treated with amiodarone, which was later discontinued in the setting of breathing difficulty.
You also were started on dabigatran for stroke prevention.
You were found to have pneumonia during this admission and treated with intravenous antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
You were admitted briefly to the intensive care unit in the setting of breathing difficulty, but made good progress and subsequently returned to the floor for further recovery.
