Cardiomegaly is again noted with large tapering left pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Osseous structures reveal a compression fracture in the upper- to-mid thoracic spine which is new since [**2156-1-19**].
CT head [**5-5**] - IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or fracture.
US liver [**5-5**] - Moderate ascites with gall bladder wall thickening and edema, unchanged from prior study, likely due to third spacing.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Extensive atherosclerosis is present in the coronary arteries and there is an aberrant origin of the right coronary artery which traverses between the aortic root and the pulmonary artery.
Cardiomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusion as well as ascites could represent congestive cardiac failure.
There has been significant interval increase in the right pleural effusion with almost complete collapse/atelectasis of the left lung.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged since the prior examination and may be assessed further to exclude indolent lymphoma.
Echo [**5-13**] - A small secundum atrial septal defect is present (cine loop #34).
There is mostly left-to-right shunting, but after injection of aerated saline into the right atrium, right-to-left bubble transit is seen, as well.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal [**Month/Year (2) 7216**] septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to annular dilation.
Small secundum ASD with bidirectional flow.
CT of head [**5-13**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
Old infarct of the left frontal lobe and insula as well as the left thalamus.
No acute intra-abdominal process is seen.
There is no evidence of ischemic bowel.
Moderate free intraperitoneal fluid is seen.
Dilated common bile duct without evidence of an obstructing lesion.
Therefore, an MRCP is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
Areas of consolidation at the lung bases as detailed above.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces appear normal.
There are old lacunar infarcts in the centrum semiovale bilaterally visualized with adjacent view of this.
There is no evidence of an acute infarct.
There is no evidence of intracranial edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
There is hyperintensity visualized in both mastoid air cells suggestive of fluid within the mastoid air cells.
There are multiple susceptibility artifacts visualized in the left temporal lobe, right aspect of the pons, and in both cerebellar hemispheres, which may represent multiple cavernomas or dystrophic calcifications.
Visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses appear normal.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm (greater than 3 mm), flow-limiting stenosis, or occlusion.
CXR [**5-22**] - Increased consolidation of left lung, which could be compatible with pneumonia or aspiration.
No definitive epileptiform abnormalities were, however, seen.
US upper extremity [**5-27**] - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
EKG [**6-1**] - Compared to prior tracing irregular sinus mechanism at rate about 55 has replaced atrial flutter.
There are occasional atrial premature beats and ventricular premature beats.
Generalized low voltage remains.
In addition, there is Q-T interval prolongation consistent with drug effect and also rightward axis.
Anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age cannot be excluded in either tracing.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo F with DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, CHF w/ RV failure, who p/w altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Was successfully extubated and had several days of altered mental status, where she was uncommunicative and unable to eat.
Had intact mental status with some memory problems upon discharge.
Pt was emperically treated w/ Vanc/Meropenem, then was switched to cefepime for possible PNA (now s/p 10-D course).
Pt also has a L-sided chronic pleural effusion (exudative), pt is s/p thoracentesis of 1.5 L w/ exudate, but no infection.
Pt had a possible seizure during thoracentesis, so she was intubated and started on neosynepherine.
Neuro was consulted and EEG showed no seizure activity.
LP was performed w/o evidence of bacterial meningitis, however pt was placed on acyclovir.
Pt has stayed in ICU [**12-27**] mental status which waxes and wanes, and at best the pt is resposive to only some simple commands.
Pt does reportely have some baseline altered mental status, but is signifcantly changed from baseline.
On the floor, the patient continued to have significantly altered mental status.
She was uncommunicative and would follow some simple commands.
She had episodes of atrial flutter with [**Date Range 13223**] into the 110s/120s.
Pt also had c.diff infection diagnosed.
Please see below for specific details of each problem...  # Altered mental status: At baseline pt able to walk from chair to bathroom, and communicate.
Pt's mental status declined while in pt when she became hypotensive.
The differential consists of seizure (EEG x2 did not show seizure activity) or encephalitis (HSV-but PCR was negative, and CSF studies WNL) or a global hypoxia or a metabolic encephalopathy.
No radiologic evidence of intracranial pathology.
Pt believed to have seizure during thoracotomy as stated above.
Likely cause of mental status changes was multifactorial - including metabolic derangements from kidney and liver disease.
# [**Month/Year (2) **]: Unclear etiology, originally thought due to possible pneumonia, as stated above, pt required pressers in ICU.
Echo showed no pericardial effusion or tamponade.
She will be on no antihypertensive medicines on discharge.
# Possible PNA, hypoxia: with coughs (though no leukocytosis, no fever).
CXR showed worsening pleural effusion and collapse of LLL initially.
Pt treated with empiric vancomycin and meropenem (switched from imipenem due to lower seizure threshold from imipenem)for 10 day course.
# Arrhythmia: In ICU pt had transient [**Month/Year (2) 13223**] which improved with IVF, pt alternated between sinus tach and atrial tach.
Improved somewhat w/metoprolol, which was later stoped d/t bradycardia into the 30s.
No PE on chest CTA.
While on floor, patient converted into atrial flutter with rates between 110 and 130.
# Effusions: large left pleural effusion.
Prior fluid analysis showed exudative process, w/o identifiable cause, cytology negative as well.
Pt continues to have effusions, but not symptomatic.
# Transaminitis: Likely due to congestive hepatitis in setting of RV failure.
Pt does have elevated INR, likely d/t some liver dysfunction.
No evidence of liver pathology on any imaging studies.
# Hyperlipidemia: statin was held in setting of transaminitis.
# ESRD/HD: On HD MWF.
Pt will need to continue HD upon discharge MWFs for fluid status management.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt had several episodes of hypoglycemia in ICU, likely in setting of NPO; got dextrose and FS improved after adjusted RISS.
Continued to have episodes of hypoglycemia while on floor and there was no way to have nutritional support (no NGT or PEG and somnelent).
Pt then started to have improved mental status.
Endocrine team was also following and ruled out insulinoma as possible cause.
Insulin level was low and c-peptide was likely elevated because it is usually cleared by the kidney.
# DM:  held all diabetic medicines due to hypoglycemia.
# C.diff - had diarrhea during most of her time on the floor.
She was still having diarrhea at the time, but no white count, fevers or abdominal pain.
# New thoracic compression fracture: pt asymptomatic, no treatment.
# Megaloblastic anemia: B12 and folate levels are normal, unclear etiology, was monitored and remained stable throughout admission.
# Code: FULL.
Family is aware of her end organ failure and fragile state.
Altered Mental Status of multifactorial etiology 2.  chronic liver disease with ascites, likely secondary to R heart failure 3.  chronic kidney disease stage V 4.
C.difficile colitis  Secondary diagnoses: 1.
Siezure disorder 2.
Anemia 3.
Compression Fracture 4.
Pt was unable to ambulate by herself, she was able to walk a short distance with the help of physical therapy.
She was having diarrhea at the time of discharge.
It was thought that you may have had a pneumonia, and there was fluid in your lungs.
We were worried because your blood sugar kept dropping low, probably due to your kidney failure and poor nutritional stores.
You also had an irregular heart beat at times.
You also were diagnosed with an infection of your bowels call c.diff.
