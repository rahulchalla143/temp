HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman admitted on [**9-27**] from an outside hospital for evaluation of type B aortic dissection and concern for pulmonary embolus.
He presented four days ago with chest pain located in the middle of the chest with radiation to his back and also down to his arm.
The patient was discharged home after a workup for myocardial infarction on [**9-25**].
The patient presented again with increased chest pain and had a computed tomography which was notable for type B aortic dissection.
His denies any recent fevers or chills.
He has had an increased weight loss over the last several months.
Besides that, no other complaints.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
A remote history of thyroglossal cyst resection in [**2146**].
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2186-9-4**].
Hernia repair in [**2179**].
FAMILY HISTORY:   No family history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
In general, in no acute distress and comfortable.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear bilaterally with very mild left lower lobe decreased breath sounds.
No crackles or wheezes were noted.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse/consolidation with associated layered pleural effusion.
Also with right-sided atelectasis.
Cardiomegaly without evidence of overt heart failure.
A computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary edema.
A left-sided pleural effusion and a dissection which was unchanged when compared  to an earlier study.
Computed tomography showed a type B dissection from the left subclavian to the diaphragm.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for evaluation of type B dissection.
Since the day prior to discharge, his blood pressure medications were readjusted and the frequency was changed from 500 mg by mouth twice per day to 300 mg by mouth three times per day to achieve better blood pressure control and without any more evidence of hypotensive episodes.
In terms of his pulmonary status, the patient pleural effusion was most likely secondary to his dissection.
He received a magnetic resonance imaging on the day prior to discharge which showed no change from the previous magnetic resonance imaging when he was first admitted in terms of the dissection or the pleural effusion.
The patient was to follow up with his primary care physician to actually see the progression of the pleural effusion and the dissection.
So far, no change.
In terms of Infectious Disease, the patient had a one-time temperature increase to 101 on admission; however, he has been afebrile since, and no acute Infectious Disease issues since admission.
On the day prior to discharge, the patient had multiple bowel movements which he noted to have relieved the mild abdominal pain that he was experiencing.
Since then, he had no other complaints except mild dizziness which was most likely secondary to his decreased blood pressures.
The patient was instructed to call of follow up if he experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain.
Followup with Cardiology is important secondary to his dissection.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed with ulceration in [**2186-8-4**].
Status post Whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer in [**2186-8-4**].
MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  The patient had a computed tomography in [**2186-9-4**] with complex type B dissection.
No pulmonary embolus was noted.
In [**2186-9-4**] a magnetic resonance imaging was done which showed thoracic aortic aneurysm with large mural hematoma and separate focal dissection in descending thoracic aorta.
A repeat magnetic resonance imaging on [**10-5**] to compare versus prior showed no changes.
