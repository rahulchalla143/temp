Admission Date:  [**2171-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-4-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lipitor / Amoxicillin / Erythromycin Base / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Procainamide / Zocor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Confusion / Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 87 yo male with history of CAD,A fib, dCHF (EF 55%), pHTN, PAD who presented to the ED from his nursing home with altered mental status and hypoxia.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and hypoxia in [**12-26**] in the setting of an aspiration pneumonia.
Additionally, he was having an element of increasing confusion, with visual hallucination and disorientation.
He had been treated with levofloxacin for the last 4 days for a pneumonia seen on CXR and his lasix was increased from 40mg to 60mg daily.
It is unclear the exact order of what component of these symptoms began after starting the levofloxacin.
On the morning of presentation, he was having increased confusion, and was noted bo the hypoxic.
He had some degree of hypotension in the ED, with systolics in the high 80s.

Bilateral pericardial hazy opacities likely represent epicardial fat pads.
Low lung volumes slightly limit evaluation.
No focal consolidation is present.
A paratracheal curvilinear density on the right is of uncertain etiology.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient had one episode of hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures of 80.
Given his mild acute renal failure, likely this is related to hypovolemia.
Dry mucous membranes on exam consistent with volume depleation.
No clinical evidence of pneumonia by symptoms, CXR, or [**Last Name (LF) 108201**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] low suspicison of septic etiology.
No clinical evidence of pneumonia.
CXR without consolidation, no symptoms of cough or fevers, and no leukocytosis.
Patient does have a history of dCHF, but no pulmonary edema on CXR, flat JVP, and dry MM.
CXR does show pleural plaques, low O2 sats may be the product of chronic lung disease versus effects of scilent aspiration.
He should follow up with a pulmonologist and get an outpatient chest CT/PFTs.
No evidence of infection, with out pneumonia on CXR, no fevers/chills, negative UA.
No focal neurologic deficits, and no history of fall, so did not get a head CT.  With holding of meds and addressing ARF, symptoms resolved.
# Positive urine culture:  Pseudomonas on urine culture, which has been present in the past.
No evidence of UTI based off UA, and this was believed to be colonization in the setting of a chronic indwelling foley.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal given volume depletion and hypotension.
PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat non-healing ulcer in [**12-26**].
CAD: No acute process, trop mildly elevated likely secondary to acute on chronic renal failure.
It appears the patient's ACE-I has been held since [**Month (only) **] because of falls and low blood pressures.
Will hold lasix in the setting of acute renal failure.
Monitor for signs of volume overload.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
History of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/uretheral stricture.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for foot pain: hold for sedation or RR<12.
Collagenase Clostridium hist.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered Mental Status Asbestosis lung disease Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable, breathing comfortably on 1L of oxygen  DNR/DNI   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and hypoxia, and cared for in the ICU due to concern for low blood pressure on presentation.
Your confusion was likely the consequence of medications (levofloxacin and oxycodone) in the setting of acute renal failure due to dehydration.
There is no evidence of pneumonia, and your chest XR findings are more consistent with chronic pleural disease which will need outpatinet follow up including a pulmonogy appoitnment and chest CT.
You will need a chest CT to evaluate your abnormal chest XR findings.
