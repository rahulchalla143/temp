Admission Date:  [**2129-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Diphenhydramine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: MCC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 59 yo M with hx of MCC with R parietoocciptal traumatic contusion.
At the time he had a c/o head and abd pain.
He sustained a large R forehead laceration.
While being sutured at the OSH he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 1 minute and self resolved.
He had a prolonged post-ictal states and was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
Neurosurgery evaluation for R parietal-occipital bleed vs. contusion.
Right posterior partietal contusion with vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle without shift of midline structures.
Underlying mass cannot be excluded.
Large frontal subgaleal hematoma.
No evidence of acute injury in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
No evidence of acute fracture or subluxation.
Recommend direct visualization to rule out underlying lesion.
Right posterior parietal contusion is much less prominent on today's study, consistent with evolving left parietal hemorrhage.
Resultant vasogenic edema is relatively similar in appearance compared to the most recent prior examination.
Nondisplaced right nasal bone fracture again noted.
Bilateral ethmoidal air cells with mucosal thickening.
Area of increased signal intensity, in the right parietal lobe measuring approximately 5.4 x 3.6 cm, with associated swelling of the adjacent cortex, and effacement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle with vague curvilinear areas of enhancement scattered in the lesion along with a few areas of slightly decreased diffusion.
Contusion/hemorrhage- subacute hematoma is less likely given the lack of negative susceptibility foci and decreased attenuation and lack of hemorrhage on the prior CT head study.
Edema with overlying cortical thickening and sulcal effacement in the right parietal lobe, unchanged compared to most recent prior exams.
TTE [**5-17**]: EF greater than 55% IMPRESSION: No PFO, ASD or cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild LVH with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No clinically-significan valvular disease seen.
He also underwent a Brain MRI to r/o an underlying brain mass.
The MRI  showed area of increased signal intensity, in the right parietal lobe measuring approximately 5.4 x 3.6 cm.
Carotid dopplers showed less than 40 percent stenosis bilaterally.
At the time of dischage he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.

Caduet  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Traumatic Brain Injury Right parietal-occipital brain contusion Seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
