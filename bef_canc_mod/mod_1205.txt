Admission Date:  [**2136-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension and hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] is a 51 yo M with a h/o diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia on chronic steroids since [**2-/2136**], pulmonary emboli off coumadin [**3-6**] GI bleed, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and difficult intubation with recent hospitalization for shoulder pain s/p fall who was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic (SBPs in the 70s and SaO2 88%) on follow up clinic visit in the setting of abrupt cessation of steroids for cryptogenic organizing PNA (decreased from 25/day x 5 days to 5/day).
He received vanc and zosyn x1 for presumed bilateral lower extremity cellulitis.
CXR was clear, sats progressively decreased to 86% on 5L, improving to 99% on NRB, received 10 mg of decadron for presumed adrenal insufficiency, had ARF with Cr of 3.9 from baseline of 0.9 with good UOP, hyponatremia (129), troponin negative x2, EKG with NSR and no ST changes.
There was concern for pulmonary emboli, especially given past history but no CTA was performed due to ARF and no heparin gtt started.
Thus, hypotension was felt most likely due to adrenal insufficiency.
Hypoxia: Felt due to acute respiratory acidosis and acute metabolic alkalosis from worsening chronic lung disease in setting of rapid steroid taper vs. volume overload (proBNP 106, >99% NPV, though morbidly obese).
Autodiuresesd 1.7L in ICU with no diuretics.
D-dimer slightly elevated at 630.
LENIs were negative for DVT.

Sinus rhythm.
Low precordial voltage.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   [**2136-11-6**] 3:36 PM IMPRESSION: Increased densities in distribution similar to prior examinations could represent worsening of previously diagnosed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or possible superimposed edema.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT [**2136-11-7**] 7:44 AM IMPRESSION: No DVT in bilateral lower extremity.Bilateral peroneal veins could not be identified reliably.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-11-7**] 4:48 PM IMPRESSION: Bilateral upper lobe/left lower lobe reticulation, stable since [**2136-8-16**] is in an unusual distribution for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
Ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes has markedly improved since [**2136-6-7**] .
Minor new left lower lobe basal segment atelectasis.
There is no acute fracture or dislocation about the shoulder.
In the imaged right lung apex, there are extensive alveolar opacities, better evaluated on the chest CT, from the same date.
No acute fracture or dislocation.
Pulmonary opacities, better evaluated on the recent CT.  Brief Hospital Course: Hypotension: On transfer to the MICU, Levophed was discontinued, and systolic blood pressures stabilized in the 110s with dexamethasone, 1L IVF, and one dose of vancomycin and cefepime.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, and he denied chest discomfort.
Thus, hypotension was felt most likely due to adrenal insufficiency.
Hypoxia: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] hypoxia was felt to be due to acute respiratory acidosis and acute metabolic alkalosis from worsening chronic lung disease in the setting of a rapid steroid taper in addition to volume overload (as evidenced by recent weight gain, medication and diet noncompliance, and though proBNP was low at 106, his morbid obesity may artificially lower this result).
Following steroids and autodiuresis in the ICU, he was weaned to 2L NC with sats in low 90s; on transfer to the floor his O2 saturations were in the low 90s on room air, near baseline.
Pulmonary emboli was also considered as an etiology for his hypoxia, as his D-dimer was slightly elevated at 630, however LENIs were negative for DVT, he was not tachycardic, noncontrast chest CT showed no change from prior, and CTA could not be performed due to renal failure.
He was not considered a candidate for heparinization given recent history of a significant GI bleed, and his oxygenation status improved with steroids and diuresis (lasix 80mg IV X2).
Renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] nonoliguric renal failure was thought to be due to ischemic ATN (FeNa 3.5%).
He was diuresed with 80 mg IV lasix daily (given thought of poor forward flow contributing to his renal failure) and Cr continued to improve throughout hospitalization to 1.5 on discharge.
Cellulitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] chronic lower extremity cellulitis with venous stasis was treated empirically with vanomycin and cefepime while in the MICU for ?infectious sepsis.
He remained afebrile and lower extremity erythema remained stable, improved from baseline.
He was also started briefly on terbinafine for tinea pednis and onychomychosis management as these were felt to be exacerbating causes for his ongoing cellulitsi.
DM Type 2: Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was maintained on an insulin sliding scale and his evening basal lantus dose was adjusted daily.
Shoulder XRays were obtained which showed no acute fracture or dislocation.
He denied active suicidal ideation and was able to contract for safety.
Per his discussions with social work and psychiatry, he continues to live for his daughter's sake.
EtOH abuse: Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was noted to have asterixis and a mild intention tremor while in the MICU.
He placed on a CIWA scale and did not require any benzodiazepenes as he exhibited no autonomic instability or other symptoms of EtOH withdrawal.
He does not have a history of delirium tremens.
Anti-E antibody: On type and screen, Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was found to have a new diagnosis of Anti-E antibody.
E antigen is a member of Rhesus blood group system.
Anti-E is clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.
A wallet card and a letter stating the above will presumably be sent to the patient.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency Diastolic Heart Failure .
Secondary: Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia Pulmonary Embolus Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome Obstructive Sleep Apnea Alcohol Abuse Chronic Pain Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tracheobronchomalacia with difficult intubation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for low blood pressure and low oxygen levels.
While you are on higher doses of steroids, you will need more glargine/lantus insulin to prevent severely elevated blood sugars.
Please call your PCP should you have any very high or very low blood sugar values.
