Admission Date:  [**2115-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-6-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Motrin / Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**] Chief Complaint: CC: SOB, fever, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old African-American female with a  complicated past medical history significant for HIV CD4 986 ([**10-22**]), CAD s/p MI and PTCA, insulin dependent DM2, ESRD on HD, diastolic dysfunction, and history of PE on anticoagulation.
Recently hospitalized in early [**Month (only) 404**] for SOB/pleuritic left-sided chest pain and treated with antibiotics for likely pneumonia.
Admitted again later in [**Month (only) 404**] for left-sided chest pain during dialysis and ruled out by enzymes.
* Patient reports a 3 day history of non-productive cough, HA, sore throat, and fever/chills.
ROS also significant for decreased appetite, but taking fluids, + N/V ([**3-22**] x in last few days), + racing heart, chronic LQ abd pain (unchanged).
Received Metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 to slow rate, became hypotensive to SBP 70-80s, started on Levophed.
Also got Vancomycin/CTX/Flagyl, atrovent nebs, ASA/morphine/tylenol, solu-medrol 125mg, 2L NS * Currently, patient states that she has some shortness of breath but is feeling better.
CAD s/p NSTEMI [**5-19**], s/p PTCA/stent LCX [**2113**].
Persantine MIBI  [**4-22**] without symptoms or EKG changes.
MIBI images significant for severe fixed inferior defect, EF 58%.
DM type 2, on NPH.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Last echo [**2114-12-4**] with 4+MR, [**1-20**]+TR and complex aortic atheroma.
H/o multiple AVF clots, s/p thrombectomies, last in [**2115-1-8**]  8.
H/o GIB in the setting of coagulopathy and NSAIDs 9.
Eosinophilic pneumonia diagnosed [**4-22**], on chronic prednisone.
Anemia [**2-20**] CRF 11.
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosed in [**2113-4-18**].
RESP: Distant breath sounds.
Abdomen soft and mild tenderness to palp over LQ.
No rebound, guarding.
AVF left UE with thrill, NT, no erythema CVL right groin.
no ST-T changes * CXR: NO evidence of acute cardiopulmonary pathology * CTA: 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mucous impaction in the right upper lobe posterior subsegmental bronchus.
There are two (2) patchy areas of air space opacity within the left lung as described above.
These probably represent atypical foci of inflammation or infection.
However, given slight changes or architectural distortion, CT examination is recommended after appropriate treatment.
Chest x-ray ([**3-25**]) - early, mild congestive heart failure  * culture data-legionella urinary antigen positive for direct influenza A viral antigen blood cultures - [**3-24**]- NGTD C. diff toxin - [**3-24**] negative urine cultures- no growth  chest x-ray ([**4-4**]): [**Month/Year (2) 2182**],  no change since the prior examination.
No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
Chest CT ([**4-4**])-  1)  Interval progression of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, involving all of the right lung (with some apical sparing) and the mid portion of the left lung.
There has been no significant interval change of the 2 patchy areas of ground glass opacity within the superior segment of the left upper lobe and within the lingula.
Diagnostic considerations include atypical infectious agents, such as mycoplasma, mycobacteria, fungus and viral etiology.
2)  The ground glass opacities of the left lung should continue to be followed to document complete resolution and exclude malignancy.
Significant interval resolution of tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities involving the right lung with only a few residual opacities still present.
Nodular ground-glass opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are stable.
Perhaps related to adrenal insufficiency and patient was placed on hydrocortisone with improvement, she was switched to prednisone when called out of MICU.
Patient will need a very slow taper of prednisone given her history of a chronic eosinophilic pna, and perhaps outpatient [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
CV/elevated troponin- Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia  Patient  was not having cp.
Felt to be related to sepsis and renal failure.
--Patient was continued on ASA and beta blocker, Ace inhibitor held secondary to hypotension (and was restarted prior to dc) * 3.
Repeat chest x-ray showed no evidence of pna, but given her slowness to respond levoquin was added for question for bacterial superinfection-?
Pulm consulted indicated that likely she has a chronic eosinophilic pna and has been treated with too short courses of steroids in past.
It was decided that the patient should be placed on respiratory isolation in order to rule out TB and to send sputum  x 3 for AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], bacterial cultures, and cytology (concern for malignancy given smoking history).
The sputum cultures grew gram neg rods, and given her history of pseudomonal pna, patient was placed on gentamycin.
Also, patients sputum grew out stentrophomonas maltophilia that was sensitive to bactrim.
Eventually it was decided that patient would be treated with 14 days of gent and cipro for pseudomonas, and 14 days of bactrim for stentrophomonas maltophilia.
Patient was also placed on a 14 days of diflucan for oral thrush.
DM2- cont home regimen of NPH and ISS for coverage.
