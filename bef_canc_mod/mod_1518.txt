There were no preceding events or symptoms.
They found that he has underlying AF and has had ~10 episodes of VT.
He received a bolus of amiodarone 150mg x1, but continued to have slow VT in the CCU.
The patient's groin site was complicated by bleeding and hematoma after an episode of nauesa and vomiting.
Patient developped aneurysm in the cath insertion.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and had an episode of slow VT that he was ATP paced out of.
Acute on chronic anemia - The patient had a groin bleed on [**11-15**] after nausea/vomiting following his ablation.
The patient had no further evidence of bleeding.
Acute on Chronic kidney disease - The patient's baseline creatinine is 2.3-2.8.
His creatinine trended up to 3.1 likely from hypovolemia in the setting of nausea/vomiting and poor po intake.
Chronic Systolic Heart failure: Secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Initially lasix and spironolactone were held in the setting of acute kidney injury but these were restarted prior to discharge.
Atrial fibrillation: Coumadin was held in the setting of bleeding from the groin.
