CXR showed some interstitial edema, left pleural effusion.
EKG showed NSR, mild ST depressions in V4-V5.
Pt was planned to be given Vanc for LE cellulitis (though not actually given prior to transfer) and Levaquin for possible pneumonia.
Pt was transferred to ICU for close monitoring of respiratory status and possible sepsis given elev lactate.
Denies worsening of his baseline cough.

Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2137-9-12**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
Imaging: CXR ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Relatively stable bilateral upper lung patchy opacities are consistent with history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
However, there is a new focal opacification in right middle lobe, atelectasis versus infectious process.
Ultrasound bilateral lower extremities ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Extremely limited evaluation given patient's body habitus and inability to properly position the patient due to patient discomfort.
Very limited assessment of the superficial femoral veins and left popliteal vein demonstrate no clear evidence of thrombus in these veins, however compression was not assessed.

# Hypoxia: Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
DDx on admission included ACS, pneumonia, COP flare, CHF exacerbation, PE, or volume overload.
The EKG in the ED showed ST depressions in V4-V5 and TnT 0.03, although the patient denied chest pain and showed no further symptoms, increased troponin level, or EKG changes.
The troponin was therefore thought to represent demand ischemia.
A CXR showed a new infiltrate, however, the patient had no fever or cough.
He was treated with a single dose each of levofloxacin and vancomycin, but these were discontinued given his rapid improvement.
Alternatively, this can be a COP/BOOP flare given his underlying chronic lung disease.
PE was also on the differential, with immobility [**3-6**] recent hospitalizations, increased LE edema.
His pain resolved with diuresis.
Finally, his symptoms could be due to volume overload, for which he is frequently admitted, given recent weight gain and increased edema.
He was treated with Lasix to good effect, with reduced oxygen requirement.
He still has some lower extremity edema but it is much improved.
Overall it appears that the patient became volume overloaded for salt indiscretions while on vacation.
He was asymptomatic from it.
Workup for multiple myeloma is thus far negative.
