Although no clear source was found, she was streated iwht IV fluconazole and daptomycin for her history of fungemia and multiple line infections.
She had a TEE that was negative for endocarditis.
Of note, during this hospitalization, she had new word-finding difficulties and a noncontrast head CT demonstrated a new interval focus of hypodensity in the L basal ganglia, concerning for acute to subacute ischemia, and new subtle hypodensity at the left cerebellum, also concerning for acute ischemia.
However, she could not tolerate CTs with contrast or MRIs so no further imaging was performed.
Neurology felt her symptoms did not correlate with the CT findings.
She had bilious vomiting and was shaking.
She was noted to have large petechiae on her entire body, including pams and soles.
IR has been notifed of new line needs and will take her case next.

There is slight increase in the right pleural effusion with potential increase in the right basal atelectasis but note is made that overlying devices are projecting over the right chest and the exam should be repeated for precise evaluation of the right hemithorax  [**2146-9-17**] CT abd/pelvis 1.

Extensive perivascular fat stranding and small amount of free fluid within the pelvis which measures simple.
Right lower lobe consolidation concerning for infection and less likely atelectasis.

Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Extensive right pleural effusion with atelectatic change in the lower lung is again seen.

Limited study with no evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] multifocal peribronchial and peripheral nodular opacities, most likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Atelectasis in the right lower lobe, mostly due to persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which could be reactive  [**2146-10-4**] TEE: Patent foramen ovale with bidirectional shunting at rest and anatomy not ideally suited for percutaneous closure.

DISCHARGE LABS [**2146-10-7**]: [**2146-10-7**] 06:05PM WBC-3.0* Hgb-9.1* Hct-27.1* Plt Ct-288*# [**2146-10-7**] 06:05PM Glucose-113 UreaN-23 Creat-0.8 Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-107 HCO3-25 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 47 year old woman with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Syndrome, multiple abdominal surgeries, resultant short gut syndrome, on chronic TPN, who presented with sepsis and paradoxical emboli.
# Klebsiella Bacteremia - The patient was admitted to the MICU with sepsis, likely [**12-27**] to line infection and was started on Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, and Micafungin empirically.
She was also given Daptomycin and Fluconazole from a prior infection until [**2146-10-7**].
She was afebrile with no increase in WBC count during her hospitalization.
CT showed no large RP bleed.
The patient's HCT remained stable during her hosptialization with no further requirement for transfusion.
The TTE on [**2146-9-19**] showed new R->L shunt, thought to be [**12-27**] to increased pulmonary pressures from untreated PE from [**3-3**].
It was determined to be suboptimal for closure at this point, so the patient was started on anticoagulation to treat her PE and lower pulmonary pressures.
She can be re-evaluated in the future if she continues to have paradoxical emboli.
# DYSPHAGIA: The patient has noted intermittent symptoms of choking for the past year.
She was found to have an esophageal stricture [**12-27**] to reflux esophagitis.
She was started on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for treatment.
# PE/Multiple line-related thromboses: The patient has a h/o of PE from [**2146-2-23**] that was untreated [**12-27**] to failure of AC with Coumadin (supratherapeutic INR [**12-27**] to interactions with Abx) and Lovenox (adverse reaction - painful welts developed on arms and abdomen).
She was admitted with painful petechiae on her fingers/toes and had episodes of word finding difficulties.
Further work-up for other causes of increased clotting was not done, as the patient has clear risks for clot formation from her multiple stents and indwelling line.
# LEUKOPENIA: The patient was noted to have leukopenia - WBC ~3, possibly from drug reaction.

)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Klebsiella bacteremia Esophageal stricture secondary to reflux esophagitis  Secondary Diagnosis Pulmonary embolism Atrial septal defect [**Location (un) **] syndrome   Discharge Condition: Stable, improved, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an infection in your blood.
You had an echocardiogram, which showed that the blood has started shunting from the right to the left side of the heart.
This is because of increased pressure in your lung, which is likely due to a blood clot (pulmonary embolus) that has been untreated in your lung since [**2146-2-23**].
You were found to have a stricture in the esophagus, which has been causing you difficulty swallowing for the past year.
This can be treated with acid blocking medication.
It was thought to be safer to start blood thinners (Fondaparinux) to treat the blood clot in your lungs, which will hopefully decrease the pressure in your lungs.
Start Fondaparinux 5mg subcutaneously daily - this is a blood thinner that will help treat the blood clot in your lung, as well as prevent more blood clots from forming.
Please monitor closely for any adverse reactions to this medication, as you have had an adverse reaction to Lovenox (a similar medication) in the past.
Take Ceftriaxone until [**2146-10-14**] to complete treatment for your infection.
