Both lesions were injected with mix of dermabond/lipiodol with good hemastasis and evidence of sclerosis.

Other forms of hepatic disease, such as cirrhosis or fibrosis are not excluded.
This is nonspecific, possibly an area of focal fatty sparing, though a nodule in that location is not excluded.
For this finding as well as for the nodule described in the liver, would first recommend comparison to prior imaging if available and, failing that, these could be further evaluated via MRI.
