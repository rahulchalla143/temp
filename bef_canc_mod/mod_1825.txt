# Altered mental status: Altered mental status most likely cause by lithium toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury.
No evidence of infection on UA, no fever or leukocytosis.
She has a history of AMS with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states, but her hyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity was normal.
Lithium was held, [**Known lastname **] was held and she was hydrated agressively with LR, since patient has received 6 L NS and developed a hyperchloremic acidosis.
Lithium levels were checked Q6hours and she was discharged when Lithium levels returned to [**Location 213**]  # Acute kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated to 1.3 from a baseline of 0.7 on admission.
This was thought to be most likely intrinsic from TMP/SMX usage, but there she may have had prerenal physiology as well due to decreased PO intake.
There was no evidence of obstruction or infection.
# Diabetes mellitus: Chronic issue which was stable during admission.
She refused to take her long acting insulin  # Psoriatic arthritis: Symptoms were stable.
# Bipolar and anxiety disorders: Chronic, stable.
She has no mood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at all consistent with mania or depression.
We continued her home benzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acute toxicity.
# Anemia: Initial hematocrit was normal, but that may be in the setting of hemoconcentration.
No evidence of acute bleeding.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lithium toxicity Acute Kidney Injury Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Psoriatic Arthritis Thyroid Cancer s/p resection and radioactive iodine Hypothyroidism Bipolar Disorder Anxiety Disorder Asthma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Lithium toxicity and Acute Kidney Injury.
It is believed that because of your nasal cellulitis you became dehydrated which affected your kidneys ability to clear Lithium.
The [**Hospital1 **] antibiotic you took for cellulitis may have also caused some kidney injury which may have increased your Lithium level as well.
Dehydration, kidney injury and increasing Lithium levels in your blood caused your altered mental status, difficulty finding words and unsteady walking.
The following changes to your medications were made: - You can begin taking your Lithium again tomorrow [**8-6**] at your regular home dose - You should avoid taking [**Month/Year (2) **] again in the future because it may have increased Lithium levels on your body - Please do not take your [**Month/Year (2) 21177**] until you see your outpatient physician.
