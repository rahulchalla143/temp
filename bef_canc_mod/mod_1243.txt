Admission Date:  [**2190-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-1-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mediastinoscopy, lymph node biopsy  History of Present Illness: 83 y/o man with PMH significant for type 2 DM, CHF, first degree AV block, and recent 2 month illness characterized by weight loss and failure to thrive who was admitted through the ED on sepsis protocol.
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-13**] through [**12-23**] with failure to thrive.
At that time, he was evaluated for a possible malignancy given the presence of widspread lymphadenopathy.
Bone marrow biopsy was done which was consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder.
During this admission, the pt was also treated for possible sepsis since he had hypotension with a SBP in the 80s and an elevated WBC count of 23 on admission.
Pt was apparently not injured but this morning he was unresponsive and wouldn't follow commands.
The pt's wife reported that he hadn't had any new complaints over the past few days.
However, at 6:00 PM he was noted to be pale and diaphoretic with a temperature of 102.8 and BP of 100/50.
He was intubated for altered mental status.
Asymptomatic AV dissociation and bradycardia s/p [**Company 1543**] Sigma 300 DR [**Last Name (STitle) 4448**] placement [**5-18**].
Holter [**2187**]: SR w/ moderate PR prolongation, AEA w/ runs of atrial tachycardia, 2 beat run of VT 2.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 3.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p TURP-- path w/ prostate ca [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3 = 6 4.
Diverticulosis with colonic polyp (c-scope [**2186**]).
Recent circumcision for balontitis 9.
Cirrhosis (consistent findings on recent ultrasound, but not seen on CT abdomen [**11-24**])   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **] Corner.
No history of other drug use.
HEENT: perrl, eomi, mmm Chest: good air movement, no wheezes, crackles CV: RRR, systolic murmur LUSB abd: soft, NT/ND, no HSM ext: no c/c/e.
Pulmonary vascular markings are somewhat indistinct but without frank pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is seen on this supine radiograph.
[**12-29**] Non-contrast head CT: FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Low attenuation within the periventricular white matter is consistent with small vessel infarction.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the left maxillary sinus.
Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are appropriately aerated.
There is no evidence of fracture.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
No major vascular territorial infarction.
No infiltrates are present.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal extraaxial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift.
Low attenuation in the periventricular white matter remains similar in appearance.
No enhancing intracranial lesion is detected.
The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear patent, without significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
No arteriovenous malformation is detected.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial mass is identified.
See note above re: CTA technique relating to mass lesion detection.
[**1-5**] RUQ U/S: FINDINGS: The liver is markedly heterogenous, with predominantly increased echogenicity with multiple focal areas of decreased echogenicity, which appears to be increased in number and size compared to the prior study.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
The previously noted multiple nodules in the spleen could not be well demonstrated on the present study, in this patient who could not hold the breath.
The findings probably represent microabscess, or hepatic involvement of malignancy such as lymphoma.
Prior noted splenic lesions are not well demonstrated on the present study.
Brief Hospital Course: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was suspected of being septic, with fever to 104F, mental status changes, hypotension, and leukocytosis with left-shift.
No evidence of PNA on CXR.
[**12-30**] blood cultures had no growth on bacterial cultures, and preliminarily no growth on fungal or mycobacterial cultures.
LP was done [**12-30**], which showed no evidence of meningitis.
CSF bacterial, fungal, and AFB cultures no growth.
BAL with transbronchial biopsy was done on [**12-31**], and respiratory cultures eventually grew MRSA, and was negative to date for AFB or nocardia.
Fibrinogen normal, no FDPs.
It was observed that Mr. [**Known lastname **]' INR was elevated to 2.7, with tbili elevated to 2.7.
HHV8 Ag, and Histoplasma Ag pending.
A RUQ U/S was done on [**1-5**], which demonstrated multifocal areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with microabscesses or metastatic disease.
During his course on the floor, his LFTs remained elevated, and the aforementioned RUQ U/S was done, which suggested microabscesses vs metastatic disease.
In preparation for a possible lymph node biopsy and to better image the liver lesions, a CT was done.
Mr. [**Known lastname **]' mediastinal LAD appeared unchanged; however, the liver lesions seen on U/S could not be visualized on CT.  During his admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], but ultimately deteriorating course in terms of his mental status, respiratory status, and hemodynamics.
Post-extubation, he had a very raspy voice, and failed a speech and swallow test, leading team to suspect laryngeal nerve and/or vocal fold damage.
He had a very low albumin (2.0), thought to be [**3-17**] poor nutritional status and his deteriorating hepatic function.
He became severely edematous to the point of anasarca, and daily decsions were made regarding how to balance fluids and TPN, necessary for hemodynamic stability and nutrition, with diuresis for comfort.
On [**1-3**], he was found to have an acute decline in mental status, unable or unwilling to open his eyes, and only responding to noxious stimuli.
An EEG was also done, which showed generalized theta slowing c/w toxic/metabolic etiology.
He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids, due to Mr. [**Known lastname **]' long history of prednisone for RA, in context of hypotension and tachycardia associated with these episodes.
They made it clear that they would like to be able to obtain a biopsy in order to have a diagnosis.
The reiterated that he should be DNR/DNI, and unneccesary invasive tests or interventions should be avoided.
On [**1-10**], he gradually became hypotensive to 80s/40s and tachycardic to 130s with SaO2 in 80s on NRB.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no heartbeat or breath sounds after two minutes of auscultation.
He had no corneal reflex and no pulse.
