Admission Date:  [**2167-8-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-11-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Ativan / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 2520**] is an 81 year-old female with past medical history significant for respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy and decannulation who presents from home with decreased level of consciousness.
Per daughter, her mother did not have any difficulty breathing.
No recent fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, or dysuria.
Patient was taken to CT scan but was found to be in increased distress and was found to be "blue".
- Respiratory failure: Admitted to BIMDC in [**1-14**] after cardiac arrest, presumed to be secondary respiratory failure.
- Hypertension - Type 2 Diabetes - Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy several years ago and s/p XRT [**11-12**] (unclear where radiation was targeted to) - followed at [**Hospital1 2025**] - Glaucoma - Cataracts, baseline anisocoria (R pupil) .
STUDIES: [**8-7**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma with bibasilar atelectasis.
Subtle ground-glass change may represent acute infection or subtle edema, though this is more likely to be due to patient respiratory motion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 2520**] is an 81 year-old female with PMH significant for DM, HTN, 2 prior admissions this year for respiratory failure, s/p tracheostomy in [**6-13**], who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of sedative overdose.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of overdose of Ambien requiring brief intubation.
The etiology of her hypercarbia was unclear but felt likely due to underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrone and obstructive sleep apnea.
This was supported by the fact that she had elevated bicarbonate suggesting she is a chronic CO2 retainer.
ABG on RA [**2167-8-11**] was also consistent with chronic CO2 retention.
Her hypercarbia resolved when on bipap overnight, however she was not always able to use the mask secondary to her anxiety.
She was evaluated by pulmonary who felt that the etiology of her hypercarbia was likely multifactorial as above.
She had a CTA of the chest which was negative for PE but did reveal some atelectasis and interstitial edema.
They did not have any further specific recommendations at this time.
# Insulin-dependent Type II DM: She takes Humulin at home (40 qAM, 28 pre-dinner).
# Positive UA: Urinalysis on admission showed moderate leukocytes & bacteria.
She also had a peripheral leukocytosis with WBC of 12.3.
She denied urinary symptoms.
Urine culture was unremarkable (~[**2159**]/mL gram positive bacteria and ~1000/mL probable enterococcus) so macrobid was discontinued.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypercarbic respiratory failure Secondary: 1) Anxiety 2) Type II Diabetes, insulin-dependent 3) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable, sat'ing well on 2L of oxygen.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after taking an extra dose of your sleeping medication Ambien.
Given that you have had 2 recent prior admissions for respiratory failure, including one that led to intubation and tracheostomy, it is likely that you have an underlying breathing disorder that caused you to be extra sensitive to the Ambien.
You were evaluated by the pulmonary doctors here who think that you may have a disorder called obesity hypoventilation syndrome and possibly sleep apnea.
If you should develop fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lethargy please go to the nearest emergency room.
Your appointment is at 2:30pm but please arrive at 2pm for breathing tests prior to your appointment.
It was recommended that you have an outpatient sleep study, and one was in the process of being arranged for you during your admission, however you have declined having the study performed.
