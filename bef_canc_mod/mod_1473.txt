Focal hyperechoic spots within the thickened wall may represent embedded stones, or less likely, crystals.
Numerous small gallstones layering in gallbladder.
No peri-cholecystic fluid or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) **] sign.
Findings may be compatible with acute cholecystis in the correct setting but gallbladder wall thickening can also be found in other situations such as hepatits and volume overload.
Large right-sided pneumothorax.
Mild right colon wall thickening which might represent mild colitis versus collapse.
Metallic density in small bowel as noted in preliminary report.
Gallbladder contains multiple hyperdense stones in the dependent region with some pericholecystic fluid but without wall thickening.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology identified.
CTA Chest ([**8-24**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No pneumothorax.
Decrease in size in large bilateral pleural effusions since [**8-21**].
Large bibasilar atelectases.
Peribronchial consolidations and ground-glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally greater in the upper lobes could be due to pulmonary edema.
Pneumonia is also likely present.
CXR ([**8-31**]) - IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male with a history of ETOH abuse and fatty liver, HTN who presented [**2146-8-19**] with melena, hematemesis and dyspnea on exertion.
Hematemesis/melena: The patient presented with large volume hematemesis and was initially managed in the ED with ocreotide, PPi drip and transfused 1 unit (HCT 24).
Also with duodenal and stomach ulcers.
On the morning of [**8-21**], the patient spiked a fever to 101.2 and was found to have a bandemia of 17%.
CXR revealed b/l PNA and the patient was noted to have increasing o2 requirements.
The patient required re-intubation due to poor oxygenation.
Found to be growing yeast and pan-sensitive E. coli on sputum Cx from [**8-22**].
Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial washings on [**8-25**] grew yeast and Respiratory viral culture on [**8-25**] was negative.
Radiographic imaging following the TLC placement revealed a tension PTX and the patient was noted to have low BPs requiring pressors.
24 hours after chest tube removal patient developed tachipnea and desats to the 70s he was emergently reintubated for respiratory distress, CXR did not show rexpansion of the PTX.
Bronchoscopy showed large amounts of thick sputum and while no obstructive plug was seen it was felt that his acute decompensation was due to mucus plugging.
# Delirium: Pt with some delirium after being transferred from the MICU to the medical floor.
Likely multifactorial, in the setting of acute illness, prolonged hospitalization, and prior heavy EtOH use.
Also had initially been refusing PO medications for unclear medications.
# Hypothyroidism: Pt with some lethargy and hypothermia after being called out to the medical floor.
Endocrine consult suggested hypothyroidism may be secondary to large iodine dose and that he should be trialed off levothyroxine as an outpt after discharge as this can lead to transient hypothyroidism.
Anti-TPO anti-bodies were negative, decreasing suspicion for hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Believed to be pre-renal in the setting of vomiting and blood loss.
Possible ATN given duration and severity of dehydration.
The patient received blood and fluid resuscitation while in the MICU with good improvement in renal function.
?Colitis:  patient was found to have radiologic findings suggestive of colitis on CT without change in stool output.
He was stable without evidence of new bleeding.
Patient was covered emerically for C. diff given CT findings desipe no stool output.
Macrocytic anemia suspected to be due to a combination of GI bleeding and longstanding alcoholism.
Also carries a history of paresthesias/neuropathy and intermittent ataxia c/w B12 deficiency.
============================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will need to have his hematocrit followed (preferably at least every other day, initially) to ensure no further GI bleeding.
Of note, patient had been placed on lansoprazole disintegrating tabs given his initialy refusal to swallow pills while on the medical floor.
Medications on Admission: - thiamine 100 mg DAILY - folate 1mg daily - multivitamin 1 tab daily   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Last Name (un) **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB/wheeze.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with bleeding from your GI tract.
This showed a tear in your esophagus as well as an ulcer in your stomach.
Your ICU course was complicated by a collapsed lung as well as a serious pneumonia.
You were also found to have a bacteria called h.pylori, which can cause stomach ulcers.
- You will complete a 10-day course of amoxicillin and clarithromycin to treat a bacteria that was found in your GI tract.
This bacteria can cause stomach ulcers.
- You will start lansoprazole to help with your stomach acid, and you will start colace and senna to prevent constipation.
