right diaphramatic hemiparalysis, right pleural effusion, dementia, hypertension, pulmonary embolism s/p IVC filter and SDH, COPD on BiPAP at night, EtOH abuse that presented to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30746**] with dyspnea and RLL collapse with pleural effusion.
She is being transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy for right lower lobe collapse to look for endobronchial tumor and pleurocentesis.
Patient was recently discharged from rehab hospital after sustaining fracture of her obturator ring on right.
After only one day at home she started to have sob and leg swelling.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] where they originally treated her for CHF exacerbation with diuresis but BNP was wnl and TTE showed normal LV systolic function, mild aortic stenosis, and PAH at 60mmHg.
CTA was negative for PEs and for metastati disease.
She was also treated for PNA with rocephin and zithromax after developing a fever to 100.2 and a new right-sided haziness on CXR.
Did not drain effusion as was not sizeable enough to tap.
Oncology did not feel this was new metastatic disease because she had just undergone 9 cycles of chemotherapy.
Eventually found to have RLL collapse and right hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.
Pulmonology suggested chest pt and nebulizers but the patient did not improve so they then recommended bronchoscopy to remove mucous plugging.
Past Medical History: - Stage IIIB colon cancer who completed adjuvant therapy with eight cycles of capecitabine.
Medical course complicated by recurrent right-sided pleural effusion, right upper quadrant intra-abdominal abscess, and E. coli bacteremia.
In addition, s/p liver resection fro metastatic disease - SDH s/p craniotomy - PE s/pIVC filter - COPD - ETOH abuse - HTN - AAOx3 but baseline dementia per OSH records - hysterectomy - Colectomy - BSO - loculated pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and chest tube placement in [**2122**] with cytology on pleural fluid negative for malignancy   Social History: - Tobacco: Quit smoking 12 years ago - Alcohol: Previous heavy ETOH use not currently sober - Independent in her ADLs previously, recently discharged from rehab after a fracture.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Partial right and left lung base atelectasis.
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
[**2125-11-19**]: CT Chest Wetread chest: small bilateral effusions and associated atelectasis obscure some of the known pulmonary nodules.
others are not seen due to atelectasis.
hyperdense pleural material on the right suggests prior pleurodesis.
septal thickening and ground glass opacities suggest an element of volume overload.
abd/pelvis: stable appearance of the liver s/p partial right hepatectomy.
no new liver lesions.
no new RP or mesenteric adenopathy.
bowel-containing ventral hernia is uncomplicated.
no free fluid or free air or other acute intraabdominal process identified.

no acute fractures.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo female with PMH of colon cancer stage IIIb with liver mets s/p resection, questionable lung mets, new right diaphragmatic hemiparalysis, right pleural effusion, dementia, pulmonary embolism s/p IVC filter, COPD admitted to OSH with SOB found to have R lobe collapse and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for hypoxia then transferred to the medicine team stable on 6 L NC.
#Hypoxia: Patient has underlying lung pathology including COPD and prior pulmonary embolism.
She was found to have RLL collapse at the OSH with right hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.
The RLL collapse was thought to be the most likely cause of her new oxygen requirement.
She was evaluated by oncology who felt that pulmonary involvement of her cancer was less likely based on review on imaging and normal CEA.
#Hx of Colon Cancer: There was initial concern that endobronchial tumor may have been cause of RLL collapse.
CEA was elevated when liver mets were found, now within normal limits, making metastasis less likely.
CT Chest/abdomen/ pelvis did not show any evidence of new metastasis.
#Chronic Diastolic CHF: Patient had signs of acute on chronic CHF at OSH including bilateral pleural effusions, vascular congestion which improved with diuretics.
On discharge, patient had mild tibial edema and bibasilar crackles on lung exam.
There were mo signs of acute COPD exacerbation on this admission.
#Hx of PE: patient had IVC placed as she was unable to receive anticoagulation at the time secondary to subdural hematoma.
CTA was negative for PE at OSH.
She was given heparin subq tid for DVT prophylaxis.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2125-11-14**] with shortness of breath.
Part of your shortness of breath is likely due to heart failure and you were continued on lasix to remove the extra fluid.
