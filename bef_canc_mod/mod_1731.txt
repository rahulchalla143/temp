Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with mild diffuse, slightly sluggish flow but no angiographically apparent coronary disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated left-sided filling pressure (LVEDP 17 mmHg).
There was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle.
Left ventriculography was deferred due to elevated creatinine and recent echo.
There is moderate-to-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
EKG showed diffuse ST elevations and there was concern for ST elevation MI.
ECHO done in ED showed depressed LVEF (30%).
The patient was brought for cardiac cath and found to have patent coronaries.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, as well as cardiology for her apparent pericarditis.
She began taking PO's well without N/V.
* On transfer to the floor, she was taking good PO's without N/V, and was not having chest pain.
* 2) PERICARDITIS: The patient had diffuse ST elevations on admission which was consistent with pericarditis.
She also had elevated troponin on admission (1.21).
Her elevated troponin on admission (1.21), was likely due to perimyocarditis.
A cardiac echo was done initially in the ED which showed LVEF of 30%, however, no pericardial effusion.
Her initial decrease in LVEF was likely related to her pericarditis.
* 6) LOW TSH: The patient also had a low TSH on this admission; likely secondary to euthyroid sick syndrome.
* 7) FEN: At the time of discharge, the patient was taking good PO's without nausea or vomiting.
