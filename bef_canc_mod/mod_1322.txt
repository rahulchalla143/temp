Admission Date:  [**2170-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-11-25**]   Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine Firm/Medical ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, and pedal edema transferred from a nursing home for abnormal laboratories, nausea, vomiting, and change in mental status.
The patient recently completed treatment for UTI with Macrobid.
The patient received extra Lasix the day prior to admission for a 2 pound weight gain and increased pedal edema.
In the past 24 hours, the patient became more lethargic, vomited two times, and had a fever to 101.
Here, the patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
Her neck examination was notable for a left surgical pupil, but reactive to light.
Her neck had jugular venous distention to 9 cm with no bruits.
Lung examination:  She had crackles at the right base.
Cardiac examination:  She had a [**5-20**] blowing systolic murmur and a [**3-22**] diastolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Her extremities had 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally.
She had a chest film that showed a left pleural effusion, left lower lobe opacity that is most likely atelectasis.
According to the nursing home, she swallowed several liters of free water.
She was given very gentle IV hydration, since the electrolytes were also consistent with dehydration.
Respiratory distress:  The patient was noted to be in significant respiratory distress on the second hospital day.
Her examination was notable at the time for diffuse rhonchi throughout.
In addition, she also had an echocardiogram done previously that day which showed right ventricular failure as well as left ventricular failure that was new.
However, the chest CT showed worsening congestive heart failure.
This was also consistent with the examination, and so she was diuresed with moderate improvement.
Congestive heart failure:  Given the patient's worsening respiratory status and CHF, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed that revealed biventricular failure that was new of unclear etiology.
This became one of the dominant issues as the patient was ultimately having worsening respiratory distress.
Tachyarrhythmia:  The patient had a tachyarrhythmia on admission that was originally sinus tachycardic, but soon became more rapid and consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Urinary tract infection:  The patient has a multi-drug resistant urinary tract infection that is longstanding.
Her initial urine showed possible infection and so she was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl.
She has a chronic indwelling Foley, and so it is not clear whether she had an active infection or just a contaminant.
Pneumonia:  It was possible that some of the findings on chest film and CT were consistent with a pneumonia including possibly tuberculosis as she had a right upper quadrant spiculated pneumonia.
However, despite these efforts, she was unable to maintain normal oxygen saturation and became in severe respiratory distress and so she was made CMO and passed away shortly thereafter.
Congestive heart failure.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
