CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint is lightheadedness.
She had black stools but had been on iron supplementation.
She denied any fevers or chills.
She did have some constipation, but she had a bowel movement earlier that day.
She was noted to have anemia with a drop from a normal hematocrit of 36.7 to approximately 23 in the Emergency Department.
She actually presented with melena with occult-blood positive stools and hypotension in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**].
She had a nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department which was negative, and she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for hypotension and a gastrointestinal bleed.
Congestive heart failure secondary to Adriamycin.
History of a band-negative sepsis.
C2 to C5 spondylosis in the cervical spine.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; started on amiodarone in [**2122-1-22**].
Left knee arthroplasty in [**2119**].
Chronic renal failure.
A grade 3 systolic murmur.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended and without rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed lower extremity with 1+ edema bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram was done and showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and T wave flattening in leads I and aVL, II, III, and aVF.
There were T wave inversions in leads V5 and V6.
Some ST depressions in V5 and V6 which may or may not be significant.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was taken to colonoscopy and upper endoscopy by Gastroenterology after having a negative nuclear scan which showed a probably large bowel source.
There were some shallow ulcers in the stomach that were visualized, but they were nonbleeding.
The colonoscopy revealed multiple blood clots throughout with a possible cecal ulcer.
There was no brisk active bleeding seen on either scope.
After her hematocrit stabilized, she was sent out to the floor because the family did not wish to pursue any further colonoscopies for visualizing the ulcer.
When she came out to the floor, she had copious melanotic stools and a hematocrit drop of 29 to 24 over that day.
The patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy which again showed the same lesions but did not reveal any actively bleeding ulcers.
Also of note, there were some ulcers noted in the antrum and fundus of the stomach which were sent for cytology given the patient's history of breast cancer, but these came back negative for malignancy.
She was also started on Epoetin for the thought that she had a chronic anemia.
She had no further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Her stools showed old blood, but were negative for new bleeding.
CARDIOMYOPATHY:  The patient was in stable heart failure throughout this time.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13584**] from the Heart Failure Clinic and kept on her stable regimen of heart failure medications.
LIGHTHEADEDNESS:  The patient had a couple more episodes of lightheadedness while on the floor.
CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS:  The patient arrived with films from an outside hospital which showed C4-C5 spondylosis with some signal in the cord.
There was no instability seen, and at this time the patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] in the clinic for further management of her cervical spondylosis.
Cervical spondylosis.
History of breast cancer (as noted above).
