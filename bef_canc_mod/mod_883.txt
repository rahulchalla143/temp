There is a predominantly hypodense right frontal and right temporal extra- axial collection, which is similar in size from [**2185-8-20**], and may reflect evolving post-surgical blood products.
External to the dura, there is an additional hypodense collection, measuring approximately 6mm in maximal dimensions, which also likely reflects residual post-operative changes and is not significantly changed.
A tiny focus of hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe likely reflects residual intraparenchymal hemorrhage as seen on prior studies, decreased from [**2185-7-30**].
However, there is a new left acute-subacute subdural hematoma overlying the left frontal and parietal convexity with a fluid level, measuring up to 20 mm in width maximally.
A new right subdural hemorrhage is also evident overlying the right convexity near the vertex.
There is associated local mass effect, with sulcal effacement, effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and a rightward shift of normally midline structures of approximately 5 mm.
No uncal herniation is appreciated.
No major vascular territorial infarction is identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Enlarged left subdural hematoma, with acute-subacute components, compatible with interval bleeding from the prior study, with subsequent effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and 5 mm rightward midline shift.
New right subdural hematoma overlying the convexity near the vertex.
Evolving small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, decreased from [**2185-7-30**].
Head CT [**9-6**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval evolution of the left frontal subdural hematoma.
The previously noted linear hemorrhage at the evacuation site is less prominent on this examination.
The previously noted left frontoparietal subarachnoid hemorrhage appears grossly unchanged.
There is a hypodense collection in the right epidural as well as right subdural spaces consistent with prior surgery.
A previously noted right parietal hematoma is currently measuring 29 mm in longest diameter versus 11 mm previously (2A:26).
This could represent either a subdural or epidural hematoma.
A hyperdense focus (2A:15) within the left sylvian fissure is likely due to layering of blood products in addition to different slice position on this examination; however, a small new bleed cannot be completely excluded.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
Interval evolution of left subdural fluid collection.
New focus of hyperdensity in the left parietal region may represent interval layering of blood, however, new hemorrhage cannot be fully excluded  Cardiac Echo [**9-7**]: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU/neurosurgery service following vague complaints of right sided weaknes and gait abnormality.
She had been on lovenox for the treatment of a subsegmental pulmonary embolus that was diagnosed on [**8-20**].
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-29**] days(from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
