She returned to bed and then had several episodes of hematemesis.
The patient was medically managed for her myocardial infarction with Metoprolol.
She did not experience any arrhythmias or episodes of congestive heart failure.
Her diuretics were also discontinued secondary to her volume depletion.
She remained without congestive heart failure and was discharged to home without her diuretics.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient experienced hematemesis following administration of aspirin and heparin.
Recent hematocrit drop from 32 down to 26 and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on hospital day one.
On hospital day two her hematocrit again took a small decrease and she was transfused 1 additional unit of packed red blood cells.
She did not have any further episodes of hematemesis or any episodes of hematochezia.
This likely represented mild volume depletion secondary to her diuretic use.
Non Q wave myocardial infarction.
