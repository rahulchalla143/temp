Catheter placement into the distal superficial femoral     artery, the contralateral superficial femoral artery,     and proximal popliteal artery.
Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 60F with PVD with femoral stents placed [**9-18**], CAD s/p CABG [**6-16**], dCHF, T2DM, HTN, HCH, Hep C, asthma, nephrotic range proteinuria and recent foot debridement was directly admitted from [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] clinic with concern for ischemic RLE.
Received right superficial femoral stent placement and on the way to PACU became unresponsive with HR 40s , pulseless, and apneic.
Patient was unresponsive, raising concern for anoxic encephalopathy.

Overnight, she was hemodynamically labile with episodes of hypotension (61/35 at 9PM) and hypertension as well as bradycardia (low 50s).
Vital signs normalized and she was extubated with altered mental status, volume overload, and urine output of dark brown color.
CAD: s/p MI [**2183**], cath with 3VD s/p CABGx3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA and ramus); Cath [**2183-6-11**] Severe left main and a three vessel coronary artery disease (LMCA 60%, LAD proximal 90% lesion and 90% apical stenoses, LCx 80%, Ramus 80% ostial lesion).
Diastolic CHF: TTE on [**8-27**] showed a LVEF 50-55%, PCWP >18, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, mildly decreased global ventricular function, mild-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation 3.

Pertinent Results: LABORATORY DATA: CBC ([**2188-9-16**]): 9.3<8.2/26.4/186 MCV 99.0 RDW 17.3 BMP ([**2188-9-16**]): 136/5.1/99/23/118/5.4<151 Ca 7.8, Phos 6.5, Mg 2.7  Coags ([**2188-9-16**]): PT 11.7, INR 1.1, PTT 32.6 LFTs ([**2188-8-31**]): ALT 36, AST 62, Alk Phos 127, TBili 0.9, Lipase 28 HgbA1C ([**2188-8-25**]): 8.6% Ammonia ([**2188-8-31**]): 14  STUDIES: ECG ([**2188-8-27**], post-code): Sinus rhythm with left axis deviation.
Incomplete right bundle-branch block and diffuse non-specific ST  segment flattening throughout.
Head CT ([**2188-8-27**]): No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or acute [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territorial infarction.
EEG ([**2188-8-27**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous slowing of the background activity with 5-7 Hz theta and occasional [**2-12**] Hz delta activity.
There are occasional brief periods of suppression in EEG activity lasting 1-2 seconds.
These are indicative of moderate to severe encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology.
In this patient, hypoxic ischemic brain injury, hypothermia and use of sedative medications are all potential causes of diffuse slowing.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) secondary to mild global hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, estimated 53mmHg.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2188-1-21**] (images reviewed), global left ventricular systolic function appears less vigorous.
The degree  of aortic regurgitation has progressed to mild-moderate.
However, artifactually high pressures seen in the distal right lower extremity again interfere with this measurement.
Significant inflow arterial insufficiency with aortoiliac disease bilaterally with likely artifactually elevated right ankle/brachial index.
CXR ([**8-27**]): Mild pulmonary edema and more focal opacification in the right upper lung where pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.
The mild left pleural effusion and right moderate-to-severe pleural effusion is unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged since a month, mostly explained by atelectasis; however, a superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Left upper lobe area of consolidation is most compatible with pneumonia.
Sign of severe tracheobronchomalacia.

# SURGERY, PEA ARREST, AND CONSEQUENCES: On [**2188-8-27**], pt.
underwent angiogram with distal superficial femoral artery angioplasty and stenting with subsequent PEA arrest (HR 40s, pulseless, and apneic) in the PACU likely [**3-13**] apnea from sedation (versed and propofol) where she was down for approximately 5-10 min.
Her post-arrest course has been complicated by altered mental status likely [**3-13**] toxic metabolic encephalopathy, hemodynamic lability with episodes of hypotension with BPs as low as 60s/30s.
She did not respond to IV diuresis with torsemide and metolazone.
As such, she was evaluated by nephrology and in the setting of increasing BUN and volume overload, they recommended initiation of dialysis which she has now been started on.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Status post arrest, patient had asterixis, perseveration, poor short term memory, and was oriented only to self and place.
Etiology for AMS is likely multi-factorial, including hypoxic encephalopathy s/p arrest, uremic metabolic encephalopaty, and labile serum glucose.
Early after surgery she had elevated white count suggesting infectious etiology for AMS and her right internal jugular line was removed with subsequent normalizing of WBC count.
PNA was suspected on [**2188-9-17**] and treated empirically for 7 days of Vancomycin and Cefipime, but remained afebrile with normal white count and negative blood and urine cultures taken before Abx admin.
Had a cognitive-linguistic evaluation on [**9-24**] that showed some deficits with complex manipulation of information, including short-term recall, executive functioning, and attention.
# PVD with ischemic right foot: Admitted directly from clinic, superficial right femoral stent was placed [**8-27**].
Right heel ulcer was extensively debrided by podiatry with failure to heal despite daily dressing change with hydrogel and coverage with Augmentin x 14 days, ultimately eroding to the calcaneus.
Waveform study [**9-15**] showed failure of stent.
# ESRD: History of nephrotic range proteinuria and baseline Cr 2.9-3.1 developed post-PEA ischemic ATN, given numerous muddy brown casts in urine sediment.
Patient developed volume overload that did not respond to diuresis with metolazone and toresemide with fluid restriction, and HD was initiated on [**2188-9-16**].
A temporary line was placed initially due to epistaxis prior to anesthesia, which the patient removed during agitation overnight [**9-19**], tunneled catheter on the right placed [**2188-9-22**].
# Bleeding diathesis: Developed repeated epistaxis and hematomas/ecchymoses at superficial puncture sites.
No active liver, Hep C not active.
Tolerated self-removal of right IJ line without significant blood loss.
# T2DM: Insulin requirement trended up after surgery and then down during final week of admission with concomitant decreased appetite.
# Heart failure: Patient saturated well throughout time on floor, with small bilateral pleural effusions noted [**8-25**] and unchanged [**9-25**].
Triggered for lethargy and respiratory distress [**9-25**] but maintained 99% saturation on room air, likely mucus plugging from asthma.
Patient does not have positional stridor or wheezing related to this finding.
# CAD: PEA attributed to poor respiratory function, not an acute coronary event.
