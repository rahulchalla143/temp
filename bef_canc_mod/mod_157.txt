History of Present Illness: 73 year-old female with coronary artery disease status post CABG times one and aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve, Diabetes type II, and hypertension who presents with complete heart block.
She had a syncopal episode while doing PT excercises.
She has never had any previously documented conduction abnormalities.
She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or lightheadedness before or after her syncopal episode.
She does complain of an intermittent headache for the past several months.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times one, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve on [**2119-1-31**].
Coronary catheterization from [**Month (only) 956**] [**2118**] showed a 70% right coronary artery occlusion.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
History of severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 status post AVR with a porcine valve.
Bilateral subclavian stenosis.
History of subdural hemorrhage after motor vehicle accident.
Family History: Family history is significant for a brother who died of an MI at the age of 65.
Cardiac exam was a regular rate, S1, S2, III/VI crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmor best heard at base with radiation to carotids, no rubs or gallops; JVD was elevated to 10 cm; [**Doctor Last Name **] A-waves were present.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with bowel sounds present.
Extremeties were warm without cyanosis or edema and had weakly palpable distal pulses.

Chest x-ray: No evidence of CHF or PNA, mild atelectasis in left lower lobe.
Complete Heart Block (CHB): She presented in CHB with rare captured beats.
Her CHB was thought to be due to either ischemia, infection, or fibrosis from her aortic valve replacement.
Therefore her conduction abnormality is likely secondary to fibrosis.
A permanent pacemaker was placed through the left subclavian once all sources of infection were ruled out.
Heart Failure:  After the placement of the temporary pacing wire, she had an increased oxygen requirement.
A chest x-ray showed new onset pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure secondary to CHB.
She was diuresed with furosemide and her oxygen requirement decreased.
She had no evidence of ischemia.
She still had evidence of heart failure after the initial day of diuresis and required more diuresis with IV lasix.
