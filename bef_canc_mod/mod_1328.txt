HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for COPD, with recent admission for COPD/pneumonia/question lung carcinoma, now admitted with increasing shortness of breath for the last several days.
Then, about five days prior to this admission, she was called by her PCP to discontinue Hydrochlorothiazide due to hypokalemia.
At this time, she noted decreased urination since discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide.
She denied fevers or chills, she also denied hemoptysis.
She notes that over the ensuing four days, she was increasingly short of breath when supine, but this was relieved with sitting up.
She also noted worsening lower extremity edema over this time period.
She denies any chest pain, nausea or vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, calf or leg pain, or calf redness.
In the field she received nebs without improvement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, COPD, hypercholesterolemia, status post TAH, status post resection of benign esophageal tumors, status post euthyroid goiter, GERD.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general the patient is in mild respiratory distress but is otherwise comfortable.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs are coarse throughout, with bilateral crackles, right greater than left.
There is diffuse mild to moderate wheezing.
The heart is tachycardic but regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
There are no masses.
There are no cords, and [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign is negative.
Admission chest x-ray shows extensive air space opacity of mid and lower lung zones on the right, seen on previous chest x-rays.
There is a relatively rapid increase over the last three weeks suggesting superimposition of an acute process.
There are no new ST changes compared with prior EKG from [**2155-4-8**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine service for evaluation and treatment of her multifactorial respiratory distress.
She was treated simultaneously for CHF, COPD and likely pneumonia, possibly post obstructive.
On the morning after admission, the patient went into acute respiratory distress with a respiratory rate in the high 30's and increased work of breathing.
While ABG was not significantly abnormal, her work of breathing was increased, and her symptoms did not initially respond to IV Lasix, nebs, IV Solu-Medrol or Nitro Paste.
She was transferred out of the MICU on [**5-22**] and has made progressive improvement in respiratory symptoms and oxygenation requirement.
CHF:  The patient's initial history and physical was most consistent with CHF, and she responded to initial diuresis to 80 mg IV Lasix on the field.
Echocardiogram performed on [**5-21**] showed possibly severe LV diastolic dysfunction, with preserved systolic  function.
She was also continued on her calcium channel blocker in light of her diastolic dysfunction.
COPD:  While this admission was not felt to be secondary to an acute COPD flare, the patient does have marked baseline obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pneumonia:  The patient was noted on previous admission to have a suspicious right lung opacity concerning for possible carcinoma.
Work-up at that time was equivocal, and was felt that further work-up was not indicated as the patient would not proceed to surgery or chemotherapy anyway.
On this admission chest x-ray did show a right lower lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia, and she was treated with Levo and Flagyl, again for suspicion that this process might be post obstructive.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
