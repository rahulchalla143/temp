Admission Date:  [**2168-12-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-12-11**]   Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems as listed below including recurrent pancreatitis attributed to microlithiasis who was in her usual state of health until the day prior to presentation when she developed abdominal pain, radiating to her back and side and had some nausea.
She was brought to the Emergency Department where she was found to have laboratory values consistent with pancreatitis (as summarized below).
The patient was initially slated for admission to the Medical Service, however, the presence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding prompted admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Evaluation of cardiac markers in the Emergency Room also were suggestive of acute myocardial infarction.
Shortly thereafter she had an episode of coffee ground emesis with nasogastric lavage as described above.
Pancreatitis, she has had several episodes since [**2168-8-1**].
She was initially scheduled for outpatient endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography through the [**Hospital **] Clinic, however, she failed to meet her appointment and as described below has refused to have further evaluations.
Coronary artery disease, the patient had a myocardial infarction in [**2168-8-1**], however, she and her family declined angiographic evaluation.
Her last echocardiogram showed a systolic congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with apical left ventricular aneurysm and diffuse wall motion abnormality.
The left ventricle was 1+ aortic insufficiency.
Type 2 diabetes controlled with oral Sulfonylurea as described above.
Mild Alzheimer's disease for which she received Aricept as described above and Quatiapine for sleep.
Recurrent urinary tract infection.
Symptomatic bradycardia necessitating a DDD cardiac pacemaker placement.
Colon cancer at age 78, status post surgical resection, there no radiation or chemotherapy performed.
Dry mucous membranes.
Jugulovenous pressure is inappreciable.
No carotid bruit.
No thyromegaly.
Nodes:  No anterior cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular or infraclavicular, axillary or inguinal adenopathy.
Heartrate is regular with normal S1 and S2, there is no S3 or S4, murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Protuberant, normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender or nondistended.
Back:  There is no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities:  There is no rash, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Cranial nerves:  I, not tested formally; II, III, IV and VI, pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact without nystagmus as described above; V and VII symmetric, she would not cooperate with the sensory assessment; VIII not tested formally; IX, X and XII tongue is midline.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm of 70 beats/minute with PR interval of 0.2, QRS was 0.15 with old right bundle branch block, QT was 0.4 with an axis of 0 to -30 degrees and early R wave progression.
There were unchanged ST-T segment elevations in the inferior lead 2, 3 and AVF as well as dynamic T wave inversions in that lead, there were stable T wave inversions in anterior and precordial leads V1 through V3.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Computed tomograph of the abdomen showed fat stranding around the pancreas consistent with a laboratory evaluation described above.
There was no evidence of biliary ductal dilation or pericystic fluid collection.
Since stones had not been identified in her gallbladder it was suspected that her pancreatitis was due to medications or other nonstone causes.
Gastrointestinal bleeding - Serial evaluations of her hemoglobin and hematocrit showed a stable vascular supply.
Coronary artery disease - Following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit serial evaluation of her cardiac markers supported evidence of myocardial infarction, medical management was pursued exclusively.
Hypothyroidism - Her TSH was slightly elevated on admission, however, interval evaluation of her free Levothyroxine showed it to be normal.
There were no changes made to her outpatient regimen.
Diabetes - A modest sliding scale of subcutaneous insulin was administered.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for one episode of flash pulmonary edema for which she received Furosemide, Nitroglycerin and nonmechanical ventilation as she and her daughter had stated previously that she does not wish to have mechanical ventilation during this hospitalization.
Her daughter reiterated her mother's desire to have a Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate order written.
Once her pancreatitis resolved and her cardiac issues were stabilized she was transferred to the Medical Floor for further titration of her medication.
