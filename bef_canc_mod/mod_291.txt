Stable opacity projecting over the right mid-thorax, likely representing pleural fluid loculated within both the major and minor fissures, which slightly limits evaluation for underlying infiltrate.
There is no left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Limited portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable to minimally increased right pleural effusion.
Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged .

Complicating failure was a bradyarrhythmia (discussed below).

A VVI pacer was implanted with good capture and without acute complications of bleeding or infection.
3 CAD History of CAD s/p CABG.
No evidence of acute myocardial ischemia was identified during hospitalization with negative cardiac enzymes.
Again these organisms were isolated from urine culture in setting of an inflammatory urine analysis.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Complete Heart Block Congestive Heart Failure Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: Improved, with paced heart rate of 75 and improved congestive heart failure.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of slow heart rate, for which you had a pacemaker placed.
You also had heart failure and so you should eat a low salt diet and weigh yourself every morning.
Please continue the antibiotic, linezolid, for urinary tract infection for another 6 days.
