Admission EKG: sinus tach @ 120, LAD, nl intervals, poor baseline, no obvious ST changes, ?
CXR [**2170-12-18**]: heart enlarged similar to prior cxr, perihilar haziness and large bilateral pleural effusions c/w moderate CHF.
CE: CK [**Age over 90 **]m 281m 282 Tpn: 0.06, 0.27, 0.13   Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 72 yo woman with DMW, ESRD on HD who p/w a h/o L sided neck pain radiating down L shoulder, associated n/v/diaphoresis/ dyspnea for 12 hrs PTA.
The pt was found to have sinus tachy and hypertensive urgency on admission with BP 224/99--likely due to BP medication noncompliance.
CXR revealed moderate CHF and Echo revealed mild LVH, EF>55%, and moderate pulmonary artery HTN.
The pts presentation was most c/w LV overload/pulmonary edema secondary to hypertensive urgency.
Dyspnea: Her dyspnea was likely due to pulmonary edema induced by hypertensive urgency, as well as demand ischemia.
The pts Tpn peaked at 0.27, likely secondary to  both demand ischemia and renal insufficiency.
Nitro gtt was titrated on day of admission to the pt being chest pain free, and it was discontiued on [**12-19**].
Chest pain/Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Pt again c/o chest pain today [**12-20**], but no EKG changes and no elevation in CE from prior (Tpn 0.08).
The pt presented with c/o chest pain in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
While in the MICU, her Tpn peaked at 0.27, CK peak 282, MB peak 8; likely due to renal insufficiency and demand ischemia.
There was probably some element of demand ischemia in the setting of volume overload, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency.
She was started on lipitor 80 mg po qd in the setting of elevated cardiac enzymes.
The pt has several likely episodes of chest pain on [**12-20**] (due to language barrier, there was some confusion as to the pts symptoms), however all EKGs were unchanged and her cardiac enzymes were unchanged from prior.
The pt seemed to have some chest wall tenderness to palpation at this time.
ESRD: The pts ESRD is felt to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
The pts pulmonary edema (in setting of hypertensive urgency) was felt to be partially induced by being in an overall volume overloaded state (from CRI).
CHF: The pt has mild diastolic dysfunction in the setting of long-standing HTN.
The pts diastolic dysfunction likely compromised the pts ability to expedite forward flow in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
The pt did not take her meds PTA secondary to feeling unwell, likely contributing to her hypertensive urgency.
