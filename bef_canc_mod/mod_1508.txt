- s/p hernia repair.
Brother with CAD status post PCI in 62.
I/VI systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.
I/VI systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium.
LUNGS: slight bibasilar crackles, but otherwise lung fields clear to auscultation b/l ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
Ongoing optimal medical therapy for CAD and CHF.
TTE [**12-25**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of AV groove Lcx due to inability to cross lesion with wire.
CXR PA/LAT [**12-27**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing pleural effusions have minimally decreased in extent.
However, bilateral, right more than left subtle reticular opacities are seen on both the frontal and the lateral radiograph.
Given the small overall lung volumes the findings are suggestive of a fibrotic process.
Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of acute pulmonary edema.

No residual pneumothorax identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG ([**2156**] - LIMA to LAD, SVG to RPDA, SVG to OM1, SVG to ramus), sCHF (EF 20-30%) admitted after elective PCI c/b inability to  Circ, psuedoaneurysm, and hypotension in the setting of HD who experienced in-hospital Vfib arrest greater than 48 hours after NSTEMI.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# NSTEMI/VFib Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for optimization of cardiac function in preparation for possible renal transplant.
During the procedure he was noted to have severe native vessel disease, 2 patent grafts (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RI), and one occluded graft (SVG-OM).
Following the procedure the patient developed chest pain with ST depressions in II/III/aVF and positive CKMB and troponins (CKMB peak of 24.1).
Echo after the procedures was significant for increase in estimated LVEF (30-35% from 20-30% on prior) with preserved global systolic function but severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
A second cardiac catheterization was conducted which was significant for a jailed AV groove Lcx with delayed flow and an unsuccessful attempt at PCI of AV groove Lcx due to inability to cross lesion with wire.
Five days following this patient's NSTEMI, he experienced a VT -> Vfib arrest (caught on telemetry) and was rapidly coded receiving chest compressions and defibrillator shocks with rapid ROSC.
# Femoral Pseudoaneurysm: Following initial catheterization the patient was found to have a pseudoaneurysm reported as 1.2x1.1cm by radiology, read as 0.7cm by interventional radiology.
Per discussion with interventional, thrombin injection of psuedoanuerysm was felt to be of low utility given its small size.
# Symptomatic Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive in dialysis following his initial catheterization to the 60's systolically with mild light-headedness which resolved quickly with fluids and 2 units of PRBCs.
There was initial concern for hemorrhage from his cath site but this was felt to be less likely given the reassuring doppler findings and quick resolution.
He continued to be mildly hypotensive mostly to the high 80's-low 90's during subsequent dialysis sessions but this continued to improve until he was able to tolerate full dialysis with significant fluid removal.
# Acute on Chronic Anemia of CKD: Pt experienced a gradual crit drop from 33 to 25 despite receiving 3 units of blood during his hospitalization.
He had no active sources for bleeding (although there was initial concern related to his femoral pseudoaneurysm as mentioned above).
He was never free of rales or pulmonary edema but also desaturated on room air to the mid-70's when walking even after he was dialyzed to his estimated goal dry weight.
It was thought that given his prior smoking history, he likely had a component of chronic lung disease.
He did not have clinical evidence of CHF exacerbation on admission and was dialyzed to his dry weight.
His home metoprolol and lisinopril were held for a period following his NSTEMI due to hypotension as above.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
He was intermittently in sinus rhythm and afib during this admission.
His warfarin was held for a period of time given elevated levels and possibility of placing an ICD.
# ESRD s/p Kidney Transplant: Stable.
He was dialyzed frequently during this admission due to his borderline blood pressures and inability to tolerate longer sessions.
We increased his sevelamer per renal recs given chronically elevated phosphate.
# GERD: Stable.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Groin U/S in 2 weeks: To assess for pseudoaneurysm .
We anticipate he will have lower coumadin requirements going forward given the amiodarone.
#Renal Transplant: He is naturally quite concerned that having an ICD/arrest may affect his chances for a renal transplant.

Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Chest pain free.
You had a cardiac catheterization with a placement of a bare metal stent.
After the procedure, you started having some chest pain that we believe was from a heart attack.
Later your heart went into an unstable rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.
Stopping these medications prematurely can put you at risk for in stent clot and subsequent heart attack.
You should not drive or operate heavy machinery because if you were to have an abnormal heart rhythm at that time you could serious harm yourself or others.
