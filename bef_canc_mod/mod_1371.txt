Admission Date:  [**2166-6-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-7-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-11-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 29876**] is a 73-year-old male who presented during a routine physical examination with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8430**] with an abnormal EKG.
The patient was promptly referred to a cardiologist who then obtained a stress echocardiogram that determined an ejection fraction of 40-45% with basal inferior, basal posterior, and inferior septal hypokinesis with severe akinesis of the septal portion consistent with prior myocardial infarction.
The patient's left main coronary artery showed moderate calcification with left anterior descending coronary artery also with moderate calcification with D1 a dominant diagonal, with a 90% lesion with heavy calcification.
Additionally, the right coronary artery also showed occlusion in the mid segment but the distal vessel filled from the L-R collaterals.
Morbid obesity.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient is a well-developed, well-nourished male in no apparent distress at the time of discharge.
No evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy.
Mucous membranes were moist with no evidence of oral ulcers.
There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
The patient has a skin graft on the sternum which is well healing with no evidence of erythema, no evidence of purulent drainage, however some mild serosanguinous drainage was noted on the superior portion which was noted to be normal by the plastic surgical service.
Epigastric midline incision was also well healing without any erythema and no evidence of drainage.
Cardiac: Regular rhythm and rate, no evidence of murmurs.
Abdomen: Soft, obese but nontender to palpation with positive bowel sounds and no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly and no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Extremities:  The right lower extremity is healing well with no edema and no erythema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73-year-old male who presented to the cardiothoracic surgery service with right coronary artery dominant vessel occlusion in the mid segment and 80% mid segment lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery mid segment lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery along with D1a dominant diagonal with 90% lesion with heavy calcification.
That evening the patient developed an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation to 130-140 beats per minute which was treated initially with 10 mg of Lopressor and 500 cc of normal saline bolus to maintain the systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg.
During the following day during a careful examination, a sternal click was found along with increasing pulmonary congestion with productive yellow cough.
The intraoperative bronchoscopy result revealed normal nares and nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, and mild secretions in the airways.
Given chest x-ray findings which showed bibasilar atelectasis and rather unimpressive bronchoscopy findings, the patient was initiated on aggressive chest physiotherapy regimen.
However by postoperative day number six, the patient's sternum continued to drain a substantial amount of serosanguinous fluid and plastic surgery continued to examine the patient and closely monitor the necessity of incising the obvious area of infection.
The patient exhibited good strength along with a chest x-ray which did not show a focal infiltrate.
The patient's effusions were also small and moderate on the CT suggesting that his persistent ventilatory dependence was not completely mechanical in nature.
By postoperative day number 11 following the second debridement, the patient's mental status improved and the patient appeared to be breathing on minimal positive pressure support, therefore the patient was extubated successfully.
By [**2166-7-28**] the patient's white blood cell count rose moderately and urinalysis indicated the patient had developed a urinary tract infection following prolonged catheterization.
By postoperative day number 17 following the second debridement, the patient's graft site continued to take well with no evidence of erythema or purulent drainage and the patient continued to progress adequately while being oriented x 3.
