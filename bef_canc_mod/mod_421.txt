Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen.
CXR [**2150-3-29**]: In comparison to the prior study, there has been progression of the interstitial and alveolar edema with slight enlargement of the left pleural effusion.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection .
Continued left pleural effusion.
Mild atelectatic changes are again seen at the left base.

The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly increased; there is an increase in vascular diameters.
Overall, these findings are suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.
Otherwise, no relevant changes, there is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

No clear cause of increased occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
Patient was placed on amiodarone drip after bolus for rate control.
She was started on a heparin drip and then underwent TEE (which showed no clot) and DCCV after which she converted to NSR with a rate in the 60s on the amiodarone gtt.
She will take 400mg QD for a month.
# PUMP: Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved EF.
Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED on admission, likely worsened by her rapid ventricular rate.
She was given 40mg of IV lasix on admission and thereafter was treated with PRN lasix for increased oxygen requirement.
Her weight should be monitored daily as well as her respiratory status at the rehab facility.
If she her weight increases by 3lbs or she has other signs of heart failure, she should be given 40mg of IV lasix.
She was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes and continued on ASA.
# Hypertension: On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol and HCTZ were discontinued.
# Leukocytosis: Initially no clear sign of infection on CXR or UA and was thought likely stress reaction, as noted on previous admission as well.
Spiked fever and had positive UA a few days into admission.
Plan to trend leukocytosis with CBCs and symptoms of UTI at rehab.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Urinary Tract infection Acute on chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain and a rapid heart rate from your atrial fibrillation.
A urine test showed you may have an infection so you were started on an antibiotic.
You had some fluid overload because of your rapid heart rate and a diuretic was given to help your body eliminate the extra fluid.
Also call for worsening shortness of breath.
Start taking warfarin, a blood thinner to prevent a stroke.
