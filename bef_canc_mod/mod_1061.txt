The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is probably mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ?40 %; views are technically suboptimal for assessment of wall motion).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and do not coapt.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (given elevated high IVC/RA pressure and measured TR jet velocity).
Moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed compared to the study of seven hours prior.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change and moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient had brief stay in MICU, was medically managed with kayexalate, insulin and albuterol,  and hyperkalemia resolved.
Was on [**Location **] service with progressive increase in abdominal girth and pleural effusions.
On night of [**8-15**] had 2 Units PRBCs with total 100mg IV lasix but developed shortness of breath with slightly increased oxygen requirment.
Put out minimal urine to lasix with continued dyspnea and oxygen requirment initiating transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] service for higher level managment (i.e.
Had second large volume paracentesis [**8-16**] with removal of 4 iters and administration of 37.5gm [**Month/Year (2) 61990**] for prevention of hepatorenal syndrome in setting of acute renal failure.
