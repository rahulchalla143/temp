Of note, he had been taking increased doses of percocet for the painful foot, and he had been increasingly withdrawn in the setting of his son's death on [**5-6**].
A Code Blue was called, and the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
In the MICU, he was found to be febrile; cultures were significant for a positive UA, and he was started on cipro.
He self-extubated himself during a spontaneous breathing trial and did well without need for reintubation.

CT Head [**2190-5-21**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Unchanged low-attenuation areas in the subcortical white matter and focal low attenuations likely consistent with small vessel disease and lacunar ischemic changes.
Persistent and unchanged right frontal subcortical area of low density, likely consistent with sequela of an old ischemic event.
If there is no clinical contraindication, MRI of the head with diffusion-weighted sequences may provide better characterization of these findings.
Cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis.
Atrophic kidneys.
Bilateral atrophic kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
Interval worsening of the mild pulmonary edema.
Increasing moderate right pleural effusion.
The abdominal aorta had moderate diffuse disease.
The RCIA, IIA and EIA were patent.
The LCIA, EIA and IIA were patent as was the L CFA.
The popliteal artery was patent with mild diffuse disease.
There was a high grade stenosis of the TPT and the AT and the PT were 100% occluded.
There were diffuse high grade stenoses of the peroneal artery.
Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis and no dissection.
Successful stenting of the LSFA with a 6.0 x 60 mm protege stent which was post dilate dto 6.0 with a admiral balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Successful PTA of the L PA  Brief Hospital Course: 89yo gentleman with dementia, HTN, PVD, CAD, AFib (s/p PPM for tachy-brady syndrome), and CKD who admitted with gangrenous toe, found to have mental status changes upon arrival to the floor.
# Mental status change/Hypercarbic respiratory failure Shortly after admission to the hospital floor, the patient was noted to be obtunded.
An ABG showed significant hypercarbia to 120 and a code blue was called.
The precipitating event for his hypercarbic respiratory failure was unclear.
A CT of his head did not show any acute event.
His cultures were significant for Citrobacter freundi in his urine.
Although subsequent CXRs were read as possible pneumonia, his fevers resolved with treatment of his UTI and he did not have clinical manifestations of pneumonia.
Upon review of his prior chest films and CT chest, he has a long history of nodules and pulmonary opacities due to silicosis.
# Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Renal Insufficiency/ Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient's baseline creatinine ranges 1.5-2.0.
His diuretics were held and he was given several liters of fluid in the MICU and transfused one unit of pRBCs.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction.
Although he initially appeared dehydrated on admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] developed lower extremity edema and crackles on his exam in the setting of receiving IV fluids for ARF and prior to his catheterization.
His home lasix dose was increased from 40mg daily to 80mg daily to continue diuresis for his lower extremity edema.
**  # Gangrenous left big toe/Peripheral vascular disease: After the patient's renal function returned to baseline, he was brought to the cath lab and underwent LE angiography with balloon angioplasty and a stent to his LSFA.
There was no evidence of infection in his lower extremities.
# Hypertension: Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] developed hypertensive urgency during his hospital stay.
The trigger for his elevated BPs was not clear, though his systolic blood pressure was noted to be elevated 150s-170s even before he became acutely hypertensive to 200 and was transferred to the CCU.
# Transaminitis: Patient was noted to have a transaminitis upon admission.
He had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis.
His transaminitis resolved with IV fluids and his ALT/AST were normal at the time of discharge.
# Coronary artery disease: There was no evidence of active coronary disease.
# History of Atrial fibrillation: Patient is s/p PPM for tachybrady syndrome.
His wife was advised to avoid narcotics because of the concern that the percocet had been responsible for his hypoventilation.
# Neurotic excoriations on neck: Dermatology was consulted for ulcerated lesions on the patient's neck and head.
They felt that he had neurotic excoriations and that the lesions would heal if he would stop picking at them.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis:  Peripheral vascular disease Secondary Diagnoses:  Dry gangrene, Hypercarbic respiratory failure, Mental status change, Hypertension, Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, mental status at baseline (oriented to person but not place or time)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with dry gangrene of your big toe.
The gangrene is there because of poor blood flow to the foot.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, palpitations, fevers, any change in the wounds on your feet (including redness or pus), or any other concerning symptom.
