There is haziness of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild failure.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with a 5 cm AAA and penetrating thoracic aortic ulcerations, CHF with EF 30-35%, DM, ESRD on HD(MWF) via LUE AV fistula, carotid disease, chronic dyspnea on 3LNC, previous MSSA bacteremia presents from dialysis with hypotension.
In the MICU, prior records were reviewed, including the partially-completed discharge summary from the patient's [**Date range (1) 29412**] admission for asymptomatic hypotension after dialysis.
Consideration was given to whether the patient's arm-thigh blood pressure difference might be a sign of acute aortic pathology.
The same concern was raised during the patient's [**Date range (1) 29411**] admission, during which CT angiography of the chest from showed extensive but stable aortic atherosclerotic disease, and CTA of the abdomen and pelvis showing the patient's known abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of leak or rupture.
They thought the patient's arm pressure was probably more accurate, but that it might not be completely accurate given the patient's extensive peripheral vascular disease and the fact that he was hypotensive in the right arm but asymptomatic.
The patient was discharged without any medication changes, with instructions to follow up with his vascular surgeon and his primary care physician for further management of his hypertension.
Leukocytosis: WBC count was elevated to 12.2 on admission, but the patient had no fever or focal signs of infection.
CXR showed some atelectasis but no infiltrate.
The patient refused to be catheterized for urinalysis and culture.
The nurses were not certain if the bleeding was coming from the patient's GI or GU tract, but the patient refused urinalysis for further evaluation of this.
Likely related to chronic kidney disease +/ chronic blood loss.
No concern for acute bleeding.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count at baseline.
# Ascites: Tapped on previous admission with SAAG 1.3 c/w portal hypertension.
# Peripheral vascular disease: Followed by vascular surgery as outpatient for toe amputation.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for bright red blood on toilet paper.
The patient may also require further evaluation with colonoscopy.
The patient should undergo arterial ultrasound of his right upper extremity to evaluate for peripheral vascular disease, although he is unlikely a candidate for intervention unless he develops symptoms.
-Important info for all providers: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has very significant peripheral vascular disease and BP varies very widely in each limb.
Disp:*30 Cap(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Peripheral vascular disease Hypertension Hypotension .
Secondary: End stage renal disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with low blood pressure.
It was determined that there is a difference between the blood pressure in your arm and the blood pressure in your thigh.
You had a small amount of blood in your urine or stool, but your blood counts were stable.
Followup Instructions: Call your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**] to arrange to be seen within the next week for further management of your blood pressure.
