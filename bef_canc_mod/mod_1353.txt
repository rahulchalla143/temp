She received 10mg IV metoprolol as well as 100mg labetalol without significant change in her blood pressure or tachycardia.
She had one episode of nb/nb emesis, but responded well to zofran.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76-year-old woman with a history of IDDM, Stage IV CKD not on dialysis, s/p splenectomy presents with nausea and nonbloody-nonbilious vomiting for one day, with sinus tachycardia and hypertension without evidence of end-organ ischemia.
# NAUSEA/VOMITING:  The patient's history and benign abdominal exam was not suggestive of an acute abdominal process, and instead was more consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
She was responsive to zofran and fluid resuscitation.
Her abdominal discomfort improved without direct intervention.
# HYPERTENSION:  The patient had similar hospital admissions in the past with significantly elevated blood pressures without evidence of end-organ ischemia.
This does not appear to be a hypertensive emergency, and [**Known lastname **] have been due to her inability to take her home antihypertensives in the setting of her nausea and vomiting.
Notably, she is on clonidine 0.3 mg [**Hospital1 **], which [**Known lastname **] cause reflex hypertension when withdrawn.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Likely a sequelae of her inability to take her home antihypertensives and possibly a stress response to viral illness; her tachycardia improved steadily with labetalol and with her home anti-hypertensives.
# DM:  On glargine 15mg at home, blood sugars elevated to 260s at the time of admission, likely in the setting of an acute stress response with illness.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely due to viral illness or stress response.
No bandemia and patient remained afebrile.
# CKD:  BUN and creatinine were elevated during admission possibly in the setting of dehydration, though patient has an unclear baseline.
