Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73M with h/o NSCLC s/p pneumonectomy, CHF (LVEF 25-30%), COPD, presents with STEMI likely [**2-28**] apical ballooning syndrome and respiratory failure.
1) Respiratory failure: Pt initially p/w Likely aspiration/PNA superimposed on underlying pulmonary disease (s/p right pneumectomy, COPD).
Pt self extubated [**7-26**] after which he became he had apnic episodes lasting up to one minute, for which he was re-intubated.
Pt received several dose of diamox given concern for decreased respiratory drive [**2-28**] metabolic alkalosis.
Pt again failed PS trial on day prior to discharge as pt became tachy with high rr (40s) on PS of 18.
2) STEMI: On [**7-23**] pt had elevated TPN level and EKG with STE V1-V4 with TWI.
On [**7-24**] pt had acute chest pain and received cardiac catheterization which revealed only mild disease except known disease to RCA with good collaterals and apical ballooning.
Elevated troponin levels attributed to apical ballooning vs. coronary vasopspasm.
ACE and BB held for septic shock.
3) Septic shock: On [**7-31**] pt spiked a fever C. diff (+) with MRSA in urine/sputum.
Pt given large volumes of fluid and placed on a titrated dose of levophed.
4) Neuromuscular weakness: Due to pt's apneic episodes, there was a concern for apneic episodes/bulbar weakness during prior extubation.
No current apneic episodes Given LE weakness and ?LUE weakness, neuro suggested L&T spine CT and repeat head CT which were done on [**8-5**] and were negative.
An EMG performed on [**7-26**] was c/w general axonal sensorimotorpolyneruopathy, ?superimposed proximal myopathy; not c/w NMJ disorder (LEMS or MG), though the study was limited.
5) CHF, EF 30%: Diuresis was held due to septic shock/ hypotension.
6) Right scapular wound: Pt has had chronic wound since pneumonectomy.
PEG placed without complications on [**8-7**] by GI.
