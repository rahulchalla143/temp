Per her son, the patient's home nurse noted that she had a slight temperature this morning.
He also noted that her catheter contained urine that was dark and concentrated.
There is no report of SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation.

Family History: Son has DM  Physical Exam: vitals T 95.8 BP 117/50 AR 65 RR 23 O2 sat 95% on 3L NC Gen: Patient awake, responsive to commands HEENT: MMM, PERRLA Heart: RRR, no audible m,r,g Lungs: CTAB, scattered crackles at posterior bases Abdomen: Markedly distended but soft, NT, +BS Extremities: 1+ bilateral edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally; large ulcer approximately 6cm in diameter over L ischium that appears to probe down to bone.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
The imaged portion is obscured by overlying pannus, however, the underlying bowel loops show a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with mildly air-filled distended loops of colon.
No intra-abdominal free air.
Multiple left-sided rib deformities are noted.
[**7-2**]: Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2137-2-7**] show slightly increased interstitial lung markings, which may represent mild edema with areas of new patchy opacity in the right lung base and left mid lung, which may represent atelectasis although aspiration/pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Moderate opacification from fluid versus mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, not [**Last Name (LF) 4646**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect sinusitis, and clinical correlation is recommended.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Mild cardiac decompensation with pulmonary vascular congestion but no alveolar edema.
Small right pleural effusion.
Possible small airways infection in the right middle lobe.
Descending aortic graft in place without complication.
Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggesting underlying pulmonary artery hypertension.
[**2137-7-7**] MRI HIP FINDINGS: Please note that due to hardware failure, the complete sequences could not be obtained.
There is a comminuted left proximal femur intertrochanteric fracture, with coxa varus orientation.
There is a large amount of marrow edema within the proximal femur.
Marrow edema and a small fracture line also extends into the femoral neck.
There is a small left hip joint effusion.
Also noted is abnormal marrow signal in bilateral ischial tuberosities, left greater than right.
These areas of abnormal marrow signal are just deep to the bilateral decubitus ulcers.
In the appropriate clinical setting, these are consistent with osteomyelitis.
There is no evidence of right hip fracture.
There is a large amount of pelvic musculature atrophy, consistent with patient's history of quadriplegia.
There are spinal cysts which are partially visualized on the T1 images in the sacral spine.
Differential consideration includes Tarlov cyst.
Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal left femur.
Sclerosis and osseous irregularity of the left ischial tuberosity in the region of a vacuum drain is concerning for osteomyelitis.
[**7-5**] R HIP XR: Markedly limited study without definite evidence for acute bony injury or marked infection.
If there is high clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging is recommended.
(Per discussion with radiologist after fracture seen on MR, fracture was previously visible on this film as well, but was poor study)    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 71yo paraplegic female with PMH as listed above who presents with transient hypotension and leukocytosis.
1)Hypotension: Patient initially found to be hypotensive with SBP~90's despite receiving 3L NS.
The drop in her BP may have been early sepsis physiology given fever, history of recurrent UTI's.
She may also have some underlying autonomic dysregulation given paraplegia.
She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given prior culture results which grew E.coli and enterococcus.
After transfer to the floor on [**2137-7-4**] her BP remained stable SBP 110s-120s, no longer requiring IVF.
Her U/A was positive for leukocytes and nitrites but no WBCs and urine cx were negative.
Plastic surgery was consulted to see patient while she was in-house and recommended VAC dsg changes q MWF.
She continued to spike fevers until [**7-5**] on Vanc/Zosyn but remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
She also had XRs of her hips to look for osteomyelitis given B/L decubitus ulcers.
MRI showed abnormal marrow signal of B/L ischial tuberosities near areas of decubitus ulcers c/w osteomyelitis.
This resolved rapidly with resolution of hypotension and fever.
She was also reporting increased bladder spasms since Baclofen was originally held in MICU.
Spasms resolved with restarting Baclofen and she had decreased leaking around SP catheter after catheter/bag change.
She has a wound vac on her left lower extremity.
When findings of osteomyelitis were reported on MRI, plastics was again contact[**Name (NI) **] and they did not feel that further debridement was neccessary at that time.
L buttock VAC dsg changes should continue qMWF.
Left femur fracture: Incidentally, patient noted to have comminuted L intertrochanteric femur fracture on MRI.
She denied any pain or h/o trauma.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D supplements as well as Alendronate q week for atraumatic fracture.
8)COPD: Pt reports she has "lung disease" but denies known h/o COPD and PFTs in [**2128**] were normal.
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**12-5**] aerosols Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for constipation.

?COPD (PFTs normal [**2128**]), intermittently on 3L home O2,   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, normotensive   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fever, low blood pressure, and confusion.
This was most likely from an infection of the bones in your hips.
We also found that you have a fracture of your left hip.
You should not bear any weight on this leg and should have a repeat X ray in approximately 6 weeks to ensure that it is healing.
We added Alendronate 75 mg PO q week  Please return to the ER or call your primary care physician if you have fever >101, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or pain in your hips.
You should also have a repeat X ray of your left hip to ensure continued resolution of hip fracture.
