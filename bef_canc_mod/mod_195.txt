Admission Date:  [**2119-10-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-10-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-10-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right subclavian central line placement Intubation PICC placement   History of Present Illness: The patient presented to OSH ED yesterday w/neck pain since the 17th.
CXR initially showed extensive right-sided PNA and the next day (day of transfer) was notable for left upper lobe infiltrate.
Exam was notable for fresh track marks.
Head CT was negative for acute intracranial abnormality.
2 sets of blood cultures were + for gram + cocci; echo (TTE) negative for vegetations and EF was 70%.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C (liver biopsy in [**2116**] as showing stage III fibrosis) Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoma history of IVDU depression sialolithiasis fine tremor peripheral neuropathy s/p prolonged ICU stay for heroin and benzodiazepine overdose multi-lobar pneumonia (M. cattharalis)  Social History: hx for polysubstance abuse, lives with her son   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: AF 37.2C/ 105/65// 88// 100% Vented and on dopamine Acutely-ill female, looks younger than stated age.
Neck: supple, no LAD Heart: rr, no m/g/r nl s1s2 Lungs: Diffusely rhonchorous, r>l, reduced BS at left base, no rales Abd: Distended, diffusely tender, no BS audible, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well-perfused, no lower extremity edema, track marks in left antecub, no splinter hemorrhages.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small (~1cm) anterior pericardial effusion but without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Peripheral and basilar predominant interstitial pattern affecting the right lung to a much greater degree than the left, in corresponding to more extensive areas of consolidation on earlier radiograph of [**2119-9-23**].
These findings may be due to slowly resolving pneumonia, but areas of interstitial disease from drug toxicity, previously masked by an overlying pneumonia, is within the differential diagnosis, particularly if the patient has received bleomycin therapy.
Continued radiographic followup is recommended to assess for resolution.
No radiographic evidence of acute, displaced rib fracture.
If symptoms are localized to a specific area, coned-down rib films with metallic marker may be helpful.
Interstitial lung opacities as described above.
Please see recent report [**2119-10-27**] regarding differential diagnosis and recommendations.

* 1) Respiratory failure: Her respiratory secondary to a right upper lobe pneumonia.
When her blood cultures grew out strep.
She became febrile on [**10-19**] and [**10-20**] self-extubated on [**10-20**], and later had to be reintubated on [**10-21**] due to tachypnea and alkalemia.
She was extubated successfully on [**10-25**] and weaned without difficulty to nasal cannula.
2) Strep Pneumo sepsis: Initially, the etiology of her gram positive cocci bacteremia was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] her history of IV drug use and her fresh track marks on exam, there was initial supicion for Endocarditis.
However, at the outside hospital, she had a negative transthoracic echocardiogram for endocarditis.
Once her blood cultures grew out strep.
pneumonia, it seemed most likely that her pneumonia was the source of her bacteremia.
On hospital day 2, she was weaned off of the dopamine and maintained on the vasopressin; however, due to low urine output, she was switched back to the dopamine and off of the vasopressin.
The sepsis was likely from pnumococcal pneumonia.
See Respitroy failure section for discussion of pneumonia treatment.
He CKs were elevated on initial presentation to the outside hospital, which is consistent with rhabdomyolysis.
4) Acute renal failure: Her elevated creatinine was likely secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension.
She had a negative abdominal ultrasound for ascites.
no head trauma.
patient c/o lumbar back pain, mild headache.
cards consulted for flipped T waves in precordial leads.
9) UTI - found to have positive urinalysis on [**10-27**].
11) CXR - Patient with interstitial findings on CXR.
Likely [**1-25**] resolving pna but could be drug toxicity.
