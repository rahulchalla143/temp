Mild O2 requirement, 93% on 3L NC, WBC 16.5, and CXR with old L base opacity, started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP.
He had a witnessed aspiration event with liquids at ~0230 on [**9-30**].
Noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam.
Repeat CXR showed possible new RML opacity.
On conversation with son, the patient denies chest pain and shortness of breath.
He was transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia and possible CO2 retention.
In ICU found to have aspiration pneumonia and treated with BiPAP and antibiotics  with some improvement.
CHF- last TTE in [**11-29**] with EF 50-55%, mild LVH, severely dilated LV with intrinsically depressed systolic function [**1-28**] valvular disease 2.

Left atrial enlargement.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-6-30**] the rate has slowed and ST-T wave abnormalities previously recorded in leads I and aVL are less prominent.
STUDY: CT scan of the pelvis without intravenous contrast.
Degenerative changes of both hip joints without signs for acute bony injury.
No fractures or dislocations identified.
No fracture or listhesis.
Multilevel spondylosis.
Transitional vertebral body.
No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
Small left suprapatellar knee effusion.
LEFT HIP ULTRASOUND: No evidence of fluid collection adjacent to the left femoral head and neck.
The patient demonstrated premature spillover and poor valve closure.
There was also a single episode of witnessed aspiration of thin barium liquids which was not recognized by the patient.
A relatively weak cued cough was then observed.
There was also significant retention of liquids in the valleculae.
There findings demonstrated minimal improvement with [**Known lastname **] tuck maneuver and clearing maneuvers.
ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
A mass or vegetation on the mitral valve cannot be excluded.
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # Aspiration pneumonia: Patient presented with left hip pain but was found to have a 3 liter oxygen requirement on admission.
On hospital day #1, patient had a witnessed aspiration with desaturation.
He had been started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin on admission for community acquired pneumonia.
This was changed to ceftriaxone/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia in the unit and he has completed a 10 day course for treatment.
Bedside evaluation showed overt aspiration and video evaluation reveals silent aspiration so patient is now on aspiration precautions and modified diet.
# Persistent hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration vs end stage CHF.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Onset in unit.
# Left hip pain: Pain in left hip on admission with negative work-up (CT and ultrasound).
Pain resolved without intervention.
# Possible neuromuscular vs CNS disorder: Given aspiration, low NIF, and ptosis, neuro was consulted for possible neuromuscular disease.
# CHF: Patient has end stage heart failure and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**].
During his admission, he had an episode of aspiration vs possibly flash pulmonary edema.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
