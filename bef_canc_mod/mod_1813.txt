No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
While the entire visualized ascending aorta appears dilated, there appears to be a focal outpouching at the level just below the RPA.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
Occasionally, one leaflet is slower than the other to close, possibly due to poor LV contractility.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

The small amount of right pleural effusion is unchanged.
Anterior mediastinal air with small air-fluid level noted on the lateral view are redemonstrated with the air-fluid level potentially representing small loculated anterior pneumothorax in combination with post-surgery air in the mediastinum.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
