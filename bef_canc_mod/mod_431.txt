Admission Date: [**2128-4-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2128-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-3-6**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia and cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolic dysfunction with negative catheterization, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3 weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea and vomiting.
The patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea with a 30-pound weight gain and decreased urine output.
The patient was also found to have nephrotic range proteinuria and elevated LFTs.
Echocardiogram revealed depression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.
GI Service was consulted and it suspected that her increasing liver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injury with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
The Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic nephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.
Generally, in mild respiratory distress, alert and oriented x 3.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Chest x-ray on [**4-7**], shows congestive heart failure versus bibasilar atelectasis.
Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 20 percent, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right ventricular and free wall hypokinesis, 3 plus TR, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with non-ischemic congestive heart failure associated with [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia with a recent worsening of her ejection fraction to 20 percent.
The patient had mild elevation in her cardiac enzymes, more consistent with atrial fibrillation and hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
These enzymes trended down and were not consistent with myocardial infarction.
The patient was felt to be at risk for arrhythmia secondary to her severe congestive heart failure and would likely need pacemaker replacement in the future.
She was started on a Natrecor drip due to her worsening renal function with Lasix.
She was diuresed well with the Natrecor and the Congestive Heart Failure Service followed her while she was in the hospital.
Atrial flutter:  The patient has evidence of sick sinus syndrome with occasional positives and is very sensitive to beta-blockers.
She was started on dofetilide per the Electrophysiology Service in an attempt to convert her to sinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure.
Therefore, dofetilide was considered to be a poor antiarrhythmic choice for her.
Per the Electrophysiology Service, there were no other antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need to follow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablation is unsuccessful, likely AV node ablation with pacemaker placement.
Renal:  The patient was in nephrotic range proteinuria, likely due to diabetic nephropathy.
Because of her unstable creatinine dofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her.
Elevated LFTs:  There was no clear toxic etiology for increased LFTs.
This was felt to be either related to transient hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] versus hepatic congestion from congestive heart failure.
Depression:  The patient was with a history of severe depression with suicide attempts.
She was continued on her Paxil and during her hospitalization denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations.
