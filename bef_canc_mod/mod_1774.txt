Please get MRI with gadolinium and diffusion weighted imaging.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: The patient with listeria meningitis, question of infarct in the right medial frontal lobe, for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
There is subtle increased signal seen in this region on diffusion images, indicating T2 shine through.
The appearances could still be suggestive of an evolving subacute infarct.
However, given the clinical history of listeria meningitis, an associated infection in this area could not be excluded.
Therefore, correlation with lumbar puncture findings and a followup are recommended.
There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Slightly increased T2 hyperintensity and new enhancement in the medial right frontal lobe since the previous MRI examination of [**2147-11-18**].
However, given the clinical history of listeria meningitis, associated infection could not be excluded and correlation with CSF findings and followup up are recommended.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement are seen.
Ulcerative colitis, chronic active, with mucosal disease extending from right colon to distal margin.
No granulomas or dysplasia.
The specimen is opened longitudinally to reveal a small segment of distal ileum measuring 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
The proximal 11 cm of the colon has unremarkable tan-pink mucosa, while the remainder of the specimen shows a dark red and granular mucosa with numerous small polyps.
The specimen is sectioned and represented as follows:  A = proximal ileal margin, B = representation of appendix, C = representation of uninvolved cecum, D-G = representation of remainder of bowel at 10 cm intervals, H = distal margin, I = representation of possible lymph nodes.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2147-11-25**] 7:05 PM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  Reason: r/o toxic megacolon  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54 year old woman with UC now with worsening diarrhea, abd pain and distension.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o toxic megacolon SUPINE AND ERECT - ABDOMEN  HISTORY: 54-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis and abdominal pain, rule out megacolon.
IMPRESSION: Two views of the abdomen show centrally clustered small bowel loops moderately distended with air concerning for small bowel obstruction.
The colon may be diffusely thick walled, but it is not distended and there is no evidence of intraperitoneal free air.
Lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions, new since [**10-20**].
