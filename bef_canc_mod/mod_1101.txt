The patient had fecal peritonitis and was in septic shock.
She originally underwent a damage control procedure with colostomy for abdominal sepsis.
Subsequently, the pelvic tumor began to bleed and she underwent a second procedure for resection of the pelvic tumor to achieve hemostasis.
During the intervening period, she had several episodes of admission for abdominal abscesses which we felt were due to some mucous leakage from the top of the rectum.
On study, however, we could find no obstruction of the distal rectum.
