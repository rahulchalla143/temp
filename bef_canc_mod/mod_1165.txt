Past Medical History: HIV HCV cirrhosis HCC s/p RFA [**3-31**] (4.5x3.4 cm hepatoma, which was biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).)
He has no military history.
Features consistent with recurrent viral hepatitis C (Grade [**12-27**]).
No diagnostic findings of acute cellular rejection identified.
Focal, mild bile duct damage with a rare associated neutrophil (see note).
Trichrome stain demonstrates increased portal fibrosis (Stage 1).
Iron stain is negative for iron deposition.
Note:  The bile duct findings are suggestive of a mild component of biliary obstruction/ischemia.
Compared to the prior biopsy (S07-[**Numeric Identifier 66355**]), the current biopsy demonstrates a relative increase in lobular apoptotic hepatocytes and similar degrees of portal inflammation, with an overall reduction in the amount of bile duct damage.
This revealed no dilated bile ducts and patent choledochojejunal anastomosis site with only mild smooth narrowing.
Able to enter, but could not successfully catheterie the nondilated intrahepatic ducts.A chest portable AP with upright position was ordered to rule out pneumothorax.
Blood and urine was sent for culture.
Decompressed intrahepatic duct with severe stricture at the hepaticojejunostomy was noted.
Performed serial cholangioplasty with a cutting balloon and conventional balloons at the stricture with substantial improvement but presnce of a residual moderate stricture.
The liver biopsy was negative for rejection.
Features were consistent with recurrent viral hepatitis C (Grade [**12-27**]).
Focal, mild bile duct damage with a rare associated neutrophil (see note).
Trichrome stain demonstrates increased portal fibrosis (Stage 1).
Iron stain is negative for iron deposition.
Note:  The bile duct findings are suggestive of a mild component of biliary obstruction/ischemia.
Compared to the prior biopsy (S07-[**Numeric Identifier 66355**]), the current biopsy demonstrates a relative increase in lobular apoptotic hepatocytes and similar degrees of portal inflammation, with an overall reduction in the amount of bile duct damage.
Plan: The patient may return in 6 weeks for re-dilatation at the hepaticojejunostomy, for instance with a 7 mm cutting balloon and 8 mm and 9 mm conventional balloon catheters and 10 F drainage catheter palcement.
It was stressed that he should be contact[**Name (NI) **] at home to urge him to return to the hospital due to the fact he still had a PICC line in place and vancomycin resistant enterococcus positive blood cultures.
