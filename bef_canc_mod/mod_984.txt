Pt was at OSH from [**11-3**] to [**11-12**] for 2 months of SOB, wheezing, sputum production, found to have LLL PNA and large mediastinal mass deviating the trachea to the right.
Course was c/b Afib requiring dilt gtt and ARF with Cr up to 4.0 on [**11-9**].
Extubated on [**11-22**] but reintubated for excessive secretions on [**11-24**], then trached.
FNA of mass indeterminant but bx during trach placement with papillary thyroid ca, follicular type.
Also Prednisone taper for COPD until [**12-1**].
Recurrent sputum pos for MRSA, started on linezolid (vanco thought to have caused thrombocytopenia).
At [**Hospital 100**] rehab since [**12-1**],unable to wean from vent initially due to secretions.
Pt unable to see endocrine and onc as outpt b/o ventilator and family requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further inpt management.
Also diarrhea but C diff neg repetitively.
Her coumadin was held since her INR remained around 2.5 due to poor nutrition.
She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible trach stent (by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], PEG and further follow up by Endocrine and Oncology for her thyroid cancer.
On transfer, she is afebrile and comfortable with 100% O2 on 40% trach mask.
Past Medical History: NIDDM COPD HTN Dyslipidemia Bronchitis Gout MRSA pneumonia s/p thyroid surgery in past (?R lobectomy) Recently diagnosedd papillary thryoid cancer, follicular type   Social History: living at [**Hospital **] rehab, italian speaking  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals - T:97.7 BP: 115/48 HR:93 RR:26 02 sat: 100% on 40%TM GENERAL: Calm, NAD, comfortable SKIN: warm and well perfused, bruises on UEs HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, MMM, clear OP NECK: trach in place, large goiter palpable CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: very coarse, rhoncherous BS in all lung fields, no rales ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender, no rebound/guarding, no masses EXTR: no C/C/E, warm, 1+ to 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: Responds to questions with gestures, moves all extremities ACCESS: R Midline in place  Pertinent Results: Pertinent Results from rehab: Labs at rehab from [**12-21**]: .
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
No right thyroid lobe.
Incompletely imaged heterogenous soft tissue mass containing  calcifications extending along the left thoracic inlet and upper  retrosternal region causing compression and rightward deviation of the trachea.
The mass does not appear to invade mediastinal structures.
Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much less likely a thymic lesion.
Peribronchiolar nodular opacities and ground-glass attenuation in the posterior right upper lobe may represent evolving infectious etiology or aspiration.
Left lower lobe collapse with opacification of the left lower  lobe bronchus.
Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at the left hilum.
2.0 cm ill-defined low attenuation in the upper pole of the right kidney, which is incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
CXR [**12-22**] (read pending): Trach in good position, mediastinum shifted to R, small b/l pleural effusions .
EKG: NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, no acute ST changes .
Bibasal effusions with atelectasis at the lung bases and scattered parenchymal patchy lung opacities suggestive of infection.
Satisfactory position of the PEG tube with no hematoma or free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.
Spigelian hernia with tiny pockets of air in the surrounding subcutaneous tissues, but no stranding, fluid collections or skin thickening.
Enlarged left lobe of the thyroid gland with retrosternal extension causing displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet as described above.
Bibasal effusions with passive atelectasis of the lower lobes and scattered ill-defined patchy opacities in both lungs suggestive of infection.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89F Italian speaking woman with COPD, HTN, DM, recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11-12**] - [**12-1**]) large mediastinal mass, diagnosed with thyroid cancer, s/p intubation and subsequent trach (b/o increased secretions), now retransferred from rehab for further management of her cancer and PEG tube placement.
Mediastinal Mass: Recent diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer, follicular type.
Recent Head/Torso CT negative metastatic w/u but without contrast.
A PEG has been placed one day after admission by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1533**] from thoracic surgery.
Pt was evaluated by endocrine who deferred further discussions to outpt setting given multiple other issues.
Then MRSA pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) **] tracheitis s/p vanc and fluc treatment.
Extubated on [**2191-11-22**] but reintubated b/o secretions and trached.
PT was continued on linezolid for MRSA bactermemia and CTX for proteus in sputum (planned course of linezolid and CTX until [**12-29**]).
She should follow up with interventional pulmonary for a flexible bronchoscopy in approx.
Afebrile on admission.
Coumadin was not given over the last few days at rehab since INR remained high off Coumadin, likely due to poor nutrition.
Afib: Patient with new afib since admission to OSH.
Was intermittently in afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt and increasing doses of dilt PO during recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
At rehab, she was continued on PO dilt with no significant events.
ARF: Patient with ARF on recent admission, likely pre-renal given improvement with IVF.
Meds on transfer from rehab (PO meds on hold since [**12-17**] due to loss of NGT): Allopurinol 100mg PO daily CTX 1gm IV q24h (started [**12-16**]) Diltiazem 30mg qid PO Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix 10mg daily IM Lasix 20mg PO daily Glargine 4U qHS RISS Linezolid 600mg IV q12h (start [**12-18**]) Albuterol nebs prn Bisacodyl PR prn Epinephrine nebs prn Atrovent nebs prn Flagyl 500mg IV q8h Omeprazole 20mg PO daily Omeprazole 40mg IV daily KCl 20mEq [**Hospital1 **] PO Verapamil 2.5mg qid IV Warfarin per INR (not given in last 4 days given INR therapeutic without Warfarin)   Discharge Medications: 1.
