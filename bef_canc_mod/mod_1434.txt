She was evaluated by IP in ED, had a trial of bipap with minimal improvement.
She was intubated in ED, IP bronched her and saw no mucous plug, clear and patent stent, and distal airways.
Of note, her last spirometry showed no obstructive pattern.

No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
No focal pulmonary consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Aerosolized secretions are noted within the indwelling tracheal Y stent in the proximal right and left main stem bronchus in conjunction with bronchial wall thickening and regions of bronchiectasis within the right lower lobe which may suggest superimposed infectious bronchitis.
Bilateral pulmonary nodules as described above.
If the patient has outside CT imaging, comparison should be made to assess for stability.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and coronary circulation.
Bilateral pleural effusions with regions of adjacent compression atelectasis.
Left hepatic cyst with calcification .
CXR [**2149-3-1**]: There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are noted.
There is no definite consolidation or pneumothorax identified.
Extensive calcifications of the aortic arch are noted.IMPRESSION: Tiny bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
No definite consolidation identified.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: elevated right atrial pressure with normal left and right ventricular contractile function  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 75 y/o F with tacheobronchomalacia s/p stenting, OSA, who now presents with SOB.
# SOB: Based on history, she may have initially presented with reactive airway disease / asthma exacerbation with no compromise of her oxygenation.
Patient's lungs were without crackles.
She suddenly decompensated in the ER with increased labor breathing and respiratory distress and had a bronchoscopy looking for mucus plug and/or stent obstruction.
However, the bronchoscopy showed patent stent and no mucus.
Patient was emergently intubated had a PE-CT that showed normal lung parenchyma and no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
On [**2149-3-3**] she was extubated and started with respiratory distress afterwards with SpO2 of 100% on 4 L NC.
She underwent a bronchoscopy and there was paradoxical movement of the vocal cords with edematous cords and with patent airways and stent and distal malacia without any evidence of secretions or mucus plug.
Patient was afebrile and without a white count.
The most likely diagnosis after extensive work up was panic attack with paradoxical vocal cord movement.
They recommended video swallow that showed mild delay without other abnormalities.
Patient can have full liquids and soft solids, but stated that she prefered thickened fluids.
Benzodiazepines were not recommended since she will need very high-dose in case of the repeating episode and will need very close monitor.
# Volume status -  Pt had low urine output first day of admission, FeNA consistent with volume depletion and prerenal state.
# Hypertension - Patient is diabetic and currently BP not on started according to JNC-7 guidelines.
She will benefit of ACEI, but did not start them in the setting of respiratory distress in case she were to get cough as an adverese reaction.
# DM - Patient was given ISS.
# Anemia ??????

Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath.
