He then developed a focal hematoma, which progressively increased in size over the next few days.
He was started on Keflex to cover for cellulitis and also Vicodin for pain.
The patient subsequently noted a decrease in his hematoma size.
Today, he went to see his cardiologist, who was concerned given the significant hematoma size and concurrent cellulitis and referred him to the Emergency Department to be admitted for IV antibiotics.
The patient does complain of shin pain localizing to the hematoma site.
He denies any distal weakness or any sensory deficits.
No fevers or chills.
At the time of presentation in the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile with vital signs stable.
Ischemic valvular cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin.
Obstructive sleep apnea, on BiPAP.
CHF with EF 35 percent.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
GENERAL:  An elder male sitting in bed in no acute distress.
No vesicles or focal bleeding.
NECK:  Soft and supple, no JVD.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Left shin with an approximately 4 cm circumferential hematoma with surrounding erythema and 2 plus pitting edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Strength 5/5 in bilateral lower extremities, although left lower extremity exam limited secondary to pain.
Nonfocal neurologic exam.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cellulitis:  The patient with left lower extremity hematoma occurring in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
He then developed a secondary cellulitis.
The surrounding erythema did resolve, and his edema markedly improved.
Given the lack of resolution of hematoma and concern for a concurrent cellulitis, in addition to functional deficits due to immobility due to pain, a Vascular Surgery consult was obtained to evaluate the hematoma.
He tolerated this procedure well without any complications.
However, several hours after the procedure, he did have extensive bleeding from the hematoma site.
The wound was compressed and pressure dressings were applied with subsequent control of bleeding.
Atrial fibrillation/AVR:  The patient was admitted with diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and a recent AVR, for which he takes Coumadin.
CHF:  The patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF with an EF of 35 percent.
He had no clinical evidence of failure during this hospitalization.
His inputs, outputs, and weights were followed, and he was maintained on a cardiac diet with fluid restriction.
CHF Service did see him while he was in-house and felt he was doing well on his current regimen.
SVT:  The patient with AICD defibrillator in place.
He did have a short run of an SVT, an approximately 6-beat run, for which he was asymptomatic while in-house.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin.
