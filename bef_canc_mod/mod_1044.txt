Faint DP's Right shoulder with increased warmth and pain on passive motion.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and there is new vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness and scattered septal thickening consistent with pulmonary edema from either fluid overload or CHF.
Round nodule in right upper lobe is again demonstrated and corresponds to a suspicious nodule on recent chest CT dated [**2144-6-19**].
Small left pleural effusion is without change but a new right effusion is present.
[**Numeric Identifier **] PICC W/O PORT  [**2144-6-29**] 1:44 PM  Reason: Please pace a L sided PICC line, but insert line only as so  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 78 year old man with GAS sepsis, L sided pacemaker, and R arm septic arthritis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please pace a L sided PICC line, but insert line only as so far as the distal subclavian/proximal braciocephalic, ie AWAY FROM THE PACEMAKER INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.
INDICATIONS: 78-year-old man with pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
A small residual pneumothorax up to 4 mm in thickness remains.
Otherwise, there has been no significant change.
IMPRESSION: Small persistent pneumothorax.
PREVIOUS BIOPSIES:  [**2144-6-24**]   [**-7/2379**]   BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS [**2141-10-4**]   [**-4/3727**]   RIHT SHOULDER   REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]  DIAGNOSIS: Bronchoalveolar lavage:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages and   squamous cells.
Lung, right upper lobe, transbronchial biopsy:  Lung parenchymal, and fibrous tissue with anthracotic pigment.
No malignancy identified.
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A 16 x 19 mm lobulated solid solitary soft tissue nodule is seen in the right upper lobe posterior segment, abutting the major fissure.
It corresponds with the recent chest radiograph findings and has no cavitation.
No other lung nodules are identified.
In the right upper lobe, there is scarring, with scattered micronodules and mild bronchiectasis, probably representing sequela of previous granulomatous exposure.
Bilateral small nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusions are present, with associated compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe; consolidation in the right lower lobe is also present, more than would be expected for atelectasis.
Several borderline lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum, none larger than an 8 mm precarinal node (2:24).
No definite hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.
The heart is enlarged; there are extensive coronary vascular calcifications, evidence of previous CABG, and dual-lead AICD, with wires following the expected course to a left pectoral generator.
Staples overlying the right pectoralis muscle and subcutaneous air are consistent with the patient's recent shoulder procedure.
This study is not designed to examine the abdomen, however, non-contrast images show layering radiopaque gallstones and several kidney cysts that are similar in appearance to the previous exam including CT scan of [**2141**].
Calcified splenic granuloma and hiatal hernia are also noted.
No mass lesions are seen in the imaged portion of liver, adrenals, kidneys, or spleen.
Bone windows show midline sternotomy wires and mild degenerative changes of the spine.
Findings are most consistent with a lung neoplasm; septic embolus is much less likely, as the lesion is solitary, without cavitation.
Scarring and multiple micronodules in the right upper lobe with very mild bronchiectasis, probably representing sequelae of granulomatous exposure but activity of disease is indeterminate without older studies for comparison; correlation with current infectious status or previous films is recommended to help determine chronicity of these findings.
Consolidation in right lower lobe may represent a pneumonia or atelectasis.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts as previously documented.
TEE - Conclusions: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation or abscess seen.
TTE - Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the basal halves of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal inferior and distal anterior walls.
The apex is mildly dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-4-29**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is slightly lower and no aortic regurgitation is now seen.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CT spine- CONCLUSION: Acute T11 compression fracture with a small retropulsed fragment encroaching on the spinal canal.
No cervical lymphadenopathy, abnormal soft tissue mass, or abnormal fluid collection to suggest paraspinal abscess.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine as described above.
Low-attenuation area noted within the right maxilla likely represent periodontal disease.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
No definite paraspinal fluid collections; however, CT has low sensitivity for evaluation of spinal abscesses.
1.5 cm right kidney complex cyst, and 3 cm left kidney simple cyst.
Cholelithiasis and mild gallbladder wall thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the prolonged complicated course - course described by problems -  # Sepsis from strept bacteremia - source is left leg cellulitis.

Pain controlled.
# Pulmonary nodules/ Abnormal CT chest - concern for malignany.
# Pneumothorax s/p bronchoscopy - pt developed a pneumothorax after bronchoscopy.
# Hyponatremia - resolved with diuresis.
# Gout, acute - rt big toe.
# Thoracic fracture - cause could be traumatic vs osteomyelitis.
# Left kidney mass - as above - US showed - 1.5 cm right kidney complex cyst, and 3 cm left kidney simple cyst.
# ARF - from ATN/sepsis - resolved.
# CHF systolic - EF 35-40%.
Had post-op hypoxia due to mild pulmonary edema on [**2144-6-15**].
# Parox AFIB - Warfarin - Restarted after all procedures.
