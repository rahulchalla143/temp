Admission Date:  [**2195-1-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-1-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2145-9-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer first diagnosed in [**2194-5-2**] status post chemotherapy and radiation, who underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy on [**2194-11-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] at this institution.
Since that operation, the patient's postoperative course has been complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound infection, wound dehiscence, and creation of a fistula and diversion after breakdown of his anastomosis.
On that date, the patient began to experience fever and mental status changes, and was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where he was found to be frankly septic.
Extensive work-up of the patient included CT scan of his abdomen and chest, magnetic resonance imaging scan of his abdomen, bronchoscopy and multiple cultures, revealing that the patient was floridly septic, although a discrete source was not clearly identified.
The patient's fistula was found to be draining frank pus, although no discrete drainable fluid collection was found in his chest.
Discussions were undertaken with the family and he was made DNR, and the decision was made to transfuse no new blood products and to start no pressors.
He was found to be in disseminated intravascular coagulation and appeared to be having liver failure.
The patient's course continued to deteriorate and on the morning of [**2195-1-30**] the patient was found to still be spiking fevers, was hemodynamically unstable, and to be in severe disseminated intravascular coagulation.
