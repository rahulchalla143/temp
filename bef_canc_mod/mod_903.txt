There are vague rounded opacities projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung seen over the anterior and lateral ribs, suggesting healing fractures.
The lungs are clear of focal consolidation or effusion.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple healing right-sided rib fractures.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 36F history of poorly controlled DM1, Barrett's esophagitis/gastritis, HTN, diastolic CHF with LVEF >60%, h/o PEA arrest in [**2139**], here with symptoms consistent with gastroparesis flair and transferred to MICU for diabetic ketoacidosis with secondary issue of hemeatemsis likely from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
She had a slight leukocytosis on admission, but no other signs of infection.
# Gastroparesis - Patient's presenting symptoms were consistent with previous gastroparesis flairs (previously unresposive to Ativan, Reglan, Zofran, and erythromycin).
Her gastroparesis has a characteristic intermittent flare-up every two to three months.
# Hypertensive Urgency - Patient had labile pressures while in the MICU with sBPs>200, which was controlled in MICU with labetolol drop and IV labetolol.
Pt had significant autonomic dysfunction likely in the setting of long-term poorly controlled diabetes.
# Hypernatremia - Free water deficit of 1.2 was repleted with 1/2NS with slow correction of hypernatremia from 153 to 144 over 28 hours.
# Anemia and Coffee ground emesis - Consistent with low-volume upper GI bleed from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
During this admission, Cr 1.2-1.8 most likely due to pre-renal etiology given poor PO intake and vomiting.
Following IV hydration patient was noted to have a down trend in her BUN and [**Last Name (un) **].
