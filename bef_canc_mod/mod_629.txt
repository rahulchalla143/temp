he was seen in clinic that day and had his T-tube clamped.
Noted to have lower extremity edema with lethargy.
Oxygen saturation was 60-70% on RA with fever to 101.0.
Was alert and oriented, but reported upper respiratory congestion and cough.
ABG showed hypoxia and hypercarbia: 7.34/67/65, CXR showed LLL consolidation.

A CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was obtained that did not show a PE, but a LLL pneumonia and a R posterior perihepatic fluid collection were visualized.
By systems:  Neuro: He was admitted on his outpatient regimen of resperidal for his bipolar disorder.
Psychiatry was consulted and had no specific recommendations.
Neurology consult did not think there was a central inhibition of his respiratory drive.
There were no major valvular abnormalities and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension that had increased from the last study.
He was diuresed with lasix, for diastolic dysfunction.
Pulmonary:  Treatment was started for LLL pneumonia with zosyn.
He was maintained on BIPAP, however he continued to be somnolent and tachypneic with elevated pCO2.
This showed mild LMSB deviation c/w LLL collapse and minimal secretions.
He remained a difficult wean with hypercarbia thought to be driven by lasix diuresis with metabolic alkalosis.
Pulmonary consult was obtained: thought that pt had pickwickian syndrome with hypoventilation with diastolic dysfunction/CHF and needed more agressive diuresis.
His pleural effusions continued to worsen so more lasix and diamox were admininstered.
His effusions eventually improved and his oxygenation improved, but he continued to have a poor respiratory drive, requiring high pressure support.
Trach collar trials were unsuccessful due to hypercarbia w/ pCO2 in the 70s.
His [**Last Name (un) **] was held because of persistently high levels.
GU: Given his respiratory failure and CHF, he was diuresed with lasix, with intermittent diamox to manage metabolic alkalosis.
He otherwise stabilized with no major issues.
He completed a 14 day course on [**2158-8-28**], and remained afebrile with a normal WBC count.
Wound:  His abdominal wound was managed with a VAC dressing, changed every 3 days.
The wound was clean and granulating well.
