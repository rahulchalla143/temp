Per OSH notes, the patient presented with moderate respiratory distress and complaining of chest pressure that woke her from sleep.
At [**Hospital1 18**], EKG showed NSR [**Company 64667**] wave inversions in I, II, L, throughout the precordial leads, Q III, LVH.
new T wave inversions, also consistent with HOCM.
Initially thought to be endocardial ischemia from hypertension, not acute coronary syndrome.

- CARDIAC # Ischemia: While being treated in the MICU for acute pulmonary edema, patient developed NSTEMI with peak CK 204 and Trop 0.17.
# HTN: Patient with severe HTN, admitted in hypertensive crisis.
Patient received a renal MRI/MRA to rule out stenosis, and this showed... .
# PUMP: [**Hospital1 **] showed EF 35-40% 3+ TR or 1+ MR, e/a 0.45 indicative of LV diastolic dysfunction.
# RHYTHM: While on the floor, patient developed Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter that then reverted to sinus rhythm under beta blocker.
Patient was discharged home on [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts for monitoring.
# RIGHT ATRIAL LESION (THROMBUS VS. VEGETATION): Seen on [**Doctor Last Name **] [**11-15**] and [**11-16**] with ?
Repeat [**Date Range **] was done on [**11-22**], and mass/vegetation was thought not to be endocarditis Patient had double-lumen PICC placed by Interventional Radiology and will continue Antibiotics at home for total 6 weeks.
# PFO: Small PFO seen on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**11-15**] and [**11-16**].
- RESPIRATORY # ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA: Patient admitted to the MICU in respiratory distress s/p intubation, thought to be secondary to acute pulmonary edema.
Diuresis improved pulmonary congestion on CXR and patient was subsequently extubated.
Initially, patient received empiric course of Vancomycin given leukocytosis and concern for underlying PNA, which was later discontinued given lack of clinical and radiologic suspicion.
Patient with wheezing on exam maintained on inhaled steroids.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient with leukocytosis to 22.5 at [**Hospital1 18**] after receiving stress-dose steroids at OSH.
Multiple possible etiologies including stress-response, steroids, ?
Leukocytosis resolved with extubation, NSTEMI intervention, and with Abx therapy.
Patient was afebrile throughout hospital course.
# ASYMMETRIC PUPILS: Head CT done for concerns of possible ICH, no mass effect or bleed seen.
Later learned that patient has history of cataract surgery.
# HYPERGLYCEMIA Patient hyperglycemic on presentation with glucose of 325, thought to be secondary to steroids administration.
Hyperglycemia covered with RISS, self-resolved.

PVD s/p Bifemoral bypass 2.
Breast CA s/p right mastectomy 3.
Fibromyalgia   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, feeling well, muscle pain under control.
On an MRI of the abdomen, it was found that you have 2 R renal arteries, which are both patent(open); however we could not assess adequately the Left renal artery because there was interference from the aortoiliac graft in your abdomen.
