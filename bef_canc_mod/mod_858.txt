He was in his USOH until Wednesday evening ([**10-26**]) at 7:15 when he had an acute onset of speech difficulty.
He was aware of his deficit and frustrated by his inability to communicate.
He denies associated numbness, weakness, dysarthria, visual deficits or swallowing problems.
[**Name (NI) **] did not have CP, palpitations, or dizziness prior to this episode.
He had a head CT there which showed 2.5 cm left temporal hemorrhage.
Then, around 3:00AM he had another episode of language problems which lasted for a minute or so, then spontaneously resolved.
He was started on nipride in the ER for BP control.
He developed a headache and chest pain (right sided, radiating to neck).
He has had similar episodes of language problems in the past.
The first episode was in [**2130**] when he had an episode of slurred speech and mild right facial droop.
He was found to have "aphasia" and mild right hemiparesis at that time.
He had a head CT which was negative and echo which showed PFO and atrial septal aneurysm.
HTN (historically difficult to control) 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Paroxysmal Afib 6.
He denies smoking, EtOH or drugs  Family History: Uncle:  Died of MI in 70's Father: Leukemia, MI at age 65 Uncle:  Died of MI in 40's  Physical Exam: T 97 ;  BP 220/98 (decreased to sbp 170s initially with nipride); HR 76; RR 18; O2 sat 96% RA gen - no acute distress.
no scleral icterus or injection.
no lad or carotid bruits appreciated.
Speech fluent without paraphasic errors or hesitancy.
No fasiculations.
No pronator drift.
He was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He had an MRI/MRA with gadolinium to evaluate the extent of the bleed and to assess for vascular malformation or underlying mass.
MRI of the brain demonstrates an acute left lateral temporal lobe hematoma with mild surrounding edema, as seen on the CT scan of earlier in the day.
There is no enhancement in this location.
There are numerous small foci of susceptibility artefact within the brain, likely representing hemorrhages from amyloid angiopathy or hypertension.
There is no abnormal vascularity detected on MR angiography and there is flow in the major branches of this circulation.
He remained neurologically intact and did not have another episode of aphasia during his admission.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Intracranial hemorrhage 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Improved-no neurologic deficit  Discharge Instructions: Please continue to take your medications as directed.
