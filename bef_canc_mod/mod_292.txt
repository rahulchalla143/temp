Admission Date:  [**2113-8-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-9-6**]   Service:  Cardiothoracic Service  IDENTIFICATION/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19388**] is an 80-year-old gentleman who has complained of shortness of breath and fatigue over the past four years; worsening over the past year.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old gentleman status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2097**] and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2109**] with complaints of shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue over the past four years which has worsened over the past year, prompting the patient to finally consent to surgery which he has been refusing for at least one year prior to this surgical date.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**7-11**] that showed left main disease with a patent right coronary artery stent a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex; both patent.
Severe mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 67%.
His echocardiogram done on [**7-6**] showed right ventricular enlargement with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Status post penile implant.
Status post bone marrow biopsy to diagnose pancytopenia in [**2113-7-13**].
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history revealed father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.
Mother died of breast cancer at 48.
In general, a pleasant male who appeared his stated age, in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
Chest with positive crackles at the right base.
A sternal incision was well-healed.
Heart was irregular, second heart sound and second heart sound, with a positive [**2-15**] murmur heard best at the apex.
Slightly distant heart sounds.
Normal active bowel sounds with a median abdominal incision that was well-healed.
Diffuse bilateral varicosities; right greater than left.
A nonfocal examination.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 100 with a central venous pressure of 13, a mean arterial pressure was 67.
During that time, he remained hemodynamically stable.
He did, however, have frequent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation; for which he was initially loaded with amiodarone and later switched to digoxin for rate control.
During the surgical repair of the patient's mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair, he received large amounts of fluid, and the first several days of the Intensive Care Unit were spent with the patient undergoing vigorous diuresis in an attempt to successfully extubate him.
He was noted to have a large right loculated pleural effusion.
On [**8-29**], he underwent a right videoscopic thoracoscopy for removal of his loculated right pleural effusion.
During this period of time, the patient was also restarted on his anticoagulation given his history of atrial fibrillation.
Cardiovascularly, he had a heart rate from 80 to 100, in atrial fibrillation.
Second heart sound and second heart sound with no murmurs.
The patient had a well-healed old sternal incision.
Respiratory revealed he had a #8 Portex tracheostomy.
He had scattered rhonchi throughout, and no rales.
He had an ileal loop that had a collection bag that was intact, draining yellow urine with some sediment in it.
He had a right thoracotomy with clean margins, a small amount of sanguinous drainage from the upper portion of that incision.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times two.
Atrial fibrillation.
Prostate cancer; status post radical prostatectomy and ileal conduit.
Status post tricuspid valve repair with a #32 annuloplasty ring.
Status post right videoscopic thoracoscopy on [**8-29**] for evacuation of a loculated pleural effusion.
Also, the patient was noted to have a positive screen during this admission, and he was treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum.
