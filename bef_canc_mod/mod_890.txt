Pt reports having chronic SOB associated with her aortic stenosis.
One day prior to arrival she noted increased SOB associated with chest heaviness in the middle of the chest.
Chest heaviness is worse with deep inspiration.
She reports that her SOB is similar to prior CHF/aortic stenosis episodes but her chest pain is new.
Also found to have positive UA and given ceftriaxone.
?C) (Rectal), Pulse: 71, RR: 28, O2Sat: 98, O2Flow: 3, Bedside u/s showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is comfortable, denies any chest pain or SOB, she says both have resolved.
Bedside TEE was performed and showed no acute dissection.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Positive: urinary frequency On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors (does report feeling cool).
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No tobacco, alcohol or drugs ever   Family History: father died of stroke, mother died of cerebral hemorrhage.
2 systolic murmurs, one murmur heard at right sternal border radiating to carotids late peaking, other murmur is holosystolic at left sternal border.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
few crackles in bases bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Anicteric sclera.
CARDIAC: Irregular, systolic ejection murmur best at RUSB, no extra heart sounds.
Minimal crackles at bases b/l.
ABDOMEN: BS+, distended, soft, non-tender EXTREMITIES: No Edema in the lower extremities.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aortic dissection.
Atheroma throughout aorta with small, calcified atheroma just above the aortic sinus, complex atheroma in the arch and descending aorta.
Likely moderate to severe aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation .
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, but no acute intrathoracic process.
[**2156-8-18**] bilateral LE U/S: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
[**2156-8-19**] hip xray: FRONTAL VIEW OF THE PELVIS AND CONED-DOWN VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HIP:   The patient has a gamma nail construct with proximal nail, intramedullary rod and interlocking screw transfixing an intertrochanteric fracture which appears in unchanged alignment with no evidence of hardware-related complications.
A coil is noted over the left hip and along the left lower abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Open reduction internal fixation of right intertrochanteric femur fracture without evidence of hardware-related complications and with fracture line less prominent compared to the most recent prior examination.
Unchanged left chronic retroperitoneal hematoma (but decreased from first sighting in [**Month (only) 956**] of [**2155**]).
This lesion contains some "entrapped" fat lobules and should be followed to resolution to exclude an underlying lesion.
Appearance of right femoral fracture and hardware.
Increased stranding and skin thickening with 2.7cm rounded hematoma in left lower anterior abdominal/pelvic wall could relate to recent injections and trauma to this site.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] (goes by [**Doctor Last Name 8214**]) is a 66yoF with h/o severe aortic stenosis (s/p valvuloplasty [**2156-8-5**]), diastolic congestive heart failure  (EF 70%), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (not on Coumadin), diabetes mellitus type 2, and End stage liver and renal disease s/p liver/kidney transplant [**7-/2154**], who presented with 2 days shortness of breath and pleuritic chest heaviness.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed no dissection.
## acute diastolic CHF exacerbation - Patient complained of dyspnea on exertion.
Likely acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (dCHF) exacerbation with volume overload in the setting of severe Aortic Stenosis.
Per OSH, pt's CXR showed pulmonary edema and she was given lasix 40mg IV with good urine output.
CXR here showed mild pulmonary congestion.
She remained euvolemic and was discharged at a weight of 86.4kg.
## Chest Pain with Troponin Elevation - likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of dCHF and left ventricular hypertrophy/aortic stenosis.
Because of mild persistant chest heaviness, and known 90% stenosis per above, we trialed her on imdur 30mg daily which improved her symptoms.
This decrease in preload may facilitate control of pulmonary edema as well.
## Urinary frequency and UA suggestive of UTI -  h/o multi drug including ESBL resistant E. coli and VRE UTI in the past.
## h/o Renal/Liver Transplant - tacro was low, so we increased tacrolimus to 1mg [**Hospital1 **], and resultant troughs were within goal range.
Held Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], given recent h/o c diff.
##  Recent C DIFF infection: patient developed watery loose stools on recent admission, C Diff PCR positive.
However, on this admission had episodes of diarrhea with increased frequency, so we started on PO vancomycin for 10 days, completed on [**2156-8-31**], with improvement in her symptoms.
## Constipation - resolved with lactulose 15mL in AM, senna, colace, miralax.

Albuterol-Ipratropium 2 PUFF IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath or wheezing 3.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO HS:PRN anxiety, insomnia hold for sedation or RR < 12 MAX 1mg/ day 32.

You came in for worsening shortness of breath and chest pain.
This was found to be from volume overload, and we gave you water pills to get rid of the extra fluid.
The psychiatry team recommended inpatient psychiatric admission for ECT, a treatment for depression that you have had in the past.
