CT chest was done which revealed a multifocal pneumonia.
She was then treated with a 7-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for ventilator associated pneumonia.
#AMS: Pt has had fluctuating MS suggestive of delerium or over-sedation.
She has been noted to have poor motor effort and persistant myoclonic jerks.
Over the course of her hospitalization she required intubation for airway protection given her poor mental status.
After she was extubated for the second time her mental status cleared back to baseline and she was A+Ox3 with a nonfocal neurological exam.
Neurology was following early in her stay and felt that a large amount of her altered mental status was due to narcotic overuse.
Her mental status improved with less narcotiics and avoidance of deliogenic medications.
#A fib w/ RVR: Pt developed atrial fibrillation with RVR upon admission and was rate controlled without anticoagulation initially due to her thrombocytopenia.
#Acute liver failure: Pt presented with extremely elevated LFTs and was screened for acute viral infections including hepatitis, EBV and CMV, all of which were negative in terms of acute exposure/infection.
Pt was on fluconazole, but this would not be expected to cause a transaminitis this severe.
After an extensive workup with the liver team to exclude drug toxicity vs autoimmune vs infectious hepatitis, a definitive etiology for acute liver failure could not be found.
#Acute anuric kidney failure requiring hemodialysis: Cr progressively worsened during hospital stay from 1.2 to 5.5 during her first 4-5 days in the ICU, and she eventually became anuric.
Nephrology was consulted and concluded that renal failure was likely multifactorial: prerenal/hypotension, hepatorenal, contrast induced, and possible DIC.
She remained dialysis dependent while in the MICU.
Hematology was consulted, and they believed that the pt had TTP vs DIC, with schistocytes on peripheral smear, thrombocytopenia, and elevated PT and PTT.
DIC was thought to be more likely, and no treatment was necessary, as pt did not have active bleeding.
Thrombocytopenia was most likely due to liver failure and possible DIC and resolved during her hospital course  #Pain: Pt has an extensive pain history and was on copious doses of narcotics preadmission including 120mg/day of morphine.
Pt's pain was initially controlled with fentanyl, which was thought to be the best choice in the setting of acute renal and liver failure.
She had problems with [**Name2 (NI) 97802**] on narcotics and therefore Pain serivce was consulted to find nonsedating medications to control her pain and she was started on gabapentin.
Her final pain regimen was gabapentin 200qHD, dilaudid 0.25 IV q4hPRN for breakthrough pain, and 1mg PO dilaudid q4hPRN.
#Hypertension: Pt has a history of hypertension and was on metoprolol, Lasix, and lisinopril at home.
Her lisinopril was discontinued due to the renal failure.
The patient was continued on metoprolol for HTN and rate control, and the diltiazem was added for rate control as described above.
Decreased HCT may have been due to hemolysis.
Pressors were given for a short duration.
There was no sign of wet gangrene or infection.
She will need follow up for this issue with vascular, however no acute management changes are needed.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 20893**],  You were treated at [**Hospital1 18**] for Pneumonia and found to have liver and kidney injury.
While you were here, you needed dialysis because your kidneys were not working.
You were also very confused and unable to protect your airway while you were here and required a breathing tube temporarily and are doing well after that was removed.
You also had significant pain and required pain medicine, however you frequently had changes in your mental status due to the use of these medications.
Your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] need to balance your pain medications with your sleepiness from those medications.
Your heart rate also became elevated and irregular while you were here, and you required three different medications to keep your heart rate low.
