He was initially admitted two weeks ago to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgical service when he presented with a headache, nasuea, and vomitting and was found to have a posterior fossa intracranial hemorrhage.
He was transfered from OSH where the inital thought was that there was a mass + hemorrhage.
He went to the OR for evacuation and exploration and no mass found, only bleed.
While at rehab, he had ongoing weakness, confusion, and poor appetite.
Neursurgery did nto feel there were any changes and recommended disposition back to rehab.
He further complianed of headache, also developed a fever to 101 and had some neck stiffness.
His wound was evalulated by neurosurgery who felt it was well healing, without evidnece for superficial infection.
Family states patient has been more confused over the last week with word finding difficulties and increased disorientation.
Today patient appeared increasingly lethargic and weak.
Past Medical History: Intracranial Hemorrhage Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin until recent hemorrhage Hypertension AAA s/p emergent endovascular repair in [**7-/2187**] after presenting with back pain and hypertension Peripheral Vascualr Disease s/p LLE bypass Symptomatic Bradycardia s/p PPM   Social History: Social History: Married, lives with wife (admitted from rehab however).
Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: On Presentation:  VS: Af 125/81 78 15 100% on RA GEN: NAD, pleasant, elderly male laying in bed HEENT: PERRLA, dry mmm, no OP lesions, no scleral icterus CV: Regular rate, no mrg PULM: CTAB ABD: + BS, soft, NTND EXT: No edema 2+ DP pulses, skin with hyperpigmented patches NEURO: Oriented to person, year and type of place (hospital though unable to name which one).
Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage or mass.
Residual foci of high density within the right cerebellar surgical bed are decreased in comparison to [**2188-1-26**].
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.
No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
IMPRESSION: [**Month/Day/Year **] cardiomediastinal configuration with indwelling stable pacemaker and no acute pulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M with ICH, afib, PPM, PVD, ruptured AAA, who presented with altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] urgency.
# Delirium/Moderate Cognitive Impairment/Likely Traumatic Brain Injury: Pt delirium rapidly cleared with no intervention, but pt does have a new moderate cognitive impairment.
Per family, patient was not mentating at baseline, has long term and short term memory deficits and some word finding difficulties.
Patient has posterior fossa intracranial hemorrhage several weeks ago and is s/p posterior crainitomy for evacuation of bleed.
Neurosurgery saw in ED and felt that scan was unchanged and there was no evidence of new bleed.
Patient was also febrile in ED to 101.1 though was afebrile on arrival to ICU.
Initial concern was for meningitis, but LP was not performed as pts mental status quickly improved, he had no further fevers other than isolated fever in the ED, no leukocytosis, and bacterial meningitis unlikely in the setting of 1 week of mental status changes.
He had no abdominal symptoms or diarrhea to suggest colitis.TSH/B12folate levels were normal.
It is possibly pts delirium was due to labile hypertension/[**Month/Year (2) **] urgency, but his BP here on his home regimen was in the 110s-140s.
Pt was seen by OT here, noted to have [**1-14**] short term recall, could not appropriately draw a clock, and could not say months of year backwards.
OT felt these findings were more consistent with TBI rather than dementia or delirium.
# Headache: Likely [**2-11**] to surgery +/- TBI, pain has improved to [**2-19**].
Neurosurgery saw no intervention necessary.
Controlled pain with tylenol.
# S/P Posterior Crainiotomy/ICH: Patient underwent craniectomy for evacuation of cerebellar hemorrhage by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] on [**1-25**].
Was evaluated by neurosurg and found to be stable from neurologic perspective.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt at baseline in 90s-low 100s.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Rate controlled on beta-blocker.
No anti-coagulation or ASA given ICH - was stopped at last admission.
Felt to be volume depletion vs. SIADH.
Do not think this is cerebral salt wasting given pt is not hypotensive or dry in appearance.
Lasix was stopped and can be resumed in the future if he has any evidence of volume overload.
# Communication: With patient, wife [**Name (NI) 22362**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79160**], [**Name2 (NI) **]ter [**Name (NI) 3692**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79161**]     Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 325-650mg q6 prn Docusate Sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] Allopurinol 200 qd Atorvastatin 10 mg qd Doxazosin 4 mg qhs Furosemide 20 mg qd Isosorbide Mononitrate 30 mg SR qd Sertraline 50 mg qd Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] Bisacodyl 10 mg Tablet qd Atenolol 25 mg Tablet qd Hydralazine 10 mg q6h Famotidine 20 mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Rehab Hospital Of [**Doctor Last Name **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Delirium [**Doctor Last Name **] urgency Hyponatremia Thrombocytopenia Moderate cognitive impairment   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion and hypertension.
Your blood pressure was treated with medications, and has remained normal since you have been on your home blood pressure regimen.
You had an isolated fever on admission, but you had no evidence of urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or other infection.
Your famotidine was changed to protonix in the case that famotidine has been causing your platelet level to be low.
You were seen by occupational therapy an diagnosed with moderate cognitive deficit.
This is likely due to traumatic brain injury after your fall.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any worsening confusion, dehydration, fever, new weakness/numbess of any arms/legs, slurred speech, worsening headache, visual changes, or any other concerning symptoms.
