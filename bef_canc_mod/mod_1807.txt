Admission Date:  [**2114-4-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2086-4-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-10-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year-old female with a history of inflammatory breast cancer, morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and anemia who felt short of breath on the morning of [**2114-4-10**].
She reports low grade fevers with chills and sweats with reported temperature to 100.1 with increased fatigue.
She denies chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
She denies urinary tract infection like symptoms.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Morbid obesity.
Congestive heart failure systolic and diastolic dysfunction with an EF of approximately 30 to 35%.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile on Intensive Care Unit evaluation.
She was described as mild tachypneic with some accessory muscle use.
She had coarse breath sounds anteriorly with moderate air flow throughout.
No audible murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had 1 to 2+ edema peripherally and evidence of chronic venostasis.
She had a chest x-ray, which showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity.
She had an electrocardiogram that was alternating between normal sinus rhythm and ventricular bigeminy.
No acute changes or ischemia were noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 57 year-old female Jehovah's witness with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea requiring BiPAP at night, congestive heart failure, hypertension, anemia and inflammatory breast cancer who was originally admitted [**4-10**] from her nursing home for hypoxia and hypotension and treated in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was initially treated with Levofloxacin for pneumonia, BiPAP and noninvasive pressure ventilation for hypoxia without intubation.
She was subsequently transferred to the floor to continue treatment for pneumonia and hypoxia.
Repeat chest x-ray showed worsening shortness of breath.
She was treated with Lasix for diuresis and moderate improvement of respiratory status.
On representation to the Intensive Care Unit [**2114-4-15**] the patient spiked a fever to 104, developed significant respiratory distress and was then emergently intubated semiemergently admitted and initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for her continued respiratory distress.
Respiratory failure:  The patient is currently being treated for multifactorial respiratory failure in the setting of congestive heart failure, marked obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea who was semiemergently intubated [**3-/2039**] for progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure and a newly developing sepsis.
However, she remained difficult intubation and exacerbated primarily by her recurrent congestive heart failure and over 30 liters positive, fluid balance since her admission.
The goal would be to continue diuresis gently approximately 500 cc to negative one liter per day in order to avoid intravascular of the patient and acute renal failure.
She completed a course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and subsequent treatment for urinary tract infection as well.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient has known congestive heart failure with an EF of approximately 30 to 35% with no systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
She was approximately 30 liters positive for fluid following treatment for MRSA sepsis and remains volume overloaded at this time.
She was initially started on a Lasix drip and subsequently developed acute renal failure and that was discontinued and the patient was started on Nesiritide with minimal effect on diuresis.
Ultimately Nesiritide was discontinued minimizing her fluid intake and she responded to Lasix intravenously prn as needed for goal as stated above.
She was seen on the CH Service by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] and upon resolution of her hypotension the patient was started on low dose beta blocker and treatment of her congestive heart failure.
She ultimately had a positive right IJ culture tip for MRSA and positive blood cultures from the [**2-12**] for MRSA bacteremia 4 out of 4 bottles.
She was given intravenous fluids, starting on intravenous Hydrocortisone 50 gallop or murmur intravenously q.i.d.
and required Dopamine for blood pressure support.
Urinary tract infection:  The patient had a urinary tract infection from the 28th that was positive for E-coli that was sensitive to Ceftazidine.
Hypotension:  The patient had known hypotension in relation to her sepsis, however, her hospital course was complicated by persistent hypotension following resolution of her sepsis.
Empirically while the patient did not demonstrate evidence of adrenal insufficiency removal of intravenous steroids complicated the patient's picture and she subsequently became hypotensive.
With subsequent discontinuation of the Natrecor and continuing of the intravenous Hydrocortisone the patient was effectively diuresed and continued to be diuresed at the time of this dictation without significant hypotension.
Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of .5 to .7 and subsequently developed acute renal failure with a creatinine rising to 2.1 with diuresis presumed to be prerenal.
Goal was to continue diuresis gently in order to avoid acute renal failure.
Right IJ thrombus:  The patient has a known right IJ thrombus as a presumed complication from right IJ line placement in the setting of sepsis.
The patient was not anticoagulated given her Jehovah's witness status and will be continued to follow serially with ultrasounds.
She has a recent history of inflammatory breast cancer and had been receiving weekly Navelbine and Herceptin.
The plan was to try to reduce the size of her left breast mass so she could become a candidate for a mastectomy.
She is unable to be staged appropriately because of her weight.
However, recent CTPA did not show any obvious metastatic disease.
There was some concern that her preexisting lower extremity edema prior to this admission was secondary to a carcinous meningitis, however, that seems to be unfounded and neurology was unable to obtain LP for diagnostic purposes.
Anemia:  The patient is a known Jehovah's witness and would significantly benefit from blood transfusions.
Vaginal spotting:  During her hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit the patient had repeated vaginal spotting with an associated drop in her hematocrit.
Gynecology was consulted and it was thought that this bleeding was unrelated to her anemia.
She does have multiple risk factors for endometrial cancer and the goal would be to image her with a transvaginal ultrasound to sample her endometrium again, however, at this point in time any additional studies were deferred and she is to be contact[**Name (NI) **] for follow up in the [**Hospital 111518**] Clinic as her condition improves and she becomes an outpatient.
Rectal fistula:  The patient had a noticeable perirectal fistula on examination with concern that this may have been contributing to her fever and sepsis.
Surgery was consulted and determined this unlikely as the nidus of infection based on clinical examination findings.
No perirectal cellulitis and no obvious abscess formation.
Perirectal swab was polymicrobial in nature including MRSA, however, it was thought that this was unlikely to be the source of the patient's MRSA bacteremia though should be considered if the patient has recurrent event without additional line placement.
She unfortunately was not a candidate for PEG or open G tube placement given her [**Doctor Last Name **] habitus and potential surgical risks.
Code status:  The patient is a Jehovah's witness and remains full code at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:  The patient's disposition is pending based upon improvement in her respiratory status with a goal for subsequent transfer to a nursing facility for continued trach care and pulmonary rehabilitation.
