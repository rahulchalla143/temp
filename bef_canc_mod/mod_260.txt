Admission Date:  [**2159-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-8-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 105**] for acute on chronic respiratory distress.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture on [**8-22**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] is a 73 yo male with a complicated past medical history, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-8**] following a prolonged admission for STEMI, respiratory failure felt secondary to pulmonary edema requiring intubation and subsequent tracheostomy [**2-28**] failure to wean, sepsis and C.difficile colitis treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl with a course of Levophed.
At OSH, sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and MRSA, and he was restarted on Zosyn ([**8-14**]) and Vancomycin ([**8-15**]).
He then became dusky and cyanotic, and stopped breathing on his own.
EKG without acute changes.
Stool sent for C.diff and given Flagyl 500 mg PO X 1 dose.
Non-small cell lung cancer s/p XRT and chemotherapy in [**Country 532**], s/p right pneumonectomy in [**9-/2158**] for recurrence.
Chronic left pleural effusion.
SSS status post PM/ICD placement 3.
COPD/bronchiectasis 4.
Hypertension 5.
CHF with EF 25% on last echo on [**2159-7-25**] 7.
Depression 9.
Left femoral AV fistula [**2159-4-25**] 10.
Recent MRSA pneumonia and sepsis [**7-/2159**], treated with Vancomycin 11.
Sclera anicteric.
Ronchorous breath sounds left chest.
No murmur appreciated.
No grimacing with palpation.
Cool extremities.
Old TWI V4-6.
Long QT interval (QTc 462 ms).
ST depressions V4, 5.
Mild ST elevation in V3.
Old TWI V4-6.
New lower left lateral CW opacity, likely loculated pleural fluid.
[**2159-7-25**] ECHO: Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum.
Resting WMA include mid to distal septal akinesis, apical akinesis, inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
No definite apical thrombus seen (cannot exclude).
[**2159-8-22**] CT head: New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm in left basal ganglia, which partially extends to the left thalamus, probably representing subacute infarction.
[**2159-8-22**] CTA chest: No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
Findings consistent with failure or fluid overload.
Development of small loculated pleural fluid collection along the periphery of the left major fissure or so-called pseudotumor, consistent with the recent chest x-ray.
Overall LVEF is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction abnormality (suspect significant improvement compared to prior study dated [**2159-7-24**]).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade  [**2159-8-23**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing.
The first abnormality raises the possibility of material (such as subdural fluid) interposed between the brain and recording electrodes or widespread cortical dysfunction on that side.
There was also evidence of subcortical dysfunction on the right side.
No epileptiform features were seen.

However, the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status.
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct, likely cardioembolic.
However, they felt this event could not account for his new, severe global deficit; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process, likely anoxic encephalopathy, for which the prognosis is extremely grim.
