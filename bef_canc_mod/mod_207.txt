Pt reports that [**2-18**] x over the past couple of wks he has awoken from sleep w/anginal pain which he describes as starting w/upper jaw and teeth tingling sometimes radiating to throat and shoulders/arms BL.
He called the ambulance and was brought to OSH where his pain was [**9-26**].
He notes that at baseline he is able to climb a flight of stairs w/o CP or SOB.
If he climbs 2 flights(which he has at home) he does get some SOB, but does not have anginal pain.
He has only had his anginal pain while asleep.
EKG showed 0.5mm ST depressions V2-V6, troponins came back at his baseline.
Pt has been chest pain free since arrival.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is as in HPI syncope or presyncope.

Allergies: Plavix--rash Simvastatin--myalgia Tape--rash HCTZ--unkown reaction  Social History:  Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use; quit 25 years ago.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother had CVA at 46.
Sister with scleroderma and another sister with [**Name (NI) 18109**].
Sclera anicteric.
No xanthalesma.
+ systolic murmur, no r/g.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Clear BL no RRW Abd: Soft, NT, mildly distended.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The LAD had diffuse 50-60% disease in stent and within gap  between stents.
D1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin before the stent (unchanged from prior cath).
The LCx was a small vessel with mild diffuse disease.
The RCA had a severe proximal and mid in-stent restenosis with focal 70% proximal and diffuse 80% mid with possible filling defects.
There was a 70% distal RCA de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] stenosis and 90% mid PDA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic systolic hypertension with SBP of 163 mmHg and DBP of 88 mmHg.
Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
There is noted hypokinesis of the inferior, inferior-lateral, anterior and anterior-septal walls for the mid to apical segments; thereafter, the walls appear akinetic.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**2154-12-26**] CXR FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study dated [**2154-12-25**].
There is status post sternotomy and multiple external wires are overlying the thorax on the frontal view.
No pneumothorax has developed during the latest examination interval, nor is there any pulmonary vascular congestion.
The previously described left lower lobe atelectasis obscuring partially the diaphragmatic contour and that of the descending thoracic aorta persists.
There appears to be a somewhat improved inspiration with lower positioned diaphragms in comparison with the previous study.
No new parenchymal infiltrates have developed.
No pneumothorax identified.
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement of postoperative atelectasis and pleural effusion on the left base.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-12-18**] for further management of his chest pain.
He was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab and underwent a catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The renal service was consulted to assist in his care given his history of end stage renal failure and a left renal transplant.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
HE developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with an increase in his beta blockade and amiodarone.
Pt also developed Oglivies syndrome.
