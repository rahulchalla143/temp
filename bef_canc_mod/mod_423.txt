History of Present Illness: 67yoM with hx of HCC s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] in [**2174**] now relisted, s/p ichemic cholangiopathy with bilateral biliary stent placements, and recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for similiar symptoms, re-presents today with persistent chest pain.
During his prior admission, dates ([**2178-8-23**]) through ([**2178-8-25**]), the patients chest was worked up and was ruled out for MI, PE and Aortic Disection.
During the admission the patient had his left percutaneous biliary catheter exchanged, treated for suspected cholangitis with Cipro/Flagyl however his chest pain persisted.
An echo during the admission saw a small pericardial effusion, which was not there during a TTE in ([**5-24**]).
The patient was given PO tylenol that decreased the severity of the pain, however the pain was still persistenting on his discharge.
The pain is constant and severe, limiting him from falling asleep.
No alleviating symptoms.
The patient was recently discontinued off his Naloxone, which he was taking for persistent pruritis.
ROS is negative for fevers, chills, sweats, visual changes, loss of consciousness.
One episode of "spitting up", no coffee ground emesis.
No weightloss.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-8-25**] diffuse ST segment elevations have improved.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2178-8-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-8-25**], the pericardial effusion is larger and increased pericardial pressure is now suggested.
Large regional/geographic hypoechoic area involving the central portion of the liver, not in a vascular distribution.
Findings are nonspecific, however, concerning for possible ischemia or cholangitis.
Bilateral pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2178-8-31**] IMPRESSION: Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.
No acute cardiopulmonary process or displaced rib fractures.
Pericardial tamponade with improvement in hemodynamics after removal of 610 cc of bloody fluid.
Moderate systemic arterial hypertension, post pericardiocentesis.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2178-9-2**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Bilateral large pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
Non-obstructive left renal calculus.
Focal hyperemia in the left hepatic lobe as described above; this could represent early inflammatory hyperemia or focal pericholangitis or reactive changes secondary to trauma from recent percutaneous catheter exchange.
No microabscesses, focal hepatic lesions, or masses were identified.
There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, unchanged.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2178-9-4**] IMPRESSION: 1) Slight decrease in pericardial effusion.
2) Slight increase in right pleural effusion but unchanged small left pleural effusion.

The drain was removed [**2178-9-2**] and repeat TTE showed only a trivial effusion.
This was unlikely to represent TB with [**Doctor First Name **] minimally elevated and PPD negative.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The patient was initially treated with NSAIDs, which were discontinued due to chronic renal failure, and he was subsequently treated with a prednisone burst with good effect.
Hyperechoic liver lesion: There was a hyperechoic liver lesion noted on ultrasound as above.
CT abdomen was performed for further evaluation, and the lesion was most likely an area of hyperemia or inflammation, and was not thought to represent a recurrence of hepatoma.
Atrial flutter/fibrillation: The patient had atrial flutter with variable block during the time of transfer to the CCU with tamponade.
He reverted back to sinus rhythm, but then returned to atrial flutter during admission.
It is unlikely that this represented cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative at the time, however, he has numerous risk factors and should be considered for outpatient cardiac stress test for further evaluation.
Anticoagulation was not addressed during admission due to pericarditis and risk of hemorrhagic effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions: He was noted to have small bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray.
The patient denied shortness of breath or other symptoms.
The patient is hypervolemic and his hyponatremia is likely from cirrhosis.
Status post liver [**Last Name (STitle) **]: He is now relisted due to donor-graft-associated cholangiography.
His valsartan and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide were held for acute renal failure as above.
Type 2 diabetes: No active issues.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 5 days.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Tamponade - Pericarditis - Hypoechoic liver lesion - Atrial flutter - Acute on chronic renal failure .
Secondary: - Status post liver [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-/2174**] - Cirrohosis due to NASH - History of HCC - Diffuse biliary strictures due to ichemic cholangiopathy with subsequent bilateral percutaneous biliary drains, with multiple exchanges since placement - Type 2 diabetes - Hypertension - Parathyroid adenoma status post parathyroidectomy [**8-/2175**] - Chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine 1.3-1.4   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Your pain improved after drainage of the fluid and treatment with steroids and oxycodone.
We remain unsure as to the cause of your symptoms, but it likely represented an infection, with some studies pending.
You had an abdominal CT that showed this area was unlikely to be a cancer and was more likely an area of inflammation.
While in the hospital, you developed an irregular heart rhythm called atrial flutter or fibrillation.
You should discuss future use of coumadin, a blood thinner, and your personal risk of stroke with your primary care physician and cardiologist.
You had a bump in your kidney tests on admission.
Please contact a physician or report to an emergency department if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms.
