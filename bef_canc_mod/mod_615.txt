HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, spontaneous aortobifemoral on [**2169-8-2**] who had a relatively uneventful course during his prior admission and was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2169-8-8**].
He noted nausea and vomiting ............. eating at rehabilitation that had been worsening over the past two days and unable to keep anything down.
He had normal bowel movements and was passing gas with no signs of obstruction.
Coronary artery disease 2.
Myocardial infarction x3.
Last echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 75%, carotid stenosis right side 40%, left side 69% 3.
Type II diabetes 4.
History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 7.
Right kidney atrophy with baseline creatinine ranging from 1.8 to 2.0, though has been as low as 1.5 as well.
Vocal cord polypectomy in [**2167**].
ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.
ABDOMEN:  Minimal right upper quadrant tenderness without a physical exam [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, some slight left greater than right edema for which he had an ultrasound which showed no deep venous thromboses.
RADIOLOGY:  KUB showed mildly dilated small bowel with good air and contrast without evidence of obstruction, no free air.
Post fluid CT at the outside hospital showed stranding around the gallbladder, mild dilated loops, scanned fluid around the previously right aortic limb and of the aortobifemoral.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The picture was that the patient was likely to have cholecystitis and we were consulted.
Our evaluation was that the patient did indeed have cholecystitis and he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2169-8-14**].
The patient had an attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy which had to be converted to open and postoperatively the patient had a nasogastric tube and a Foley and was receiving perioperative antibiotics which had also been started preoperatively on admission.
The patient was kept in the PACU and had to be extubated by anesthesia after he had desaturations.
He had his epidural line fixed.
The determination was made that the patient could later be extubated and ............. was transferred to the floor in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit setting for additional monitoring.
After his diet was advanced and he was tolerating po's, he was switched over to po pain medication without difficulty and his pain was well controlled.
He had never had signs of a stroke.
Respiratory:  Patient outlined as above wound up being intubated in the Recovery Room for an overnight stay and was then transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit past being extubated.
The rest of the stay was significant for aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet along with nebulizers and supplemental oxygen which he had preoperatively.
Abdomen:  The patient's old aortic bifemoral wound has had staples discontinued as did the groin wound from his previous aortobifemoral.
The wound was carefully monitored and with Kefzol the patient's wound improved.
Otherwise, there are no acute issues.
His abdominal pain from the cholecystitis was resolved.
Renal:  Patient has elevated creatinine which is consistent with his chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient had some swelling for which he was given Lasix twice during the course of his admission and his electrolytes were appropriately repleted.
The patient is not in congestive heart failure upon discharge.
Infectious disease:  The patient will receive seven days of Keflex as an outpatient, has received Kefzol in house after signs of the wound having a slight amount of erythema and cellulitis.
Heme:  The patient's heme as stated was stable and the patient received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis including Venodynes and subcutaneous heparin.
He had a vascular duplex prior to discharge, on the day of discharge on [**2169-8-18**], which was again negative for deep venous thrombosis.
