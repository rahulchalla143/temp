On review of systems he also notes increased cough and phlegm production for the past week with brown/yellow sputum.
He relates chronic [**3-6**] pillow orthopnea and PND, unchanged from prior.
Denies new chest pain, but does relate some mild nausea.
He notes that he has been on steroids for ~year, and was tapered off last week from 5mg.

2) Diffuse lung changes consistent with emphysema and congestive heart failure.
3) Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis, and a component of consolidation, aspiration, or pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
5) Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, of uncertain significance.
There is no good contrast enhancement of the abdomen and pelvis, which were done as an addition after PE study, and if clinically warranted, further evaluation can be done by multiphasic CT  Cardiac Cath: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed no evidence of flow-limiting coronary disease.
The LAD had mild luminal irregularities.
The LCX had mild luminal irregularities.
Hemodynamic evaluation on entry revealed mildly elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 10 and RVEDP was 14 mmHg), mildly elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 17 mmHg and LVEDP was 19 mmHg), and severely elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 70/29/49 mmHg).
There was a 5 mmHg gradient across the aortic valve on pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of 100% inhaled oxygen revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 71/30/50 mmHg.
Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of inhaled nitric oxide revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 65/29/42 mmHg.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2105-4-24**], there has been no significant change.
CHF with bilateral atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild emphysema.
Multiple focal calcified granulomas within both lungs.
Appearances are most consistent with chronic changes due to prior histoplasmosis or varicella pneumonia.
We cannot define or clearly evaluate for diffuse lung disease in the presence of these acute abnormalities.
PMIBI: Partially reversible, moderate defect in tracer uptake involving the apex, inferior wall and inferiolateral wall.
Etiology is likely multifactorial in origin from pulmonary HTN, possible DIP, and noncardiogenic edema.
He had several episodes of desaturations into the 60s on floor improved with ativan, morphine, and lasix.
CT chest showed pulmonary edema and effusions, LENIS negative for DVT, and TTE with bubble negative for shunt.
PPD negative.
CARDIAC - On admit, patient noted increased NTG use for atypical chest pressure.
He ruled out for MI by enzymes with unchanged EKG.
Obtained stress MIBI which showed moderate reversible inferior defect.
Cath without sig CAD [**5-5**], no interventions performed.
Possible diastolic CHF - Increased pulmonary edema by CXR and CT scan.
Repeat TTE in house w/ preserved systolic function, but increased pulm HTN.
Cath [**5-6**] without evidence of diastolic or systolic failure.
Cardiolgy was consulted and after review of cath and TTE, thought that there was no evidence for heart failure.
Decreased Lasix from 160 po QD to 80 po QD secondary to his ARF.
He had oozing from his Hickman site with multiple pressure dressings applied.
On discharge, he had clot formation with minimal bleeding.
Surgery evaluated on day of discharge and felt no further sutures were needed.
DM - Glucophage was d/c'd secondary to renal insufficiency.
HTN - Continue Cartia XT and Toprol.
ANEMIA - Patient was guiac negative.
No Retroperitoneal bleed on CT scan.
Abdominal pain - Patient had several days of abdominal pain.
GI - Four months of anorexia and early satiety.
Rash - Chest rash secondary to flolan.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Diagnosis: Dyspnea CAD Diastolic CHF Elevated Cholesterol Diabetes Mellitus Pulmonary Hypertension Hypertension Pulmonary Fibrosis   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please take your medications as prescribed.
Please continue daily weights, as well as a low-sodium diet.
If you develop any further episodes of chest/pressure, worsening shortness or breath, increasing cough, or have any other concerning symptoms whatsoever please seek immediate medical attention.
