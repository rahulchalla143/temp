There was no appreciable flow along this anatomic pathway, though this is likely just higher resistance than the bypass.

Patient may continue to have some leaking into the bandage.
Diffuse pneumobilia, unchanged from prior.
No significant biliary ductal dilatation.
No definite fluid collection within the region of the porta hepatis.

Partial wedge hepatectomy.
This procedure went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
On POD#1, the patient was successfully extubated, and placed on a ketamine drip for pain control.
Later that day, the ketamine drip was discontinued, and an epidural was placed for pain control.
She remained NPO, with JP, PTBD, NGT and foley in place, as well as the epidural continued for pain control.
On this day, due to some concern about erythema around her incision, she was stared on IV cefazolin.
Her epidural was removed, and she was transitioned to a PCA for pain control, which she tolerated well.
A second fever on POD#10 prompted ultrasounds of the LEs and RUQ, both of which were unconcerning as well.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
