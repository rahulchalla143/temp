On [**2103-7-23**] Neurology was consulted due to increased somnolence and tachypneia.
Despite Bipap, patient's VBGs/ABGs fluctuated and patient remained tachypneic 30-36 breaths/min with shallow breaths and inability to complete sentences from being so out of breath.
Patient reports that he has always had generalized weakness with his myasthenia; however, notes that this admission his breathing has been bothering him the most.
He has difficulty having sustained conversdations since he feels constantly out of breath.
However, he denied pain on inspiration.
He also notes double vision worse with looking at near objects than looking at far objects.
Denies difficulty swallowing, regurgitating as long as he takes small quanities or eyelid weakness.
MICU c/b UTI Klebsiella tx'd 7D Ceftriaxone.
Plasmapheresis D4/5 for myasthenic crisis.
Of note, patient has history of vascular disease and in fact had MI when received IVIg last in [**7-4**].
Patient had baseline 1st degree heart block and developed 2 episodes of Wenckebach, HD stable and asx one resolved spontaneously other after fluid bolus.

S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No dysarthria.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.

Extraocular muscles are full without nystagmus and diplopia only on sustained sustained lateral gaze R>L.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
+Dysdiadochokinesia L>R.
No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML  Radiologic data: CXR 1.
Small peripheral wedge-shaped opacity.
Differential diagnostic considerations include focus of early pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, or atelectasis.
No pneumonia is seen  Spirometry [**7-5**]- Impression: Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Sinus tachycardia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2103-9-27**] no diagnostic interim change.
No definite evidence for aspiration.
No new infiltrates in comparison to the prior study.
Mixed progression/regression of multiple tiny pulmonary nodules as described above.
No change in size of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Small well defined ovoid fluid density medial to the lower pole of the right kidney of unclear significance.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old right handed man with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] status post upper endoscopy and balloon dilation of the pylorus complicated by a increased difficulty breathing and extremity weakness consistent with a myasthenic crisis post procedure.
Myasthenic crisis is usually precipitated by a variety of factors including infection, surgery, or tapering of immunosuppression.
Although his past medical records state that the etiology of his difficulty breathing is multifactorial, upon inital evaluation by neurology, he had fatiguable weakness of the deltoid which was new.
CV: History of type 1 heart block.
Patient had 2 episodes of Wenkebach which were asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
Patient had NSTEMI likely secondary to increased myocardial demand with subsequent preserved ejection fraction.
However, on discussion with the plasmapheresis team, it may have been secondary to plasmapheresis technique.
However, heparin was subsequently listed as an allergy to avoid recurrence of thrombocytopenia and risk of bleeding.
Since patient has not fully recovered, it was discussed with patient and his wife that there would be an increased risk of precipitating another myasthenic crisis with surgery so soon after this past one.
Afebrile and asymptomatic.
FEN: He developed a respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
Left internal jugular plasmapheresis line discontinued.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) Neb Solution Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 7.75 % Suspension Sig: 15-30 ml PO every six (6) hours as needed for constipation.

Secondary diagnosis: myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] bilateral diaphragmatic impairment coronary artery disease history of esophageal cancer and TIA cervical spondylosis history of TB    Discharge Condition: neurologically stable.
If you have any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain, epigastric pain, fever, excessive nausea and vomitting, or diarrhea, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency room.
