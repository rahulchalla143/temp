Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with multiple medical problems including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, previous AF with [**Age over 90 5509**], s/p mechanical AVR, s/p listeria endocarditis, CAD, dCHF and CKD who presented for low BP and subsequently developed AF with [**Age over 90 5509**].
His CXR suggested vascular congestion but this could have been caused by the AF.
ACS is unlikely as he has no CP or EKG changes consistent with ischemia and his trop 0.02 in the setting of Cr of 1.4.
Infection is unlikely as he is afebrile, has normal WBC and no suggestive signs/symptoms.
He was ruled out for MI and was monitored for signs of infection.
Hypotension:  The patient presented with SBP 80's that increased to the 130's transiently in the ED without intervention and decreased after he went into AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**].
In the MICU his SBP was in the 100's, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of a low EF and insufficient LV filling time due to rapid HR.
CHF: He has an EF 45% and his CXR shows signs of mild fluid overload, likely due to his AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**].
Diuresis was deferred for now given his low BP, and carvedilol was held while controlling his AF with metoprolol.
