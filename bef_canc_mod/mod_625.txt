He showered Saturday night and then complained of sudden onset neck pain and flashing lights.
He vomited once then was fine, with his vision clearing.
He had had no recent trauma.
He was easily arousable to voice but this evening, he had so much difficulty getting OOB that his wife became concerned (she had previously thought him to have a GI illness) and called EMS.
Per his wife, he had had no recent illnesses.
It bled in [**2154**], requiring EVD and ICU stay, leaving him with subtle language deficits and mild right hemiparesis (pt refused gamma knife and surgery was deferred due to the location) Seizure disorder, subsequent to his hemorrhage HTN (of note, had not been able to take his meds for 2 days)   Social History: Lives at home with his wife.

Two high-density foci superior to known region of AV malformation may be consistent with acute bleeding in this region.
MRI [**2156-5-21**]: Left-sided arteriovenous malformation in the left temporal lobe is again identified with an enlarged posterior cerebral artery.
A draining vein into the vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**] is noted  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 68 yo RHM h/o known L temporal AVM with subsequent sz disorder, h/o HTN, EtOH abuse who presents with three days of N/V and progressive decrease in level of responsiveness.
Neuro exam is significant at present for decreased level of arousal (that is worse than prior NSurg eval) with retained brainstem reflexes; focal findings include less vigorous withdrawal to noxious stimuli in the right arm/leg.
His exam is notable for right hemiparesis in the absence of signs of herniation; this suggests cause of decreased level of consciousness is bilateral pressure on the thalamus from the third ventricular bleed (and he does have small pupils with dysconjugate gaze).
Miotic pupils with wall-eyed dysconjugate gaze.
Neurology: Left temporal ateriovenous malformation bled with intraventricular spread bioccipitally with hydrocephalus.
Initially started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis however it was discontinued on [**5-21**] given fever, facial erythema and negative infectious workup.
MRA demonstrates the left-sided intraventricular arteriovenous malformation with an enlarged left posterior cerebral artery and venous drainage to the vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**].
Patient will follow-up in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic as an outpatient for possible Cyberknife therapy.
Was febrile [**5-19**] without obvious infection or growth on cultures.
Patient then remained afebrile until time of discharge.
Ruled out myocardial infarction x 3.
Monitored on telemetry without events.
Derm:  Seen by derm for exfoliative facial skin rash felt to be consistent with seborrheic dermatits.
[**5-25**] Liberalizing free water restriction given normal Na and elevated BUN/Cr.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Left temporal ateriovenous malformation bleed Status post external ventricular drain Status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt Status post gastrojejunal tube  Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good.
