Admission Date:  [**2139-9-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-9-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-10-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Short gut syndrome, chronically occluded superior vena cava, right brachiocephalic vein and right jugular vein, occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac veins, TPN dependent.
polyposis, she had resection of her colon at age 20 and now has a high output ileostomy.
She came in [**2138-7-26**], to our attention when she had developed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis At this time, we removed a tunneled femoral catheter which had been tunneled from the right groin into the left upper chest and placed temporary access.
The patient came to see on [**2139-9-7**], in clinic with the chief complaint of line dysfunction.
There was some high grade narrowing in both common iliac veins which were still patent at this time.
On [**2139-9-11**], she was admitted to St. [**Hospital 107**] Medical Center in [**Hospital1 189**], [**State 350**] for line sepsis, generalized weakness, near syncope and low grade fever.
There was some swelling and induration over the right thigh extending to the level of the knee which was suggestive of deep venous thrombosis but additional superinfection and cellulitis could not be ruled out.
There was an intact left lower quadrant ileostomy.
To assess her semi-obtunded status, blood was drawn which revealed a severe hypomagnesemia with a level of 0.7 and a hematocrit of 26.6.
To reduce further risks of sepsis due to the line, we proceeded with recanalization of the inferior vena cava.
Because of the patient's low pain threshold, all procedures had to be performed under MAC anesthesia.
I removed the tunneled right femoral line and replaced it with a 7French bright tip sheath.
In the afternoon, I was able to dilate the occluded inferior vena cava and place kissing stents in the chronic occlusion channels of the inferior vena cava.
The main goal for this day's procedure was to give the patient also a superior vena cava access since it became clear that she would be having recurrent infections in the long run.
She had some oozing around the right neck exit site.
There was no growth to date.
In the following course, the patient had only low grade temperature to 100, however, no spikes.
On [**2139-9-22**], she still had some swelling of her neck and both arms which may have been related to fluid therapy.
She developed an oral herpes which was treated for five days with Acyclovir.
Additional fluid should not contain heparin if need for hydration in presence of a high out put ileostomy.
We also obtained hematology consultation to address the issue of recurrent bouts of anemia which the patient also had at home.
Recommend also bone density study because of prior hysterectomy and heparin use as well as genetic cousneling because of [**Doctor First Name **] familial inbcidence of cancer to assess for Li-Frameni BRCA.
She has no signs of acute infection.
Short gut syndrome due to [**Location (un) **] syndrome.
Occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac veins treated by stent reconstruction.
Superior vena cava syndrome with occlusion of all central veins treated by reconstruction of the right internal jugular, brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.
TPN with Heparin at mixture of 8000 U for nightly infusion .
She treats pain with Dilaudid subcutaneous and wears a Fentanyl patch.
