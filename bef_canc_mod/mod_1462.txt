Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
As noted previously the patient had wheezing and dyspnea on admission with oxygen saturation 84% on room air, which improved with nebulizers and Lasix treatment.
The patient was started on IV Solu-Medrol for treatment of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with nebulizers with marked improvement over the course of her hospital stay.
The patient had a repeat chest x-ray two days prior to discharge, which demonstrated the resolution of some previously noted small effusions and atelectasis and noted no new lung lesions.
Early in the patient's course the patient underwent a swallowing study, which demonstrated a high risk of aspiration.
Following resolution of the patient's primary infection the patient's mental status improved and the patient was reevaluated by swallowing study who felt that although she was a high risk of aspirating liquids she could tolerate soft solids and pureed foods.
However, the patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status over the hospital course and her ability to eat without aspiration was extremely variable.
It was ultimately decided to place an NG tube in the patient then and refeed with tube feeds to prevent the aspiration risk.
It was felt that the patient's drop in her platelet count was a result of her sepsis causing possibly low grade DIC as well as decreased platelet formation.
The patient has a history of a left MCA middle cerebral artery stroke and was noted to have a change in her mental status on [**2142-5-9**] several days into her hospital admission.
A CT of her head without contrast was done, which demonstrated the presence of an old large infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution with associated encephalomalacic changes predominantly involving the left parietal region.
There was a small area of low attenuation in subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, which may have represented a subacute infarct, however, there were no signs of any acute infarct.
The patient was noted to be quite somnolent and unresponsive in the morning, however, by the afternoon hours the patient generally was awake and alert and interacting near her baseline and able to move her left lower leg and her left arm to command and spontaneously as well as smile and laugh appropriately.
For the two days prior to discharge, however, the patient was noted to again to be more somnolent and less interactive, thought to be secondary to the patient's ongoing low grade temperatures.
As stated before no source of infection other then yeast in her urine cultures was noted and at the time of discharge it was decided not to treat the yeast urinary tract infection as it was felt to be simply colonization rather then true infection.
Mild gastritis.
While the patient had NG tube placed in her stomach it was noted that aspirates of gastric secretions were positive for coffee ground substances.
Multiple NG tube lavages demonstrated no active source of bleeding in the stomach.
It was felt that the low level bleeding was secondary to gastritis possibly exacerbated by steroid use.
The staff at the [**Hospital6 459**] would continue to treat any reversible processes at the rehab facility, but would not traumatize her by further hospitalizations.
Proteus urinary tract infection and sepsis.
High aspiration risk.
Mild gastritis.
