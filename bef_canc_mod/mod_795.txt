worth of right leg pain.
The pain is worst when she tried to bear weight on the leg, or when she uses it to roll over or adjust her position in bed.
The pain begins in her buttock and travels down the posterior thigh and calf but stops before reaching the ankle.
She denies any parasthesias or weakness in the leg, and she denies any numbness in her foot or groin.
She denies any fevers or incontinence.
The pain was unrelieved by Vicodin that she had at home, so she scheduled an urgent visit with her nephrologist yesterday [**2141-9-4**].
?s office, she was hypertensive to 250/145 and so she was referred to the ED.
She ended up leaving the ED against medical advice yesterday, but returned today because of persistent leg pain.
She denies any fevers, headaches, visual changes, nausea (prior to coming to the ED), or leg weakness.
She received a total of 90 mg of IV labetalol and nitropaste, and was eventually put on a labetalol drip for her hypertension.
She was also given 4 mg of IV morphine and 1 mg of IV hydromorphone for her leg pain with decent relief.
Due to a urinalysis suggestive of infection, she was given one tablet of DS TMP/SMX.

worth of right leg pain.
She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and then transfered to the floor after a day.
# Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED, but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was coming down too fast).
She also had transient dizziness during this episode.
We opted to discharge her on her home regimen (without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issues with elevated blood pressures.
# Right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on plain film.
MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no acute pathology.
The pain was in the distribution of her right hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting a muscle injury.
On day of discharge, she was able to ambulate without gait abnormality or pain.
# CKD V: PD catheter placement in place.
Cx of peritoneal fluid not suggestive of peritonitis.
K remained mildly elevated.
# Anemia: chronic.
Not on Epo given hypertension .
# ID: Rx with cipro for ?
No clear source.
# Prior SVC thrombus.
# Dispo status: ambulating, pain free, BP in the 150/90 range  Medications on Admission: Nifedipine 60 mg PO qhs Labetalol 900 mg PO tid Hydralazine 50 mg PO tid Clonidine 0.3 mg/hr patch qWED Vitamin D once weekly Vicodin prn Aliskiren 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] Prednisone 5 mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

afebrile and SBP in the 130-150 range.
Discharge Instructions: You came in with right leg pain and poorly controlled hypertension.
Since your blood pressure was occasionally low, we recommend that you hold your labetalol if you are feeling lightheaded or have dizziness or have blood pressure less than 110/60.
You also had a fever which is suggestive of infection.
Please return to the ED if you experience headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers, or worsening leg pain.
