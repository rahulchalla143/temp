There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Video Swallow: PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Limited evaluation due to patient positioning and poor visualization of the structures.
However, pharyngeal phase demonstrated mild residue in the valleculae after puree and solid boluses which cleared with sips of liquid.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Laryngeal penetration of thin liquids via teaspoon and aspiration of thin liquids via straw occurred due to premature spillover.
IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia as described above.
Please see speech pathology note for further details.
Slight worsening in bibasilar opacities might represent worsening of atelectasis, although bilateral, in particular on the left aspiration cannot be excluded.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No evidence of failure is present.
Followup with chest radiograph to exclude the possibility of worsening basal pneumonia is recommended.
LENI: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
