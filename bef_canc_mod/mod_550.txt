He then became ill one week ago with upper respiratory symptoms including congestion and cough productive of phlegm streaked with blood which has evolved into phlegm with clots.
He has noted some epistaxis with dripping down the back of his throat.
He also noticed atraumatic bruises over his extremities over the past two days.
He has had diarrhea for 7-10 days all prompting him to be evaluated today at [**Company 191**] and was found to have a new pneumonia.
His labs returned with a critical value with platets of 22 and creatinine of 7.3.
Review of systems also positive for air hunger and anxiety related to his feeling of being unable to get enough air.
He denies any medication non-compliance, new medications or supplements.
recently, patient has been having difficulty breathing, described as inability to get air in.
CXR showed RLL/RML pneumonia.

Family History: Significant for lung cancer in the patient's father who developed this at age 75, but subsequently died of a stroke.
He has one brother with mental retardation that died at the age of 69.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 77 year old male with extensive history including heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction (CAD c/b MI), diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2), lung cancer status post VATS, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) status post kidney transplant in [**2104**] (on immunosuppresion), who presented from clinic with pneumonia, new thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Ultimately, the cause of his acute renal failure was not found.
It was suspected that he had a TTP/HUS-like syndrome or possibly ATN from sepsis which he never recovered from.
A renal biopsy of his transplanted kidney did not show acute graft rejection, blood vessel thrombosis, or other pathologic diagnoses.
He was tried on CVVH and CRRT for dialysis, however, he was ultimately unable to maintain euvolemia with this and was continuing to have pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure.
As discussed above, it is possible that he had a TTP/HUS-like syndrome, sepsis, or a smoldering DIC.
His hemolysis labs showed a mixed picture with largely normal total bilirubin and haptoglobin, variable fibrinogen sometimes under 100, and elevated LDH.
Then, he was given a trial of prednisone for possible TTP/HUS, which worked for only one day and was confounded by platelet transfusions at the same time.
He continued to have bleeding through pulmonary hemorrhage  Differential diagnosis includes TTP/HUS vs. sepsis vs. acute rejection, graft thrombosis.
Likely source of infection is urinary with a UA positive.
In terms of TTP/HUS, he has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.
He has been on prednisone chronically and may be playing a role in suppression of his fever response in the case of TTP/HUS and sepsis.
His peripheral morphology shows occassional schisotcytes.
He has had symptoms of diarrhea for 7-10 days though non-bloody.
