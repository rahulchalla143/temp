History of Present Illness: This 82-year-old gentleman with known atrial fibrillation and an atrial myxoma who underwent serial echocardiograms that have revealed worsening aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.
Based on these findings, he underwent an aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve replacement and atrial myxoma excision.
He was discharged home and while he was in a hotel where he was staying, several days after he was discharged, he had a syncopal episode.
During the syncopal episode, the family dialed 911 , the patient was hypotensive w/respiratory distress and was intubated.
A large left pleural effusion was drained for 1400 cc serosanguinous fluid.
he underwent an echocardiogram which revealed a large mediastinal hematoma with some signs of early tamponade.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with mid to distal anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis/akinesis and mild/moderate hypokinesis elsewhere.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion (most prominent inferolateral to the left ventricle and adjacent to the right ventricle in the subcostal view).
The effusion is partially echodense consistent with the presence of blood and/or partial organization.
No mitral respirophasic variation seen (limited views).
[**2195-4-14**] CXR Compared with [**2195-4-12**], the left pleural effusion may be somewhat decreased.
There has been partial re-expansion of the atelectasis at the left base medially.
There is minor atelectasis at the right lung base.
Left-sided opacity on recent portable chest x-ray is shown to be predominantly due to atelectasis of the lingula and left lower lobe, although moderate left pericardial effusion accumulating preferentially on the left side also contributes to this appearance.
There is only a small left pleural effusion.
Peristernal, retrosternal and pericardial fluid and gas, probably postoperative in etiology, although infection is not excluded considering the time interval since surgery; clinical correlation suggested.
Small dependent right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Diffuse severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-4-4**] via transfer from the [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] for further management of his pleural and pericardial effusions.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed  normal functioning aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valves and a large pericardial effusion.
Anticoagulation was resumed for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
Given his left pleural effusion continued to drain, the thoracic surgery service was consulted for assistance in his care.
A chest CT scan was obtained which showed small bilateral pleural effusions and normal postoperative changes.
His foley was removed and he developed hematuria and a 3way foley was reinserted and a [**Doctor Last Name **] drip was started.
