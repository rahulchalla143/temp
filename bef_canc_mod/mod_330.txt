HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial infarctions in the past, status post right nephroureterectomy on [**2163-3-7**] for a transitional cell carcinoma, who presented on the day of admission to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening lower extremity edema and exertional dyspnea since discharge.
The patient awoke on the morning of admission with acute dyspnea and presented to [**Hospital3 **] where his electrocardiogram revealed new lateral ST depressions of 2 mm in V5 through V6 which was initially read as left ventricular hypertrophy with strain, and he had an initial creatine kinase of 40 with a negative troponin, but an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air.
On review of the patient's history, he admits to having frequent bologna sandwiches and can soups and was unaware of their sodium content.
At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient had a blood pressure of 130/54, pulse of 72, respiratory rate of 26, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% Venturi mask with electrocardiograms that revealed 1-mm ST depressions in V5 through V6.
The patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, and several hours later suffered acute worsening dyspnea with 5/10 chest pain, and diaphoresis, and an electrocardiogram that showed ST depressions in II and F as well as V4 through V5, with a rate of 120, and a blood pressure of 150/90.
An echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for observation, diuresis, and afterload reduction in the setting of 3-vessel disease and left ventricular dysfunction.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in [**2149**], as well as a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2159**].
First-degree anterior vesicular block.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction that was markedly depressed by not quantified on a recent outside hospital echocardiogram.
History of colon cancer, status post right hemicolectomy.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without a history of intubation or hospitalizations.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral-popliteal in [**2155**] with known carotid artery disease with a right internal carotid artery of 80%.
Transitional cell bladder cancer, status post right nephroureterectomy on [**2163-3-7**].
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a bowel sounds creatinine of 2 to 2.5).
Anemia of chronic disease.
On general examination, the patient was a pleasant elderly man in mild respiratory distress.
Neck examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure to 10 cm of water.
Chest examination revealed crackles up to one-third of the lung fields bilaterally.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound appreciated, and a soft 3/6 systolic blowing murmur heard at the left lower sternal border radiating to the apex.
Abdominal examination revealed no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds, with a nontender and nondistended abdomen.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An echocardiogram status post catheterization revealed the patient had an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, and a normal right ventricle.
There was 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  From a coronary artery disease standpoint, the patient had 3-vessel disease with 40% left main lesion, 50% left anterior descending artery lesion, a 40% first diagonal lesion, a circumflex lesion with a 60% to 70% midvessel stenosis, a 70% proximal right coronary artery lesion, and a totally occluded first obtuse marginal.
No intervention was performed on the patient's first catheterization.
Within 48 hours of the patient being in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient developed an episode of bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoxic arrest requiring intubation and the use of pressors.
In this setting, the question arose of possible ischemic mitral regurgitation in addition to viable myocardial compromise by rate-related ischemia.
The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization four days later, at which point he received stents to his right coronary artery and first obtuse marginal.
From a myocardium standpoint, the patient had a right heart catheterization on presentation which showed elevated left-sided filling pressures with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 37 mmHg.
From a rhythm standpoint, the patient presented in normal sinus rhythm but then developed intermittent Wenckebach until nine days into the admission when the patient developed atrial flutter without rapid ventricular response.
PULMONARY:  From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of known poor systolic function.
The patient also had renal insufficiency in the setting of recent right nephroureterectomy.
The patient was intubated for progressive hypoxia.
Twenty four hours later, the patient became progressively lethargic, developing ventilatory failure as well as hypoxemia, and the patient was once again reintubated.
The patient was once again extubated, and within 48 hours was reintubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
At that point, Pulmonary was consulted and felt that the patient's multiple reintubations had to do with poor cardiac status limiting increase cardiac output and stress response to mild episodes of respiratory compromise including mucous plugging and aspiration.
The patient was successfully extubated and did well status post third extubation.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had presented with a low-grade temperature and possible right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin and ampicillin for a urinary tract infection.
When the patient experienced his decompensation status post initial extubation, he was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for a possible line-related sepsis and ventilatory-associated pneumonia.
After the patient's second extubation, he was found to have progression of a right lower lobe consolidation and was restarted on ceftazidime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
The patient had a right femoral internal jugular tip which had grown out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis for which he received a single dose of gentamicin.
The patient was continued on coverage for ventilatory-associated pneumonia for 10 days; after which his antibiotics were discontinued.
RENAL:  The patient developed progressive oliguria in the setting of known chronic renal insufficiency within the first 48 hours of presentation.
His acute renal failure was felt to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis from hypotension.
The patient was initially started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration with excellent results and excellent control of his volume status.
Although possible renal recovery was not excluded, it appeared to the Renal Service that the patient would remain on prolonged hemodialysis.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient presented with a low hematocrit which was initially thought secondary to chronic anemia.
He exhibited significant bleeding around lines and had multiple clot suctions in his endotracheal tube.
When the patient was extubated, he was evaluated for his swallowing and was found to aspirate significantly at the bedside.
The patient was re-evaluated after his third extubation with video swallowing and was also found to have marked aspiration.
The patient underwent this procedure without difficulty.
He will receive tube feeds until it is felt that his swallowing capacity may be re-evaluated.
EAR/NOSE/THROAT:  The patient complained of difficulty hearing after his second extubation.
He will likely need formal audiologic testing and possible hearing aide.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to acute rehabilitation for ongoing conditioning and management of pulmonary hygiene.
