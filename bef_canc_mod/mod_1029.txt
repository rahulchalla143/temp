He was found to be hypotensive, hypernatremic and hyperchloremic, abd was fluid resuscitated, and started on levophed.
He had a CXR which showed a right middle lobe pneumonia.
His left leg was found to be acutely ischemic with no dopplerable signals in the left foot with coolness up to the left mid-thigh.

A CT revealed a SMA stenosis with concerns for acute mesenteric ischemia given the patients hypotension requiring a vasopressor.
It also revealed that the left limb of his previous aorto-bifemoral graft was thrombosed causing his left leg to be ischemic.
Due to concerns for ischemia and potential compartment syndrome formation, a left lower leg fasciotomy was performed.
Pulses: He left foot had no dopplerable signals and his femoral was weakly dopplerable.
Post operatively his exam was notable for a palpable femoral pulse and a strong dopplerable left PT signal.
He is currently on prn dilaudid for pain control.
He does have left drop foot requiring a multipodis boot.
On POD zero, he was noted to have increased opacification of his right hemithorax.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics with double coverage for Pseudomonas due to his recent hospitalization being complicated by resistant Pseudomonal pneumonia.
His BAL specimen never grew any organisms and his antibiotics were discontinued by one antibiotic daily.
Once he was off pressors and stable, these were able to be advanced to goal.
He continues to have a spit fistula that drains to an ostomy appliance.
The was continued leakage of fistula output and the vac was only functioning part of the time.
Thoracic surgery is managing his fistula and recommended discontinuing the wound vac and starting moist to dry dressing changes to his abdominal wound.
His foley catheter was able to be removed once he was out of the ICU and he voids without difficulty.
Infectious Disease: Due to his septic physiology on admission he was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics empirically.
On POD zero there were concerns for pneumonia based on CXR and bronchoscopy so double coverage was started for his history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.
