History of Present Illness: This is an 86 year old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 17%), prior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with worsening fatigue and diarrhea.
His family noted worsened malaise, fatigue, diarrhea, over past week, also with loose, non-bloody stools over the prior 3 days, then with decreased oral intake.
Out of concern for Digoxin toxicity, Digibind was given, but then stopped after Dig level returned at 1 (only half vial administered).
CXR showed trace bil effusions, streaky atelectasis in RLL, final read possible pneumonia.
2 large bore pIVs.
He was admitted to MICU for concern for evolving pneumo-sepsis.
History of Colon cancer - last scope [**2162**] with polyp 2.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
History of Basal cell carcinoma 4.
Hypertension 6.
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) 8.
Mild aortic stenosis 9.
History of deep venous thrombosis - IVF filter placed [**2163**] 10.
Hypercholesterolemia 11.
Spinal stenosis 12.
Hernia repair, R-side inguinal 14.
Chronic kidney disease  Social History: - Former orthodontist.
Family History: - Father had heart attack at age 60.
- Denies history of CA, diabetes in family.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
systolic murmur, S1, S2, No thrills or lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
no wheezes or rhonchi.
Ext: +LE tense edema, pitting, with erythema bil, appearance of some stasis dermatitis.
There is hazy consolidation in the right lung base with associated pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with right lower lung pneumonia and associated pleural effusion.
ECHO [**2166-12-9**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20% %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-22**], the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 86 year old male with ischemic CMA, EF 20-25%, prior STEMI, PVD, p/w worsening fatigue and diarrhea, admitted to MICU with hypotension, now stable on floor:  In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 95/50, 95% room air, HR 70, lungs clear bilaterally, guaiac (-), otherwise benign exam.
Out of concern for Digoxin toxicity, Digibind was given, but then stopped after Dig level returned at 1 (only half vial administered).
CXR showed trace bilateral effusions, streaky atelectasis in RLL, final read possible pneumonia.
2 large bore pIVs were placed, and the patient was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving pneumo-sepsis.
Levo/ceftriaxone for pneumonia was continued initially.
No leukocytosis fever or tachycardia, no tachypnea.
Hypotension is considered, perhaps, an element of his worsening AS with overdiuresis.
The MICU did not restart dig or diuretics.
New acute renal failure was considered pre-renal in etiology.
On discharge, the patient was started on low-dose Coumadin for his afib and low EF.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Family Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Dehydration Hypotension Congestive Heart Failure Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for low blood pressure (hypotension).
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
as this can be a sign of fluid build-up.
