No recent travel.
Never had these symptoms before.
No pain anywhere.
Levo/Flagyl given for possible lung/abd infection.

Past Medical History: -Intrinsic asthma w/chronic obstruction: Last spirometry shows FEV1 of 1.78 liters, FEV1-to-FEC ratio of 59% -Bronchiectasis -AFib -HTN -Dyslipidemia -Erectile dysfunction -GERD -Allergic rhinitis -Last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 107189**] for severe gastroenteritis c/b ARF  Social History: Lives at home by himself.
CARD: tachycardic, s1, s2, wnl, no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: obese, distended, vericosities, TTP RUQ, no rebound, no guarding, hepatomegally by percussion.
Echogenic liver, commonly seen in hepatic steatosis.
However, other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease, including significant hepatic cirrhosis and fibrosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
Interval development of moderate-to-large abdominal ascites.
Tiny filling defect in the subsegmental branches of the posterior segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with acute PE.
Left greater than right basal patchy opacities, as well as bronchial wall thickening and minimal post-inflammatory, bronchiectasis, persistent in changes since the prior study, mean reflect recurrent aspiration, infectious causes are also in the differential.
Limited evaluation for focal liver lesions.
Questionable focus of increased attenuation in the posterior right lower lobe, as there is clinical concern; MRI with gadolinium could be performed.
13 mm nodular density in the lingula, 3 months follow up is recommended.
TTE [**9-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function.
Probable right ventricular dilation with borderline normal function.
LENIs [**9-28**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both lower extremities including the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms without evidence for intraluminal thrombus.
Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar alveolar opacities, mostly on the left, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Mild bibasilar areas of bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening suggest peribronchial inflammation.
Lingular atelectasis without suspicious lesion for neoplasia.
Severe fatty liver and ascites.
Bilateral gynecomastia.

There was evidence of cecal to ascending bowel wall thickening on his admission CT abd/pelvis but this was in the setting of no accompanying abdominal pain and an unimpressive lactate thus making an embolic or frank ischemic colitis less likely.
It was thought that the diarrhea was likely viral in nature, which then preciptated low BPs in a gentleman on multiple BP agents (SBP noted to drop as low at 60s in MICU while pt sleeping, would go back up to 80-90s with stimulation), which then possibly lead to a low flow state and possible watershed ischemia.
UA on [**9-29**] showed 39 WBC and muddy brown casts on sediment suggesting ATN.
FeNa is 0.04 on [**9-29**] which is c/w a prerenal picture likely due to low ECV [**2-7**] diarrhea.
Renal U/S showed no postrenal obstruction.
Hepatorenal syndrome was also considered in the setting of hepatitis.
AST/ALT ratio c/w of alcoholic hepatitis and liver US suggestive of hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis.
Also found to have new onset moderate to large ascites on admission.
Abd CT showed area of increased hyperattenuation in R lobe, raising a concern for HCC.
Hepatology was consulted who felt that hepatitis was likely [**2-7**] EtOH cirrhosis (pt drinks 6-8 ozs of whiskey/day) vs. NASH.
All imaging did not show frank obstructive lesion that could cause obstructive cholestasis.
Elevated conjugated bilirubinemia thought to be [**2-7**] acute illness.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed upon admission that revealed a SAAG > 1.1, no SBP, and negative cytology and cultures.
Was found to have a small subsegmental PE on chest CTA on admission, which was not thought to be a big contributing cause to his complaints of worsening SOB.
SOB unlikely thought to be [**2-7**] to COPD flare.
New onset ascites thought to be largely contributing and his sxs did improve after a 1L therapeutic paracentesis.
TTE showed no evidence of L sided heart failure.
He will continue on coumadin for an INR goal [**2-8**] indefinitely for atrial fibrillation and PE.
Diltiazem, sotalol held on admission due to hypotension initially on presentation.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with watery diarrhea, worsening of your baseline shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and jaundice.
You were found to have an inflammed liver with increased amounts of bile, leading to jaundice.
You have 1 L of fluid removed from your abdomen.
The following changes were made to your medications: 1) Losartan, lasix, and sotalol are being held for increased kidney function and the low blood pressure you had.
2) You were also started on imodium as needed for loose stools.
Please call your physician or return to the ED if you experience any of the following: fever > 101, worsening shortness of breath, worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, or any other symptoms concerning to you.
