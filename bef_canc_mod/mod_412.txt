Stable post-surgical and post-radiation changes of the right lung.
No new opacity, effusion, or pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Worsening opacities in the right lower lobe which had cleared in early [**Month (only) 956**].
New occlusions from secretions of the right middle lobe and distal bronchi consistent with a picture of chronic aspiration.
Alternatively if the patient received chemotherapy between [**Month (only) 404**] and [**Month (only) 956**] this could be a picture of improving malignancy, but more likely it is infection caused by chronic aspiration.
Right middle lobe collpase and concurrent infectious process is improving.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-2**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are both more prominent.
Pulmonary hypertension is now seen.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Initial differential inclueded aspiration pneumonia/HCAP vs COPD exacerbation vs viral brochiolitis.
She also has a history of OSA but did not tolerate CPAP 10 years ago and hasn't tried since.
The patient should complete a total of eight days of Vancomycin coverage for MRSA Pneumnomia (started on [**4-9**] but missed one day on [**4-12**]) and a full 14 days of antibiotics (started on [**4-9**]) for Pseudomonas (Had been on Zosyn) and will switch to IV Ciprofloxacin on discharge.
# Acute COPD Exacebration: Likely preciptated by PNA (as above).
# Hyponatremia: Appears to have combined SIADH and hypovolemic hyponatremia (as evident by low Urine sodium).
It could be related to active pulmonary process, but given smoking and cancer history there is concern there was some concern of malignancy.
