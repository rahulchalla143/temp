Subsequently developed hypotension with sedation, with persistent tachycardia, elevated lactate, stable hct.
Sepsis/Hypotension: Cause strongly suspected to be urosepsis, outside urine culture from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] grew E. Coli sensitive to Ceftriaxone.
The patient was agressively fluid recussitated, initially requiring Levophed for BP support.
He was additionally diuresed with lasix (for CHF and s/p fluids given in unit for sepsis).
He was given large volume fluid resuscitation on presentation for sepsis and became quite volume overloaded.
He was initially transfused and had a stable hct since that time.
AMS: Likely sedation for intubation, lingering effect given poor baseline with dementia and Parkinson's.
Head CT was without any acute event/mass.
He will need assistance with feedings, hob elevated during and post meals.
Goal should then be decreased to 500 cc negative, and then euvolemia when your peripheral edema is resolved.
You should follow up with GI; you had some GI bleeding in the hospital, but your hematocrit remained stable after that isolated event.
