Upon stabilization she said that her only complaint was RLQ abd pain which was somewhat worse with movement, it was non-radiating and intermittent.

She has no history of easy bruising or bleeding problems.
She denied having any GU symptoms including hematuria prior to admission.
Past Medical History: -Heavy ETOH abuse -HCV -Elevated portal pressures with varices and portal gastropathy -Chronic LE neuropathy -Diastolic CHF -Asthma -Depression -Osteopenia .
PSH: -CCY -TAH for endometrial hyperplasia  Social History: Lives with husband and 29 y.o son from a previous marriage.
Family History: Father died of MI in 80's.
Physical Exam: On arrival to medical floor: Vitals: 98.3   92/55 79  20  97%RA Gen: alert, mildly uncomfortable with movement.
MMM, remnants of blood on teeth, erythematous oropharynx, no discrete lesions.
good air entry no wheeze or crackles CV: RRR no murmur/rub/gallop Abd: soft, non-distended, mild tenderness to RLQ but diffusely as well.
indirect tenderness across abdomen Extr: tender on lower extremities [**1-11**] neuropathy Neuro: a&ox3, pupils as described above.
[**2176-6-4**]: EGD: Grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus Grade 1 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction Portal gastropathy Duodenitis in the proximal bulb Large duodenal varix.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 46 year old woman with history of alcohol/hep C cirrhosis, portal hypertension and recent episode of colitis who presented with an upper GI bleed.
There were no active bleeding vessels visible during the procedure and none of the lesions detected required intervention.
Her hematocrit stablized in the mid 30s but time of discharge and she exhibited no evidence of re-bleeding.
She was referred to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the Liver Center with the consideration that a TIPS procedure might be therapeutic to treat her duodenal varix that was the presumptive cause of the bleeding.
Hypotension:  In the ED the patient became hypotensive to sbp ~80s.
Hypoxia:  With the history of diastolic CHF the patient developed mild hypoxia  following the vigorous volume expansion with saline and blood.
This could be secondary to hypersplenism.
This was thought secondary to octreotide (which was later stopped) on top of chronic hypersplenism, however, other possiblities were entertained included secondary to the PPI, ITP or DIC, and HIT.
The smear did not reveal appreciable shistocytes and the DIC panel including trend did not support DIC.
There were no thombotic events to support an immune HIT picture.
Liver Disease:  The patient has a history of alcohol and Hep C cirrhosis.
CT scan demonstrated a increase in her splenic diameter compared to [**2176-3-9**].
Hematuria:  The patient reported no history of hematuria prior to admission.
This was thought to be secondary to a traumatic foley placement.
A follow-up UA after the foley was removed showed a decrease in the RBC by more than half the prior level.
Abd pain: The patient described a pain in her RLQ.
Potential diagnoses included a re-lapse of her pancoltis from [**3-14**], appendicitis, mesenteric adenitis, constipation, or less likely ovarian cyst.
A abdominal CT was obtained that revealed portal gastropathy and mesenteric collaterals, resolved colitis, but no obvious source for abd.
Chronic Diarrhea/Bloating:  This was thought likely secondary to celiac sprue (+FH, duodenal biopsy + for early disease, TTG reported as + although no result in OMR).
[**Name (NI) **]:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper gastro-intestinal bleed  Secondary: Cirrhosis Alcoholic hepatitis Chronic Hepatitis C Esophageal Varices Peripheral Neuropathy Celiac sprue   Discharge Condition: Good: Hct stable, bp stable at her baseline, no evidence of re-bleeding.
