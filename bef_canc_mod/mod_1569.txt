The pt was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 19710**]) for shortness of breath, likley secondary to atrial fibrillation.
The pt underwent a TEE to rule out thrombi in the heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and underwent successful cardioversion on [**2111-11-20**].
He stated his SOB was improved s/p cardioversion and he was discharged in stable condition in sinus rhythm and without complaints.
Pt was feeling unwell, and electrocardiogram showed underlying atrial fibrillation in a fully ventricularly paced rhythm at 60 beats/minute; the right ventricle is paced from the outflow tract.
ICD interrogation showed a low OptiVol fluid index.
Has been back in atrial fibrillation since [**2111-11-25**].
Over the past 12 months, this has been his sixth episode of atrial fibrillation starting [**Month (only) 956**], [**2111**].
Procedure was terminated and patient was taken away to the OR for urgent arterial closure.
He underwent endarterectomy of the LCF with bovine patch with a drain left in place.
Family reports that he has been having increased leg swelling and dyspnea in the few days preceeding admission.

EXTREMITIES: 1+ pitting edema of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to the mid-shin.
Stable cardiac enlargement with interval improvement in aeration in the lungs consistent with resolving pulmonary edema.
There is persistent retrocardiac opacity and likely layering effusion which may reflect compressive atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
No pneumothorax.
[**12-20**] Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with several mildly dilated loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant.
The imaging appearance would favor postoperative ileus, but early small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Prominent amount of gas within a moderately distended stomach.
No evidence of free air.
[**12-22**] ECHO Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage without organized thrombus.
Diffuse and complex aortic atherosclerosis without mobile components.
[**12-23**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST Subtle changes in the posterior left parietal lobe in the left MCA territory concerning for early acute infarction.
No acute intracranial abnormality.

There was evidence of a seroma after the drain was removed which was managed conservatively.
#Hypotension - Upon presentation to the CCU, he was hypotensive and briefly required dopamine and phenylepherine to maintain his MAP >60.
The hypotension was thought to be related to the sedation used during his procedure and subsequent surgery, he did not appear hypovolemic and there was no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
#Rhythm/atrial fibrillation (CHADS2=2) - Pt has refractory AF with multiple prior cardioversions and trial of many antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone.
During this admission, he remained in artial fibrillation with intermittent V-pacing on telemetry while he was in the CCU.
In an attempt to chemically convert him to NSR, he was started on doeftilide after a TEE was negative for thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] RA.
#Pump/coronaries - He has a history of CAD with multiple prior stents.
He had a cath in [**10/2110**] which showed non-obstructive coronary disease and did not report any chest pain during this admission.
His ASA and Plavix were initially held after the arterial puncture with repair, but were restarted after discussion with vascular surgery.
There were no focal neurologic defecits noted, however there was ongoing concern that his mental status was declining and a non-contrast head CT was obtained.
There was initial concern for a stroke in the left MCA distribution and a code stroke was called, NIHSS was 0.
A CT perfusion was obtained which showed no evidence of ischemia.
The initial thought was that he may have global hypoperfusion from severe carotid stenosis with mild hypotension.
This concern was also dismissed and the prevailing theory was that his mental status changes were a result of delirium from a combination of oxazepam and ambien.
#Dilated cardiomyopathy (EF=15-20%) - He initially appeared volume overloaded on exam and his family gave a history of worsening dyspnea and LE edema prior to presentation (patient was intubated and initially unable to provide history).
There was no clear precipitating cause, although reverting back to afib after his last cardioversion likely contributed.
At discharge, his weight is 92.6kg and his volume status is slightly hypervolemic.
#Hyperlipidemia - Continued atorvastatin and Zetia  #COPD - Noted on CT scan prior to admission, not reporting any wheezing at admission.
