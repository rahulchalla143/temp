Admission Date:  [**2191-11-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-11-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-3-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Progressive dyspnea on exertion X 2 wks  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis and Balloon pericardiotomy   History of Present Illness:      Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 36733**] is a 56yo man with a history of IgG Multiple Myeloma.
This was first diagnosed in [**11-18**] when pain between his shoulders prompted a chest x ray demonstrating a posterior chest wall mass.
CT demonstrated a large mass in the right posterior mediastinum and hemithorax destroying the transverse processes of T3, T4, and hte ribs at that level.
CT guided biopsy of this right posterior chest wall lesion was consistent with plasmacytoma.
This was CD-134 positive, adn positive for monclonal kappa and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin.
Bone marrow biopsy was significatn for plasma cells involvement, 41% of the marrow cellularity.
Skeletal survey showed no additional lytic lesions.
His IgG was 8703, SPEP with abnormal band representing 58%, and a beta-2-microglobulin or 3.4.
MRI at that time demonstrated only prominent sulci.
Then he completed his second cycle of DVD, but had increasing size of a neck mass and incerased size of rib mass.
On [**11-8**], he presented to clinic with shortness of breath, a pulsus of 15, and a chest xray significant for a large mediastinal mass.
His [**11-8**] echocardiogram demonstrated  circumferential pericardial effusion (2.6cm anterior to RV) with evidence of right ventricular and atrial diastolic collapse consistent with tamponade physiology.
Catheterization [**11-9**] demonstrated tamponade physiology with increased and equalized diastolic pressures of RA, PCWP, and pericardial pressures.
MRI of the thoracic mass with bony involvement of T3 through T5 with right posterior ribs and lesion into the spinal canal.
Prevertebral mass size of 5.6 x 8.0 x 9.0 at the posterior aspect of the trachea.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated plasma cell myeloma, with chromosome 13 deletion.
History of viral encephalitis in 12/[**2177**].
10.Steroid induced diabetes.
11.History of pneumonia in 02/[**2190**].
3 children from previous marriage.
Physical Exam: 97.9, 106, 18, 140/80  *No pulsus paradoxus  gen: alert/oriented, no acute distress.
2) Moderately large pericardial effusion.
3) 2.4 x 4.0 cm mass displacing the cervical esophagus anteriorly.
4) A few images of the lower cervical spine show some irregularity in the region of the epidural space this could be secondary to artifact.
5) Moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
Status-post balloon pericardiotomy with marked decrease in pericardial effusion.
A small amount of air is seen within the pericardium.
Slightly increased bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right.
Redemonstration of extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy associated with left pleural atelectasis, unchanged within the very short interval of three days.
[**2191-11-15**] CT chest: FINDINGS: The size of the dominant mediastinal mass and the other mediastinal adenopathy is unchanged over the short interval compared to the prior study.
Unchanged also is pericardial and pleural effusion.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion (2.6cm anterior to the right ventricle) with evidence for right ventricular and right atrial diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is a small (~0.7cm) pericardial effusion anterior to the right atrium and right ventricle.. A catheter is seen in the pericardial space.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**11-10**]: SPECIMEN RECEIVED: PERICARDIAL FLUID  DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo man with history of IgG multiple myeloma.
#Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The patient was admitted for shortness of breath.
He was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology on echo.
Cytology from the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
A repeat TTE on the [**11-10**] demonstrated small amount of residual pericardialfluid, but no tamponade physiology.
#Anterior Mediastinal Mass: He was treated with a five day course of Solumedrol 125mg IV qD, and there was no interval change in the size of the mass by repeat CT. CT surgery and interventional pulmonary were consulted and the decision was made to biopsy the lesion by bronchoscopy.
He then decided that he did not want further diagnostic procedures and would f/u as an outpatient for Velcade.
#Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia: The patient had a small pleural effusion on admission, which increased in size over the first few hospital days.
By the second or third day on the floor, he was intermittently requiring 2L oxygen by nasal cannula to have oxygen saturation of 95-96% and his pleural effusion was larger on both cxr and CT.
The interventional pulmonologists had suggested tapping the effusion for symptomatic relief, but the patient refused any further invasive procedures.
He denied feeling short of breath.
