There is also worsening of the atelectatic changes at the left lung base.
There has been interval development of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities of the right middle [**Male First Name (un) 3630**], which is very concerning for aspiration pneumonia.

Both kidneys contain multiple hypodense lesions which are too small to characterize.
Moderate amount of ascites in the peritoneal cavity is unchanged.
The stomach, duodenum and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal.
The oral contrast is noted within the ascending and transverse colon up to the rectum with no evidence of obstruction.
The colon is mildly distended which may be related to the use of hypertonic oral contrast.

There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstructing stone.
1.5 cm rounded anechoic structure in the mid pole of the left kidney is not fully characterized given the limitations of the study and likely reflects a simple cyst, and unchanged from [**2167-12-21**].

The left lower quadrant was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
... [**2-22**] Liver US: FINDINGS:  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated subtotal occlusive thrombus within the main portal vein extending into the right branch.
Minimal flow is seen within the portal vein, which is again noted to be reversed in direction, similar to [**2169-2-15**].
... [**2-6**] CT A/P: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Small lymph nodes are seen particularly in the mediastinum that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient is status post catheter placement into the right pleural space and the right pleural effusion is thus significantly decreased in size.
There is a moderate right pneumothorax.
There is improvement in the reticular opacities in the left upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**] with near-complete resolution.

Correlate with recent instrumentation or catheterization.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o male who is s/p segment VI/VII liver resection on [**12-24**] who now presents with increased weakness.
-New large amount of perihepatic and abdominal ascites, tracking into the pelvis; note that ascites has not been present pre-operatively.
-Large amount of pneumoperitoneum, possibly post-operative in nature, though this appears larger than expected, some three weeks following hepatic resection; perforation of hollow viscus or infection (ie.
-Distended loops of small bowel; however, no definite evidence of obstruction or secondary sign of bowel ischemia.
Paracentesis showed WBC [**Numeric Identifier 4395**] with 88% polys with culture growing Coag + Staph aureus.
Additionally on [**2169-1-8**] the patient was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a pre-op diagnosis of perforated Viscus and a post op diagnosis of perforated small bowel.
In summary per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] "he had approximately 6 liters of cloudy slightly yellowish ascites.
In the distal jejunum there was a small 2 mm simple perforation midway between the mesentery and anti- mesenteric border of the small bowel.
There was no fibrinopurulent debris around this area.
There was no evidence of any foreign body.
There were no adhesions in the abdomen.
There was no obvious explanation for the perforation.
There were no other abnormalities in this area."
In summary briefly, he was noted to have rising LFTs and bilirubin prompting a liver ultrasound on [**2-15**] which showed a portal vein thrombus.
At that time he was having blood in his stools and was not started on anticoagulation.
He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis, TPN was started for some time for nutrition,  a nasoduodenal tube was placed in IR for enteral feeding, and he was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
He underwent a total of 3 paracenteses for abdominal distention and ascites.
Over the past week he had developed acute renal failure with his creatinine rising.
A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
On [**2169-3-18**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have some vomiting and his tube feedings were stopped at this point.
He was emergently intubated after which he became hypotensive requiring levophed.
A CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done showing likely aspiration event.
