Reports baseline orthopnea and PND - no change recently.
EMS documented BP 172/88, O2 Sat high 70s, speaking in short sentances and working to breath.
She had peaked T waves on EKG consequently received calcium, dextrose and insulin.
CXR revealed hazy opacity right lung base suggestive of atelactasis and prominent mediastinum suggesting volume overload.
Due to continued respiratory distress required BiPap.
On arrival to ICU patient reports feeling well andn denies any shortness of breath, weakness or chest pain.
Of note, patient has had several admissions to the hospital, most recently discharged [**2163-1-31**] for syncope felt to be secondary to severe AS.
For concern of bactermia patient was discharged on Vancomycin for 14 days which was completed [**2163-2-10**] however no blood cultures were ever positive.
Patient also had a recent ICU stay [**2163-1-18**] for LGIB felt to be secondary to a diverticular bleed.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Past Medical History: * Dyslipidemia/hypertension - coronary artery disease on aspirin * Hypertension * Complicated proximal humerus fracture ([**6-/2161**]) * Cerebral hypoperfusion: Evidence of multifocal previous strokes despite aspirin - clopidogrel added [**3-/2162**] * Post polypectomy bleed admitted on [**4-24**] for BRBPR and LGI bleed [**1-/2163**] with further non-bleeding polyps [**1-14**] * ESRD on HD: Tues, Thurs, Sat at [**Location (un) **].
LVH ([**Month/Day/Year 1192**], and diastolic dysfunction) * Type 2 DM: diagnosed >40 years ago, complicated by ESRD, controlled on insulin * Sarcoidosis with ocular involvement: seen every 3 months for eye exam - not biopsy proven * Gout: last flair [**10-18**]; usually occurs in R toes * Knee surgery s/p fall * Obstructive sleep apnea: [**2161-8-12**] sleep study shows [**Year (4 digits) 1192**] obstructive sleep apnea consisting mainly of hypopneas that produced substantial drops in oxygen saturation.

There is a hazy opacity overlying the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis.
No left pleural effusions or pneumothorax is identified.
A small rigth pleural effusion may be present.
Prominence of the vascular interstitium suggests a mild degree of volume overload.
Possible right basal atelectasis and mild volume overload.
There is mild prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings, consistent with pulmonary edema.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral pleural effusions.

She spent one night in the ICU with BiPAP which was able to be weaned off without difficulty and she was weaned down to to 1-2L nasal cannula by time of discharge with O2 Saturation in the mid 90s range.
Patient tolerated room air without difficulty, but was kept on nasal cannula for comfort.
Respiratory distress was felt to be secondary to combination of poor physiological compensation with severe aortic stenosis in the setting of flash pulmonary edema due to rising hypertension and elevated heart rates.
# Aortic Stenosis: Progression from mild to severe aortic stenosis in recent months with clinical decline and sensitivity to drops in pre-load volume with her [**Year/Month/Day 2286**] sessions has made management especially challenging.
Patient was seen and evaluated by cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] who helped communicate to patient and family that future surgical interventions for aortic stenosis would not be feasible.
# ESRD on HD: Continued with hemodialysis per home schedule.
# Hypertension: Remained normotensive for majority of stay after initial hypertension on hospital day one.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Was continued on sliding scale plus AM NPH.
Because of 2 episodes of asymptomatic hypoglycemia (to 40s), the sliding scale was decreased.
Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for contipation.
11. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for pruritus.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - Flash pulmonary edema - End stage renal failure  Secondary diagnoses: - Aortic stenosis - Diabetes mellitus - Carotid stenosis - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were seen in the hospital for shortness of breath secondary to flash pulmonary edema from fluid retention related to renal failure and worsening aortic stenosis.
You were treated with BiPap face oxygen in the ED, hemodialysis to remove excess fluid, and your home blood pressure medications for congestive heart failure.
You tolerated hemodialysis without difficulty, and your breathing improved considerably.
