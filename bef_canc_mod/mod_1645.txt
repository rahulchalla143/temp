Admission Date:  [**2155-10-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-10-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-10-21**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 101878**] is a 63-year-old female with a past medical history significant for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, end-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity, papillary thyroid cancer status post tracheostomy and complicated by vocal cord paralysis and Crohn's disease who was admitted through the Emergency Department on [**2155-10-13**], with hypotension, shortness of breath, fever and leukocytosis.
She described shortness of breath as well as some slight increase in her baseline thick sputum production.
Specifically, she denied abdominal pain, no diarrhea or constipation, no headache or visual changes, no urinary symptoms, no weakness.
A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department was negative for focal infiltrate.
There was also no evidence of volume overload/congestive heart failure.
These intravenous antibiotics were chosen for empiric coverage of sepsis and were also chosen after consultation with Infectious Disease as the patient has multiple drug allergies that will be listed below.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Again the patient only complained of slightly increased shortness of breath and slightly thickened mucus production from baseline.
She also described some nausea but no vomiting.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia left lower lobe diagnosed in [**2153-10-18**].
End-stage renal disease.
The end-stage renal disease is secondary to lithium toxicity.
Papillary thyroid cancer status post tracheostomy that was complicated by vocal cord paralysis.
Intention tremor secondary to lithium.
Crohn's disease status post ileostomy with a history of chronic diarrhea.
Also has a history of perineal sinus status post colectomy and a history of a perineal abscess.
Basal cell carcinoma right lower extremity.
History of recurrent right upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm formation.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to NSAIDS.
The patient has no voice at baseline secondary to vocal cord paralysis but is able to clearly mouth her words.
HEENT: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was diffusely tender, greatest in the left lower quadrant but no rebound and no guarding and normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There was minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, however, this was unchanged from previous chest x-rays.
No ST changes.
No change from old electrocardiograms.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  Patient's most recent echocardiogram was on [**2153-6-29**], that showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 60% and moderately dilated left atrium and asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex.
This study was said to be consistent with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atypical variant.
P-MIBI on [**2153-7-3**], showed no perfusion defects and, again, hypertrophy anterior and apically of the left ventricle.
IMPRESSION:  This was a 63-year-old female with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, Crohn's disease status post ileostomy, history of MRSA pneumonia, who presented with sepsis.
In particular, the patient had hypotension, fever, leukocytosis with an uncertain source.
Sepsis:  As stated, patient presented with hypotension, fever and leukocytosis, thereby, by definition, sepsis.
Our differential diagnosis included a pneumonia with her history of shortness of breath, however, her initial chest x-ray was negative.
Also in the differential was an abdominal source with her Crohn's disease and history of abscess.
The repeat chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
As far as an abdominal source, an abdominal CT and pelvic CT was performed on hospital day two that showed no evidence of small bowel inflammation or obstruction nor abscess.
The initial concern was perhaps that the patient was septic from a hemodialysis line infection, however, no blood cultures grew out any organisms.
By hospital day three all cultures were negative and the patient's leukocytosis and fever had resolved, therefore, it was decided to discontinue gentamicin and Flagyl.
No blood cultures grew out any organisms.
All respiratory cultures and stool cultures were also negative, therefore, all antibiotics were discontinued on the day of discharge aside from vancomycin which was to be given with hemodialysis for one week post discharge.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis:  The patient was continued on her hemodialysis.
A lithium level was checked that was slightly subtherapeutic at 0.21.
It was felt that in an acute setting no changes should be made to her current Synthroid regimen, therefore, she was kept on her outpatient dose of Synthroid.
Cervicalgia:  The patient has baseline cervicalgia secondary to spinal disease and nerve root compression.
She was continued on her Duragesic patch, her Elavil and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Most likely patient has a tracheobronchitis.
