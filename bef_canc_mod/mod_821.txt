HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old man with a history of obstructive jaundice since [**2101-5-26**].
In [**2101-5-26**], the patient was discovered to have painless jaundice.
Several days later, the stent eroded and the patient developed an acute abdomen.
He also complained of some low grade fevers while he was at home.
He denies any pain and he did have the low grade fevers up to 101.7.
He denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  In addition to the suspected ampullary adenocarcinoma, the patient also has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
[**Name (NI) **] does have a positive smoking history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on presentation was afebrile with a heart rate of 112, blood pressure 99/69, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96%.
The patient did not seem in any acute distress.
He did have a J-tube in the left upper quadrant.
His extremities were warm with no edema.
The CAT scan showed a significant amount of intrahepatic ductal dilatation with a persistence of the mass in the porta hepatis compressing the hepatic duct.
There were no fluid or air collections indicating abscesses and stable abdominal aortic aneurysm.
An echocardiogram at this time revealed an ejection fraction of only 25% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis.
A chest x-ray showed marked bilateral pleural effusions which was confirmed in a CTA that was performed afterwards that also showed the bilateral pleural effusions but did not show any sign of pulmonary embolus.
Over the next few days, the patient received multiple transfusions with packed red blood cells and required pressors for hemodynamic stabilization.
This revealed an obstructive stricture in the common bile duct with associated dilation of the intrahepatic ducts.
It drained bilious material afterwards.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with the drain in place draining bilious material.
The patient's extremities were warm with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Hypoxia and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic blood loss anemia requiring transfusion.
He could not remember these so he was recommended to follow-up as soon as possible with his primary care physician to coordinate his home medication regimen for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
