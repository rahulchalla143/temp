He was treated prophylactically with Keppra for a 10 day course and had no seizure activity.
He had 2 subsequent Head CT's which showed no interval change in his intracranial hemorrhages but his wife felt that he was not at his baseline mental status.
He was evaluated by the Occupational Therapy service on multiple occasions and they found deficits in memory and recall and felt that he would benefit from both a short term rehab and a follow up visit with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from Cognitive Neurology.
