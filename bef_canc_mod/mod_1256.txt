Admission Date:  [**2184-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-9-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfonamides / Tetracyclines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**] Chief Complaint: generalized weakness, anorexia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter [**2184-9-16**]   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/ AFib on coumadin, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, CKD, and diastolic CHF a/w malaise, weakness, and decreased PO intake for two days and an episode of urinary incontinence the night prior to admission.
Per the patient's family, she felt well until 2 days ago when she noted multiple episodes of diarrhea in the setting of an increase in her laxative regimen intended to treat constipation and associated abdominal discomfort.
She denies fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, flank pain, or changes in mental status.
Had transient fluid-responsive systolic hypotension to SBP 85.
She was transferred to the MICU for close observation given hypotension in the setting of delicate volume status.

**FINAL REPORT [**2184-9-17**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2184-9-17**]):       IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES REQUESTED BY DR.[**Last Name (STitle) 99804**].
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
[**2184-9-12**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL Dual-lead right pectoral pacemaker with right atrial and right ventricular leads is unchanged from prior studies.
Cardiomegaly is again noted, although the right heart border is now obscured by right basilar opacity which also obscures the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with moderate-sized pleural effusion and related atelectasis, although underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is also a small left pleural effusion with milder left retrocardiac atelectasis.
The remainder of the lungs are grossly clear, without evidence of overt pulmonary edema or lung consolidation .
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Old right lateral rib fracture is unchanged.
IMPRESSIONS: Increased right basilar opacity, with increased and now moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and related atelectasis, although underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
Small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
[**2184-9-14**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction and evidence of volume overload.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed the catheter tip in the right atrium with no kinks along the course of the catheter and no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: #CKD stage IV - The patient presented with symptoms consistent with uremia.
Volume overload was refractory to diuretic therapy due to worsening renal function.
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Admission CXR showed a moderately-sized right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
TTE [**9-14**] showed a dilated RV with mild global systolic dysfunction and evidence of volume overload, normal global and regional LV systolic function (LVEF 55-60%), and severe functional TR and mild AR/MR.
Volume status was managed with HD, as above.
#Thrombocytopenia - The patient did not have clinical signs or symptoms of bleeding or thrombosis.
#Anemia of chronic kidney disease - Hematocrit remained stable, obviating the need for transfusion.
#UTI - Admission urinalysis showed [**5-11**] WBC, moderate bacteria, and trace leukocyte esterase.
#Atrial fibrillation - Anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K and FFP prior to HD catheter placement.
#Nutrition - Heart-healthy diet.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/g Cream Sig: One (1) application Topical twice a day as needed for itching.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Medication You may continue taking your hydrocortisone-lidocaine compound topically as needed for discomfort due to hemorrhoids.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary 1) Chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis 2) Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 3) Thrombocytopenia 4) Urinary tract infection  Secondary 1) Atrial fibrillation 2) Anemia of chronic kidney disease 3) Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: clinically improved with stable vital signs.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with generalized weakness and poor appetite most attributable to worsening kidney function, or uremia.
You were also found to have a low platelet count likely due to an effect of medication.
3) Metoprolol was decreased to 12.5 mg twice daily due to low blood pressure.
Please call your physician or return to the Emergency Department immediately if you experience fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, falling, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody or dark stools, discomfort with urination, or leg swelling or pain.
