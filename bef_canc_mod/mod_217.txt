Transplant surgery was consulted for her access issue and recommendations were made for a RUE ultrasound which was done.
This showed an ill defined 1.3 x 0.5 cm fluid collection within the superficial subcutaneous tissues of the right antecubital fossa.
She was transferred to the ICU for care where BP responded to small fluid bolus.
There was no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve, mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations were seen.
There was severe mitral annular calcification.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation was seen.
There was no pericardial effusion.
She was given IV dilaudid for pain management.
The wound was cultured.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened switched backt to vanco on [**2-1**] as there was no GN growth and the wound grew MRSA.
Right arm dressings were continued with persistent purulence noted in wounds.
Endocrine was consulted for low basal cortisol levels and she was found to have secondary adrenal insufficiency based cosyntropin stim test.
Recommendations included increasing prednisone to 10mg qd and giving stress dose steroids if she is febrile or hypotensive.
-If the patient is undergoing surgery or has severe illness would recommend stress dose steroids -d/c prednisone and start Hydrocortisone 100mg iv q 8 hours then taper.
-Recommend discharging pt with dexamethasone 4mg IM to take PRN when having emesis and unable to keep down PO meds.
Her risk for fracture is high given she has amenorrhea, is weak from recent stroke, and is on steroid treatment.
Pain in R arm worsened after I&D.
She did not tolerate neurontin due to "twitching".
On [**2-10**], she was taken to the OR the following day to remove remnant infected graft and a patch angioplasty was placed.
Patient remained in the hospital due to poor pain control and persistent oozing of blood at incision sites.
Bleeding was partially due to a hematoma of the more distal incision.
Incisions appeared without redness or purulence.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
