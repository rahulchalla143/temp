He c/o pain in his jaw, which then moves to his throat and then the middle of his chest; feels like pressure.
Patient states that symptoms began a few months ago and have been worsening in the sense that they come on with less stimulus (now just with walking across the room) and only resolve with nitro.
He has had a cough productive of large amounts of white sputum x 1 week.
He also notes subjective fevers at home and nausea with episode of non-bloody emesis in the ED.
He has had diarrhea about 5 times a day, "like minestrone soup."

Of note, he does endorse PND and orthopnea as well as ankle edema.
He reports 10 pounds of weight gain in the last week.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother had CVA at 46.
Sister with scleroderma and another sister with [**Name (NI) 18109**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, with some pallor but no cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Soft, NT, mildly distended.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG demonstrated NSR with old Q wave in V3 but new ST depressions in V5-V6 and I, aVL as well as ST elevations in V1 and V2 as compared with prior dated [**2154-7-25**].
CXR [**10-10**]: TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are slight increased patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, which is seen to project posteriorly on the lateral view.
Small Kerley B lines suggest mild interstitial edema.
Possible early/developing right lower lobe pneumonia.
Mild interstitial edema.
Echo [**10-11**]: The left atrium and right atrium is moderately dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect.Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal lateral and anterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Secundum type atrial septal defect.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hyertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-31**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive (now involving the basal inferior and inferolateral walls), the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
The secundum type atrial septal defect is now better defined.
PORTABLE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**10-13**]) FINDINGS: Limited grayscale images of the abdomen do not detect ascites and limited views of the liver suggest normal echotexture.
CXR [**10-13**]: Increased airspace disease is evident by progressive increasing density of the bilateral consolidations, the left now clearly expressing itself as such.
IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease bilaterally for which bilateral pneumonias most fitting.
ABDOMINAL FILM ON [**2154-10-13**] INDICATION: Abdominal distention, increased dyspnea and difficulty breathing.
A single view of the abdomen shows nonspecific non-obstructed bowel gas pattern with predominantly gas-filled large bowel visualized.
On the current study, there are surgical clips overlying the sacrum and there is no evidence for pneumatosis.
No ascites .
CXR [**10-13**]: Increased airspace disease is evident by progressive increasing density of the bilateral consolidations, the left now clearly expressing itself as such.
IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease bilaterally for which bilateral pneumonias most fitting.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral and apical hypokinesis with mild hypokinesis elsewhere.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital 1516**] Hospital course: Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] with NSTEMI with positive enzymes, (peak trop 0.54, CK 298, CK-MB 6), and EKG with inferolateral 1-2mm ST depressions, 1mm ST depressions in aVL and 1mm STE in aVR (has baseline 1-2mm STE in V1, V2).
Had TTE here after admission on [**10-11**] confirming the EF of 35% as well as focal HK of basal inferior and inferolateral walls and distal lateral and anterior walls.
Was treated with abx for PNA, and pulm also had plan for bronch/IBAL [**10-14**] but course was complicated by intermittent hypotension and hct drop to 25 for which he was transfused 3 units of prbc's and 1L of NS.
No associated fevers with transfusion, although he did spike to 101.3 the day prior.
He does have perihilar consolidation and hemoptysis and was followed by pulmonary and ENT surgery who at this point recommended no steroids since they did not beleive this to be Wegener's flare.
He was also followed by renal team for worsening acute renal failure that was though to be pre-renal in etiology.
# PNA Pt arrived to the CCU in respiratory distress with RR of 40, ABG 7.44/18/56/13; BiPAP was tried but pt was eventually intubated since the CCu teamed feared he was becoming fatigued.
Pt was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, R>L, and hypoxia in the setting of a pneumonia and hemoptysis starting after integrillin.
Pulm bronched pt showing minimal blood and hemoptysis resolved quickly after intergrillin had been stopped.
The thinking was that pulm hemorrhage was [**1-18**] inflammation due to PNA.
Pt was afebrile, without a cough, off oxygen ambulating well with good O2 sats on disccharge.
# CHF with EF 35% Pt also arrived fluid overloaded and in acute on chronic systolic heart failure after the transfusions.
# CAD s/p mulitple stents Pt likely had a minor NSTEMI on admission and definitely had interval inferolateral wall motion abnormalities from prior to admission.
The decision was made to continue to [**Hospital 18110**] medical management and do a stress MIBI as an outpatient for risk startification since this all happened in the setting of an acute illness.
# Atrial Fibrillation On the evening of extubation ([**10-15**]) pt entered afib with a ventricular resonse rate of 100-120s.
# Metabolic acidosis/diarrhea/hypokalemia Pt had an anion gap of 22 when arriving to the floor, likely [**1-18**] uremia.
The AG corrected failry quickly, however pt still had an acidosis with a low bicarb since he continued to have diarrhea with 3-5 loose stools per day.
The cause of the diarrhea was not found in hosp and was negative for c.diff x4, O+P, shigella, salm, legionella among other things.
Immodium was prescibed with some effect and mycophenolate preparation was changed since the different preparations have different GI side effects.
Hypokamlemia to 2.4 was repleted agressively.
Pt was given 20mg daily of K to take at home and to eat banana's, especially if diarrhea continued.
# Wegener's disease Patient is s/p 6 match donor transplant in [**2154-5-17**] with basline Cr 1.8-2.1 since [**Month (only) 205**].
Renal recommended stopping sirolimus and starting tacrolimus once the sirolimus was <5.
# Anemia to 25 with recent baseline hct 25-30 As mentioned above was given 3-4 units of prbc's prior to CCU transfer.
Blood counts in the CCU improved with hct in 32-33 range and no further transfusions were needed.
Pt was guaiac negative and no other source of bleeding was identified other than the DAH.
Pancytopenia of unknown origin Anemia as above.
Perhaps a medication effect, although bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if persists and other causes are ruled out as an outpt.
