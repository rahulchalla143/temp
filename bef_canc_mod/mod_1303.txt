Pt was complaining of lightheadedness and subjective dyspnea.
CXR showed scattered patchy alvelolar opacities b/l greated in upper zones.
Additionally, pt with ~3 episodes of coughing up hemoptysis, which has since become clear sputum.
It was decided to transfer pt to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing observation and nursing requirements as well as for possible potential of increasing respiratory distress.
No N/V/F/C.
Pt does note that she felt like "I was getting a cold" for the days prior to surgery and had been coughing with minimal productive sputum, but no blood until this am.
At bseline denies orthopnea, weigh gain or LE edema.
Overall she had been feeling well prior to admission excpet with cold and mild cough symptoms prior to admission.
Of note in OR receieved 1.5LNS with 250cc blood loss and 2.3L in PACU and 1.5L on floor, but no PRBC.

No illegal drugs.
[**Name2 (NI) **] other cardiac, renal, or pulm disease.
Physical Exam: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission exam PE: T: 95.9/100.3; HR: 80; BP: 135/70; RR: 14; O2: 97% on 5L via mask Gen: AA female in NAD speaking in full sentences without respiratory muscle usage.
No edema b/l.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission: 62 yo female s/p LRRT on immunosuppressives, PAF, DM2, hx of squamous cell lung ca s/p RLL lobectomy in [**2138**] here after right hip revision with increased SOB and bilateral infiltrates.
Respiratory Distress: Likely CHF exacerbation as pt likely received fluids in the periop and operative period.
Other causes such as cardiogenic pulm edema, ARDS from infection either aspiration related to intubation or atypical pneumonia given immunosuppression or fat emboli and alveolar hemmorrhage given hemoptysis were considered and ruled out with trial of diuresis, cardiac enzymes, repeat echo and sputum cultures.
Hypotension - in the ICU transient episode of hypotension likely secondary to overmedication with metoprolol and verapamil.
Ortho and medicine teams evaluated patient, no signs of hematoma or bleeding.
Per Ortho resident low concern for bleeding and the hct remained stable after this time.
CAD: no hx of MI, but with EKG changes and hyperlipidemia, has presumed CAD, so continued statin, Repeat Echo essentially uncahnged from prior EF> 55% - mild demand ischemia likely source of mild troponin leak.
If you experience shortness of breath that is not relieved with rest please contact your PCP or [**Name9 (PRE) 5511**] the emergency room.
