HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old male with a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma first diagnosed in [**2154-2-13**].
He underwent modified radical neck dissection in [**2154-10-14**] which was complicated by a fluid collection that was drained incompletely by placement of an IR drain.
On [**2155-1-9**] (the day after discharge), the patient presented to the Emergency Room with fevers to 102, right neck pain, chills, and dyspnea.
He denied any dysphagia, odynophagia, or difficulty breathing.
He demonstrated no airway compromise.
A chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
Nasopharyngeal cancer (as above).
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2155-1-16**] for incision and drainage of the right neck abscess.
The wound was left open.
Postoperatively, the patient complained of shortness of breath.
He denied odynophagia or dysphagia.
There were no changes in his voice.
Fiberoptic examination revealed supraglottic edema.
Neck examination revealed no fluctuant fluid collection.
However, later that evening he complained of throat swelling and dysphagia.
Fiberoptic examination revealed a swollen epiglottis with pooling of secretions at the malicola.
On postoperative day seven, the patient again complained of subjective shortness of breath with oxygen saturations remaining above 92%.
On examination, he was found to have bilateral neck edema, anteriorly and posteriorly.
He had harsh breath sounds, but no stridor.
On [**2155-1-24**], a trial with a Passy-Muir valve was attempted; however, he could not tolerate the valve, likely due to swelling at the level or above the tracheostomy tube.
He also developed left arm and left face swelling.
Ultrasound studies demonstrated no deep venous thrombosis.
The edema improved with arm elevation.
He demonstrated a hoarse voice but immediately complained of difficulty breathing; especially upon exhalation.
Poor tolerance of the Passy-Muir valve was felt to be due to continuing edema.
It demonstrated less gas within the fluid collection in the right neck; although the size of the collection was similar, the left internal jugular appeared patent.
He was also started on clindamycin for mild cellulitis of the right neck.
By [**2155-2-1**] the superior and lateral half of the wound contained healthy granulating tissue.
The lower aspect of the wound still revealed fibrinous exudate.
There was no recurrent collection and no surrounding erythema.
He continued to have vac changes every two to three days by the Plastic Surgery Service.
He ambulated and voided without assistance.
