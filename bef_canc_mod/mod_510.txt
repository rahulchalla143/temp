bipolar d.o., s/p recent hospitalization for jaundice and found to have pancreatic mass causing obstruction, s/p stent placement p/w recurrent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
Pt states she noted the onset of nausea, vomiting as well as new onset of jaundice 1 day PTA.
Pt reports also diarrhea and periumbilical pain this AM to the ED, but on the floor denies diarrhea and denies pain.
pancreatic head mass and biliary dilation and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2172-8-25**] for [**Date Range **].
[**Date Range **] showed a chain of lakes with a beaded pattern in the main pancreatic duct c/w chronic pancreatitis versus auto immune disease or malignancy.
Pt also found to have distal high grade stricture of the CBD and dilated intra-hepatic ducts.
Sphincterotomy was performed and cytology samples sent from CBD which showed atypical cells.
Stent was removed on [**9-3**] and sent for path which also showed atypical cells.
Pt also underwent abdominal CTA given question of pancreatic head mass which showed "diffuse hypoenhancement of pancreatic head and neck with upstream dilation of pancreatic duct.
No definite discrete mass identified; findings may represent focal pancreatitis, however, an underlying mass cannot be excluded."

There is marked dilatation of the common hepatic duct proximal to the biliary stent, with maximal transverse diameter of 14 mm.
Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is also seen, most prominent in the left hepatic duct.
No obvious focal parenchymal lesion is identified in the liver.
No pancreatic duct dilatation is identified at the head of the pancreas.
IMPRESSION: Prominent dilatation of the common hepatic duct and intrahepatic ducts proximal to biliary stent.
Findings are suggestive of obstruction of biliary stent.
Subsequent images demonstrate cannulation of the pancreatic duct with a beaded appearance.
Cannulation of the common bile duct reveals smooth tapering of the distal CBD and post- obstructive dilatation of the proximal CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts.
Beaded pancreatic duct, suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.
Smooth distal CBD tapering, consistent with pancreatitis.
Portable CXR [**2172-9-22**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2171-11-14**], there has been the development of patchy opacification at the left base consistent with pneumonia.
No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
[**2172-9-23**] Chest PA and Lateral HISTORY: Cholangitis.
Increasing hypoxia and shortness of breath.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-22**]:  The lung base is elevated at least by a moderate right pleural effusion.
Although heart size is normal and unchanged, mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature is more pronounced and there is new septal opacification in both lungs.
The simplest explanation is volume or cardiac related pulmonary edema.
[**2172-9-25**] Chest PA and Lateral FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate increased patchy opacity in the right upper lobe which may represent infection.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small, right greater than left pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  CT Chest without contrast [**2172-9-26**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are multifocal infiltrate involving all major segments of the lungs, but predominantly in the right upper lobe.
The findings are compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
There is a partially consolidation versus collapse at the base of the right lung.
There is no discrete pulmonary nodule, allowing the obscuration of the underlying infectious process.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, but no evidence of organized abscess.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no gross hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy by CT criteria.
Again noted is moderate pneumobilia.
There is probably a pancreatic head mass, incompletely evaluated in this study, grossly unchanged in appearance.
BONE WINDOW: There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
No suspicious lytic lesions are noted concerning for metastasis.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
No evidence of fluid collection to suggest abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the MICU on [**9-21**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and was found to have cholangitis, sepsis, ?
Obstructive jaundice/cholangitis Patient initially presented with fevers, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, leukocytosis and elevated LFT's and was admitted to the ICU.
Initial differential diagnosis included cholangitis, cholecystitis or an auto-immune process.
Pancreatitis was also considered given history of pancreatitis in the past and [**Month/Year (2) **] x 2.
A RUQ-US was performed which showed prominent dilatation of the common hepatic duct and intrahepatic ducts proximal to biliary stent, suggestive of biliary stent obstruction.
Blood cultures returned positive were positive for Klebsiella and enterococcus.
The jaundice, fevers, nausea, vomiting and leukocytosis all continued to resolve upon transfer to the floor.
Bacteremia Patient's blood cultures were positive for klebsiella and enterrococcus faecalis.
TTE was negative for vegetation given enterococcal bacteremia.
Multifocal Pneumonia When the patient was transferred to the floor, she had an oxygen requirement of 2-3L with an oxygen saturation of >90%.
Her exam and chest x ray suggested fluid overload.
She was diuresed with good effect and was weaned off of oxygen completely without feeling short of breath.
A PICC was placed for her IV antibiotics and the X ray was concerning for a right multifocal pneumonia as well as a right-sided effusion.
A chest CT was done which revealed bilateral effusions which were too small to tap and multifocal PNA.
Her path results were positive for atypical cells and Ca [**81**]-9 was elevated.
On further discussion with [**Year (2 digits) **], this could be consistent with inflammation.
Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of BP d/o with recent psychiatric hospitalization.
Hypertension The patient was remained normotensive and home BP medications were held.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob, wheezing.

No abdominal pain.
They also found a lot of bacteria in your blood.
You were also short of breath and required oxygen but after fluid was taken off you were able breath much more easily.
There was a fluid collection seen on chest x-ray but your CT scan showed it was too small to drain.
You were started on the following new medications: - Vancomycin 1250mg po q 8hrs (check next trough tomorrow afternoon, goal 15-20) last dose on [**2172-10-5**] - Levofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H last dose on [**2172-10-5**] -Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB Inhaled every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze -colace and senna prn -heparin sc 5000 units sc TID .
