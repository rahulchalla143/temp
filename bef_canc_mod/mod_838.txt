Admission Date:  [**2149-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76M h/o pancreatic CA (s/p Whipple), upper GI bleed and liver abscesses with recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2149-8-9**], d/c'ed on [**2149-9-2**] on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, meropenam, and caspofungin.
He had been feeling well after discharge, but returned to the ED today after he began experiencing shortness of breath.
Of note, during his last hospitalization he was found to be bacteremic, with various blood cultures growing out E.coli, Klebsiella (sensitive only to the penems), and Enterococcus (Vanc sensitive).
He was also found to have expanding liver absesses; absess fluid grew out E. coli, strep viridans, [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 17939**], enterococcus, and bacteroides.
He also had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status throughout his hospitalization with persistent word finding difficulties.
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
The volume overload was attributed to low albumin secondary to liver dysfunction from his large abscesses.
He had persistent pleural effusions during his admission, noted on CT on [**8-9**], moderate on the right and small on the left.
Liver abscess ([**3-3**]) Has recurred multiple times.
Acute Renal Failure at OSH in DC [**5-/2149**] (thought [**2-27**] vanc/ampho) 4.
Anemia secondary to bleeding duodenal ulcers ([**5-/2149**]) 5.
E. coli bacteremia ([**5-31**]) 6.
Chronic diarrhea-secondary to pancreatic insufficiency 7.
RUQ U/S on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for  abcesses vs. metastases.
He received a CT guided drainage of one  liver abscess and drain placement on [**8-15**] -> growing klebsiella resistant to cetriaxone, enterococcus and yeast.
No malignant cells were found on abscess biopsy.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
He had two other liver nodules also drained by IR, last on [**8-19**].
Planning for antibiotics will need to be continued for 6 weeks with serial imaging to monitor for resolution of absecesses.
Neck- JVD Pulm- Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Abd- Large distended abdomen with hernia above the umbilicus.
Rectal- Deferred Extrem- 3+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities including both thighs Neuro- Somnolent.
His MICU stay was complicated by an upper [**Hospital1 **] bleed secondary to peptic and duodenal ulcers.
He developed acute on chronic renal failure secondary to aggressive diuresis, but remained otherwise stable of the course.
#)SOB Pt has known pleural effusion and left lower lobe opacities.
Effusion had increased during last hospitalization after drainage of his liver abscesses.
Now has shortness of breath in bed.
Also has 3+ pitting edema up to thighs bilaterally and large, protrudent abdomen with increased ascites, and increased JVD.
SOB likely related to fluid overload from increasing liver dysfunction.
# Upper GIB- peptic ulcers found on EGD.
Episodes of tachycardia treated with IV lopressor prn.
Could not anticoagulate given upper GI bleed and possible intracranial septic emboli.
#)Liver abscesses and Bacteremia - Continued vancomycin, caspofungin, and meropenem.
# Mental status changes- patient was believed to be encephalopathic secondary to his multisystem dysfunction and severe illness as his mental status waxed and waned greatly.
He never had focal neurologic deficits except for a persistent word finding difficulty noted on his prior admission.
The utility of repeating head imaging to reevaluate his possible septic emboli was believed to be low without further intervention options.
#)Ascites- persistent ascites with low albumin minimally responsive to aggressive tube feeds.
#)Pancreatic insufficiency - Was given viokase per NG while he was getting tube feeds to assist in breakdown and absorbtion of nutrients.
# Renal failure: Creatinine elevationa after aggressive diuresis for pleural effusions.
