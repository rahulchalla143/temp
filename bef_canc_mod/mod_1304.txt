Given hypotension pressors were started including Dopamine, Dobutamine and Neo.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed which did not reveal effusion but did reveal new severe MR and possible [**Year (4 digits) 99125**].
Recommendation was made to discontinued pressors as likely exacerbating hypotension and admit the patient to MICU for further evaluation.

Avascular Necrosis bilateral hips   Social History: Patient currently intubated.
[**Name2 (NI) **] other cardiac, renal, or pulm disease.
No M/R/G Abdomen: Healed infraumbilical scar.
Postoperative changes in the right lung appear stable.
No definite pleural effusions are visualized.
Dystrophic calcification in the axillary regions bilaterally appears stable.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic post-surgical changes in the right hemithorax as above.
[**2144-3-2**]: Portable Chest IMPRESSION: Worsening of a now moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No RA diastolic collapse.
Hypoxia - at baseline patient has been evaluated for longstanding dyspnea without obvious cause.
However, hypoxia on admission new.
Bedside echo in ED was concerning for severe MR as well as possible [**Month/Day/Year 99125**] as contributors.
Chest imaging looks more consistent with pulmonary edema rather than infectious, although important to consider latter given patient is immunocompromised.
The sum of her presentation and course was most consistent with cardiogenic source.
Hypotension - etiology not clear although initially thought to be related to new severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99125**].
However, repeat echo off pressors showed only [**11-27**]+ MR with some LVH.
Squamous Cell Lung CA - s/p resection sup seg of RLL, no known recurrence to date.
Anemia - currently at baseline, likely secondary to renal and chronic disease .
SVT - history of SVT, currently in NSR.
Hyperlipidemia - continued statin .
DM - on insulin sliding scale.
