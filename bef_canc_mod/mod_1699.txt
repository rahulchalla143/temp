History of Present Illness: The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman who presents with a three day history of progressive nausea, vomiting, obstipation, failure to pass any stool or flatus, as well as profound right lower quadrant tenderness.
He had a history of vomiting up to 20 times a day, accompanied by vague grampy abdominal pain and decreased flatus.
The patient had no fever or chills.
Esophageal spasms secondary to achalasia.
Chronic fatigue.
History of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; status post direct current cardioversion.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic headaches.
Cerebrovascular accident; status post left occipital stroke.
First-degree atrioventricular block.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a bowel sounds creatinine of 1.4 to 1.8).
Physical Exam: Temperature 100.5, Pulse 108, Plood pressure 110/48, Respirations 18, Exam: General: No apparent distress.
no jugular venous distention Lungs: decrease breath sounds at the bases bilaterally Abdomen: soft, distended.
Right paramedian incision with no hernia.
Positive fror right lower quadrant/peripubic mass in inguinal region that is tender and firm.
No rigidity, rebound or guarding Rectal: no masses, enlarged prostate, heme negative Extremities: warm, well perfused  On discharge, the patient's abdomen was soft.
Pertinent Results: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2116-7-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Small bowel obstruction with a transition point within the mid to distal small bowel and wall thickening within small bowel.
No evidence of pneumatosis, mesenteric gas, or portal venous gas.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction with a transition point and the patient was taken to the operating room for an emergent exploratory laparatomy and right inguinal hernia repair.
Cardiology also felt that this might be intermittent atrial tachycardia, but suggested no further changes in his management.
He was slightly confused and not at his baseline, and a CT was done which was negative.
He had not had any recent sedative/pain control.
Given his respiratory failure and CO2 narcosis, anesthesia was called and the patient was intubated for respiratory failure.
The patient also began receiving amiodirone for his episodes of rapid heart rate.
he remained stable on the vent on postoperative day 5, although he continued to have intermittent runs of SVT, and like all previously episodes, he remained completely hemodynamically stable otherwise.
His tube feeds were held over concern of aspiratoin, but on post operative day 7 the patient's mental status began improving and his tube feeds were restarted.
He was evaluated by speech and swallow who demonstrated no aspiration.
