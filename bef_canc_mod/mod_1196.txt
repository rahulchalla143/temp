The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with a suggesiton of more prominent inferior hypokinesis (difficult to assess due to poor image quality).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-1-30**], no definite change.
There are low lung volumes.
Small left-sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged.
Mild congestive failure.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin and recurrent GIB, who presents with low HCT and guaiac positive stool.
Hemolysis not thought to be a significant factor given the Coombs test was negative and he had a normal LDH.
He had dark guaiac pos stools, but has had work up in past including colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy without finding source of bleed.
CBC should be monitored periodically as well as stool output for recurrent bleeding.
In the past, blood has been noted in the terminal ileum so a small bowel lesion is suspected.
# Mechanical Aortic valve: The patient has a goal INR of [**3-6**] (ideally 2.5).
# UTI: The patient complained of dysuria on admission and he had a positive U/A.
He had questionable delerium after ICU stay, and so Cipro was changed to Ceftriaxone.
# Delerium vs. Hospital Psychosis:  When out of ICU on medical floor, he had vivid hallucinations of being visited by Chinese Immigration, and then by 2 men from the mafia who were after his patents.
# Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Chronic - is on Prednisone for this.
# CKD: On admission his creatinine was at his baseline (1.2-1.5).
# GERD: Initially he was treated with PPI IV BID and subsequently transitioned to PO.
# CAD/Hyperlipidemia/HTN: Continued statin.
Held carvedilol in setting of GIB and stable blood pressures.
