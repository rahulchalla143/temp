POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Perforated diverticulitis with diffuse peritonitis and free air, with large retroperitoneal abscess extending into the splenic hilum.
PROCEDURES:  Left hemicolectomy, splenectomy, removal of Marlex mesh, and ventral hernia repair and end transverse colostomy.
HISTORY:  This elderly male with significant comorbidities of severe coronary artery disease, having had an acute episode with stenting in [**2108-1-9**], now on Plavix, and additionally having a chronic course of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], which is requiring large steroid doses, presented to the emergency department in transfer from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, having had a history of approximately 2 weeks of lower abdominal pain, which got dramatically worse during the night, awakened him from sleep.
They immediately determined that they would transfer him to [**Hospital1 **] after a CAT scan revealed that he had massive free air.
He additionally had a large epigastric hernia which was resulting from his sternotomy from previous cardiac surgery.
This, under CT, had evidence of the transverse colon being in it, but it did not appear to be incarcerated.
There was little inflammatory reaction, but a large amount of air in the retroperitoneum as well as in the abdomen.
At surgery he was found to have a fecal peritonitis, with ruptured abscess in the descending colon.
However, the size of the abscess was rather dramatic and attempting to drain this laterally we actually got feculent material out of it, actual fecal matter and so therefore it was felt that we really needed to resect this area.
Because of the large abscess the colon was actually removed along the colon itself to avoid injury to the ureters.
Upon coming around to the middle colic artery, taking down the left branch of the middle colic, we got into good bowel with no more abscess.
Additionally, the patient had a recurrent ventral hernia with Marlex mesh, which was actually intraperitoneal, attached to the left lateral costal margin.
This was excised and fascia was mobilized, so that we could actually effect epigastric closure primarily.
A midline incision was created and upon entering the abdomen and observing the incredible amount of retroperitoneal process, this was extended superiorly and inferiorly to allow complete midline incision.
Based on this the sigmoid was identified and found to be without any inflammation in the midportion and distally.
Attempts at mobilizing the splenic flexure and draining this retroperitoneal abscess up around the pancreas yielded some bleeding off the inferior pole of the spleen, as well as behind the spleen.
Vascular pedicles were controlled throughout the case with 2- 0 silk ligatures in continuity, followed by 2-0 silk suture ligature to the vessel remaining in situ.
Attention was turned back to the left upper quadrant, at which point the patient still had some bleeding and we were unable to control the hilum well, where the abscess was extending into it.
There was still some bleeding in the inferior port of hilum.
The pancreas could not be identified because of the diffuse edema and pus that was coming out from behind it, so a right-angle clamp was placed on the actual arterial bleeding site and a 2-0 silk suture ligature was placed, and this controlled the bleeding.
At this point in time the left upper quadrant was again packed, after diffuse irrigation along the left side of the abdomen with warm saline was completed.
After this packing, the attention was turned to the superior aspect of the abdomen, where he had his old ventral hernia.
This was dissected out of the abdominal wall.
He had a lot of omentum and actually the transverse colon had been previously taken out of this hernia.
However, it was decided because of the diffuse infection, as well as the immunocompromised state, that this would not be prudent.
At this point then we turned our focus back on the left upper quadrant, which was having no further bleeding.
Because of the pancreas and the abscess it was elected to go and put [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain there, and this was brought out through  a separate stab wound incision.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy with repair of fascial dehiscence, insertion of a Surgisis Gold mesh.
HISTORY:  This 64-year-old male, with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], having presented with sepsis, a free abdominal perforation of a large retroperitoneal diverticular abscess, had a left hemicolectomy along with splenectomy to adequately drain the retroperitoneum approximately 10-14 days ago.
This morning on rounds, he had some serous fluid coming out of his wound.
Subsequent CT revealed that he had a fascial dehiscence.
At surgery, he was found to have necrotic fascia.
Therefore, it was elected, after consultation with 2 different surgeons, to place a Surgisis Gold mesh.
This was placed in an anterior fascial position as opposed to a preperitoneal position because of the lack of omentum and the appearance of the bowel.
The wound was opened as noted above.
A large piece of fat from the inferior preperitoneal area was brought up and sewn to the preperitoneal fat superiorly to try to protect the bowel with 3-0 Vicryl.
Sponge, needle and instrument count were correct x2, and the patient was then transported back to the intensive care unit for bronchoscopy because of a left lower lobe atelectasis noted on CT.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, had 100 cc of urine output, and had 1000 cc of crystalloid during the course of the case.
Vancomycin/Zosyn/Fluconazole were provided for empiric coverage.
At POD 5 a bronchoscopy was performed for RUL and LLL collapse which was negative for evidence obstruction or infectious source.
At POD 9 his WBC was elevated at 36.2.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed  two small fluid pockets two small for drainage without evidence of leak or obstruction.
Repeat video swallow was completed with approval for thickened liquids.
At POD 18 he had fascial dehiscence which was noted on exam and (+) per CT scan.
At POD 20/2 he was febrile and with decreased urine output which responded to fluid bolus.
He was cardioverted for atrial flutter.
At POD 24/6 he was afebrile and extubated without event.
At POD 30/12 WBC was elevated at 33.2.
He was afebrile and clinically looked well.
Repeat CT scan was performed to assess interval change in fascial repair site which was negative for compromised fascial integrity.
WBC remained elevated at ~30 but he was afebrile and was clinically doing well.
In regards to medications, his Azathioprine was held until follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] due to his elevated WBC count.
