For the past couple days, his wife noted that he was increasingly lethargic and that he was complaining of abdominal pain.
4 days prior to presentation, he had been tapped therapeutically and 12 L of fluid was drained; he does get weekly paracenteses for recurrent ascites following a failed TIPS.
He was initiated on HD in [**2121-9-20**] for hepatorenal syndrome, the hemodialysis being a bridge until he gets a transplant.
In the emergency department, diagnostic paracentesis revealed > 4000 WBCs in para fluid suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Past Medical History: -Alcohol-related cirrhosis complicated by esophageal varices, encephalopathy, refractory ascites s/p TIPS which is likely no longer patent, h/o hepato-renal syndrome requiring admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2121-4-18**] to [**2121-4-30**], and h/o SBP on Cipro ppx.
-IDDM -Hypothyroid -Pituitary mass -h/o nephrolithiasis -h/o +PPD -ESRD on HD MWF, initiated [**2121-9-20**]   Social History: Lives w/ wife at home.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM VS: SBP 93/55, HR 99, SpO2 99% RA, temp 98, RR 12 Gen: Portuguese-speaking male, dark-skinned, drowsy, but otherwise arousable and oriented, in no apparent distress Cardiac: Nl s1/s2 RRR, no murmurs appreciable Pulm: clear bilaterally, no accessory muscle use Abd: grossly distended with dullness to percussion throughout consistent with significant ascites Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally, warm  [**Year (4 digits) 894**] PHYSICAL EXAM General Appearance: Thin, with protuberant abdomen.
A left IJ tunneled dialysis catheter is again noted with its tip residing in the expected location of the right atrium.
There is linear opacity in the left retrocardiac space, likely representing atelectasis.
No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mediastinal contour appears stable with atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob.
IMPRESSION: Basilar atelectasis without definite signs of pneumonia.
No evidence of perforation, abscess formation or hemorrhage.
Severe liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly and large amount of ascites.
Filling defect is seen in the distal SMV, at the portal confluence, the proximal portal vein, and the TIPS stent, representing thrombosis or flow artifact.
Evaluation is limited due to lack of multiphase imaging.
Massive ascites.
Cirrhotic appearing liver with splenomegaly.
Technically limited study, demonstrating diffuse gaseous distention of the large and small bowel, most consistent with ileus.
The examination was performed at near expiration, which crowds and dilates pulmonary vasculature and is responsible for severe left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.

# Transition to Comfort Care: the patient's TIPS was found to be not patent and the patient was not considered a transplant candidate in the near future.
# Sepsis - Abdominal pain is present on review of systems; diagnostic paracentesis reveals a WBC count of >4000 with >90% polys consistent with either SBP or secondary bacterial peritonitis (given repeated taps), but no perforation or abscess seen on CT abdomen.
Alkaline phosphatase is elevated which could be secondary to TIPS.
There is concern that a clot in the TIPS could be infected.
He was treated empirically initially with vanc and zosyn, the vancomycin was changed to daptomycin for VRE given hx of VRE in peritoneal fluid in [**2119**] and chronic thrombocytopenia (so avoid linezolid).
He did receive albumin for SBP despite already having HRS and being on HD.
# Ileus: the patient developed a severe ileus, which was thought to be [**1-22**] his peritonitis and his ascites.
An NGT was placed with relief of nausea and vomiting, and he was discharged with this tube to hospice for intermittent suctioning.
# Anemia: the patient has had an acute hematocrit drop from 28 to 21.
The patient has baseline anemia, likely secondary to kidney disease and liver disease; prior iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
In the setting of acute hematocrit drop, concern for bleed; no signs of acute bleeding despite history of varices.
No signs of hemorrhage on CT abd.
# Cirrhosis - Secondary to EtOH.
Complicated by esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and refractory ascites s/p TIPS that is no longer patent.
He did receive a therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 10L of fluid on [**2122-1-28**].
After that point, although he was in pain with his distension, the patient could not have another paracentesis as his hypotension was preventative.
# End stage renal disease - Hemodialysis for hepatorenal syndrome in setting of cirrhosis.
No evidence of incarceration/strangulation.
This has been one of the patient's most significant sources of discomfort and embarassment for several years however he has been told that he is not a candidate for surgical repair until after he has a liver transplant.
