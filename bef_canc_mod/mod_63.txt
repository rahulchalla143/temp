The next day, she noted a fever to 102.
She also had nausea and vomiting with emesis times one, and abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
She also noted fevers and chills with a temperature to 102.
A review of systems was significant for dysuria and frequency for the previous few days.
She also notes exercise-induced angina over the previous few months, but no active change in this.
She is otherwise without any complaints; including no cough or shortness of breath or chest pain.
Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be febrile and mildly hypotensive.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management given her presumed septic shock.

History of hepatic encephalopathy.
Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Iron deficiency anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed positive scleral icterus.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was admitted in acute septic shock, with primary source being urosepsis.
The patient with a history of urosepsis, admitted following a cystoscopy with only Bactrim prophylaxis with probable bacteria feeding her blood.
She did develop temporal sepsis and did require Levophed for pressure support.
This was sepsis clinically tailored to only Levaquin and vancomycin.
Her vancomycin was subsequently discontinued as her cultures remained negative for any vancomycin-sensitive organisms.
CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient with hepatitis C cirrhosis (Child's class B).
Initially, her cirrhotic medications were held given her acute septic shock.
She was thought to require long-term spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis with plans to start her on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis when she did complete her course of Levaquin for her urosepsis.
