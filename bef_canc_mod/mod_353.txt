At home, he denies any fevers, chest pain, SOB or bodily pain.
Past Medical History: 1) Aplastic anemia dx [**4-19**] by bone marrow biopsy.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Dilatation of cecum and terminal ileum between two fixed points, i.e., new stoma and patulous left inguinal orifice.

Prior granulomatous disease affecting multiple visceral organs.
Improvement of congestive heart failure.
Slightly dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid level within it and may represent SBO- a clinical correlation is suggested.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions.
Calcified right upper lobe granuloma, calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, calcified intra-abdominal lymph nodes, as well as punctate calcifications in the spleen and liver and atrophic calcified left kidney are all consistent with previous granulomatous infection including tuberculosis infection.
[**2-13**] Head CT: No evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarction.
Distal right colon at ostomy concerning in appearance for ischemia vs inflammation, with markedly abnormal heterogeneous, thickened bowel wall; infection is less likely.
Small amount of air concerning for bowel perforation at the distal ostomy site.
Similar appearance to prior dilated loops of bowel in left lower quadrant concerning in appearance for closed-loop obstruction.
Unchanged appearance of evidence of prior granulomatous infection including multiple calcified granulomata in liver, spleen, and left "putty" kidney.
Markedly abnormal appearance of the large bowel leading into the patient's diverting colostomy with edematous-appearing wall again demonstrated.
Differential diagnosis includes ischemia, infectious or inflammatory process.
Small bowel and free fluid in a left inguinal hernia.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
[**2-21**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Continued but slightly improved distal colitis.
Peripherally enhancing cystic structures in the seminal vesicles are new since the study of [**11-15**], and raise the possibility of seminal vesiculitis and/or prostatitis with abscesses.

Calcified granulomas in the lung, calcified mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, punctate calcifications in the liver and spleen, as well as the atrophic and calcified appearance of the right kidney are all consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Bilateral bowel-containing inguinal hernias without evidence of incarceration.
Improving appearance of the colitis adjacent to the right upper quadrant ostomy with persistent fat stranding in this region.
[**3-8**] Prostate U/S: No evidence of prostatic or seminal vesicle abscesses.
The presumed small infected collection demonstrated on prior CT (and diminishing in size on followup CT) has completely resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial BMT Course: Patient with known history of aplastic anemia was admitted for ATG + cyclosporine therapy.
*Aplastic anemia: The patient has aplastic anemia of unknown etiology.
His dose was changed initially to 200 mg PO q12 because of hypertension, tachycardia and developement of spasms, that were thought to be secondary to cylosporin.
His hct was maintained above 25 and plts above 10 with transfusions, though he remained neutropenic, requiring products approximately every 3-4 days.
* H/o of granulomatous disease The patient had a h/o of old granulomatous disease.
At the time of admission, patient did not appear to have active infection by CT scan, but known old granulomatous lesions were seen in the lungs, LN, spleen and liver.
He was continued on isoniazide and pyridoxine for empiric treatment of TB and was to follow-up with ID after discharge regarding when to stop these medications.
* Enterococcus bacteremia: Patient spiked a temperature and was found to have growth of enterococcus sensitive to ampicillan from PICC line on [**1-21**].
Surveillance cultures showed no growth and patient remained afebrile throughout the rest of his BMT stay.
*Hyperkalemia:  Patient became hyperkalemic for several days during his admission.
Was thought to be secondary to cyclosporine.
* Pseudomonas UTI: Patient developed pseudomonas UTI for which he was treated with Ceftazidime for 7 days.
He was treated for this with acyclovir and the lip lesions resolved.
The patient then developed some white spotes in the back of his throat.
These regions were swabbed and showed no growth.
*Bowel edema: Patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pouch secondary to necrotic bowel resection from several months prior.
On [**12-8**] pt had increased edema (the thought was that somehow the bowel edema was exacerbated by his treatment) in his prolapsed bowel.
We were unable to support the bowel with a truss because of fear of strangulating the blood supply to the bowel and making the small areas of necrosis even worse.
He received sugar on bowel to try to osmotically shrink the edema; this was tried 3 times with small improvement.
We felt that it would be advantageous for him to have surgical intervention while in house, in a situation where his medical issues were better controlled rather than to send him to rehab, where potential worsening of his bowel edema would constitute a surgical emergency.
Surgery Course: Patient was taken to the OR on HD31 after all blood and urine infections were resolved as well as abnormal electrolytes issues were under control.
Cyclosporine levels were monitored and increased accordingly.
Patient had a TEE per ID recs to rule out endocarditis which was negative.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for Glucose control.
POD7 CT scan showed dilated R colon and he was febrile to 102.5.
Tx to TSICU on POD9 after started on ambisome and had BP drop.
CT on [**2-15**] showed increased inflammatory changes in R colon, and pt.
[**2-16**] CT also showed similar results.
He will follow up with hem/onc ([**Doctor Last Name 410**]) as an outpatient for repeated transfusions and decision regarding need for further epogen and danazol.
On tele, pt noted to become bradycardic with coughing episodes (likely vagal).
He ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
# HTN: As above, hypertension was exacerbated by cyclosporine.
Later, HCTZ was added with the hope of discontinuing metoprolol, as the patient was noted to have episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia.
HCTZ was d/c as it caused his creatine to rise, and he was discharged on nifedipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol.
Serial CT scans showed gradual improvement of distal colitis.
He then had an isolated fever spike.
At that time a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a possible seminal vesiculitis vs. prostatitis.
Ultrasound revealed no abnormality, so the aspiration procedure was cancelled.
The patient remained afebrile thereafter except for one elevated [**Location (un) 1131**] which revealed nothing on culture or exam.
# Mild Renal Insufficiency: Patient had poor PO intake and was maintained on gentle IVF's for much of his hospital admission.
However, he was encouraged to increase intake and florinef was added to aid in retention of intravascular volume, and Cr was stable at ~1.1.
# Confusion: The patient developed mental status changes while on the surgery service.
ONGOING () as needed for colostomy.
Clotrimazole 10 mg Troche Sig: One (1) Troche Mucous membrane  QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
