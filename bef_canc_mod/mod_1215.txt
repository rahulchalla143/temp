In addition, the patient was recently seen at an outside hospital where a CT showed possible osteomyelitis of the right sternoclavicular joint.
While her O2 saturations improved, the patient continued with an altered mental status.

Although lower lobe opacities have improved from the prior radiograph, the possibility of residual or recurrent infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
Dedicated abdominal radiographs may be helpful to exclude an obstructive process.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, slightly increased.
Increased retrocardiac opacity concerning for worsening atelectasis or infection.
[**8-14**] Duplex Doppler Abd U/S:  Decline in MPV velocity and high distalTIPS velocities concerning for distal stenosis at the TIPS/HV junction.
No acute intracranial process.
Aerosolized secretions and mucosal thickening within the right sphenoid sinus.
[**8-14**] LENI: No DVT of either lower extremity.
[**8-15**] CT R clavicle: 1) Destruction of medial right clavicle with exuberant adjacent callus formation.
The appearance may be post-traumatic, but infection cannot be excluded.
If clinical concern for infection remains, biopsy/aspiration could be performed with CT guidance.
2) Patchy opacification predominantly in right lower lobe incompletely assessed on this examination however appears similar to findings of [**2160-7-4**] and may represent chronic atelectasis with possible infectious/inflammatory process.

# Hyponatremia- Likely secondary to poor PO intake superimposed on chronic hyponatremia in setting of cirrhosis.
Had peaked T waves on EKG and is complaining of myalgias for the past week.
Patient was monitored on telemetry with no cardiac events.
# HCV cirrhosis (c/b ascites, thrombocytopenia, encephelopathy, coagulopathy, s/p TIPS).
Pt is currently not a [**Hospital1 **] candidate due to recurrent infections.
During this hospitalization, patient decompensated and became encephelopathic in the setting of infection (UTI and pneumonia, see below) with a possible contribution from distal stenosis of her TIPS diagnosed on duplex doppler U/S.
She required aggressive lactulose therapy (which she had stopped at home for one week prior to admission) and was transferred to the SICU for management of hypoxia and hypothermia in the setting of encephelopathy.
A Dobhoff was placed in the post-pyloric position for tube feeds as the patient exhibited poor PO intake.
# UTI- Patient grew out VRE in urine and completed a 8 day course of linezolid.
# Pneumonia- Patient became hypoxic and hypothermic one day after admission, though she remained hemodynamically stable.
Leukocytosis to 14.8 with 85% polys.
She was transferred to the SICU where she was empirically treated with zosyn for a possible pneumonia seen on CXR.
# R clavicle fracture- There was some concern for osteomyelitis given the patient's recurrent hip infections.
She was seen by orthopedics and per their recs CT scan was performed which showed a traumatic injury but was inconclusive for infection.
Infectious disease consultants recommended holding treatment for osteomyelitis given the negative biopsy results and low likelihood of osteo.
# Acute renal insufficiency- Patient experienced a short-lived bump in her creatinine to 1.2 from her baseline of 0.8-0.9.
This was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor PO intake despite tube feeds.
Her thrombocytopenia was attributed to baseline poor hepatic function in the setting of cirrhosis with superimposed linezolid related toxicity.
Patient was hemodynamically stable without any bleeding during this hospitalization.
# Hip wound: s/p R hip ORIF in [**2156**], c/b multiple joint/hardware infections and sepsis, spacer inside, wound vac in place.
No signs of active infection.
The wound was evaluated by wound care nursing along with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
They recommended discontinuing the wound vac due to concern for premature closure of the wound with atypical granulation tissue (cauliflower tissue) which could potentially cause collection or abscess formation.
Daily dressing changes with AMD were performed per wound care recs and patient was discharged with instructions to continue this care plan.
# Nutrition- Patient with poor PO intake for past 2-3 weeks prior to admission.
# Diabetes- Patients sugars were up and down given her acute infections.
# Asthma: Stable.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Wound Care For Right Hip Wound:  Daily dressing changes to hip site with AMD (anti-microbial dressing) packing strips into the depth of the wound - this is best achieved with 90 or greater degree flexion of pt's right leg.
Insulin Sliding Scale Please resume lispro sliding scale as previously taking   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 6138**] Home Care Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephelopathy Pneumonia Urinary tract infection  Secondary: Secondary adrenal insufficiency Asthma Diabetes mellitus GERD Depression/Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital because of some abnormalities in your blood chemistries related to your liver disease.
While you were here, you were also diagnosed with a pneumonia and urinary tract infection for which you were treated with antibiotics.
We also performed a biopsy of your sternoclavicular joint to see if there was any infection- these results showed no infection.
While you were in the hospital you were seen by wound care specialists for your right hip wound- they felt that the wound vac was not appropriate for your wound and advised daily dressing changes - we advise that you continue to do this at home.
