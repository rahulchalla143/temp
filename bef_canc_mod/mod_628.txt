He had a cardiac catheterization done on the date of admission, [**1-26**], which showed "normal" coronaries, no mitral regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 45%, with critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of approximately 0.5-0.6 cm squared.
Patient also had diffuse mild hypokinesis.
He was admitted to the Cardiology Service postcatheterization, and was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] with plans to do aortic valve replacement for his congestive heart failure symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation which was new onset.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension.
He did present with a cough and dyspnea and some pleuritic chest pain.
The patient did have some symptoms of orthopnea, but no chest pain at the time.
He was also found to be in congestive heart failure with new onset atrial fibrillation for which he was given Lasix, Coumadin, Heparin, digoxin, and Cardizem for rate control.
The patient continued to be diuresed for congestive heart failure, and he remained on Dr.[**Name (NI) 13610**] service while the patient was diuresed and rate controlled was achieved for atrial fibrillation.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation.
On examination, he had some ankle edema and a little bit of abdominal distention.
He never had dental checkup and this needed to be addressed before the patient could have aortic valve replacement for risk of infecting his biprosthetic valve.
Dental recommended extracting all of his remaining teeth given his periodontal compromise and in his great infectious risk.
He underwent his dental procedure on the 15th, and was monitored for bleeding given his slightly elevated INR.
He remained asymptomatic from his atrial fibrillation.
He continued on diltiazem and digoxin for his rate control of his atrial fibrillation.
Patient continued to have bleeding from his gums which again delayed his surgery, and was recommended that his Lasix be held and his Heparin be discontinued as he would not be able to undergo his surgery until his oral bleeding stopped.
Patient had some blood clots that were loosen and dislodged from his gums.
Early in the morning on the 19th, he was examined again and his bleeding stabilized.
In the evening on the 20th, the patient continued to have some persistent bleeding from his mouth, but was ultimately cleared for surgery, and on [**2-3**], the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a propofol drip.
He had no air leak.
On the 24th, he had no events overnight.
On postoperative day four, he had no events.
Status post aortic valve replacement 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
