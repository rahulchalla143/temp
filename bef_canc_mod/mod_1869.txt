Admission Date:  [**2111-7-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2111-7-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-27**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post recent admit for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure and underwent catheterization with a stent to the left circumflex artery.
Since then, on the day of admission, in the morning, she had an acute episode of shortness of breath and chest pressure.
The patient states that she apparently felt normal last night with no recent fevers, chills.
Patient does complain of a history of a dry cough without any sputum productive.
Patient says she felt similarly during her episode of acute myocardial infarction so she subsequently called EMS.
On arrival, EMS noted that patient to be tachypneic but had a stable oxygen saturation of 98% on a questionable amount of supplemental 02.
The patient was also given 100 mg of intravenous Lasix without further improvement in her oxygenation and her shortness of breath.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management of her acidosis.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2111-6-19**], status post catheterization in [**2111-5-19**] which showed 90% right coronary artery, 40% left anterior descending and 100% mid left circumflex stenosis which was stented and an ejection fraction of 40%.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no documented pulmonary function test on record.
Acute renal failure during recent hospitalization.
Diabetes mellitus for 25 years.
Congestive heart failure secondary to cardiogenic shock.
Ejection fraction of 40% and severe mitral regurgitation.
Neck:  Mildly increased jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the apex.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales or wheezes were appreciated.
Extremities showed no peripheral edema.
After the patient's onset of myocardial infarction, chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube in good position, mild vascular redistribution likely with curly B lines, however, there was no evidence of failure and no infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Renal:  It was felt that the patient had an acidosis of mild anion gap, as well as nongap variety.
Given the fact that the patient was also on antiretrovirals and had been shown to be a culprit at times for this acidosis, they were held for part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course until the lactate level which came back and was normal.
The patient's acute on chronic renal failure continued to resolve with intravenous fluids.
Pulmonary:  There was no defect in oxygenation.
The patient subsequently self-extubated on day two of admission and had stable 02 saturations with minimal supplemental oxygen.
Cardiovascular:  Given the fact that the patient had a similar presentation for her acute myocardial infarction and was known to have a 90% right coronary artery lesion which was not intervened on, the patient was initially started on heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin and continued on her aspirin beta-blocker ACE.
The patient's Lipitor was held because of her elevated CK with a negative MB fraction.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and the intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin were subsequently discontinued.
Patient remained afebrile throughout the hospital course.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes type 2.
Chronic bronchitis.
Spinal stenosis at L4-L5.
Chronic renal failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
