# Respiratory failure: Chest CTA showed no pneumonia or PE.
Lung exam revealed poor aeration bilaterally and diffuse wheezes.
No clinical evidence of heart failure.
The impression was a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a possible pulmonary infection.
# Elevated troponin on admission: on admission his troponin was 0.15 with normal CKMB fraction.
ECG showed some minimal ST elevations in V2-V3 and ST depressions in V3-6 and II.
Cardiology saw the patient in the ED and proposed demand ischemia in the setting a pulmonary process.
Patient never had chest pain.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr.
Most likely prerenal azotemia in setting of pulmonary infection.
# HTN: SBP in 130s-140s.
After his acute renal injury resolved his quinapril was re-started.
