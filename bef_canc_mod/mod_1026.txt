Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-7-15**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, although may have been not as well visualized on prior study (image quality was limited).
Systolic anterior motion of the mitral chordal structures is similar in appearance.

The heart and mediastinal contours are consistent with a post-CABG patient.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than the right.
The lungs are clear with no focal or lobar consolidation.
Pulmonary vasculature is somewhat vague suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right; mild pulmonary vascular congestion; no pneumonia.

She was found to be in atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone.
She was diuresed for volume overload.
An echo showed no evidence of tamponade.
Amiodarone was stopped given that her atrial fibrillation was a chronic condition.
The neurology service was consulted as she had a breif episode of word finding difficulty.
A head CT was not suggestive of an acute hemorrhage or infarct.
Flagyl was started for a question of c. difficile infection.
