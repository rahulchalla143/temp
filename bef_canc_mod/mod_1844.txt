Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 111318**] Admission Date: [**2132-7-17**] Discharge Date: [**2132-7-22**] Date of Birth:  [**2061-5-11**] Sex:  M Service:  MED   Continuation of previous report:  Pneumonia:  Upon admission patient's chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe consolidation.
However, when an endotracheal sample grew out Strep pneumoniae his antibiotic regimen was switched to ceftriaxone.
The following day the sensitivities for this organism were complete and it was found that the Strep pneumoniae was sensitive to penicillin.
This showed a left upper and left lower lobe consolidation with patchy infiltrates consistent with pneumoniae, bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, cirrhosis and findings consistent with portal hypertension.
Acute renal failure:  The patient on presentation had acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.8.
His renal failure was felt to be secondary to his long-standing diabetes and hypertension in the setting of NSAID use, decreased p.o.
intake, dehydration and persistent hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitor use and low blood pressure in the setting of pneumonia/sepsis.
Initially the patient became oliguric making only approximately 5 cc/hour of urine.
However, at the time of this dictation the patient was entering a polyuric phase of ATN with increased urine output.
Acidosis:  The patient had a combination of respiratory and metabolic acidosis at presentation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
His metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to sepsis as evidenced by his elevated lactate greater than 10.
The patient's respiratory acidosis was secondary to hypoventilation in the setting of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given his significant tobacco history.
Lastly, the patient received multiple liters of normal saline infusion and does likely have a non anion gap acidosis from this.
The patient's requirement for pressors was also significantly reduced at the time of this dictation.
Thrombocytopenia:  The patient had a diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia at the time of dictation.
This revealed that he did, indeed, have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 33,000.
The thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to hypersplenism as evidenced on his CT scan.
Atrial fibrillation:  At presentation to the Emergency Room the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
This was felt to be secondary to increased cardiac output demand in the setting of infection.
He was not anticoagulated given his increased bleeding risk secondary to likely esophageal varices.
In addition, this was his first episode of atrial fibrillation and it was felt that the factors contributing to this event were resolving.
Coagulopathy:  The patient had an elevated INR at the time of presentation.
This was thought to be secondary to his liver disease.
Given his liver disease an abdominal ultrasound was obtained.
Signs of portal hypertension with a markedly enlarged spleen containing a small cyst.
The patient was also found to have a distended gallbladder containing a large stone but no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Lastly, there was a very abnormal liver with focal areas of mass light configuration particularly evident within the left lobe lateral segment where there was a five times 5 cm apparent mass.
These were just minimally elevated above normal.
Possible etiologies included sedation, tachybrady syndrome given his recent history of atrial fibrillation, slow heart rate secondary to sepsis, some [**Last Name **] problem with his conduction system such as endocarditis or abscess.
At the time of this dictation the plan was to wean his sedation and to start the patient back on dopamine as this may help his heart rate.
