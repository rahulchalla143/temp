GI Bleed: Patient presented with profuse bleeding into his ostomy bag.
The rapid transfusion protocol was activated and he received a total of 5 units pRBCs.
A colonoscopy and EGD were performed and revealed nonbleeding diverticulosis of the ascending colon and angioectasias in the stomach body at the lesser curvature, respectively.
Gout: patient was noted to have bilateral knee effusions on [**10-27**].
Joint fluid analysis of the left knee showed findings consistent with gout.
Given his recent GI bleed, he did not receive NSAIDs for this condition.
Left calf pain: Several days into his hospitalization the patient developed left lower extremity pain on the posterior aspect of his left calf.
No swelling or erythema was appreciated on physical examination.
A lower extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of a DVT.
The patient was offered Oxycodone for pain control.
His pain improved throughout his hospitalization and he was weaned from his Oxycodone.
Congestive Heart Failure (EF 20-25%): Patient required aggressive intravenous hydration and [**Date Range **] products on presentation.
The patient remained euvolemic on exam despite the aggressive volume repletion.
Decubitus Ulcer: Pressure ulcer was noted on coccyx and intergluteal fold.
Wound care consult was obtained and suggested cleansing ulcer with wound cleanser and covering with mepilex.
CAD s/p CABG: The patient's ASA and Metoprolol were held on admission due to the patient's bleed.
Of note, it would likely be worthwhile to consider placing the patient on a different statin given the recent concerns associated with high-dose Simvastatin.
