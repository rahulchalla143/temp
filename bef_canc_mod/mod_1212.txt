There are splenic arterial calcifications.
Enteric contrast has been administered via that tube for this study.
There is marked dilatation of the proximal small bowel, to a greater extent than on the prior study.
More distally there are several segments of irregular narrowing, accompanied by wall thickening of the small bowel.
These abnormal segments are mostly within or immediately above the pelvis, particularly near the residual rectum.
The proximal residual colon is only mildly distended, and more distally, is almost collapsed near the colostomy site.
Although contrast passes freely throughout, the appearance of proximal small bowel dilatation, worse than before, suggests either a low- grade obstruction, perhaps related to segments of abnormally thickened distal small bowel, or an ileus.
There are multiple enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, which are unchanged.
As none of these is over 12 cm in shortest dimension, however, these may be reactive, but metastatic disease is also possible.
There are vascular calcifications in the aorta with mild distal fusiform dilatation up to 2.9 cm at the aortic bifurcation.
There is no free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a persistent collection of fluid in the presacral space of intermediate density with a smooth enhancing wall.
The collection contains air, which suggests a fistulous connection to adjacent bowel or may be due to abscess formation.
There is also enteric contrast which has passed into the residual rectum, which outlines the convex contour of an apparent endoluminal mass more distally.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Increased dilatation of the proximal small bowel, with areas of narrowing and wall thickening in the more distal small bowel.
Proximal dilatation may be due to an ileus or low-grade obstruction, although contrast passes freely throughout.
Residual rectum with an overall similar appearance, including marked thickening and apparently an endoluminal mass.
There is also air and fluid more distally.
Persistent presacral fluid collection with enhancing rim.
The presence of air within the collection also suggests fistulous connection to adjacent bowel, or may be due to abscess formation.
Mild lymphadenopathy, which could be either metastatic or reactive.
Operative Note:  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid with a question of an enterorectal fistula.
INDICATIONS:  The patient presented with massive weight loss and total obstruction of her rectum which may have been due to a pelvic abscess which was not seen early on.
We could not get a histologic diagnosis and at the first operation I did not think that I could extirpate the rectum very well, and so we did an end sigmoid colostomy and treated her with radiation and chemotherapy.
She had 2 recurrent pelvic abscess which we believed probably was the result of an enterorectal fistula.
At the time of surgery, we were able to take down the enterorectal fistula and close the enterotomy and then do a low anterior resection, takedown the colostomy and resect it and then do an anastomosis and then because of the situation with the previous radiation then do a protected colostomy.
We excised the old incision and actually carried this higher on the abdominal wall, entering the abdomen cleanly.
The liver had no disease.
Attention was then turned to lysing all of the adhesions in the small bowel until we actually had a totally free small bowel and this was carried out without difficulty.
We then started dissecting the rectum which we did by grasping the rectum with 3-0 silk sutures, getting behind it, freeing it up from the left ureter which was clearly seen and was intact and there was no hematuria and then gradually working our way down and doing a total mesenteric excision, getting below the entrance of the fistula into the rectum and then finally well below the sacral curve.
Irrigation of the rectum revealed that it was entirely open at this point up into the point of the obstruction which the area of radiation at the bottom of which was the enterorectal fistula, the most distal.
After we saw that we could get a reasonable length of rectum up to do the anastomosis, we took down the colostomy which had a pericolostomy hernia and then transected it with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] stapler and then anastomosed it with 2 layers of 4-0 silk, initially by using the rectum as a handle, but then dealing with the front and taking it off and then getting a very nice 2-layer 4-0 silk interrupted anastomosis.
The rectal tube had been removed and we then changed gowns and gloves and closed the site of the colostomy which had a pericolostomy hernia and then prepared the transverse colostomy by getting a quarter inch Penrose drain under the transverse colon.
We then changed gowns and gloves to closure kit and closed the peritoneum, put the Penrose drain which had a tie around it in the peritoneum, irrigated the peritoneum, checked for the nasogastric tube, checked for bleeding which there was very little and then closed the peritoneum with #1 chromic catgut.
The paramedian incision was then closed as a lateral paramedian incision taking the freed up muscle and placing it in the midline and then #1 Vicryl on the fascia.
After the fascia was closed, we then made a transverse incision over the right rectus, split the rectus and then brought up a loop of colon through the previous identified colon through and put a bridge underneath.
She was slightly acidotic so she was left on the ventilator.
Two sponge counts, needle counts and instrument counts were reported as correct by the nursing in charge.
Her WBC was found to be elevated at 21.7.
An abdominal/pelvic CT scan showed increased dilatation of the proximal small bowel, with areas of narrowing and wall thickening in the more distal small bowel; residual rectum with intraluminal mass; implied fistulous connection from residual rectum to the small bowel; persistent presacral fluid collection with enhancing rim; and mild lymphadenopathy (see pertinent results).
A chest xray was obtained which was negative for acute process or effusion(see pertinent results).
She was admitted to the surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] for questionable obstructive process and presacral fluid collection.
Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl were started for empiric coverage.
She was taken to interventional radiology for CT-guided aspiration of the presacral fluid collection which revealed 30-40ml of purulent, then serosanguinous drainage.
A sample of the drainage was sent for culture.
At HD 5 her abdomen remained distended with question of continued obstructive process.
She denied pain or vomiting.
Her WBC count was elevated at 20.2 and a repeat abscess culture was sent from the pigtail.
She ctoninued to has gas and stool from her ostomy an her pigtail continued to drain 25 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
On POD 5, she continued to be afebrile and stable.
Her antibiotics were continued and her pigtail continued to have minimal output.
Her metoprolol was increased for an elevated heart rate.
She remained afebrile and her tube feeds advanced to 70 cc/hr cycled overnight with non-generic imodium.
Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] greater than 101.5, nausea/vomiting, inability to eat, wound redness/warmth/swelling/foul smelling drainage, abdominal pain not controlled by pain medications or any other concerns.
