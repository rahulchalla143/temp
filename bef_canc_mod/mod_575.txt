Pertinent Results: EGD: [**2178-12-27**] Esophagus: -Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to 40cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 42cm from the incisors.
Stomach: -Mucosa: Patchy erythema, granularity and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the antrum and fundus.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
-Flat Lesions: A few small angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the stomach body.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
-Other: There was no blood seen in the stomach or duodenum.
IMPRESSIONS: Small hiatal hernia Angioectasias in the stomach body (thermal therapy) Erythema, granularity and congestion in the antrum and fundus compatible with gastritis There was no blood seen in the stomach or duodenum.
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-4-29**], the degrees of tricuspid regurgitation and aortic stenosis have increased slightly.
CXR [**12-29**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac silhouette is somewhat more prominent, given that this represents a PA rather than AP view.
There is also increased prominence and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
No definite acute pneumonia.
MRSA screen negative  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with medical history pertinent for afib, CAD, Chronic Diastolic CHF who presented with lethargy and GI Bleed.
GI Bleed, upper: Patient presented with Hct drop and melena in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
EGD revealing for angiodysplasia although no stigmata of recent bleeding as well as gastritis.
Patient received 4U PRBC total, stable Hct without additional transfusion, INR reversed on admission.
ICU team deferred MRI given low suspicion for stroke or TIA on presentation in setting of supratherapeutic INR and alternative explanation.
Afib with Bradycardia: Patient has known afib and per discussion with her daughter has persistently had heart rates in the 30s to 40s.
Patients declining of interventions seems to be in keeping with past history including declining further evaluation of possible recurrent melanoma in [**2174**].
Patient was monitored on telemetry, and no betablockers or calcium channel blockers were given.
Hypoxemia: On transfer out of the ICU, there was some concern that patient may have a new oxygen requirement.
Does have occas [**Year (4 digits) **], but clinically not c/w bacterial pneumonia; possibly viral.
This was thought due to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and patient was resumed on Lasix.
Pt remained without fevers or SOB.
CAD, native vessel: Patient with indeterminant Trop x 2, ruled out for MI during admission.
No chest pain.
- hold Aspirin until [**2179-1-1**] as above - no beta-blocker given bradycardia - continue ACE and Statin .
Patient received 4 units of blood, and at time of transfer from ICU to the floor, pt was noted to have mild oxygen requirement and CXR c/w mild overload.
Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage III: Stable - stable .
