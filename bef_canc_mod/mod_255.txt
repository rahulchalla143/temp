Her endurance remains poor, and she continues to experience exertional dyspnea.
The head of her bed remains elevated at all times to prevent aspiration.
** Per cardiology, she is unable to tolerate dabigatran, and she cannot have a TEE because of her esophageal issues.
Given mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with worsening PA pressures, she was admitted for cardiac cath today and found to have clean coronaries.

Final Report INDICATION: 80-year-old woman, status post mitral and tricuspid valve repair, with now right-sided weakness and lethargy.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, or mass effect.
A new relatively well-defined hypodense region in the medial left frontal lobe, in the ACA territory, is consistent with an acute infarction.
A tiny focus of hyperdensity in the parasagittal frontal location (2:8) may represent a focal "hyperdense ACA" with intramural thrombus versus plaque.
No intracranial hemorrhage is detected.
There is mild mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
No rightward shift of midline structures is seen.
IMPRESSION: Acute left ACA territory infarct, with possible focal hyperdensity in the A2/A3 segment of the left ACA, which may represent in situ thrombus versus embolized atheromatous plaque (or other material).
TECHNIQUE: MRI and MRA of the head was obtained without contrast and MRA of the neck was obtained before and after administration of contrast per department protocol.
FINDINGS:  MRI HEAD: There is an area of slow diffusion in the left frontal lobe extending into the corpus callosum with accompanying FLAIR signal abnormality.
There is no signal abnormality on the gradient echo images to suggest hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
The major intracranial flow voids appear preserved.
A 6mm size T1 hyperintense lesion is noted within the anterior pituitary.
Visualized orbits and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
Bilateral internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar arteries are patent with no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, dissection or aneurysm formation.
Bilateral common carotid arteries, vertebral arteries in the neck and internal carotid arteries are patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection or pseudoaneurysm formation.
Left A2 occlusion with early subacute infarct in the left ACA territory as described above.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
6mm size T1 hyperintense lesion is noted within the anterior pituitary, may represent a Rathke cleft cyst, and less likely hemorrhagic adenoma.
No mass/thrombus seen in the left or right atrium, but this study is not adequate to fully exclude atrial/atrial appendage thrombus ((ie atrial appendages not well visualized).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricular apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened without aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
No mitral regurgitation is seen, though cannot exclude fully due to acoustic shadowing from the ring.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic tricuspid regurgitation is seen, though may be underestimated due to shadowing.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severely reduced global systolic function of the left and right ventricle.
Mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty rings present.
No mass or thrombi seen in the atria, though cannot fully exclude by transthoracic echocardiography.
Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
If suspicion for atrial thrombus is high, consideration can be given to other imaging studies (eg cardiac MRI, CT), as the patient is unable to undergo TEE.
[**2153-3-25**] RUQ ultrasound  Final Report INDICATION: 80-year-old woman with increasing LFTs, assess for portal vein thrombus.
The liver is normal in echotexture without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Small amount of sludge is seen in the gallbladder which is otherwise unremarkable in appearance without wall thickening, distention or pericholecystic fluid to suggest cholecystitis.
Trace perihepatic ascites is seen.
Patent portal vein without evidence of thrombus.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
Head CT revealed left ACA infarct.
EEG was instituted to assess for seizure activity.
Infarct was followed on CT to evaluate for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of anti-coagulation for atrial fibrillation.
RUQ ultrasound did not reveal acute findings.
She remained in the CVICU for close observation of airway protection in the setting of her infarct and rhoncherous secretions.
Current clinical picture is consistent with Left ACA infarct likely due to embolic etiology and exam shows profound abulia with a right hemiparesis.
