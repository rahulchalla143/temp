There are new moderate right and tiny left pleural effusions with adjacent relaxation atelectasis.
No nodules seen in the visualized lung bases.
The non-enhanced liver demonstrates a tiny 5-mm hypodensity along the left dome of the liver (2:10), too small to accurately characterize.
No gallbladder is seen probably due to prior surgical removal.
The nonenhancing spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, left kidney, and the non-opacified stomach and small bowel appear unremarkable.
Again note is made of extensive colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is very abnormal appearance to the right kidney which is expanded and demonstrates heterogeneous appearance with multiple densities.
Areas of high density likely represent subcapsular and intraparenchymal acute hemorrhage.
There is also extracapsular extension of the hemorrhage from the lower pole of the right kidney into the perinephric space which is expanded and causes mass effect on the adjacent IVC and duodenum.
No nephrolithiasis and no definite hydronephrosis is noted.
The abdominal aorta contains mural calcifications as well as mural calcifications along the origin of the major abdominal arteries, without aneurysmal dilatation.
No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting size criteria for adenopathy.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
No pelvic fluid, free air, or adenopathy is noted.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted along the visualized thoracolumbar spine, particularly noted at the L2-3 and L5-S1 levels which causes some narrowing of the spinal canal.
No region of bony destruction is seen concerning for malignancy.
Degenerative changes are also noted at the sacroiliac joints and the hips.
Markedly abnormal right kidney, with likely subcapsular and intraparenchymal acute hemorrhage.
There is marked heterogeneous appearance to the kidney, making delineation of the parenchyma difficult.
No stone or hydronephrosis seen.
Etiology indeterminate; possibilities include trauma, underlying mass (not previously seen in [**2188**]), or AV malformation.
Preexisting small upper pole mass (cf.
Increased size of right upper pole nodule from 12 to now 22 mm since [**2188-6-19**].
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF, and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**] found to have retroperitoneal hemorrhage possibly from renal cyst, transferred to ICU on day of admission for hypoxia, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure with ATN requiring HD, and concern for ACS.
On day 1 of admission the patient triggered for an episode of guaic positive emesis and hypoxia to the 80's.
This was thought to be post-tussive emesis with aspiration.
He was started on an 8 day course of azithryomycin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone to cover for community acquired pneumonia and culture positive Klebsiella pneumonia.
By the time he arrived to the ICU his CXR also showed signs of volume overload.
For volume overload, caused by aggressive IVF and blood procduct resucitation, diuresis was attempted, but he developed an oliguric renal failure in the setting of his hypotension and was unable to produce sufficient UOP for diuresis.
He was started on CVVH given his hypotension which was complicated by numerous filter clottings.
(#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.
Shortly afterwards, his GI secretions cleared.
He was started on [**Hospital1 **] ppi and required no further intervention.
(#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Pt initially presented with R flank pain, CT scan noted right retroperitoneal bleed possibly from renal cyst rupture.
Coumadin was reversed with FFP, but given worsening renal failure repeat CT was obtained which showed enlarging of the hematoma.
Following which his Hct remained generally stable although lower than baeline thought to be precipitated by overphlebotomization and poor hematopoesis in the setting of pneumonia and renal failure.
(#) Acute renal failure on Chronic Kidney Injury: He has history of chronic renal funciton with baselin creatinine likely in mid 2s, which was abruptly worsened in the setting of hypotension and he developed oliguric ATN.
With conversion of ATN to non-oliguric variety, HD was held to observe return of renal function.
(#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  He was noted to have a Klebsiella pneumonia (pansensitive) treated with ceftriaxone and pan sensitive Enterococcus UTI treated with Vancomycin.
All blood cultures were negative, although he was noted to have a pyogenic skin/line infection at the site of central LIJ.
# CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2188**] echo): Pt reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain.
Known systolic dysfunction although LVEF in [**2188**] >55%.
ECHO was repeated given concern of change in heart failure in setting of possible MI, which showed EF of 35%.
#Atrial fibrillation: Pt had history of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2186**] (defibrillated 1x).
During this hospitalization he had several episodes of wide complex afib (confimred by EP).
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 805**] of [**Last Name (un) **] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for kidney disease .
Home diovan was held given his changing renal function.
#Gout: The patient was continued on home dose of  alloprunol, adjusted dose given changing renal fucntion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Medical Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: retroperitoneal hemorrhage Aspiration pneumonia Acute renal failure Acute tubular necrosis Acute systolic heart failure  Secondary: Chronic renal insufficiency Atrial fibrillation Congestive heart failure Diabetes Type II CABG   Discharge Condition: Stable, Afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-10-30**] for sudden onset right flank pain.
A CT scan showed bleeding in the right kidney.
You developed a pneumonia and were treated with a course of antibiotics.
There was a concern that you may be having a heart attack although the blood tests were negative for this.
Stop Symlin (discuss this with your primary care doctor) Weight yourself each morning and if weight increases >3 pounds contact MD.
Please return to the emergency department for fever, chills, shortness of breath, or worsening symptoms.
