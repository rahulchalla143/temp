Our patient was at home in her usual state of health while she developed epigastric pain while straining during a bowel movement.
Of note she has a history of a similar admission with hyperkalemia and bradycardia in [**9-28**], which was treated with dialysis.
On arrival to floor, patient states that abdominal pain has improved.
She has not been on Coumadin until very recently due to history of upper GI bleeding.
On [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and shortness of breath in the  setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hyperkalemia.
She was treated for hyperkalemia and subsequently  her atrial flutter was converted to sinus rhythm.
Myocardial infarction was [**Hospital1 20003**] out based EKG and biomarkers.
Thereafter, she underwent right-sided isthmus ablation of clockwise atrial flutter, and was started on quinidine and Coumadin.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to IgA nephropathy.
History of upper GI bleeding on [**2195-2-20**] with evidence of esophagitis, gastric ulcer, and bleeding duodenal vessel.
Repeated endoscopy in [**2195-4-21**] revealed mild inflammation and healing ulcer.
She has not had any recurrent episodes of GI bleeding since then.
Diastolic heart failure supported by an echocardiography from  [**2195-12-21**].
History of malignant hypertension, which was complicated by seizure on [**2193-5-20**].
Rheumatic fever in childhood .
Social History: She is single, lives by herself in [**Location (un) 686**], and has no children.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

EKG:Sinus bradycardia with pauses and junctional escape beats.
Possible blocked premature atrial contractions.
Also, evidence for retrograde conduction in lead V1.
Tall T waves suggesting hyperkalemia.
Probable anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-10-4**] sinus bradycardia, first degree A-V block, junctional beats and tall peaked T waves are new.

# Hyperkalemia: Secondary to ESRD.
She has a history of hyperkalemic episodes in the past, that required MICU admission and emergent dialysis.
K was 7.6 at admission and EKG showed peaked T waves and first-second degree AV block with junctional escape rhythm.
This was due to diet in the setting of oliguria, and less likely due to ACEi.
# Bradycardia: Sinus bradycardia with 1st degree AV delay with junctional escape beats.
The most likely cause was beta-blocker toxicity in setting of worsening CRI.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt in sinus rhythm.
# Epigastric pain: Ddx included anginal equivalent/CAD vs viral gastroenteritis vs renal failure vs gastritis.
EKG with no ischemic changes.
Pain improved spontaneously.
# ESRD on HD: secondary to IgA nephropathy, s/p failed transplant.
# HTN:  Normotensive.
D/Ced metoprolol for toxicity with ESRD that caused bradycardia.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: hyperkalemia bradycardia secondary to beta-blockers  secondary: atrial fibrillation chronic diastolic CHF   Discharge Condition: good condition post-hemodialysis with stable vital signs   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you.
You were admitted for hyperkalemia (elevated potassium) due to your kidney disease.
You also had low heart rate and blood rate due to metoprolol, which does not get cleared as well by your kidneys.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  Please seek medical attention if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or any new symptoms.
