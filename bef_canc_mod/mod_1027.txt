He received NS and was noted to have a palpable pulse upon arrival to the ED.
Neurology was consulted and found him unresponsive to painful stimuli without DTR and with only minimal brainstem reflexes.
He received a CT scan showing a cavernoma but no [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white blurring or edema and received an EEG showing overall flattening w/ occasional spiking patterns correlating with his myoclonic jerks.
He was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further managment of his respiratory and neurologic issues.
Past Medical History: - Laryngeal SCC (S/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16859**] [**2158-10-11**] and total laryngectomy [**Month (only) **] [**2159**]) - PPD positive - IVDU - R wrist infection (S/P osteotomy/tendon excision/tenosynovectomy) - DM - NSTEMI [**3-13**] sepsis (normal cath) - PCP pneumonia [**Name Initial (PRE) **] MRSA bacteremia - Fe deficiency anemia - Cardiomyopathy (EF=50%, nl cath) - Hypothyroidism - Chronic pain (on methadone)  Social History: Born in [**Country 532**], emigrated 25 [**Country 1686**] ago, speaks English, difficulty communicating secondary to speech loss, uses voice box, Lives in [**Location **] with wife, Smoking > 80pk [**Name2 (NI) 1686**], quit one yr ago, no ETOH.

Family History: Father died of gastric cancer at 56; Mother died of lung cancer at 60; mother with history of DVT  Physical Exam: 117/62, 87, 18, 96% Gen: [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] lying in bed, unresponsive and intermittantly jerking HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, MMM, O/P clear CV: RRR, S1/S2 wnl, -M/R/G Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abd: Benign Ext: Venous stasis changes and ulcers bilaterally Neuro: No glabellar/corneal/gag reflex, no appreciable peripheral reflexes, pupils reactive to light, no response to painful stimuli, generalized myoclonic jerks approximately 10x/minute  Pertinent Results: CT Scan: 7 mm hyperdense focus in left frontal lobe white matter with no surrounding edema.
This may represent a cavernoma although a focus of hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
EEG: Overall volatage attenuation with superimposed beta activity likely from medications (benzos); as well there are high amplitude electrographic discharges [**Doctor First Name **] 30s associated with myoclonic activity.

Anoxic brain injury: The pt was seen to have myoclonic jerks in the ED and had an EEG showing generalized flattening with occasional spikes temporally correlated with his myoclonic jerks.
