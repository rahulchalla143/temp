She was sent from rehab to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for HD due to her current diarrhea from c.diff colitis and concerns about her volume status.
She received 2 L total IVF in ED with minimal response.
Allergies: Aspirin / Aleve / Codeine / Depakote  Past Medical History: * Chronic Gastric Angiodysplasia (GAVE)and consequent chronic low-grade UGIB, and has therefore been advised not to take aspirin or other antiplatelet agents.
* DM type II: c/b nephropathy and neuropathy - currently not on diabetic meds, has hypoglyemia [**12-27**] poor nutritional stores * ESRD: HD MWF has fistula L arm * CAD * CHF, R-sided, diastolic EF 50-55% with 4+ TR 2+ MR [**8-/2155**] TTE * Anemia: multifactorial (ESRD + iron deficiency [**12-27**] GIB) * colon polyps (hyperplastic) [**7-/2153**] colonoscopy * gastritis and duodenitis [**7-/2153**] EGD * gout * pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis [**8-/2153**] negative cytology,  .
No ETOH, tobacco, or drugs.
No HSM or tenderness.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
A secundum type atrial septal defect is present.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT abdomen and pelvis - CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate-to-large left effusion, simple in attenuation, increased in volume from the prior study.
There is a small right pleural effusion, also increased since the prior exam.
There is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
There are coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the aortic valve.
The known enlarged common bile duct is not well assessed on this examination.
There is no hydronephrosis.
A moderate amount of ascites is again seen.
There is no free intra-abdominal air.
There is circumferential wall thickening of the colon, most marked from the cecum through the hepatic flexure.
Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and appearance, without evidence of obstruction.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is extensive subcutaneous edema bilaterally, similar to that seen on the prior study.
A 2.4 x 1.3 cm nodule is seen in the subcutaneous fat of the left lower abdomen, possibly related to an injection.
There is a moderate-to- large amount of free pelvic fluid, slightly increased from the prior exam.
No enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are seen.
No suspicious osseous lesions are detected.
Interim development of circumferential wall thickening of the colon, most pronounced in the cecum through the hepatic flexure.
While infectious/inflammatory colitis such as C. Diff remain in the differential, ischemic colitis is of concern, given the vascular distribution of the findings (right sided predominance and elevated lactate) .
No free air, portal venous gas or obstruction.
Known enlargement of the common bile duct is not well assessed on this study.
Atrophic kidneys.
Moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal vasculature.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo F with DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, CHF w/ RV failure, c.diff colitis and persistent diarrhea admitted for hypotension, also noted to be persistently hypoglycemic.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] encephalopathy while on floor, contributing to hypoglycemia and aggitation.
# Hypotension:  Coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia and hypotension was concerning for sepsis.
There was also likely component of hypovolemia in setting of diarrhea and poor POs.
She as weaned off of neo, but continue to have intermittent low blood pressures to the high 80's and 90's.
This is likely secondary to her c.diff infection.
For several dialysis sessions, she was unable to have a high enough BP for adequate fluid removal, but BPs started to improve and patient was tolerated dialysis with approx 2-3L removal per session.
When transferred to the floor, patient had moderately low BPs while she was in aflutter/afib.
# Atial tachycardia: Intermittent bursts of atrial tachycardia - afib vs. aflutter.
She was noted to have several runs of asymptomatic NSVT to about 10 beats while on telemetry.
# Encephalopathy - likely related to toxic metabolite buildup, probably hepatic failure is biggest contributor.
Likely has depression contributing at some level, too.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt has history of diabetes, but is no longer on any diabetic meds because of these low blood sugars.
Is likely due to poor nutritional stores in setting of hepatic failure with poor gluconeogenesis.
Endocrinology was consulted during previous admission and did not feel insulinoma was a possibility.
C peptide was likely only elevated because it is renally cleared.
She became hyponatremic at that time.
Her hyponatremia also resolved.
# ESRD/HD: On HD MWF.
# Thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: Initially ther was concern for DIC.
She does not have any active signs of bleeding and has stable anemia with a hemoglobin between 8 and 9. .
# Hyperbilirubinimia: Thought to be associated with congestive hepatopathy from RV hypokinesis.
We monitored her liver functions were showed increasing bilirubin.
Her belly exam remained intermittently tight and distended, worsening at time, but improves often after dialysis.
# Peripheral Vascular Disease - the patient developed what appears to be arterial ulcers on her Bilateral big toes.
They do not seem infected, but she has symptoms of pain in her heels, occassionally her hands.
We tried to control her pain with oxycodone, but patient refusing narcotic meds.
# C.diff - was admitted with a c.diff infection.
Is now on keppra for siezure prophylaxis.
# Pleural effusions - patient has a stable pleural effusion, unknown etiology.
There has been a question of possible lymphoma seen on prior imaging studies, but no diagnosis has been made.
# Deconditioning - has been in and out of the hosptial since about [**Month (only) 956**], does not get out of bed much.
# Code - patient is now DNR/DNI as CPR is not medically indicated in her case.
Hypotension 2.
Altered mental status secondary to multiorgan failure 4.
Right heart failure 7.
Peripheral Vascular disease 8.
Somewhat delerious, but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Continues to have mild diarrhea 2-4x a day.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for low blood pressures after a dialysis session.
We had a difficult time removing fluids from your body during dialysis while you had this low blood pressure.
You were treated for a possible infection with strong antibiotics.
None of the cultures came back, so we do not know if there was an infection causing you to have these low pressures.
These pressures also affected your mental status.
Some days you were very delerious from having low pressures and having toxic metabolic buildup in your blood from your multiorgan failure.
It causes chronic diarrhea.
We treated you with anitbiotics called vanco and flagyl, both of which are taken by mouth.
You also had heart problems during this hospitalization.
You also had some problems keeping you blood sugars high enough, especially on days when you were confused and not eating well.
You should come back to the hospital for any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, or other concerns.
