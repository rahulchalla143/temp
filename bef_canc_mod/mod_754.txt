Admission Date:  [**2132-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-3-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix  Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Diuresis   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/3VD CAD, CHF, severe MR, and mild AS who opresented with shortness of breath.
The night prior to admission, she became short of breath at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, and was given Lasix 60 mg po,  NTG paste, and morphine, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
NSTEMI [**9-11**], hospitalization complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and intubation and NSVT.
CHF: Baseline 2 pillow orthopnea, chronic intermittent LE edema.
Numerous admissions for flash pulmonary edema.
HTN 5.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at both bases, R>L, with rales [**2-10**] way up bilaterally.
Left atrial abnormality.
Old inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Old anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
CHF:  This admission was felt to be consistent with the patient's prior admissions for pulmonary edema, with a CXR on admission c/w frank congestive heart failure.
She was slightly hypotensive after that (systolics in the 80s) and was placed on dopamine for a day (the hypotension was felt to be secondary to aggressive diuresis.)
The evening of [**2132-3-27**], she became acutely short of breath, tachypneic to 34 and with O2 sat 92% on room air (earlier in the day had been 98% on room air).
Because of her severe mitral regurgitation, she was also begun on a nitrate, Imdur 30 mg po qd, which should be given at night because her ACE should be given in the morning.
She was also changed to twice daily dosing of her Lasix (as it seemed that her shortness of breath episodes have been occurring at night.)
CAD:  Her troponin was mildly elevated on admission, but was not as high as it has been in the past, and she had no worrisome EKG changes.
It was not felt that her episodes of pulmonary edema are related to ischemia.
Her CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity, and she was begun on Levaquin for a 7 day course (renally dosed at 250 mg daily).
She realizes that with her significant CHF and MR, these episodes will become more frequent, and that she will likely come to a point where she doesn't want to be intubated again, if even for a short time.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulized treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: CHF CAD Mitral Regurgitation Pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: We have changed around some of your medications.
If you become short of breath again, your doctor should give you Lasix 60 mg IV as this will work faster than po, and you respond very well to this medication and dose.
