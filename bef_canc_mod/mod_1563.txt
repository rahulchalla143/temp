Admission Date:  [**2189-1-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-1-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-11-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old female who is well-known to the [**Hospital **] Community Health Center, is mentally retarded, has diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, a history of ETOH abuse who presented to her PCP on the day of admission complaining of 2 weeks of cough and lethargy.
She was found to have a BP of 60/palp and difficulty ambulating.
She was brought by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 18**]-ED where her BP was noted to be 73/56, and she was noted to be in possible atrial flutter on EKG.
She complained of a mild cough but no sputum.
She denied dysuria, urinary frequency, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Mental retardation diagnosed in [**2167**] with no formal evaluation by psych or neuro.
Chronic active hepatitis B.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Ethics is involved but there is no healthcare proxy.
GENERAL:  A frail, elderly female, lying in bed, no acute distress.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
Mild discomfort in the right upper quadrant.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema bilateral lower extremities, warm, 2+ DP pulse left, 1+ DP pulse right.
Very slow finger-to-nose.
An EKG showed AFIB versus AFLUTTER versus MAT at 150 beats per minute which converted to normal sinus at 75 after diltiazem, with a normal axis, no Q waves, and no acute ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray initially showed mild CHF with left lung base patchy atelectasis, no pneumothorax, no effusions, no consolidations.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed coarse liver echo texture, no masses, no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no free fluid in the abdomen.
There was gallbladder wall thickening but this was not consistent with acute cholecystitis.
It was consistent with cirrhosis.
She also had an elevated white count, elevated lactate, and was hypotensive.
She was essentially afebrile throughout, never really showing any signs of infection.
A follow-up chest x-ray was read as left lower lobe consolidation, could be consistent with pneumonia, though the patient did not have other signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
The patient presented with what sounded like a viral syndrome, initially a chest x-ray without signs of pneumonia.
It is possible that burgeoning pneumonia brought her in and it developed over several days radiographically.
It is also possible that this left lower lobe consolidation is atelectasis and that she never had a bacterial pneumonia.
2) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's baseline creatinine noted to be 1.0.
This was felt simply due to hypotension and volume depletion.
3) TACHYCARDIA:  On presentation, the patient was in a SVT felt to be atrial flutter versus atrial fib versus multifocal atrial tachycardia.
This was felt probably the result rather than the cause of her hypotension.
4) ELEVATED LFTS:  The patient has a history of ETOH abuse, hepatitis B and known cirrhosis.
When she presented, her LFTs were elevated and they consistently trended down over the course of her stay.
The right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no signs of cholecystitis, and there were no clinical signs of cholangitis.
Also of note, the patient's INR appears at baseline to be slightly elevated likely due to decreased hepatic function combined with perhaps poor nutritional intake.
6) DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient is diet controlled at home.
This was likely due to fluid shifts rather than to any acute blood loss.
There were no signs of bleeding at any time.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To either extended care facility or homeless services.
You should contact your primary doctor, or come to the ED with any fever, chills, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
Sepsis or hypovolemia.
Atrial flutter.
Acute renal failure, now resolved.
Possible pneumonia versus atelectasis.
