The patient had been complaining of the neck pain over the past several weeks with radiation down his mid back.
The patient denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
The patient's last bowel movement was on the day prior to admission and there was no blood in the stool.
Although, denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or mental status changes.
In the emergency department, the patient was given 4 liters of normal saline, and was found to have hyperkalemia as well as acute renal failure.
The patient developed chest pain following an abdominal CT scan in the emergency department, but EKG showed no changes.
Chest pain resolved spontaneously without intervention.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2099**] and right coronary artery stent for a 95 percent lesion.
Left uretero-ileal anastomosis stricture.
HEENT:  Reveals pupils equally reactive and round to light with no sclera icterus and dry mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular exam, regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
Abdominal exam: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds and stool with OB negative.
Extremities, no lower extremity edema and no rashes.
There is no point tenderness over the spine.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission showed him a hematocrit of 26.9 down from his baseline of 40, his potassium is elevated at 6.6, his creatinine is elevated at 2.3 from his baseline 0.9, lactate is 0.5, CK is 21, troponin is 0.05.
Chest x-ray shows no CHF or infiltrate.
Abdominal CT scan shows stable abdominal aortic aneurysm with no evidence of leak.
There is a non obstructing left renal calculus and there is ileal loop diversion of the right aorta.
Renal ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney and moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney with a distended bladder.
The Foley was flushed and there was no evidence of hydronephrosis following flush of the Foley and urination of two liters of fluid.
UA shows no bacteria and 0-2 white blood cells with negative nitrates and negative leucocyte Estrace.
There are ST elevations in V2 through V5, which purpose on previous EKG of [**2102-2-20**].
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test to evaluate for renal insufficiency was within normal limits.
Due to concern for sepsis, the patient was started on antibiotics, although there was no evidence for an infection.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
Stools were guaiac negative and iron studies showed normal iron and low TIBC.
Abdominal CT scan showed no leak or rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and there was no retroperitoneal bleed.
There was no evidence for DIC.
It is believed that his vitamin B12 deficiency is due to the removal of his terminal ileum to make the neobladder.
Acidosis improved with bicarbonate drip and volume resuscitation.
Following discussion with urology, it was determined that neobladder obstruction was an important cause for his non anion gap metabolic acidosis.
The mucosa of the ilium has a tendency to excrete bicarbonate.
The patient's acidosis resolved slowly throughout the course of hospitalization.
Acute renal failure.
The patient was found to be in acute renal failure on hospital admission with creatinine of 2.3 from his baseline of 0.9.
Renal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis, which immediately resolved following flushing of the Foley and removal of the mucous blood obstructing the neobladder outlets.
The patient was also hydrated for hypotension, which may have led to some acute tubular necrosis in addition to obstructive renal failure.
The patient had complaint of neck pain for several weeks prior to presentation.
Due to concern for possible osteomyelitis or discitis as the source of infection leading to hypotension, a MRI without contrast was obtained.
There was no evidence for osteomyelitis or discitis.
However, he was found to have a severe cervical spine stenosis at several levels with cord impression.
The C3-4 level showed moderate sized antral disc protrusion with spinal stenosis and compression of the spinal cord in C3 nerve roots.
C4 side has mild disc bulge with mild compression of spinal cord and C4 nerve roots.
C5-6 showed mild disc bulge with mild compression of the spinal cord and C5 nerve roots.
C6-7 showed mild disc bulge with no evidence of compression.
They felt that the spinal cord compression was not a neurosurgical emergency.
Neurological exam was nonfocal and the patient did not have any numbness, weakness, tingling, or incontinence.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hypotension due to hypovolemia.
Anemia due to B12 deficiency.
Non anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Acute renal failure due to obstruction and possible acute tubular necrosis.
Severe cervical spine stenosis with cord compression.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient was given the phone number to call Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurosurgery to discuss his spinal stenosis and cord impingement.
