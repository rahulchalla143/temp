Admission Date:  [**2136-6-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-8-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lasix / Diuril / Keflex / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo woman with pulmonary fibrosis and COPD on transtracheal home oxygen (3-4L) and chronic prednisone (10mg po daily) who was admitted to the MICU on [**2136-6-6**] for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia after elective bronchoscopy earlier that day.
She was admitted in [**Month (only) 958**] (~6 wks prior to this admission) to an OSH for exacerbation of her shortness of breath and was discharged to a rehab facility.
Because of the six weeks of worsening dyspnea and two days of increased cough productive of prurulent sputum (which coincided with an episode of prolonged epistaxis c/w prior history, though patient denies any link to her SOB), she was scheduled for elective bronchoscopy on day of admission.
Per IP notes, there was no bloody secretions in the airways, minimal clear secretions and no endobronchial lesions.
Pt was monitored post procedure without event and was transferred back to the rehab where she and her husband have been living for the last 2 months.
On return to rehab, husband was concerned that she was increasingly SOB and O2 sats dipped into the 70s.
Patient underwent a CXR which was essentially unchanged with possible retrocardiac opacity.
Hct was notably down from recent baseline and was positive with brown stool.
Pt denied any BRBPR or hematemesis and was given IV PPI.
Pt was ultimately admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and O2 requirement.
There were no events and she was transferred to the floor the next day.
On the floor, she is resting comfortably on 4L, speaking full sentences, though becoming SOB with minimal exertion (such as sitting forward for lung exam) and with occasional cough.
She denies any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting.
Review of sytems:  She was denying CP, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, tingling, numbness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or BRBPR.
She has baseline dark stools due to iron replacement and this remains unchanged.
She denies fevers, URI or congestion but reports general decline in resp status over the last 6 wks and feels SOB has gradually worsened with some increased cough with scant hemoptysis since episode of epistaxis.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.

CT CHEST: 1)Severe emphysema combined with pulmonary fibrosis is most likely due to the syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)with no acute pathology.
2)Stable enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and severe cardiomegaly   Brief Hospital Course: ***Discharged to Rehab and she can be reached at [**Location (un) 169**] [**Location (un) 1411**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15122**]***  74 y/o F with PMHx of end stage lung disease who presents with subacute worsening in baseline hypoxia and anemia.
# Dyspnea:  The etiology of Mrs.[**Known lastname 670**] acute worsening of her chronic dyspnea was not clear, but the differential at admission included bronchospasm s/p bronch, ACS, respiratory infection, IPF flare, acute anemia, and CHF.
She was clinically euvolemic with TTE unchanged, troponin peak 0.09, which trended down; EKG changes in absence of symptoms thought to be due to LVH with strain in the setting of acute hematocrit drop.
Given the history of increased cough and sputum production with no acute process on chest CT, sputum positive for GPC and GNR (likely colonization, but possibly bronchitis), she was treated empirically for COPD exacerbation with levofloxacin (completed 6 day course) and rapid prednisone taper to chronic 10mg dose.
We would recommend a discussion regarding goals of care and long-term progression of her disease with her primary team during follow-up.
Patient is maintained on chronic ferrous sulfate and epoetin for anemia of chronic disease with a history of transfusion requirements at times of bleeding, including epistaxis.
Stools were guaiac positive, but there was no evidence of active bleeding on admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and she has no history of brisk GI bleed.
During the admission there was no evidence of active bleeding and her Hct remained stable at 25, with slow upward trend.
