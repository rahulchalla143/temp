CAD: The patient has known CAD, s/p CABG in [**2135**] with previous placement if a [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular pacer/ICD.
On presentation the patient was dyspneic with evidence of CHF thought likely to be [**2-20**] ischemic cardiomyopathy with superimposed afib.
However, this caused worsening of the patient's rapid ventricular response with worsening of symptoms.
On presentation the patient had a V-paced ECG without obvious changes consistent with ischemia.
The patient did not report chest pain and the majority of his symptoms appeared to be consistent with CHF.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes x 3.
Pump :  The patient was known to have CHF w/ systolic dysfunction secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy on admission.
On admission, CXR and physical exam were consistent with significant volume overload, but diuresis was limited by persistent hypotension.
This hypotension was thought initially to be due to cardiogenic shock secondary to the patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and afib as well as possible sepsis as the patient was noted to have warm extremities with evidence of peripheral vasodilation.
However, the patient remained afebrile, without elevated white count or source of infection.
The patient was found on admission to have suppressed TSH and elevated T3 and T4 however.
Repeat echocardiogram performed on [**3-6**] revealed an EF of 20-30% with moderate LA and RA enlargement, severe global LV hypokinesis, mild AS, Mod MR/TR and moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Brief right heart cath performed during the AV nodal ablation was consistent with left heart failure with a PCWP of 36.
Upon discharge patient appeared euvolemic to mildly fluid overloaded with more aggressive diuresis limited by patient's creatinine, which was 2.1 on day of discharge (2.7 on admission).
Rhythm - On admission, the patient presented in a fib with RVR, which was thought to be exacerbating patient's hypotension given pre-existing LV systolic dysfunction.
Of note, the patient previously had a biventricular ICD placed for depressed EF and ventricular dys synchrony.
Currently the patient is still in Atrial fibrillation but obviously without conduction.
However, given his persistent afib the patient will require anticoagulation.
Hyperthyroidism : Historically the patient has a history of hypothyroidism, thought originally to be secondary to amiodarone therapy.
As noted above, the patient was actually found to be hyperthyroid on admission without clear precipitant.
Antibody testing was negative including anti-peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin, making Grave's disease less likely.
The patient was seen in house by the endocrine service who made recommendations to treat the patient's hyperthyroidism given potential cardiac side effects.
The patient has been warned of potential side effects of methimazole including agranulocytosis and has been instructed about warning signs such as sore throat, fever, chills.
# ARF - Patient is reported to have baseline creatinine of 1.2 - 1.4 on previous admission.
This admission the patient suffered acute on CRF with admission creatinine of 2.7 thought likely to be secondary to hypoperfusion given patient's hypotension on admission.
Of note the patient has a history previously of renal cell carcinoma s/p left nephrectomy.
Renal ultrasound of the remaining right kidney revealed no obstruction.
# Pulm HTN/ pulm fibrosis/chronic stable PE.
Patient with pulmonary disease likely secondary to amiodarone toxicity.
The patient has an IVC filter in given history of previous PE.
# Elevated MCV: Etiology unclear, this has been present since [**2146**].
The patient is currently DNR/DNI, not to receive compressions or intubation.
However, again he would NOT want compressions or intubation.

Patient has elevated creatinine from normal baseline which will be monitored as an outpatient.
You have a diagnosis of congestive heart failure.
if your weight increases by more than 3 lbs from your baseline, you should call your cardiologist immediately to see if a change in your medical regimen may be warranted.
Please call the office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19724**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11144**] with any questions or scheduling needs.
Please have lab work drawn at your PCP's office within 2 to 3 days of discharge to have your INR monitored.
Please call his office at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5909**] for any questions or scheduling needs.
You were found to have hyperthyroidism during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] which may have been contributing to your heart failure and symptoms.
She will monitor your response to therapy as well as monitor for any potential side effects such as those outlined above.
