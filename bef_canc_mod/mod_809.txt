Findings included a single sessile 2.5 cm polyp, 2 small 2 to 3 mm sessile benign appearing polyps and several small mild diverticula.
Path showed no invasive carcinoma and the procedure was performed without complication.
Diarrhea resolved several days prior to admission which the patient attributes to starting taking acidophilus.
He reports that after drinking PO contrast he had an episode of bright red blood noted on the toilet tissue followed by 6 melenic bowel movements.
No recent NSAID use.
He reports brief episode of lightheadedness upon standing while in the emergency room.
Orthostatics in the ER showed lying heart rate of 56, BP of 119/60, and standing heart rate of 76 and blood pressure of 56/36 with lightheadedness on standing, however notably he later was able to stand and walk to te bathroom without any lightheadedness.
NG lavage was performed yielding less than 10 cc of bright red blood.
While in the ED he reported 5 to 6 episodes of black stools with an episode of bright red blood per rectum in the ER of 200 cc.
Given the question of GI bleed and severe orthostasis, he was admitted to the MICU.
GI was consulted and recommended bleeding scan if bleeding continues.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation postop '[**47**],     again [**2148-9-25**].
Echo [**2149-9-25**] showed no PAF or flutter     but did reveal underlying sinus bradycardia with     intermittent PR prolongation, left atrial abnormality, no     significant AV block or prolonged pauses, moderate atrial     ectopy, low grade ventricular ectopy.
Question of sick sinus syndrome.
Autonomic testing [**6-9**], [**2149**] with evidence of parasympathetic nervous system     dysfunction on Valsalva and heart rate variability     testing.
Normal tilt table testing, so not     indicative of orthostatic hypotension.
CAD status post silent MI.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Cervical spondylosis.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Small left kidney.
History of nephrolithiasis since     [**2130**], last symptomatic stone [**2132**].
Left cataract surgery.
Prostate adenoma resection.
GENERAL: Awake, alert, and in no apparent distress lying comfortably in bed.
No thyromegaly.
CV: Regular and normal S1 and S2; [**3-2**] holosystolic murmur at apex.
BACK: No CVA tenderness.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
ASSESSMENT:  An 82-year-old male with a past medial history significant for CAD status post 4-vessel CABG, question of sick-sinus syndrome, history of atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated, syncope, cervical spondylosis, liver hemangioma, and chronic renal insufficiency who presents with lower GI bleed and orthostasis.
Vitamin K was given to reverse his slightly elevated INR.
The patient had BiCAP of the polypectomy site.
