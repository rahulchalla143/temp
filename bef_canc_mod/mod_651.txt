One month prior to admission, the patient developed severe swelling of his head due to superior vena cava syndrome.
He also had a fever of 102 at the time.
A neurology consult was called, and the consult resident noted severe weakness of the left face, arm and leg.

Metastatic nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
In general, he was diaphoretic and uncomfortable.
