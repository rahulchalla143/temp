Ventricular premature beats.
Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Large right rectus sheath hematoma as described with posterior extension into the extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal portions of the anterior pelvis.
CT with contrast may be performed to evaluate for active extravasation.
Large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
Small amount of abdominal ascites.
Pancreatic calcifications, raising the possibility of chronic pancreatitis.
Right renal hypodensities, likely represent cysts.
[**2199-5-22**] LE ULTRASOUNDS: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Rectus sheath hematoma Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] presented with abdominal pain and swelling and was found to have a large right sided rectus sheath hematoma and significant drop in his hematocrit.
He underwent angiography that showed no active bleeding.
The vascular surgery service evaluated the patient and felt that no operative intervention was required and conservative management was most appropriate.
His abdominal discomfort and hematoma size were improved at time of discharge.
Atrial fibrillation Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on admission for rate control; it was titrated to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with HR in the 50 - 60's.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed a preserved ejection fraction with moderate TR and MR as seen in prior studies.
Coronary artery disease with demand ischemia His troponin was mildly elevated to peak of 0.14, likely demand ischemia due to anemia and poor rate control early in admission.
Hypertension Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] was started on lisinopril, metoprolol, and amlodipine for blood pressure control with good effect; BP was in the 110-120's/50-60's upon discharge.
Please restart aspirin 81 mg QD by the end of the week once INR is stable in range 2.0-2.5 and there is no evidence of worsening of the rectus sheath hematoma with anticoagulation.
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: PLEASE DO NOT START UNTIL INR IS STABLE AND NO EVIDENCE OF ONGOING BLEEDING IN RECTUS SHEATH.
Rectus sheath hematoma 2.
Coronary artery disease with demand ischemia 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hypertension 5.
Congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, diastolic   Discharge Condition: Fair, hemodynamically stable with no gross bleeding, pain under control.
Discharge Instructions: You came into the hospital because of bleeding in your abdominal muscles (rectus sheath hematoma).
Call your doctors and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] medical attention if you develop: bloody or black tarry stools, nosebleeds or other bleeding, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, weakness, numbness, confusion, slurred speech, or any other symptoms that worry you or your family.
