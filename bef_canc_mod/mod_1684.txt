No cortical disruption is identified.
Disseminated malignancy with multiple new left pulmonary and right hepatic metastasis.
T6 sclerotic lesion consistent with metastasis.

Pulmonary macrophages and squamous cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old female yo female h/o severe COPD (on 2L NC at home), T3 lung cancer s/p R pneumonectomy 4 years ago, admitted with COPD flare, found to have new liver, lung, and T6 lesions concerning for metastases.
1) COPD exacerbation: The patient received high dose steroids, bronchodilators, and 5 days of azithromycin.
2) Liver/lung/spine masses: A Chest CT revealed new left pulmonary and right hepatic masses, along with a new T6 sclerotic lesion (see result section).
These findings are concerning for metastases, most likely lung CA, although pt also has h/o breast CA and a known cystic lesion near the duodenum (noted on a prior admission).
