The patient reportedly lost consciousness at the scene and sustained multiple facial lacerations.
Initial CT scan of the head at the outside facility revealed evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, at which time the patient was transferred to this facility.
On presentation to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was noted to have a GCS of 15, complained of right hand and right knee pain, as well as right-sided face pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Right inguinal herniorrhaphy.
Right periorbital ecchymosis.
Previously repaired right maxillary zygomatic laceration approximately 8 cm in length.
CHEST:  Right clavicular tenderness without deformities or abrasion.
Flank without deformities or tenderness.
BACK:  TLS spine without deformities, stepoffs or tenderness.
C-spine without deformities, stepoffs or tenderness.
Minimal cyanosis right first phalanx.
Right lower extremity superficial abrasion to right knee and right shin.
RADIOLOGY:  CT of the head - bilateral frontal and parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, small left posterior parietal subdural hemorrhage.
Right wrist with intra-articular distal radius fracture and intra-articular first phalanx fracture.
CT of the face with fine cuts - right orbital fracture of inferior and lateral orbital walls, medial wall of the right maxillary sinus fracture.
Chest x-ray - right second rib fracture.
Right knee, tibia and fibula - no evidence of fracture.
Thoracolumbar spine series - significant only for slight disk narrowing at L5-S1 and L3-L4, without evidence of acute fracture.
MRI of the C-spine - spondylosis without evidence of acute injury.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated and stabilized in the trauma bay at [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department and then transported to radiology for the above mentioned radiographic studies.
The patient then returned to the Emergency Department and was noted to be hemodynamically stable throughout his course, yet was transferred to the T-SICU for frequent neurologic assessment and hemodynamic monitoring.
Repeat CT scans of the head on hospital day #2 and #5, respectively, were without significant.
Given the patient's right orbital fractures without evidence of clinical or radiographic entrapment, both the ophthalmology and plastic surgery services were asked to evaluate the patient in the Emergency Department.
The plastic surgery service determined that the nature of the fractures was nonoperative and wished to follow-up with the patient in the outpatient setting, as described below.
The ophthalmology consultation service found no evidence of retinal detachment, or visual deficit, and recommended cool compresses for 48 hours, sinus precautions, and follow-up with ophthalmology as an outpatient.
Given the patient's obvious right distal forearm fracture and radiographically proven right thumb fracture, the orthopedic service was asked to evaluate the patient while in the Emergency Department.
The orthopedic service felt that the nature of the fractures were unlikely to require operative repair, and recommended splinting of the injury with a thumb spica cast, elevation of the affected extremity, nonweightbearing status of the right upper extremity, and follow-up as an outpatient with orthopedic.
After the patient's admission to the T-SICU, the patient's course was notable only for confusion and intermittent bouts of lethargy, without evidence of hemodynamic instability, or worsening hemorrhage on repeat head CT.
On hospital day #4, the patient was found to have episodes of decreasing responsiveness, at which time he remained hemodynamically stable with normal fingerstick blood glucose, an unremarkable EKG, normal chest x-ray, normal urinalysis, and normal arterial blood gas values.
On hospital day #7, a nutrition consult was obtained secondary to decreased PO intake.
The family was adamantly opposed to this and committed to assisted feedings with nutritional supplementation.
