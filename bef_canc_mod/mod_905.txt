Respiratory failure: Patient has a history of severe COPD, O2 and steroid dependent, and presents with acute worsening SOB requiring intubation on presentation.
Initial CXR demonstrated bilateral lower lobes opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
He had DFA sent which was positive for influenza A.
He was treated with both a 5 day course of tamiflu as well as Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a possible underlying pneumonia.
He was also treated for COPD flare, as his lung exam was quite wheezy on initial presentation, so was treated with solumedrol, converted to prednisone taper, as well as combivent MDI.
There was felt to be a volume overload component, as the patient was quite hypertensive peri-extubation, leading to volume overload in his lungs.
His BP and volume status were optimized prior to 2nd extubation, but this also faiiled due to tachypnea --> autopeep, requiring re-intubation.
His anti-anxiety regimen was also optimized as it was felt that he had a large anxiety component peri-extubation causing tachypnea --> autopeep.
He was kept on albuterol MDI prn, and taken off atrovent because of mucus plugging.
ECHO during hospital course was of poor quality, but demonstrated a depressed ejection fraction of 45-50%, septal hypokinesis, could not assess for focal wall abnormalities.
Hypotension:  Patient with episode of hypotension in ED, very fluid responsive per report.
Felt to be due to dehydration given infection, less likely sepsis given nromal lactate in ED, also contribution of intubation/medication given peri-intubation.
Atrial fibrillation:  Patient with history of AFib in setting of intubation in past.
Anxiety:  Per history, patient with large anxiety component to shortness of breath, has led to difficulty extubating in past.
Had paradoxical reaction to ativan, so benzos were avoided.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure 3.
Community acquired pneumonia 4.
Myocardial Infarction  Discharge Condition: Stable, patient breathing comfortably  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute respiratory failure and required intubated.
You were noted to have had a small heart attack while you were here.
