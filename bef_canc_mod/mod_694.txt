Of note, she had been hospitalized [**Date range (1) 43505**] with hypertensive urgency.
She reports feeling well at time of discharge [**1-20**], however woke this evening feeling sweaty, hot, and mildly SOB.
She had total body aching (worst in her left wrist at site of recent IV and abdomen at site of known hematoma).
Denies recent joint symptoms with her lupus.
Did spike a fever while in the ED, currently 101F 101 173/106 Given vancomycin and zoysn for ?pna as CXR with right sided haziness.
Also received 3mg IV dilaudid for body pains.
LUE ultrasound without evidence of DVT.
Malignant hypertension - Baseline BPs 180's - 120's - History of hypertensive crisis with seizures - History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought  due to the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, associated with LE paresis in [**2140**] that resolved 4.
Thrombocytopenia: - TTP (got plasmapheresisis) versus malignant HTN 5.
Anemia 8.
History of left eye enucleation [**2139-4-20**] for fungal infection  9.
History of vaginal bleeding [**2139**] lasting 2 months s/p DepoProvera injection requiring transfusion 10.
History of Coag negative Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-16**] and [**5-17**] 11.
Thrombotic microangiopathy: may be etiology of episodes of worse hypertension given appears quite labile 12.
S/P Ex-lap for free air in abdomen, ex-lap normal [**2141-10-27**]   Social History: Single and lives with her mother and a brother.
Physical Exam: T 98.5 P 92 Bp 173/116 RR 16 O2 100% on RA General Pleasant young woman appearing comfortable HEENT Cushingoid faces, L eye prosthesis, MMM Pulm Lungs clear bilaterally, no rales or wheezing CV Regular S1 S2 ?soft systolic murmur Abd Soft +hematoma left abdomen unchanged from prior exam Extrem Warm full distal pulses.
Left hand with slight edema ++ tender to palpation of wrist patient unable to make fist secondary to pain, no erythema +warmth ?purulence at site of old PIV Skin No peripehral stigmata of endocarditis Lines Left groin HD catheter site without erythema, purulence, or tenderness Neuro Alert and awake, moving all extremities   Pertinent Results: CXR [**1-21**]: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the diffuse pulmonary edema has substantially decreased, possibly following hemodialysis.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists and there is no definite pleural effusion.
Suggestion of an area of increased opacification at the right base.
This could merely represent asymmetric edema, though the possibility of a developing consolidation cannot be unequivocally excluded.
LUE US [**1-21**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity.
L wrist xray [**1-21**]: There is prominent soft tissue swelling about the wrist, relatively diffuse, but quite prominent along the dorsum of the wrist.
No fracture, dislocation, degenerative change, focal lytic or sclerotic lesion, or erosion is identified.
No soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign body is identified.
A tiny (1.7 mm) linear density is seen along the dorsum of the wrist on the oblique view is seen only on that view and is consistent with a small film artifact.
Brief Hospital Course: 24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD, admitted with hypertensive urgency and left wrist pain.
Hypertensive urgency: Patient has an history of malignant hypertension, with multiple recurrent admissions for hypertensive urgency.
Patient represented the evening after her discharge from the hospital and was found to be hypertensive to 254/145.
There was no evidence of end-organ ischemia.
It was felt that pain and anxiety were both contributing to her elevated BPs.
Given her repeated admissions with hypertensive urgency a meeting was held between the patient's nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], her ICU physician and her [**Name9 (PRE) **] to come up with a plan for treatment in order to try and avoid repeated admissions to the ICU where she quickly improves with simply continuing her home medications.
Efforts should not be made to lower blood pressure further, as this may precipitate end organ hypoperfusion.
PAIN MANAGEMENT: .
Similarly, in the absence of new thrombosis, subtherapeutic INR's do not require bridging with IV UFH.
UA without pyuria and urine culture negative.
CXR also without convinving infiltrate on repeat PA/Lat so zosyn was discontinued.
Patient was complaining of severe pain at her IV site and was noted to have a small abscess there which was felt to be the cause of her fever.
She remained afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis.
Likely due to septic thrombophlebitis.
Small abscess was too small to drain.
L wrist films were enremarkable.
Her Hct was mildly decreased from baseline.
Secondary to AOCD and renal failure.
There was no evidence of bleeding.
HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on recent Echo.
Echo without evidence of worsening pericardial effusion.
[**Hospital1 **]:*4 dose* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypertensive urgency Septic thrombophlebitis   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, BP improved.
