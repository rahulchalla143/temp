ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in  [**9-/2165**] and treated with eight cycles of R-CHOP and 25 doses of  XRT, finished in 6/[**2165**].
In [**6-/2166**], relapsed with disease found in periaortic lymph nodes and in the spleen.
Follow up PET scan on [**2167-1-30**] demonstrated recurrent persistent uptake in the spleen, mesentery, and with new liver and pulmonary lesions.
Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he was treated with three weekly doses of Rituxan but continued to progress.
He has had severe chronic GVHD of the skin and oropharyngeal mucosa; he is currently undergoing Rituxan weekly x4 for GVHD, last completed at end of [**Month (only) 958**].

Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular, S1, S2, no m/g/r.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, difficult to assess for HSM due to thickened skin.
Areas of hypo and hyperpigmentation over face, back, arms, abdomen.
New right lower lobe consolidation consistent with acute pneumonia.
Multiple nodular opacities in the right and left upper lobes are grossly unchanged.
Stable small left pleural effusion.
Marked interval increase in the large left pleural effusion with associated compressive left lower lobe atelectasis.
An embedded focus of consolidation with a parapneumonic effusion cannot be excluded.
Interval improvement in the right lower lobe atelectasis with better parenchymal aeration of the right lung.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are unchanged since [**2170-4-7**].
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction with normal estimated left ventricular filling pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to outpatient clinic with hypotension and tachycardia.
Attempted stabilization on floor, but then admitted to the ICU for management.
Patient was aggressively volume resuscitated with improvement in his BP and HR.
Blood cultures grew strep pneumo pan sensitive and patient was narrowed to nafcillin but then later changed to ceftriaxone given its improved activity against strep infections.
CT of the chest confirmed lobar infiltrate in RLL w/o evidence of significant effusion.
Patient became mildly hypoxic following rehydration requiring at peak time 4L NC.
CXR demonstrated minimal pleural effusion on right at site of infiltrate and moderate L-pleural effusion thought to be related to fluids.
The pt developed a small PTX as a result of the thoracentesis however he was asymptomatic with this and it improved with supportive care.
