History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease s/p multiple angioplasties with recurrent in-stent restenoses, s/p coronary artery bypass grafting and patent foramen ovale closure in [**2154-12-23**], recurrent atrial fibrillation s/p atrioventricular nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker, hypertension, Wegener's granulomatosis, chronic kidney disea s/p renal transplant and prior stroke, who presented with shortness of breath.
For the past two days, the patient has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea, along with increasing abdominal girth and weight gain of four pounds.
He believes that his difficulty breathing began at the time of taking the decreaed dose of Lasix.
He saw his cardiologist, Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] in clinic on Friday [**9-8**], at which time his weight was 181.5 pounds and he noted dyspnea on exertion of one flight of stairs.
He was formerly evaluated by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] on [**2158-7-13**] for biventricularpacemaker placement, but the left ventricular lead was unable to be placed; the patient subsequently underwent atrioventicular nodal ablation with a ventricular lead placed on the right ventricular apex.
Afterwards, from [**Date range (1) 18128**], he was readmitted with congestive heart failure exacerbation but improved with adjustment of his diuretics.

He underwent an attempt to place a biventricular pacemaker, but it was unsuccessful due to an inability to place the left ventricular lead.
Transplant Nephrology were also consulted to follow him given his history of left renal transplant.
Warfarin for atrial fibrillation and lasix were restarted on POD2.
