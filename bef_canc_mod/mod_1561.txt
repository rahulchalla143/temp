Admission Date:  [**2127-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-12-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: sob and chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath ([**2127-2-7**])  History of Present Illness: 68 yo male with extensive PMH includes diastolic CHF, probable CAD, s/p pacer for CHB, PE ([**2125**]), htn, dyslipidemia, tracheal stenosis s/p multiple T-tubes, dilations, stents, COPD, OSA, h/o pneumothorax, AAA s/p repair and s/p graft infection, axillary DVT, h/o seizure disorder, adrenal insufficiency on prednisone, h/o pseudomonas sepsis, h/o ARDS, h/o MRSA bronchitis, h/o c.diff, GIB, gout, balanitis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and depression.
Last seen by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2126-12-2**], who felt CAD is progressing but subsequently pt did not have his recommended nuclear stress test.
In the interim, Mr.[**Known lastname 105663**] SOB has progressed to occuring with minimal exertion and occasionally at rest.
His CP also increased with a particularly severe episode 7 days ago (several hours of tightness radiating to both arms with dyspnea without relief with ntg).
Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 105664**] also notes increased LE edema and LE pain.
Presumed Coronary artery disease with last evaluation [**2-3**] (negative P-MIBI) 2.
Seizure disorder after head trauma.
COPD and a history of prior ARDS.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair andcomplicated by graft infection.
History of pseudomonas sepsis.
History of DVTs and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism in [**2125-1-31**].
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the right lower extremity.
History of GI bleeding.
History of C. difficile colitis.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
+BS Ext:  2+ edema to knees bilaterally.
[**2127-2-6**] RLE u/s: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: There is a hallux valgus deformity of the first toe.
There is diffuse osteopenia.
Soft tissue swelling dorsally.
Erosion of the first distal tarsal bone.
No definite fracture.
[**2-6**] CXR:  There is pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
3.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2126-11-13**], there has been no significant change.
2VD, right dominant ciruclation.
The LAD had diffuse disease up to 90% in the proximal-mid vessel with extensive calcifications.
The LCX had mild disease throughtout its course to the AV groove.
The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the proximal vessel and an occluded posterolateral branch that was occluded.
Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=17mmHg and LVEDP=28mmHg).
The superior vena cava oxygen saturation was elevated suggesting the possibility of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, of unknown significance.
Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Preserved cardiac output/index on dopamine.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-14**]:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of large lung bleb in the right lower lobe.
Multiple small exophytic left renal cysts.
A circular opacity surrounding the right middle lobe is again seen and corresponds with the right middle lobe emboli identified on a CT on the chest recently on [**2126-11-12**].
There is diffuse opacification of bilateral lungs, which is stable since the prior exam, and is consistent with pulmonary congestion.
[**2-16**] CXR:  Severe degree of bilateral pulmonary infiltration is noted diffusely throughout both lungs.
[**2-19**] CXR:  The appearance of bilateral lungs with diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities is largely unchanged.
The above findings remain consistent with the diagnosis of congestive heart failure.
There is a small right pleural effusion present.
[**2-25**] CXR:  There has been near interval resolution of the patchy bilateral opacities consistent.
There remains diffuse pulmonary edema bilaterally, with persistent left lower lobe collapse consolidation.
Radiopaque opacities again identified overlying the left heart border.
CAD:  Pt was admitted with stuttering chest pain and troponin leak, worrisome for progression of his presumed CAD, given his last stress was 2 years ago.
The pt was found to have 2VD with elevated right and left filling pressures.
His prox and mid LAD were stented with DES and PTCA of chronically occluded diag.
He remained chest pain free subequently.
Hypotension:  Mr.[**Known lastname 105524**] has preserved ventricular function with diastolic dysfunction.
He was volume overloaded on admission and was diuresed with IV lasix.
On the day of the pt's cath, he again became hypotensive with SBP's to the 60's.
PA catheter revealed distributive physiology but also a high wedge.
The etiology of his hypotension is unclear, but likely related to a combination of hypersensitivity to ACE-inhibitors, adrenal insufficiency and perhaps sepsis.
He was also treated with stress dose steroids and emperic antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn given history of MRSA and pseudomonas).
Diuresis was halted and he was kept negative, with return of his blood pressure.
He does have have a history of reflex sympathetic dystrophy which may be complicating his picture.
Volume overloaded on admission and IV lasix used to diurese.
A component of his diastolic dysfunction was likely hibernating myocardium, and his symptoms improved after revascularization.
His heart failure regimen will include anti-ischemic meds, in addition to beta-blockade and standing PO lasix.
No ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] given history of hypotension.
Rhythm:  Mr.[**Known lastname 105524**] has complete heart block and is ventricularly paced.
ID:  Pt was admitted with LE cellulitis for which he was treated with IV oxacillin.
He remained afebrile and without leukocytosis, until he went to the CCU, where he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he was broadly covered with vanc/zosyn for a two week course.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage:  The day after transfer out of his first CCU admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 105524**] developed blood streaked sputum on the floors, as well as guaiac positive stools.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal a retroperitoneal bleed.
12 hours later he developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requring intubation, at which point he was transferred back to the CCU.
A CXR revealed severe diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were new.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2-16**] which demonstrated clear aways but the L lingular washings were bloody and the wash was terminated early secondary to desaturation.
It was unclear whether or not pulmonary edema was a component of his diffuse infiltrates, as his fluid balance is difficult to assess on physical exam secondary to obesity, therefore a swan ganz catheter was inserted which demonstrated an elevated wedge pressure.
The pulmonary team was following, and felt that his hypoxic respiratory failure was likely secondary to a combination of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, as well as pulmonary edema.
He was treated with ARDS protocol (low lung volumes and oxygenation sparingly) and aggressive diuresis.
Subsequent CXRs revealed improvement of the infiltrates, and the patient had no further hemoptysis.
Adrenal Insufficiency:  Mr. [**Known lastname 105524**] normally takes 20 mg Prednisone daily for a history of adrenal insufficiency.
Guaiac positive stools/Anemia:  He was found to have guaiac positive stools during the admission, and a stable anemia, with one hematocrit drop on the day before the second transfer to the CCU at which time he received a PRBC transfusion.
Iron studies revealed an anemia of chronic disease, and despite the macrocytosis, his B12 and folate were within normal limits.
It is suggested that he have a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
Pain:  Mr. [**Known lastname 105524**] suffers from chronic pain for which he reports taking 80 mg oxycontin TID, as well as nefazodone.
He repeatedly denied pain when asked, and did not complain of pain until he was told that he was doing well on only 20 mg doses.
It is suggested that he not recieve the extraordinarily high doses of opiates that he requests, both secondary to extreme lethargy with potential contribution to hypotension, as well as the fact that 20 mg kept him pain free.
