After returning home, he became acutely dyspneic (particularly on exertion) along with shaking chills and was instructed by his PCP to go to ED.

Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: Vitals: T: 97.3P: 99 R:24-30 BP:107/47 SaO2: 94% on 2L CVP 14 General: Awake, alert HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MM dry, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated R IJ in place  Pulmonary: Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiac: Distant, RRR, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, obese, NT/ND, hypoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No pneumothorax.
A small left basilar atelectasis.
[**2160-7-1**] Neck CT: Air within musculature of the right temporal and mandibular region; air within small veins in the right anterior neck region extending down into the superior- anterior mediastinum.
[**2160-7-1**] CTA chest: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Increase of bony densities in the laminae of several upper thoracic component vertebrae, which in the absence of a primary malignancy, most likely represent degenerative changes.
[**2160-7-6**] CT Abd/pelvis w/ contrast: No intra-abdominal malignancy or lymphadenopathy identified.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis   Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old male with recurrent anaphylactoid reactions presents with sore throat, fever, and hypotension.
1) Fever/hypotension: The patient was admitted to the medical ICU, where he was volume resuscitated and empirically covered with ceftriaxone/clindamycin (for possible retropharyngeal abscess on Neck CT).
He was evaluated by the ENT service, who examined the patient and felt that retropharyngeal abscess was unlikely.
The etiology of his presenting symptoms remain unclear (infectious vs immunologic).
They felt that, while possible, bacterial infection was unlikely, and that the patient likely had a reaction to a viral illness.
At time of discharge, strongyloides serologieis and HCV PCR were pending.
At time of discharge, serum tryptase and serum IgE, obtained to determine whether this episode was consistent with an allergic reaction, were pending.
2) Pancytopenia/Possible immunodeficiency: Initially, the patient was noted to have a low CD4 (repeat check showed high CD4 count) as well as depressed igG subsets.
HIV Antibody and viral load were negative, and the infectious disease service felt that, even if the patient were immunosuppressed, his clinical picture was not consistent with an opportunistic infection.
In order to look for lymphadenopathy that could suggest malignancy or lymphoma, he underwent an Abd CT [**7-6**], which showed no evidence of LAD/malignancy.
[**7-1**] chest CTA had showed only small non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
This likely represents fluid overload in the setting of volume resuscitation while in the ICU.
There were no EKG changes suggesting myocardial ischemia.
