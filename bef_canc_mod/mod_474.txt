He also has had decreased PO liquid intake and decreased UOP.
[**Name (NI) **] was recently admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for 5 days for RLE cellulitis in which he was d/c's one week ago and finished a course of keflex 2 days ago.
He has had no other changes in his medications and ocntinues to take his lactulolse, titrated to [**4-19**] BMs daily.
His CXR showed worsening L pleural effusion and he was given vanc/ceftaz.
Past Medical History: # EtOH induced cirrhosis - Portal hypertension - Grade I esophageal varices - Diuretic refractory ascites.
- On [**Hospital3 **] list after a recent 40lb weight loss - Multiple admissions to [**Hospital3 3583**] and [**Hospital1 18**] for hepatic encephalopathy - s/p TIPS [**2137**] with frequent revisions [**11/2145**] and then closure  in [**4-/2146**] secondary to hepatic encephalopathy # Pancytopenia -Chronic from underlying liver disease -Baseline HCT in mid 20s -Baseline platelets in 20-40 # CKD with baseline Cr 1.0 # DM2, insulin dependent # s/p cholecystectomy for porcelain gallbladder in [**10/2145**] # Carcinoid tumor in gastric fundus # OSA (doesn't use his home BiPAP) # Squamous cell skin ca on left shoulder # Morbid Obesity # Chronic Venous Stasis  Social History: Lives with his wife.
Sister with type II diabetes, seizures.
GENERAL - Middle-aged male sitting in bed in NAD HEENT -  sclerae anicteric, MMD NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD LUNGS - breathing comfortably.
Mild rhonchi on right.
HEART - RRR, no MRG ABDOMEN - normoactive BS, grossly distended, not tense.
mild TTP RUQ, no TTP elsewhere.
RUQ healed surgical scar present, umbilical hernia present EXTREMITIES - 1+ LE edema present b/l with venous stasis changes in his lower legs.
Skin break in RLE, covered with clear dressing, no signs of infection.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE Course: 55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis admitted for hypotension who was found to have ESBL Ecoli PNA and new ARF believed to be 2/2 HRS now on HD but may also have a component of ATN from hypotension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Pt developed PAF this admission with rapid ventricular response.
Once his BP was somewhat unstable for SBPs around 80.
He has known atrial dilation and is likely sensitive to hypervolemia stretching his atria and causing Afib.
Renal failure: Concern for HRS with worsening creatinine despite IVF and albumin.
Treated with meropenem for known Ecoli and Klebsiella PNA.
Repeat PA and LAT CXR with improving edema and no signs of focal infiltrate prior to surgery.
Transfuse for PLU < 10 or active bleeding.
Transfuse for HCT < 21 or active bleeding.
DM2: Chronic issue.
MICU Course: 1) Hypotension:  Patient presented with hypotension with systolic BP's in 60's while sleeping.
He was never febrile or tachycardic, and WBC was initially at baseline ~2,000.
On the day following admission, a diagnostic thoracentesis of his left pleural effusion was performed, with removal of 1 liter serosanguinous transudative fluid.
Due to persistently low BP's, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency with appropriate result 11.7 -> 19.7.
TTE revealed dilated atria but preserved systolic function.
- CMV viral load pending  2) Acute renal failure:  On [**2-9**], patient was noted to have decreased urine output in the setting of hypotension.
Bladder scan revealed urinary retention.
Renal [**Month/Year (2) 950**] without evidence of hydronephrosis or post-obstructive pathology.
Per Liver consult recommendations, patieht was started on standing albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for presumed hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal was subsequently consulted for his acute renal failure.
On [**2-13**] a hemodialysis catheter was placed by IR, and HD was initiated without incident.
Sevelamer was initiated for hyperphosphatemia.
3) Cirrhosis:  Patient has known alcoholic cirrhosis, currently on [**Month/Day (2) 1326**] list.
He was transfusion dependent for duration of ICU stay but without overt evidence of bleeding.
5) DM2:  Patient had episodes of borderline hypoglycemia in the setting of ARF.
6) Pleural effusion:  s/p dignostic thoracentesis on [**2-10**] with removal of 1 liter serosanguinous fluid, consistent with transudate.
Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] op note for further detail.
On POD [**12-16**] his LFTs and INR rose, presenting a picture concerning for impending liver failure.
At this point, the patient had acute desaturation, became hypotensive, and had no breath sounds on his right side.
A frozen section demonstrated ischemia but no hepatic necrosis.
He also became increasingly acidemic.
By the morning of POD [**2-13**], he continued to have multiple pressor requirements.
Medications on Admission: lasix 120mg qday (off for 5 days, restarted one week ago) aldactone 50mg (stopped 1.5 weeks ago) rifaximin 600 [**Hospital1 **] cipro 200 qday protonix 40mg qday nadolol 20mg qday lactulose ~ 45ml - titrate to [**4-19**] BMs insuline NPH 75qAM and 70qPM humalogue SSI QID acidophilus keflex QID (finished 5 days ago  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Facility: [**Hospital1 18**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p OLT [**2-21**] Acute renal failure Pneumonia Hypotension Pleural effusion Ascites Pancytopenia Coagulopathy Cirrhosis  Discharge Condition: Expired
