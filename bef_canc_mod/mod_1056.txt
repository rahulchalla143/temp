CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar atelectases and effusions.
There is dense material throughout the gallbladder, which is nondistended, which may represent sludge, and less intravenous contrast was administered recently, which could suggest vicarious excretion.
The kidneys show a small 2-mm calcification on the right, which may be vascular or tiny nonobstructing stone.
The bowel is not dilated, and there is a full thickening of the small bowel, as well as stranding in the retroperitoneum and ascites, all  of this could be explained by fluid overload.
There is fatty infiltration of the wall of the ascending colon, which is suggestive of chronic inflammation.

There is marked diverticulosis, but no evidence of diverticulitis.

Wall edema may be due to anasarca.

He had initially presented with complaints of abdominal pain to the OSH.
Per the OSH ED record, the patient had a leukocytosis and some LLQ tenderness to palpation concerning for a possible abdominal infection.
However, there were no conclusive findings on abd.
Seen on CT was some stranding and thickening of the small bowel (could be explained by fluid overload).
More likely was cardiogenic shock in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and many nodal blocking agents given at OSH.
Given his significant alcohol history it was felt that he may have had an underlying cardiomyopathy that in setting of his arrhythmia and drugs tipped him over into cardiogenic shock requiring intubation.
TTE here showed global hypokinesis consistent with this.
Hemodynamics were also consistent with cardiogenic shock (elevated filling pressures, elevated SVR, low CO and CI).
Elevated lactate was consistent with decreased tissue perfusion.
An IABP was placed due to worsening cardiac status.
His Afib was managed as described below.
He was off oxygen requirement, hemodynamically stable and with minimal LE edema upon discharge.
2) ID: As above, there was concern for initial sepsis with possible abdominal source.
3) Respiratory failure: Hypoxic secondry to pulmonary edema in the setting of afib and RVR.
In addition, the patient had been given 8 liters of fluid at the OSH.
He was off any oxygen requirement upon discharge.
No significant cardiac enzyme elevations.
5) Rhythm: AFib with RVR.
DC cardiovesion was attempted several times without success in addition to medical management including frequent IV metoprolol doses.
6) Pump: Global hypokinesis.
Myocarditis vs depression in setting of sepsis vs other.
Likely underlying alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy given his history of ethanol abuse until recently.
High lactate.
No osmolar gap.
Gap eventually closed after having stabilized his cardiogenic shock.
8) Renal failure: In setting of likely poor PO intake.
Pre-renal vs ATN from cardiogenic shock.
No hydro seen.
No stones or ductal dilation.
Transaminases elevated and direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Likely shock liver due to cardiogenic shock.
No history of DTs.
13) DM: No history.
Cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock and CHF (EF initially 15%, then up to 30%), status post intubation and inotropic pressure support and intraaortic balloon pump 2.
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring DC cardioversion, on coumadin 6.

Acute renal failure secondary to poor forward flow from CHF 9.
Acute liver failure in setting of cardiogenic shock 10.
Discharge Instructions: You have been treated for a heart condition called cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.
Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, nausea/vomiting, spontaneous bleeding or any other concerning symptoms.
You should follow up with an electrophysiologist regarding your atrial fibrillation and arrythmias.
