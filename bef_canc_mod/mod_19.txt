History of Present Illness: 72 year old man with stage 4 CKD on HD, CAD, HTN, asthma who presented with multiple falls and was found by EMS to be in a wide complex brady to 20 bpm with BP of 50 systolic.
Per wife and friend, pt was in USOH until day prior to admission, when he started to feel shaky & tremulous hands.
Gait somewhat unsteady w/ generalized weakness.
Has not had any fevers/chills/sweats, no diarrhea, no CP/palpitations/SOB.
At home, pt became unresponsive, & wife [**Name (NI) 5504**] EMS.
ED Course: Pt found to be bradycardic HR 20s, SBP 50s-received atropine x1 which precipitated to wide complex tachycardia HR 100s, SBP 200s.
EP consulted which concluded significant Hyperkalemia resulted in bradycardia, followed by wide complex tachycardia and hypotension.
Family History: Noncontributory   Physical Exam: VS 95.7 BP 149/73 HR 107 GEN: Intubated, sedated HEENT: ETT in place, PERRL RESP: CTA BL CV: reg, Nml S1,S2, no M/R/G ABD:Soft ND/NT, +BS EXT: No C/C/E, warm, 1+DP pulses b/l NEURO: Hyporeflexia, sedated, responds to painful stimuli   Pertinent Results: [**2166-12-9**] 12:30PM   GLUCOSE-180* UREA N-90* CREAT-9.8*# SODIUM-144 POTASSIUM-7.3* CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-26* [**2166-12-9**] 12:30PM   CALCIUM-11.9* PHOSPHATE-5.6* MAGNESIUM-1.7 [**2166-12-9**] 12:30PM   WBC-16.7*# RBC-3.56* HGB-11.9* HCT-35.9* MCV-101*# MCH-33.4*# MCHC-33.1 RDW-16.0* [**2166-12-9**] 12:23PM   GLUCOSE-160* NA+-143 K+-8.4* CL--107 TCO2-19*  Brief Hospital Course: AP: 72 yo w/ ESRD on HD, CAD, HTN, asthma p/w significant hyperkalemia & associated arrythmias.
Pt admitted to the MICU, underwent HD with resolution of hyperkalemia.
The cause of the hyperkalemia was most likely due to inadequate/incomplete HD two days PTA.
No clear evidence of hyperaldo.
# Dysrythmias: Pt has baseline conduction disease (RBB +/- fascicular blocks).
On admission, he reportedly had bradycardic (junctional rhythm) to 20's.
Became hypotensive to SBP of 50/pulse.
Found to be hyperkalemic (8.4), which was likely the cause of his dysrythmias.
Went into wide-complex tachycardia w/ possible sine wave on EKG.
# ESRD: History of polycystic kidney disease.
Renal consulted.
Cause of hypoxia unclear: possibly asthma exacerbation, question of COPD exacerbation (however, the pt does not have documented COPD, though he does have long smoking history).
No evidence of PNA.
# Anemia: Chronic anemia.
Mildly macrocytic.
Likely component of both anemia of chronic kidney disease & anemia of chronic disease.
Vitamin B12 & folate normal.
HIT antibody negative.
Possible component of splenic sequestration w/ enlarged liver.
# Elevated CK: may have been due to falls prior to admission.
# Elevated Aminotransferases: trending down.
Likely due to polycystic liver disease.
# FEN: Cardiac diet .
The elevated potassium was treated with several medications and your heart rhythm abnormality resolved.
