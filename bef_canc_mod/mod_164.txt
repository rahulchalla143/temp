DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels; status post coronary syndrome with previous coronary artery disease history.
HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 58-year-old Spanish-speaking male from the [**Country 13622**] Republic with the history of myocardial infarction as per his report with chest pains over the course of 1??????
months prior to admission that were initially associated with exertion.
The chest pains were located centrally in the chest and were associated with sweating, shortness of breath, and inability to move when the patient had "angina."
The patient's symptoms resolved in seconds with one sublingual Nitroglycerin; however, the day before admission he had to take two sublingual Nitroglycerin to relieve his symptoms.
He denied any chest pain at rest.
He denied any chest pain, ankle edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He denied fever, cough, dizziness, blood in the stool, melena, peripheral vascular disease, night sweats, or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history includes coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction in [**2123**] in the [**Country 13622**] Republic and myocardial infarction in [**2128**] also in the [**Country 13622**] Republic.
The past medical history also includes diabetes mellitus occasionally with low fingersticks, hypertension, amoebic dysentery five years ago, and anemia.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The chest demonstrated crackles bilaterally at the bases approximately one-quarter of the way up the chest.
There were no murmurs and there were no rubs.
Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nontender, and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
The extremities revealed no edema.
No ST or T wave changes were noted as compared to [**2128-4-4**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Therefore the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of increasing angina although he was pain free at the time of admission.
He was taken to the Coronary Catheterization Laboratory where he was found to have significant three vessel disease with a mildly decreased ejection fraction.
On hospital day #4, the patient was taken to the Operating Room under the care of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels with LIMA to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the RPDA, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to a ramus of the posterior descending artery.
He also had a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm mechanical valve.
The patient was doing well and was extubated by postoperative day #1 with his major complaint being pain.
The patient became slightly dehydrated from the amount of fluid that drained from his bilateral chest tubes.
The patient was at this point considered to be in mild left ventricular failure due to the increased workload of the replaced mitral valve.
The mediastinal tubes were removed at that point and the patient was treated with long-acting pain medications as well as short-acting pain medications for breakthrough pain.
The patient was sent for a chest x-ray which demonstrated a loculated pleural fluid collection; however there was no evidence of failure.
On postoperative day #6, it was noted that the patient had blisters/bullae along his incision at the areas were the Steri-Strips were contacting the skin.
The patient had demonstrated a run of what appeared to be a wide complex tachycardia.
They felt this was an asymptomatic run of a nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia and that the patient would be safe to go home with prescriptions for Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
