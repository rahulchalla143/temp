There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect, which is confirmed by the reduced TLC measured on [**2129-10-10**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 43 y/o AAM w/ schizoaffective d/o, sleep apnea, asthma, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, on home o2 of 2L, bipap at night, w/ polycythemia likely [**3-3**] to hypoxemia, originally admitted for mania, transferred to micu for hypercapneic resp failure, transferred to general medicine wards for further management of pulm issues.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Per pulmonary, most likely secondary to either decreased resp drive from increasing patient supplemental oxygen to quickly suppressing his respiratory drive or secondary to lack of proper bipap settings.
ACS was ruled out as a cause of resp failure.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: (See above) Patient needs follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in sleep clinic.
Sleep team felt that amphetamines or stimulants for daytime sleepiness were not indicated at this time.
# Secondary Polycythemia: Seen by heme consult service in [**2131-1-29**] and again on [**2131-3-28**].
They felt polycythemia likely secondary to hypoxia, despite his epo being low in the past.
-Signs and symptoms to be aware of for sludging include headache, chest pain, and neurological or stroke like symptoms, numbness, weakness, sensory deficits,  # Hypertension: Patient was normotensive during his hospital stay would continue.
# Hyperglycemia: No history of DM 2, however glucoses in 200s on the floor.
Maybe secondary to atypical antipsychotic.
