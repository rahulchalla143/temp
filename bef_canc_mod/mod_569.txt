#.Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension in setting of recently doubling metoprolol dose, so this is likely secondary to medication effect.
He reported subjective rigors 2 days prior to presentation, but has no documented fevers, and no leukocytosis or localizing symptoms to suggest infectious etiology.
CXR showed no focal consolidations suggestive of PNA.
#.CAD/CHF: The patient has an EF of 45% from an ECHO in [**1-/2118**], secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
CXR on [**2-28**] showed evidence of chronic mild CHF, and BNP was mildly elevated.
ASA and statin were continued, beta blocker and lasix were held initially due to hypotension.
TSH was checked to rule out hypothyroidism as cause of hypotension, and was normal at 3.1. .
#.Chronic renal insufficiency.
PAF: The pt has a h/o PAF but was in sinus rhythm during this admission.
No anticoagulation given his fall risk.
