IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**2117**], most recently [**6-11**] and [**2122-8-4**]: Since [**2121**], previous small right pleural effusion has decreased and what was probably aspiration or asymmetric edema in the right lower lobe has cleared.
Moderate cardiomegaly, severe left upper lobe pleural parenchymal scarring with bronchiectasis and emphysema are longstanding.
No pneumothorax.
_____________________  CT- L Shoulder [**2122-8-6**];  IMPRESSION: Non-displaced fracture of the posteroinferior glenoid.
Bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions; improvement of right effusion leading to resolution of right lower lobe collapse; relatively unchanged left effusion.
Interval resolution or decrease of previously described pulmonary nodules, likely representing a resolving infectious process; no new nodules seen.
Left renal cyst.

His CXR on admission was unrevealing for large consolidation, but he does have a new right sided pleural effusion.
In the setting of no generalized fluid overload, the effusion may also be secondary to infection or secondary to progressing Wegners with pulmonary involvement, although none in the past.
In the MICU the patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage for community acquired pneumonia (Ceftrixone, azithromycin).
This episode self-resolved without complications.
During his stay he had at least 1 episode of aflutter with RVR that last 5 minutes and self-resolved.
# Fever: The patient had a temperature of 100 (baseline 96 degrees usually) on [**8-4**] which was likely secondary to the pneumonia.
No pain or tenderness or redness.
He remained afebrile for several days before discharge.
Etiologies considered included adrenal insufficiency from chronic steroid use,  mild infection versus early sepsis.
However he continued to exhibit hypotension with some unsteadiness while standing and ambulating.
# Shoulder Pain:  The patient reports left shoulder pain for some time after a fall.
An xray of his shoulder revealed a small lucency at glenoid.
In the setting of acute trauma, a fracture is not excluded.
A CT of the left shoulder was ordered for further evaluation of the glenoid prior to discharge and revealed a non-displaced glenoid fx that should be followed in 4 weeks.
# s/p fall: CT of his neck and head was negative for acute fracture or bleed.
# ESRD on HD: Stable, has fistula that is not mature on L and R tunneled line.
# GERD: The patient had no symptoms of GERD.
# Diabetes: The patients diabetes was well controlled recently per patient.
