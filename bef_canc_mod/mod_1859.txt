Lactate 1.0  UA >50  WBC, mod leuk, sm bld, many bacteria .
Images: CXR ([**2130-2-10**]) - No acute pulmonary process.
Scarring versus chronic effusion at right costophrenic angle.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2130-2-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Prominent pancreas with minimal surrounding stranding corresponds to clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis.
No apparent complicating features noted, within limits.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Calcific aortic valve disease with mild stenosis/mild regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Very small pericardial effusion.
EKG: normal sinus rhythm, nl intervals, slight upsloping of ST segments in aVL and V2 (unchanged from baseline) .
Likely layering debris in the urinary bladder, presumably related to provided history of urinary infection.
Benign-appearing bilateral renal cysts.
Small volume of ascites as described above .
LUE LENI ([**2130-2-15**]): IMPRESSION: Left deep venous thrombosis involving the internal jugular and brachial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: # Pancreatitis:  Initially admitted to MICU for management considering [**Last Name (un) **] and metabolic acidosis (described below).
Differential for etiology of pancreatitis includes gallstone, alcoholic, medication-induced, and hypertriglyceridemia.
Abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of pancreatitis with inflamed pancreatic head.
Patient's abdominal pain resolved over the next few days.
After her abdominal pain resolved her diet was advanced to clears and IVF was stopped.
On transfer to floor, pain and nausea much improved.
She was given PRN tylenol for pain and advanced to full diet.
She will follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic for management of possible biliary disease, which was suggested by elevated alk phos, however no evidence of cholelithiasis on RUQ u/s.
# Troponin leak: troponin x2 shows 0.11 and 0.15, in setting of acidosis and acute pancreatitis.
EKG without changes from her baseline and she was without chest pain.
Trop leak was likely secondary to demand ischemia.
Trop, CK, MB were trended and noted to be decreasing, no changes on serial EKGs.
# Metabolic acidosis: On admission had a non-AG metaboliac acidosis (although with albumin of 3.1, may be slightly elevated).
Most likely due to her acute on chronic renal failure.
With treatment of pancreatitis and ARF with IVF including bicarb the acidosis resolved.
# Acute on CKI: Patient has a creatinine baseline of 3.0 and presented to the ED with creatinine of 6.2.
Likely due to hypovolemia/fluid shifts in setting of acute pancreatitis.
# UTI: Patient with a week of dysuria and a positive UA in the ED with more than 50 WBCs.
She also grew coag positive staph 10,000-100,000 colonies on one urine culture.
The bacteria were felt to be a contaminent as CFU was low and other cultures were negative for bacterial growth.
Renal ultrasound was done to evaluate for abnormalities (poorly evaluated in CT scan), showed layering of debris in bladder consistent with UTI.
#DVT: LUE swelling noted on exam on [**2-15**], LENI showed occlusive L brachial clot and a nonocclusive thrombus in L IJ.
No focal neurologic deficits.
No further events of delirum on the medical floor.
# Chronic anemia: Baseline Hct in the mid to high 20's likely secondary to anemia of kidney disease.
No clinical evidence of bleeding.
# ?AAA - noted to have a pulsatile abdomen in the ED, noncontrast CT of abdomen did not show any signs of AAA.
# Hypertension: Was hypertensive throughout stay in MICU but refused PO meds so was managed with IV hydral and clonidine patch.
As patient's mental status cleared she was started back on her PO medications including felodipine, lasix, hydralazine and clonidine patch.
# DMII - diagnosed in [**2118**], has been on insulin in the past but no longer takes any diabetes medications.
# Access: Had poor peripheral access so a CVL was placed on [**2130-2-11**] in the ICU, discontinued on [**2130-2-14**].
Unable to obtain peripheral access so PICC was placed on [**2130-2-16**].
14. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for crural rash.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic kidney injury Pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Because of this you were also dehydrated and had some worsening kidney function, both improved with IV fluids.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection.
