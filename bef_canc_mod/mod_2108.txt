HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] given that she did not have any active surgical issues and required continued ventilator weaning.
Initially on arrival to the unit, she experienced apneic episodes and was placed on assist controlled ventilation.
She experienced intermittent apneic episodes when attempted on pressure support ventilation and was changed to either assist control or SIMV ventilation.
Her sedation and pain relief were also lightened.
She was status post pleurodesis of the right lung and was noted during admission to have a small left pleural effusion which was not thought to be compromising in terms of her respiratory status.
The patient was also tried on a pesseymuir valve during Medical Intensive Care Unit hospitalization, but demonstrated very limited speech.
Cardiovascular:  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient demonstrated hemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressures in the 70s.
Initially her episodes of hypertension were treated with fluid boluses, but later she was thought to be volume overloaded and was subsequently diuresed with a Lasix drip.
On [**2-21**], she experienced an episode of tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of becoming febrile.
Between [**2-26**] and 31st, the patient continued to experience labile blood pressures, but trended toward more hypertension.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2-24**] have concern for the patient's wide pulse pressure demonstrated a hyperdynamic heart with an ejection fraction of 80%, mild aortic insufficiency, trivial, mitral regurgitation, and mildly thickened aortic and mitral leaflets.
She was noted from her culture data to have Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae in her sputum culture from [**2-17**].
She was not treated initially for her Enterobacter as this was considered a colonizer.
She was also noted to have a urinary tract infection with Enterobacter and was continued on treatment with Bactrim.
On [**2-20**] in the setting of fever and failure to make weaning progress from the ventilator, the patient was noted to continue to have Enterobacter growing from her sputum.
On [**2-23**], the patient developed an upper body rash and the Zosyn was held.
An Infectious Disease consult was also requested for management of patient's complicated infections with multi-resistant organisms.
On [**2-24**], patient was started on Aztreonam per Infectious Disease consult recommendations given that she had developed a rash to Zosyn.
On [**2-24**], the patient became febrile and hypotensive; sputum again was sent, which subsequently grew Enterobacter despite treatment with Aztreonam.
This Enterobacter showed only intermediate sensitivity to aztreonam.
On [**2-26**], the Infectious Disease service recommended discontinuing aztreonam as the Enterobacter was showing intermediate sensitivity at best.
Further recommendations were to begin new antibiotic coverage for tracheobronchitis/pneumonia only if the patient demonstrated a clinical decompensation.
The patient also received a five-day course of Ilotycin ophthalmic ointment for conjunctivitis and a five-day course of fluconazole for oral thrush.
Hematologic:  The patient was noted to have an anemia of chronic disease by anemia laboratories.
On [**2-23**], she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for volume in the setting of hypotension and for a hematocrit of 23.0.
However, she continued to demonstrate a low hematocrit in the setting of episodes of fever and hypotension.
Oncology:  The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was consulted on [**2-26**] to give an estimate of the patient's prognosis and potential for future chemotherapy.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient was confirmed to have Stage IV ovarian cancer with an overall poor survival.
The patient also had repeat CA-125 performed which continued to be elevated at 66.
Neurologic:  Patient complained of intermittent abdominal pain.
During admission was treated initially with narcotics, these were later held because of oversedation and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
Given that the patient demonstrated poor movement of her upper extremities, an EMG was performed on [**2-23**] which was consistent with polyneuropathy of critical illness.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was fed with tube feeds, initially Respilar and later Nepro given a high phosphate.
On [**2-26**], she experienced episodes of vomiting versus regurgitation.
On [**2-25**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed for possible right upper quadrant pain showing sludge, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
She was noted to have an incidental right thyroid nodule on CT scan.
Given difficulty communicating with her directly, it was felt that her health care proxy should be activated.
