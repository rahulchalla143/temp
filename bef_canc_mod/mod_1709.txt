Admission Date:  [**2113-7-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-7-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-8-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 42 year old man with a past medical history significant for alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted with the chief complaint of falling and hematemesis.
The patient denied any other symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
Following that, he had an episode of witnessed hematemesis of approximately 700 cc.
Per patient, he has a history of hematemesis but smaller amounts than what was noted in the Emergency Department.
He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, change on bowel habits, melena, or bright red blood per rectum.
He was treated empirically for alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepines.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy when the patient was intubated and sedated demonstrated Grade III esophageal varices which were successfully banded.
This was discontinued after an ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of ascites.
Alcohol abuse; per the patient he has a history of delirium tremens.
Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol.
Right shoulder injury status post motor vehicle accident in [**2110-5-5**] with a fracture of the humeral head.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
He also has a history of intravenous drug abuse.
He is awake and alert in no acute distress.
He had slightly slurred speech.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
Hepatitis C viral load 135,000.
The bleed was attributed to bleeding esophageal varices.
NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA:  This is likely due to alcohol's effect on the bone marrow.
After his upper gastrointestinal bleed resolved, his hematocrit remained stable at a baseline of around 31.0.
This is likely due to impaired synthetic function from his underlying cirrhosis.
After receiving fresh frozen plasma in the Intensive Care Unit he manifested no other signs of active bleeding.
CIRRHOSIS:  He had an ultrasound of the liver which demonstrated an approximately 8 millimeter hypoechoic lesion in the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe.
He underwent MRI of the liver which demonstrated a cirrhotic appearing liver with innumerable tiny nodules.
There was a 7 millimeter lesion in dome segment 8 and a 10 millimeter lesion in segment 2.
These were thought to be typical of hemangiomas and very unlikely for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Due to his underlying cirrhosis, hepatitis A and B serologies were checked.
Esophageal varices with bleeding, status post esophageal variceal banding.
