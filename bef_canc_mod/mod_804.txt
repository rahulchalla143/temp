Also in the ED his son seemed to communicate with him that he (patient) was having chest pain so he was given morphine 2mg iv and oxygen with improvement in his moaning.
# Septic shock: In the ED, VS: 98.2, 72 108/54 20 98% on RA.
He remained afebrile and normotensive (his BP medications were held).
His urine culture grew 2 morphologies of Klebsiella resistant to Cipro and Cefuroxime but sensitive to Bactrim.
#C. Difficile Colitis: Arrived with diarrhea but soon became constipated so C. Diff toxin could not be sent.
# Acute myocardial ischemia: Pt.
His EKG showed ST elevation.
However, he was then seen by cardiology who felt the changes were due to hypotension in the setting in sepsis, the did not want to proceed to catheterization and suggested stopping heparin gtt in setting of h/o SDH along with guiac + stools.
Repeat TTE was similar to prior studies and showed no wall motion abnormalities.
# Acute renal failure with uremia: Came in with BUN 97 and Creatinine of 0.8.
# Acute Blood Loss anemia and chronic iron deficiency anemia: Guaiac positive stool on arrival in the setting of suspected C. Diff colitis.
Recent baseline HCT in the low 30's, with suspected hemoconcentration on arrival, repeat at baseline despite guaiac + stools.
Iron studies in [**5-20**] with low iron, normal ferritin, low binding capactiy but ratio approx 10% so likely a component of iron deficiency.
No further hemodynamic signs of bleeding.
# h/o Hypertension: In the MICU, his [**Last Name (un) **] clonidine, lisinopril, metoprolol were held.
His clonidine was never restarted and he did not have any hypertension during his hospitalization.
# H/O Ischemic CVA: [**5-20**], pt.
There was no clear change in neuro exam .
# Elevated alk phos: Mild, t.bili low, ggt elevated.
