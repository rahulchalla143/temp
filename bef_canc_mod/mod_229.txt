She also notes worsening right knee swelling and pain.
Her recent admission was complicated by possible cellulitis, which was treated with vancomycin/Zosyn to complete a 2 week course.
She was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-8**] and was found hypotensive on [**7-12**] (blood cultures growing coag negative staph sensitive to vancomycin).
The right knee was aspirated on [**7-15**] and showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters but nothing grew in cultures.
She also underwent a debridement of the right lower extremity wound by vascular surgery.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She notes constipation, right lower extremity pain (both at the site of the wound and at the knee), and low grade temperature.
She has mild numbness of the right lower extremity below the knee.

Right Knee: swollen and tender to palpation, no erythema, no warmth Right Leg: open wound with no purulence on anterior surface, approximately six inches long and 4 inches wide, 2cm deep, No swelling, no erythema.
Fluid collection due to an apparent skin defect in the anterolateral distal calf.
Distal calf intermuscular hypoattenuation which should be followed on further series but is likely to represent muscle edema.
Recent tibia and fibular fractures.
Subcutaneous edema in distal calf and foot.
8/16 L tib/fib plain film: No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
Internally fixated tibial fracture and impacted nondisplaced nonangulated fibular fracture as previously described.
Significant soft tissue ulceration at the level of the fracture site.
[**7-24**] R knee plain film: No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
Internally fixated tibial fracture and impacted nondisplaced nonangulated fibular fracture as previously described.
Significant soft tissue ulceration at the level of the fracture site.
Demineralization of the bones associated with a reticular appearance, this may be seen in the setting of renal failure.
No erosions identified.
Diffuse opacities within the visualized lungs, cannot exclude underlying pneumonia.
R LE U/S No evidence of DVT.
On the left there appears to be mild tibial artery occlusive disease.
Stable bibasilar opacities may reflect underlying pneumonia with possible associated atelectasis.
Findings consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
Slightly limited study due to patient motion and insufficient contrast -bolus, but no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
Stable extensive airspace opacities in both lungs with ground glass opacities with interlobular thickening.
Findings are likely related to a combination of left ventricular heart failure superimposed on an underlying chronic process such as COP or lupus pneumonitis.
Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**8-1**] Echocardiogram with bubble study.
No evidence of endocarditis.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2177-2-10**],  right ventricular systolic function may have slightly improved.
Severity of  mitral regurgitation appears less.
Interval decrease in size of bilateral renal fossa fluid collections.
Interval development of the presumed hematoma in the left obturator internus muscle.
There is significant interval change in bibasilar ground-glass opacities, with redemonstration of a right middle lobe pulmonary nodule now measuring 5 mm in size.
Slightly worsened left lower lobe peribronchial opacity and airspace consolidation.
[**8-14**] IR embolization: IMPRESSION: Angiographically successful embolization of left obturator artery pseudoaneurysm with microcoils and thrombin.
Swab wound cultures: no growth (final)  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 29yo female s/p failed renal transplant (rejection [**2174**]) and s/p bilateral nephrectomy, now s/p right tibial IMN on [**2177-6-24**] who was transferred from [**Hospital **] rehab with bacteremia, worsening RLE, and concern for hardware infection.
There was no clear source for the bacteremia ??????
Surgery and orthopedics were not concerned for wound infection or hardware infection as a possible septic source.
CT of the abdomen/ pelvis was without evidence of abscess or any other infectious source.
The ID service was consulted, and the patient was treated with Linezolid for VRE bacteremia and vancomycin for coag.
She had received Dilaudid >10mg IV over the course of the day and had a rapid yet brief improvement in her mental status and BP in response to Narcan.
BP was unresponsive to IVF boluses and she was transferred to the MICU for closer management, where she briefly required pressors in addition to multiple fluid boluses.
She was started on Linezolid, Aztreonam, and Flagyl for presumed sepsis, with sources likely either hardware or abdomen.
#) RLE Ulcer: Upon presentation there was no clear purulent drainage but the wound was exquisitely painful to touch.
There was no fever or leukocytosis, and no clear osteomyelitis on right leg films.
CT, however, demonstrated small abscess in the anterior subcutaneous tissues near the fixation but no deep abscess.
Both services monitored the wound regularly and felt that the wound was healing well by discharge.
#) Abdominal pain: The patient has complained of significant diffuse abdominal pain during admission, up to [**9-17**].
CT scan of abdomen/pelvis was unremarkable except for an incidental finding of a L obturator hematoma (spontaneous in nature - no history of manipulation or trauma).
Pain subsequently resolved; however, the patient began experiencing significant LUQ pain different than prior on [**8-9**].
A repeat CT of the abd/ pelvis showed slight interval expansion of the hematoma, and there was a concern for a pseudoaneurysm.
The patient was taken for angiography with placement of 13 coils and thrombin into the pseudoaneurysm with a rapid improvement in pain.
LUQ pain was thought by GI and general surgery services to be referred pain from this pseudoaneurysm.
The patient was able to tolerate po well subsequently and had much improved pain managed by a fentanyl patch (uptitrated to 200mcg) and oral dilaudid by discharge.
#) S/p nephrectomy: The patient was continued on a Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule for dialysis without any complication.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup [**Hospital1 **]: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw 2 sets of blood cultures after patient finishes linezolid on [**2177-8-14**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Right lower extremity cellulitis/wound infection Right tibia/fibula fracture Septic right knee bacteremia hypoxia .
Secondary: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Good, pain well-controlled, BP stable 100-130s   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an infection of your right leg and bloodstream.
This was treated with antibiotics, and with evaluation by orthopedics, plastic surgery, and vascular surgery, who felt that the wound had good blood flow and would heal over time.
Because of the type of organism and the fact that you have orthopedic hardware in your leg, you need to take 2 antibiotics: the first, linezolid, is an oral medication you should take for 10 more days; the second, vancomycin is an intravenous antibiotic which you should get during dialysis.
You were seen by the pulmonary doctors because [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have needed extra oxygen to avoid feeling short of [**Name5 (PTitle) 1440**].
You should also have pulmonary function tests before or on the day of that appointment, Dr.[**Name (NI) 18850**] office can arrange this).
Please return to the emergency room if you experience worsening knee pain, fevers, shortness of [**Name (NI) 1440**], chest pain, or any other new or concerning symptoms.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4944**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of pulmonology and would like to see you as an outpatient in [**1-11**] months.
Her office will call you with an appointment.
