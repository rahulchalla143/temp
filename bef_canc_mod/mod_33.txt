ECHO ([**2159-4-30**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

[**5-31**]: LENI: IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
[**6-3**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-1**] and 17: Mild pulmonary edema, seen best in perihilar left lung has worsened slightly since [**6-2**], accompanied by persistent increase in caliber of mediastinal veins.
Right lung base is elevated, and atelectasis may explain consolidation in the right lower lung, but I am more concerned this is pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly stable.
No pneumothorax is present.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territory infarction; if suspicion for infarct is present, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.

[**2159-6-6**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse low signal visualized in the vertebral bodies which could be due to marrow hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Due to pneumonia versus infiltrates from sepsis with component of fluid overload which improved after diuresis.
# Fever: The patient was followed by the infectious disease teamand had an extensive infectious workup for possible source of his fever.
Urinalysis was positive but urine culture negative; CSF suggested possible Aseptic meningitis; Rapid respiratory viral screen was negative; C. difficile was negative x3; TTE was negative for vegetation to suggest endocarditis; bronchoalveolar lavage was negative; LFTs were normal.
He became hemodynamically unstable [**5-27**] requiring aggressive volume resuscitation and pressors which were discontinued on [**5-30**].
Infectious Disease followed throughout his stay and also raised the possibility of Addisonian crisis as an etiology of these recurrent culture-negative septic episodes for which endocrine follow up would be indicated.
Swallowing, which was also initially weak, began to improve and the patient passed his swallow exam.
Noncontrast head CT scan was negative, MRI c-spine and head were negative for acute abnormalities as well.
Weakness is possibly due to deconditioning thorughout prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay.
He was seen by physical therapy, who recommended rehab stay for conditioning.
#Penile lesions: Pressure ulcers formed while in the ICU, both a large frank ulcerated area on the glans penis (multiple smaller ulcerated areas on the foreskin) for which he was seen by urology, who recommended treatment with bacitracin with improvement, and a sacral decubitus ulcer for which we have tried turning patient and keeping him out of bed as much as possible, as well as general wound care.
# Hypotension: Most likely this was secondary to septic shock, also possibly  relative adrenal insufficiency given chronic prednisone use.
He was given Cortisol empiric high-dose steroids [**5-29**] and discontinued [**5-31**], without recurrence of hypotension.
He required pressors for a short period in the ICU.
# Acute on chronic kidney failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5 per recent records but has had intermittent acute on chronic disease, thought due to prograf toxicity.
ARF was thought to be secondary to ATN vs prerenal azotemia from septic shock with poor perfusion.
# acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient was admitted with a history of diastolic CHF and an EF of 65%.
# Diarrhea: the patient's diarrhea on this admission was ruled out for c diff x 3.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Likely bone marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis versus side effect of CellCept.
Once coumadin was restarted, the patient's stool became guaiac positive and required 2 units total of pRBC's (given on different days) to maintain Hct > 21.
His hematocrit was subsequently stable and he has no sign of active bleeding.
# DM2: Blood sugars were initially poorly controlled in the setting of sepsis and suspected PNA.
His coumadin is now being held for drifting down of INR and should be restarted at 1mg po qday once his INR is <2.5.
Diovan was held in the setting of renal failure nad should be restarted as needed as an outpatient by his PCP.
# Hepatitis C: No active issues.
# Hepatitis B: Core Ab + in transplanted kidney.
Continued lamivudine, which was initially dosed for renal failure and now with improved creatinine is at regular dose.
# Hyperlipidemia: No active issues.
#ACCESS: Right IJ was placed on [**5-26**] and pulled on the day of discharge, the patient has a Left AV fistula.

Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted and treated for a severe fever and severe inflammatory response syndrome and shock.
The cause of this is unknown although may have been related to an infection with subsequent stress response.
If you develop fever greater than 101F chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or if you at any time become concerned about your health please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital1 18**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] or present to the nearest ED.
