is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a PMH of CAD, moderate AS, and COPD admitted with acute onset dyspnea.
The patient has a history of multiple hospitalizations for acute heart failure felt related to anemia, transient ischemia leading to acute-on-chronic [**Age over 90 7216**] dysfunction and pulmonary edema.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 62048**] with acute CHF and was diureses, discharged home on increase dose of lasix (20mg daily).
He was again admitted from [**Date range (1) 29263**] for dyspnea and lasix was increased further to 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
+[**4-16**] word dyspnea.
He reported recent increase in rhinorrhea.
O2 sat found to be 100% on 4L following neb and pt reported improvement in dyspnea.
BP improved to 99/53 without intervention.

EtOH: 1 glass of wine or alcoholic drink /week.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with JVP elevated to earlobe CV: RR, 3/6 systolic murmur LUSB raditaing to carotids.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: 2 pitting edema B/L.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
In addition there is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette consistent with congestive heart failure which has increased compared to prior.
Cystic degenerative change of the left humeral head is noted as before.
No soft tissue abnormality is detected.
Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
Possible infiltrate in the right lung base.
Probable underlying interstitial lung disease.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a PMH of CAD, moderate AS, and COPD admitted with acute onset dyspnea.
There is concern that he is having transient ischemic events leading to worsening [**Age over 90 7216**] dysfunction which is exacerbating his symptoms.
Dyspnea - The patient presents with acute onset dyspnea, similar to prior admissions.
His description seems consistent with bronchospasm and he improved with a combination of bronchodilators, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled steroids, and diuresis.
His symptoms are complicated by CHF given evidence of volume overload on exam and CXR.
BNP elevated though decreased from prior.
The patient has no evidence of CE elevation or new ischemic ECG changes.
He likely has episodes of transient ischemia leading to acute-on-chronic [**Age over 90 7216**] dysfunction and pulmonary edema as described prior.
Coronary Artery Disease - s/p BMS to OM2, D1, Left circumflex in [**2122-11-16**] for unstable angina - pt has declined further attempts at revascularization.
No current acute ischemic changes on ECG.
Moderate Aortic Stenosis - careful diuresis given increased preload dependence.
Started cholchicine at home dose for exacerbation s/p diuresis.
COPD - scheduled for outpatient PFTs.
Started patient on spiriva with albuterol PRN with improvement of symptoms (see above).
Chronic GI Bleeds ??????
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
call your doctor for chest pain that does not resolve.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Family Care Extended  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: CHF, COPD .
