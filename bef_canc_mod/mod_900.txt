Admission Date:  [**2139-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-9-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tape [**1-25**]"X10YD / Augmentin / Hydrocodone / Levofloxacin / Ciprofloxacin / morphine / fentanyl  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 35 y/o F with a h/o Type I DM, HTN, CKD, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, depression, and osteoperosis who was recently on the SIRS service on [**2139-9-15**] when she had a 2 minute cardiac arrest, requiring 5 rounds of CPR, immediately following a renal biopsy prompting a 1-day admission to the MICU, who now presents back to the SIRS service with hypoxia, continuing bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for mixed respiratory acidemia/metabolic alkalemia of multi-factorial etiology.
The patient was discharged from the SIRS service following presentation for anaphylactic response to fluoroquinolones, with subsequent hypoxia due to bilateral pleural effusions of unclear etiology, a normocytic anemia, and nephrotic syndrome on [**2139-9-8**].
She was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, and soon redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema and lethargy prompting her re-presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-9-12**].
A CXR confirmed the presence of recurrent bilateral pleural effusions.
Given the presence and recurrent nature of her bilateral pleural effusions, we continued IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] and consulted the Rheumatology and Renal teams.
Both teams agreed that the patient should pursue a renal biopsy, which was performed on [**2139-9-15**], and subsequently she had a cardiac arrest.
Immediately afterwards though, she became unresponsive during her transit to the recovery room, exhibiting some involuntary jerking activity and was found to not have a pulse.
She received 2 minutes of CPR and subsequently regained responsivness.
In the MICU, she was monitored and was stable other than one episode of hypoglycemia with a blood sugar of 14 on the [**2139-9-16**], that was immediately managed with IV D50 and she responded appropriately with improved alertness and appropriate mental status.
A CTA ruled out pulmonary embolus.
On the floor, the patient was found in acute respiratory distress, with an initial O2Sat in the 40s.
She exhibited significant somnolence and altered mental status.
Type 1 diabetes complicated by retinopathy and likely nephropathy, diagnosed at age 11.
She has had multiple episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Last eye exam [**5-1**] - "quiescent" PROLIFERATIVE diabetic retinopathy.
Depression 3.
Severe hyperemesis requiring TPN.
GERD, antral ulcer 9.
Hypertension 10.
Past Surgical History: - Cesarean section ([**2132**]) - Laparoscopic appendectomy ([**2132**]) - TAB [**3-31**] - Proximal gastroduodenal artery embolization - Excision of a skin mole - Achilles avulsion repair  Social History: The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol, transfusion in [**2132**].

Superimposed infections cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval moderate bibasilar opacities, likely combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis, but cannot exclude superimposed infection.
CXR ([**2139-9-16**]): As compared to the prior examination, there is improved aeration at the lung bases with improvement in atelectasis and effusions as well as vascular congestion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Interval improvement of scattered areas of peri-bronchovascular opacities.
Differential includes but not limited to cysts, hamartoma, hemangioma, or lymphangioma.
Left pectoral subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue induration likely related to instrumentation.
Nondistended gallbladder with marked wall edema, nonspecific, but may relate to liver dysfunction or hypoproteinemia.
No pericholecystic fluid or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
No free fluid is seen.
1.5 cm septated right renal cyst without internal vascularity, with thin septations measure no greater than 1 mm.
No hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Along the anterior cortex of the mid to lower pole of the right kidney, there is an echogenic focus, measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 1.0 cm, which is avascular, and not definitively within the kidney- most likely perinephric fat.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 year old female with a PMH for DMI, hypertension, warm antibody, hemolytic anemia, depression, and osteoperosis who presents with a chief complaint of dyspnea.
CTA showed no PE and labs were unrevealing.
She did not have abnormalities on EKG.
It was thought that she had a vagal episode triggering the unresponsive/pulseless episode.
She was monitored overnight in the ICU without any problems other than hypoglycemia the next morning in the setting of being NPO and receiving NPH insulin.
# Dyspnea hypoxemia with hypercarbia: Thought to be from pleural effusions, which were seen on CXR.
Patient was recently admitted with negative work up for the pleural effusions except for a positive [**Doctor First Name **] and anti SS-A antibody.
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was thought to be unlikely given her recent normal echo and cardiac MRI.
Pt did not have any signs of infection.
The effusions was ultimately felt to be secondary to her hypoalbuminemia resulting from her nephrotic range proteinuria/diabetic nephropathy.
She had no fevers, tachycardia, or signs of infection and was diuresed 3L of fluid with improvement of her O2 saturations to the mid 90s on 2L NC O2.
This is when the patient had a cardiac arrest (as above), was transferred back to the MICU, and was returned to the SIRS service.
On presentation, she had an acute desaturation into the 40s.
ABGs obtained on 4L and RA revealed a picture of hypercarbia likely from narcotic medication administration and poor inspiratory effort from pleural effusions, chest pain due to CPR and healing rib fractures, in addition to hypoxemia likely from V/Q mismatch given elevated A-a gradient and improvement on oxygen.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: According to notes from prior admission, she had nephrotic range proteinuria and the underlying cause was thought to be due to her diabetes.
The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.6, which improved initially following diuresis, but then became elevated to 2.6, 48h after a CT scan, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy.
After an acute rise in her creatinine to 1.5 in the setting of the valsartan, we chose to discontinue it upon discharge along with a dose adjustment of torsemide to 20mg qd.
Her K+ continued to be elevated on discharge but the EKG did not show any acute changes.
# Diabetes, type 1 poorly controlled: The patient was continued on her home dose of lantus and sliding scale insulin.
However, the value is still lower than her previous baseline levels and was seen by Hematology at her last admission who commented on her hypoproliferative state.
# Rib pain: As a result of chest compressions, the patient noted a very sore chest, with pain managed adequately by tramadol.
Her PCP will be following her hyperkalemia closely with outpatient lab draws prior to these appointments.
# Incidental kidney finding on imaging:  Per abdominal U/S report - "Along the anterior cortex of the mid to lower pole of the right kidney, there is an echogenic focus, measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 1.0 cm, which is avascular, and not definitively within the kidney - most likely perinephric fat.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted on [**2139-9-12**] to the ICU with shortness of breath and fluid overload in the lungs.
You received a renal biopsy on [**2139-9-15**], which went well, but immediately following the procedure, you had what was presumed to be a cardiac arrest for 2 minutes.
Once stable, you were transferred to the MICU for monitoring and evaluation.
When transfered back to the floor on [**2139-9-16**], you had an additional acute oxygen desaturation, but were placed on 4L of oxygen and given intravenous Lasix and you recovered well.
With regards to your kidneys, the biopsy results revealed that your disease is almost entirely related to your diabetes.
On [**2139-9-17**], your kidney function acutely declined as indicated by an increase in your creatinine level, likely due to the contrast you received a few days earlier during your CT scan.
You also have a mild elevation in your potassium.
Followup Instructions: We have scheduled the following appointments for you:  Name: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Name8 (MD) **] MD When: Wednesday, [**2138-9-23**]:00am Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage Location: [**Hospital1 **]  **Please have your blood drawn on Tuesday or Wednesday before this appointment.
