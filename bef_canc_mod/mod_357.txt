HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 80 year old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 0.59 and continued tobacco use, on two liters of home O2.
The patient has had multiple admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ([**2172-1-7**], [**2172-8-6**]).
She has been steroid dependent for several years and is currently on 15 mg of Prednisone q. day.
She was at her baseline until five days prior to admission when she began experiencing increased shortness of breath at rest with increased respiratory rate and exhaustion.
In addition, she has been nauseated and anorexic with abdominal pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive chronic cough with yellow sputum, positive chronic back pain.
Denies fevers, chills, chest pain or sick contacts.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with FEV1 equal to 0.59.
Bipolar disorder.
High cholesterol.
Hiatal hernia repair.
Echocardiogram in [**2172-2-7**] with an ejection fraction of 50% and decreased right ventricular function.
In general, the patient was a thin ill appearing woman in some respiratory distress, breathing at a fast respiratory rate and with clear discomfort.
She had dry mucous membranes.
Her lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally with wheezes on the right lung and some coarse breath sounds at the left lung base.
Cardiac examination:  The patient was tachycardic with a regular rhythm; no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin showed no rashes on examination.
LABORATORY:  An EKG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 93 beats per minute with normal intervals.
No T wave inversions, however, ST changes were noted.
Chest x-ray on admission showed hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms bilaterally.
No signs of congestive heart failure.
There was a question of a right lower lobe pneumonia.
SUMMARY:  In summary, the patient is a 67 year old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 0.59, bipolar disorder, hypertension, with multiple admissions to this hospital for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.
She presents now with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation of unclear etiology, a question of a right lower lobe pneumonia versus the heat versus a viral upper respiratory infection.
The patient presented with a temperature of 101.2 F, small opacity in the right lower lobe on chest x-ray and some yellow sputum that she states is at her baseline.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  In the Emergency Room, the patient required Bi-PAP mask in order to properly oxygenate and increase her oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
Prednisone but that afternoon was noted to have worsening oxygenation on Bi-PAP.
It was therefore decided that she was not hypercarbic but that her mental status changes were due to her increased ativan and morphine use for anxiety and back pain while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient continued to require Bi-PAP at a pressure support of 8 and a PEEP of 5 with decreased oxygen saturations throughout the day.
The patient, in addition, had increased agitation requiring Ativan.
On the night prior to discharge, the patient was aggressively suctioned with normal saline which yielded several brown and bloody clots.
MENTAL STATUS CHANGES:  On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extremely anxious with a very high respiratory rate which calmed down with 2 mg of Ativan.
PNEUMONIA:  The patient was admitted with a fever of 101.7 F., and increased white blood cell count of 18 with 5% bands and a right lower lobe opacity was noted on the chest x-ray.
The patient was transitioned to oral Prednisone 60 mg q. day with an aggressive taper to 15 mg q. day over the course of two weeks and she will need to have continued aggressive pulmonary toilet.
It was assumed that the patient had prerenal insufficiency due to hypovolemia with a sodium of 138.
CARDIAC STATUS:  The patient was complaining of chest pain on the second day of admission.
She complained of chest pain 10 out of 10 radiating to her left arm which improved with sublingual Nitroglycerin and morphine times two.
The patient's chest pain resolved and was assumed to be secondary to her pneumonia.
In addition, the patient was found to be hypertensive on the second day of admission, with a blood pressure of 170/80.
Hypertension seemed to be secondary to her decreased oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate in addition to some pain that she was having, and her hypertension improved considerably once her ventilation was improved.
Her prerenal insufficiency was considered to be secondary to hypovolemia and prerenal failure.
PAIN CONTROL:  The patient was complaining of considerable back pain during this hospitalization, requesting morphine.
to MS-Contin for longer acting pain control with MSIR for breakthrough pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with pneumonia.
