She does not stop to catch her breath during this walk but starts "panting" soon after getting up.
She states it takes her ~3-5 mins for her SOB to resolve.
Upon further questioning she reports ~2 mo of cough that she has been told is a "cardiac cough".
This cough is productive w/ clear sputum, denies hemoptisis or blood streaked sputum.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TRACING #1  Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2195-11-4**]  8:35:10 PM  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy although are non-specific.
Otherwise, there is no significant change.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Left axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2195-11-3**] there is no significant change.
The prior study demonstrated extensive severe pulmonary edema.

Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery graft was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual contrast injections.

A 20mm Tyshak II 5cm balloon was advanced over the wire across the aortic valve.
Aortic valvuloplasty was performed with rapid inflation and deflation of the balloon during a brief period (5 seconds) of rapid ventricular pacing.
The RCA had mild lunen irregularities.
The SVG-OM1 had and 80% stenosis mid graft with TIMI 3 flow into the distal vessel.
3) Resting hemodynamics revealed elvated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 24 and LVEDP of 35mmHg.
There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 68mmHg.
4) There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak [**Company **] of 56mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.56cm2.
Severe aortic stenosis with a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] 0.56cm2 3.

Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild functional MS due to MAC.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is minimal functional mitral stenosis (mean [**Year (4 digits) **] 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Severe calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: # PUMP: Patient w/ dCHF (EF 55%), severe AS (area 0.5 cm2) and mild MR. She presented w/ worsening DOE thought to be due to severe AS.
Initial CXR and phyiscal were consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Oncer her INR was <2.0 she underwent successful AV vavluloplasty w/ an incraese of her valvular area from 0.5-->0.8cm2, decrease in peak velocity from 4.8-->4.1m/sec and peak [**Month/Day (4) **] from 90mmHg-->66mmHg.
# RHYTHM: Patient has a h/o Afib and on presentation she was found to be in Afib with HR up to 120s.
# CORONARIES: Patient w/ known CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG [**10-29**].
Her iron levels were found to be low indicating severe iron deficiency anemia.
# HTN: Currently under control.
# HL: Currently under control.
# Peripheral venous insuficiency: Multiple LE ulcers, no signs of infection.
# Peripheral neurophathy: No issues .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] [**Hospital 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Aortic valve stenosis Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response Anemia .
Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease hypertension hyperlipidemia osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a vavuloplasty.
Your valve now opens more than in the past and this will help with some of your symptoms of shortness of breath while walking.
While in the hospital you were in an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
In addition, your stool showed signs of microscopic blood loss.
Please discuss this with your primary care doctor as this suggests you likely have slow bleeding in your GI tract.
