Admission Date:  [**2113-7-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-8-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: plasmapheresis placement of right internal jugular quinton catheter   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 18806**] is an 81 year-old female with generalized myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], who presents from home with complaints of worsening shortness of breath.
She was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**4-/2113**] with shortness of breath and gradual decline, at which time she was plasmapheresed.
Her shortness of breath was felt to be multifactorial, secondary to mild restrictive lung disease/COPD, MG, and cardiac contribution with mild diastolic dysfunction.
A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
* She reports chronic shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, with worsening over the past week.
She denies chest pain.
She sleeps in a hospital bed at home, with HOB elevated at 30 degrees or so.
She reports chronic LE edema, without significant worsening over the past 2 weeks.
Minimal activity.
No cough, no fever or chills at home.
No recent travel (last flight [**3-/2113**] when flew from South [**Doctor First Name **]).
She last had plasma exchange in 04/[**2113**].
Thymus resection [**2111-12-1**] with pathology consistent with follicular B-cell hyperplasia.
Severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
Essential tremor 5.
Glaucoma 6.
Social History: Widowed x 15 years, no kids.
Family History: No history of myasthenia in family.
No murmur heard.
EXT: [**3-3**] bilateral pitting lower extremity edema, symmetrical, with mild discoloration.
No prior colonoscopy, no prior mammogram.
* EKG in ED: NSR, rate 89 bpm, borderline LAD, occasional PAC, no ST-T changes.
* RELEVANT IMAGING DATA: [**2113-7-13**] CTA: There are filling defects in the right main pulmonary artery, as well as right segmental pulmonary arteries of the lower and upper lobes.
In addition, there are filling defects in the LUL segmental pulmonary arteries as well as the LLL segmental arteries.
*   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 81 year-old female with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on MMF and high dose Prednisone, status post plasma exchange in [**4-/2113**], who presents with progressive SOB, found to have bilateral PEs on CTA.
Given her poor pulmonary reserve secondary to MG and significant lower extremity edema, pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation and serial ABGs.
On arrival to the ED, her p02 was 105, and no high flow non/interventional oxygen therapy was required.
Given her initation of plasmapheresis as below for MG flare, coumadin was held pending completion of treatments.
An echo was obtained which did not show any RV strain or any clot in transit.
She was maintained on a heparin drip while undergoing plasmapheresis and it was difficult to achieve PTTS within the goal range of 60-100 given that her plasmapheresis extracted 60% of her plasma coagulation proteins daily.
* 2) Shortness of breath/DOE: Likely multifactorial with neuromuscular weakness secondary to MG, obesity, emphysema, and diastolic dysfunction all contributing, with an acute exacerbation in the setting of her bilateral PEs.
She also likely has a component of hypoventilation during sleep, and is scheduled for a sleep study with neuromuscular montage to be done on [**2113-8-14**], in the [**Hospital1 18**] sleep lab.
She was also diuresed for CHF and diastolic dysfunction with much improvement in symptoms.
5) Anemia: Chronic due to disease and blood loss due to oozing from pheresis catheter and frequent phlebotomy -she was maintained on iron therapy and hcts were checked daily .
