Her hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was first discovered approximately 2.5 years prior to admission during a preoperative evaluation for her pancreatic surgery.
Since then, she has noticed increasing dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with a resting gradient of 90.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.6.
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Physical exam is notable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for ethanol septal ablation for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
The patient remained on a temporary pacemaker following septal ablation due to the risk of complete heart block.
An echocardiogram performed following the procedure showed an improvement of her left ventricular outflow tract gradient as well as improvement of the severity of her mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a brief episode of delirium following the procedure, which was resolving by the time of discharge.
Her creatinine also slightly elevated from 1.6 to 1.9 that remained stable and was felt to be within her normal range.
She did have some mild pulmonary edema and was given Lasix prn.
