SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Large hiatal hernia.
New left lower lobe pneumonia.
New right middle lobe pneumonia vs. atelectasis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old female w/h/o DM2, Alzheimer dementia who was is admitted for HONC and with associated LLL PNA with evident hypoxia.
<br>  # HONC/diabetes II, uncontrolled, with complications: Calculated osm 320 on admission.
-lantus decreased to 30u on [**1-1**] - BS now controlled (started glyburide on [**1-1**] as well) - ****pm level last pm mod higher (291) - otherwise overall controlled - [**Hospital1 1501**] to f/u on SSI - adjust SSI vs long-acting insulin as indicated) -re-started glyburide at 5mg [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**] on [**1-1**] -Holding metformin with ARF - pt with likely baseline CRI II if not likely III - may consider d/c long-term - f/u on renal fx and re-start if appropriate -cont appreciate [**Last Name (un) 387**] recs - please arrange close f/u in next 1-2 weeks with [**Last Name (un) 387**] <br>  # LLL PNA: CXR on admission w/evidence of LLL infiltrate.
Pt presented from NH with hypoxia and large A-a gradient.
Pt afebrile since admission, but w/leukocytosis and bandemia resolving at time of transfer.
Pt was placed on Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl initially for coverage of possible aspiration PNA and healthcare associated PND.
-tried checking for sputum cx - however pt unable make any sputum also none in unit - given cont to clinically improve - will have to cont vanc given no data to tell otherwise with + improvement -changed vanc to q24h [**1-1**] with further improving renal fx (still not at baseline, though may now be approaching new baseline) -****cont o2 support but with plan to wean as tolerated at [**Hospital1 1501**] -PT consulted here - did well -********continue levoquin 750mg po qod and vancomycin 1g IV q24h for completion of 10d course (given significant LLL with sig complications in ICU) - Day 1 was [**12-31**].
Urine culture from [**12-28**] grew out pan-sensitive klebsiella treated with levofloxacin also used for PNA.
<br>  # abnormal EKG: EKG w/ question of ST depressions in V4-V6 on admission.
She did have a TTE on [**12-30**] which was of poor quality but showed normal LV and RV function without focal abnormalities.
<br>  # ARF: Was thought likely pre-renal in etiology.
Pt was given IVF as above with Cr trending down to 1.8 from 2.9 at time of transfer (baseline is 1.0 prior) Held nephrotoxic meds and renally dosed meds.
Pt remaining overall euvolemic - cr 1.3 at time of transfer to [**Hospital1 1501**] with further decrease of BUN to 32 (pt did have cr at 1.2 day prior but that was also from further decline from 1.
<br>  # Alzheimers dementia: Held donepezil and mementine in ICU, re-started on arrival to floor on [**12-31**].
# Hypothyroidism: Continued outpt levothyroxine  # Gout:  Held allopurinol in the setting of ARF .
# FEN: regular, diabetic at time of transfer .
# Access: PIVs .
