10,000-100,000 Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.
Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No evidence of abcess or acute abdominal process.
Bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, measuring simple fluid attenuation.
Trace pericardial effusion and small amount of abdominal / pelvic ascites.
Possible sludge or stone in the gallbladder without evidence of cholelithiasis.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion c/w right ventricular pressure and volume overload.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
No vegetations seen.
Right foot plain films ([**10-25**]): No acute fracture.
Soft tissue swelling along the medial aspect of the foot centered at the first MTP joint.
CXR ([**10-25**]): Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, continues to increase.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Septic shock: Secondary to MRSA infection of HD catheter.
TTE showed no vegetations.
She initially required levophed for hypotension and was treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but the cefepime was stopped after cultures showed MRSA in the blood.
A PICC was also placed for access and antibiotics.
She was weaned off the levophed and transferred out of the ICU, where she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with SBP improved to 110s.
Due to the fluids received for resuscitation, she was significantly hypervolemic, with pleural effusions and anasarca.
Steroids were avoided due to her recent septic shock.
4) Afib with tachy-brady: Metoprolol was held throughout the admission as the patient had no hypertension or tachycardia.
It later became subtherapeutic and her warfarin was restarted.
5) Post-herpetic neuralgia: Patient had intermittent pain under L breast that responded well to capsaicin cream, tylenol and warm compresses.
As an outpatient, she can be evaluated for long-term therapy, such as with gabapentin or venlafaxine.
6) Abdominal pain: Noted intermittently and often not reproducible on exam.
Thought to be related to IBS or constipation, or possibly fluid shifts from HD.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/g Cream Sig: One (1) application Topical twice a day as needed for itching.
Lidocaine HCl 5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for shoulder pain.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.75 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septicemia from Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus  Secondary: End stage renal disease Atrial fibrillation Irritable bowel syndrome Post-herpetic neuralgia Chronic anemia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to an infection called MRSA in your bloodstream, that initially was treated in the ICU.
We were able to remove some of your excess fluid build up with dialysis, and this will continue as an outpatient.
- You have been started on tylenol, capsaicin cream for pain control - You have been started on trazodone for sleep - You have been started on simethicone for gas  If you experience fevers, chills, difficulty breathing, confusion, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention or come to the ER immediately.
