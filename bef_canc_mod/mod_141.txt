Admission Date:  [**2147-11-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-12-11**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fell out of a tree, developed neck pain and tingling of the bilateral fourth and fifth fingers at approximately 12:30 on the day of admission.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old white male retired carpenter who was trimming branches in a tree when he fell approximately six to eight feet landing on his outstretched arms and hands and noted tingling and pins and needle sensation in the bilateral fourth and fifth fingers and ulnar side of the hands.
He also noted pain across the upper back and the base of his neck.
He denies hitting his head or any loss of consciousness.
He further denies any weakness of the arms, legs, feet or hands.
He denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.
He went to his primary care physician who obtained plain films of the cervical spine, which raised the question of a significant dislocation.
A CT scan in the Emergency Room was positive for a grade three high grade C7-T1 bilateral pedicle fracture with subluxation of C7 anteriorly onto T1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pertinent for cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
History of prostate disease.
The records indicate a history of increased PSA and that the patient refused further workup at the time of discovery of the elevated PSA.
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion in [**2145-3-18**] and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the [**Hospital1 69**] Cardiology Service for this.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He was bradycardic at 49.
There were no cervical nodes and trachea examination was further deferred due to the presence of a hard cervical collar.
The neck was in the cervical collar, but showed mild tenderness overlying the C7-T1 area.
Heart was in normal sinus rhythm bradycardic without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination showed the bowel sounds to be present in all four quadrants, nontender, nondistended abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly.
The bladder was a bit distended to within two fingerbreadths below the umbilicus and the extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
However, the patient noted mild hyperesthesias mildly along the distal ulnar C7-T1 nerve root distribution primarily in the ulnar side of the hands and the fourth and fifth fingers bilaterally.
There was no distinct sensory level to pin or light touch on the trunk and the position sense of the toes was intact bilaterally.
There was no clonus and no drift.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally equal in the arms and legs with the exception of mildly diminished, but equal 1+ deep tendon reflexes at the Achilles and the plantar responses were down going bilaterally.
Rapid alternating movements showed finger to nose and heel to shin all within normal limits.
The gait and Romberg was not tested due to clinical and radiographic findings and the presence of a cervical collar with subluxation and fracture.
A type and screen showed O positive blood with a negative screen.
CT scan of the cervical spine showed a positive wedge compression fracture of the body of T1 and bilateral pedicle fractures of C7 with anterior subluxation of C7 and T1 grade 3 consistent with a high grade subluxation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the clinical findings the patient was admitted to the hospital and shortly after admission the patient had [**Location (un) 976**] [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] tongs applied with weights for extension of the neck and the patient tolerated the procedure and placement of the [**Location (un) 976**] Well tongs quite well and he was seen in consultation by the Medicine Service and was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for stabilization and monitoring.
However, the patient failed to awaken from anesthesia and was found to have no evidence of eye opening to noxious stimuli.
The pupils were 6 mm and unreactive bilaterally.
There was trace corneals bilaterally, but no movement of the arms or legs.
The blood pressure was 200/70 and the patient emergently was taken for a CT scan to rule out intracranial hemorrhage or massive cerebrovascular accident or a pontine angle hemorrhage.
The cranial CT demonstrated some blood in the bilateral occipital horns and a small amount of convexity traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There was only mild ventriculomegaly and there was no mass effect or shift.
His ventricular drain and intracerebral pressures remained in normal physiologic ranges and on the morning following surgery the patient began to awaken, he was easily arousable and began to show evidence of moving all extremities spontaneously.
Due to the improvement in his clinical condition, the ventricular drain was removed and the patient spent the next several days in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit with stabilization of his mental status and he remained hemodynamically stable.
He was seen in consultation by the Medicine and Hematology/Oncology Service for a persistent elevated white blood cell count and shortly prior to discharge the patient had a febrile episode and was found on cultures to have a positive sputum culture and was placed on Vancomycin and Levaquin.
