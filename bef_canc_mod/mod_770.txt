Admission Date:  [**2115-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-1-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: status epilepticus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: LP attempted, intubated  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 54 year-old right-handed woman who presented to the hospital with status epilepticus.
Per EMS, the patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] clinic today complaining of left arm numbness and dizziness that was not otherwise specified in documentation.
Her seizure by report consisted of left eye deviation and left facial twitching, lasting a few minutes.
By the time EMS arrived, seizure had stopped and she reported that "I feel fine and have no numbness.
She then was en route and seized again at 4:20pm, followed by a post-event phase of decreased responsiveness.
She had no adventitious movements of her arms but had persistent facial twitching on the left, without eye deviation.
Past Medical History: HTN HLD  Social History: NKDA   Family History: maried, lives w/ husband, works as a school teacher  Physical Exam: VS 101.2 180/100 120 40 88% Gen Unresponsive HEENT NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Lungs CTA bilaterally CV RRR, nl S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abd soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Ext No C/C/E b/l Skin no rashes or lesions noted  NEURO (exam postparalytics) MS Does not open eyes to verbal or noxious stimuli.
No verbal output.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No EOM to oculocephalic maneuver.
No overt facial asymmetry.
No asterixis noted.
No myoclonus noted.
She then developed afib with RVR and was rate controlled with Diltizem.
An LP was attempted in IR but she became hypotensive from the afib and was therefore not done.
Her MRI was completed once she was hemodynamically stable and this showed a small infarct which was felt to be the cause of her seizure.
She had a TTE which did not show any thrombus or structural abnormality but the mechanism of her stroke was felt to be secondary to afib.
1) Seizure: Thought to be secondary to acute infarct.
2) Retroperitoneal Hematoma: The patient was transferred to the floor for transition from heparin drip to coumadin anticoagulation in the setting of new onset atrial fibrillation.
She developed vague low back pain in the setting of decreased hematocrit.
Repeat hematocrit was 21.6, CT abdomen revealed large right sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
She developed afib with RVR and pulmonary edema and required intubation.
A conventional abdominal angiogram was performed, and did not reveal any source of active bleeding.
Thus her RP bleed was likely spontaneous in the setting of anticoagulation.
The patient was diuresed with lasix once hemodynamically stable and extubated without complication.
3) New onset atrial fibrillation: Her atrial fibrillation proved difficult to control with medications alone, and she had a normal TEE followed by successful DC cardioversion.
Cardiology was consulted for management of her afib in setting of acute infarct and RP hemorrhage on coumadin.
She was intermittently between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation during the remainder of her hospital course.
4) Acute infarct: Likely embolic in setting of new onset afib.
She will require long-term anticoagulation, however suffered complication of RP hematoma as above.
6) Wound care:  The patient developed what appeared to be an abscess at the former  a-line site at her right wrist.
She also had evidence of cellulitis in the lower back at the site of the LP attempts.
Vascular surgery was consulted for concern regarding abscess at the right wrist site, and recommended incision and drainage of the wound, which was successfully performed.
