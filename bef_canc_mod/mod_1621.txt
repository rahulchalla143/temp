Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Revision of TIPS Embolization of duodenal varix EGD Intubated Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 46 year old female with a history of alcohol and HCV cirrhosis, esophageal and duodenal varices, multiple GI bleeds, status post TIPS.
Per report, on day of admission [**8-25**], the patient had originally experienced episodes of vomiting "coffee ground" material, which was preceded by abdominal pain.
When found by EMS, she was in bed dry heaving, having dark color diarrhea, and only oriented to name.
She underwent EGD, which revealed a large duodenal varix as culprit, that was unable to be banded or injected.
She was also noted to be difficult to wean off the ventilator, and was noted on bronchoscopy to have a pneumonia that was likely secondary to aspiration.
Past Medical History: *Cirrhosis -Heavy ETOH abuse, +HCV (viral load undetectable), c/b coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, elevated portal pressures with varices and portal gastropathy s/p TIPS [**6-13**] * Early Celiac sprue dx on Bx EGD [**4-13**] however not on diet since has no symptoms according to patient *Chronic LE neuropathy *Diastolic CHF      a. last echo in [**1-15**], PASP 28, EF >55%      b. ETT/MIBI: [**12-13**], no ischemic regions *Anemia: Baseline Hct ~30, chronic blood loss, ?sprue *Asthma *Depression *Osteopenia *Hypothyroidism *s/p CCY for cholelithiasis *TAH for endometrial hyperplasia *Mild COPD *GERD   Social History: Lives with husband and 29 year old son.
History of positive screens in past.
Family History: Father died of MI in 80's.
Vitals:  T:98.6, BP:102/60, HR:73, RR:20, RR:93% Room air General:  No acute distress.
HEENT: Mild scleral icterus.
No phrenular icterus.
No cervical adenopathy.
Slightly decreased breath sounds in lower lung fields.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Nontender and nondistended.
Ext: Minimal dorsal feet edema.
No palmar erythema.
Mildly confused during questioning, but could relate current president.
Urine culture:  No growth.
Negative for legionella.
Blood Cultures:  No growth.
STUDIES: ENDOSCOPY [**8-26**]: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Erythema and friability in the first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis.
HEAD CT [**8-26**]: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Widespread sinus opacification.
Subcutaneous left parietal nodule, unchanged.
It measures 13 mm in diameter and may represent a sebaceous cyst.
BRONCHOSCOPY [**8-28**]: INDICATION:  Respiratory failure with left-sided atelectasis,hypoxemia, lack of chest rise on the left.
NOTED:  The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally and there were no endobronchial lesions seen.
The right side was within normal limits, however, the left side was completely obstructed by tenacious and copious thick secretions which were therapeutically aspirated.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 46 year old female with alcohol and questionable HCV cirrhosis and portal hypertension, admitted for variceal bleed and status post TIPS revision and varix embolization.
The varix was smaller than on prior EGD, consistent with recent embolization.
No bleeding was visualized so no intervention was performed.
Despite no evidence of bleed, hematocrit fell from 31 on [**8-23**] to 21 on [**8-25**].
2) End stage liver disease: -Etiology likely from alcoholic or HCV cirrhosis.
The patient has no history of SBP, so prophylaxis was not restarted.
3) Hypokalemia: [**Hospital **] transferred from ICU and noted to have hypokalemia, probably secondary to diuresis.
She was not discharged with any potassium supplementation due to concern for hyperkalemia on spironolactone.
4) Hypoxemia: -Bronchoscopy revealed and therapeutically aspirated left mainstem mucous plugs, presumed to be the result of pneumonia secondary to aspiration.
A series of CXRs showed mild interstitial edema, moderate right and small left pleural effusion which worsened minimally and a left lower lobe atelectasis that improved.
Patient had persistent pleural effusions but was aggressively diuresed.
There was initial concern for sepsis, so patient was started on a seven day-course vancomycin, aztreonam and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia (stopped on [**9-2**]).
There was also concern about adrenal insufficiency (see below).
This prompted a questioned underlying adrenal insufficiency given her low level on admission and patient received a week's course of hydrocortisone 50mg (finished [**9-3**]).
Patient should have a repeat cortisol stimulation test at PCP visit on [**2176-9-13**] to assess adrenal function in non-stress situation and after a period since finishing steroid course.
7) Neuropathy: -Gabapentin was initially held due to concern for renal clearance but was restarted once the patient left the ICU.
9) FEN: -Due to concern for her volume overload and early celiac disease, patient was discharged with instructions to follow low-salt and gluten free diet.
Have basic metabolic panel drawn.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Duodenal Varix Bleed Alcohol induced Cirrhosis Delirium Aspiration Pneumonia .
Hypothyroidism Neuropathy Diastolic CHF Asthma Depression Osteopenia Early celiac disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: **You have been admitted for a GI bleed.
While in the ICU, you developed an aspiration pneumonia, so you received antibiotics.
**If you develop any light headedness, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, vomiting, bleeding from your rectum, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest ED.
