The night after transfer she required vasopressor support after running a SBP in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF.
Her decline overnight was rapid, around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was then noted to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine.
During that time she also showed no [**Location (un) 1131**] on rectal temperature and was started on a Bair hugger.
Concern stemmed from her progression of AMS to sepsis, given this data there was a large concern for bacterial meningitis.
She was also started on Ampicillin for Listeria coverage.
Brain MRI was negative for acute ischemia.
All culture data was negative at time of discharge, but given patient's presentation and lack of alternative diagnosis, neurology recommended complete treatment for meningitis.
# AMS/seizure: On the evening of [**2-26**] she was noted to be somnolent with episodes of apnea, due to concerns for airway protection and she was intubated and transferred to ICU.
On the day after transfer she had a witnessed left focal hemibody clonic seizure that lasted for about 60 s and left her in apost-ictal state with unresponsiveness to voice or sternal rub.
Since admission she has not been responsive, given the witnessed episode of tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] underwent a seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment.
CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP, MRI was negative for acute ischemia or mass, though did reveal extensive vascular disease.
She had no other witnessed seizures and her mental status improved during this hospitalization.
# NSTEMI:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest pain, however elvated CKs  Suspect likely demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.
TT was performed and showed  ## lip swelling and tongue enlargement: unclear etiology, no new meds, diff dx includes drug, allergy, infection, autoimmune disorder.
Plavis was not given as patient had gross hematuria at discharge, but this could be restarted when resolved.
Of note, patient's hematuria was resolved, so Plavix can likely be restarted.

Please return to the hospital should you develop fevers, chills, worsening mental status or other concerning symptoms.
