Chief Complaint: fever and hypoxia .
Reason for MICU transfer: septic shock   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 78 year old female with h/o meningioma c/b sroke and respiratory failure who presents from NH with fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension.
She was found to have ?patchy infiltrates on CXR.
She had two episodes of Afib with RVR which converted to sinus rhythm; she did require diltiazem 10mg iv times one.
Review of systems:  unable to obtain   Past Medical History: hypercholesterolemia, basal cell CA removal from Bilateral UE's,  bilateral cataract surgery, colon adenoma s/p biopsy, right spenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma s/p resection, s/p PEG tube placement and trach placement (now s/p removal) now in persistent vegetative state, seizure disorder   Social History: She stopped smoking 35 years ago.
Stable mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Possible left lower lobe pneumonia is unchanged.
There may be mild  vascular congestion.
Increased peribronchial cuffing on this examination is suggestive of fluid overload.
An ill-defined opacity in the left perihilar region is incompletely evaluated however could represent developing infection in the right clinical context.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Green Course  78 year old female with h/o meningioma c/b sroke and respiratory failure in [**1-31**] who presents on [**2105-12-7**] from NH with UTI, HCAP, [**Last Name (un) **], likely demand ischemia, c/w septic shock now resolved with abx and fluids.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  #) Septic Shock: Septic shock was defined as sepsis, hypotension and evidence of end-organ damage with [**Last Name (un) **] and small NSTEMI due to demand.
Possible etiologies of Ms [**Known lastname 90127**] septic shock included HCAP given infiltrate on CXR and UTI.
No central line or pressors were given per goals of care.
Blood, cultures were pending at the time of transfer to the medical [**Hospital1 **], urine cultures showed no growth.
No obvious infected lines or decubitus ulcers or other sources of infection.
Evidence of end organ damage includes renal and cardiac but improved during the course of her hospitalization.
This was most likely secondary to free water deprivation in setting of fevers and insensible losses, and also possibly secondary to tube feed interruptions.
It was unclear if this is her baseline or if this was secondary to some toxic-metabolic etiology.
After discussion with NH nursing, this appears to be very close to her baseline mental status.
She revealed no focal neurologic defecits aside from her known left-sided hemiparesis/hemineglect.
She had normal sats and exam was significant for rhonchi.
Ms [**Known lastname 46555**] was given 10mg IV lasix piror to transfer to the floor because of a CXR indicating some pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid resucittation.
#) NSTEMI: Small troponin elevation, with peak troponin of 0.3, thought to be [**12-24**] demand ischemia.
Trended down to 0.11 without intervention.
#) Trace peripheral edema: Likely secondary to being 8L positive, but patient is 2.5L net negative since [**2105-12-10**] and edema nearly resolved.
Palliative care confirmed her clear goals of care of no pressors, lines, or any other extraordinary measures.
I explained to him given her bedbound status, 4 bed sores, and poor mental status she was at high risk for readmission for HCAP, urosepsis, or wound infection.
We explored inpatient hospice or DNH as a possible future decision.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon on the Parkway - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock Complicated urinary tract infection Hospital acquired pneumonia Hypernatremia Hypoxia Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Acute kidney injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You were admitted for a severe infection of your lungs (pneumonia) and your urinary tract.
You also have unfortunately developed multiple sores from being bedbound.
We have made dressing changes and will notify your extended care facility to monitor these wounds closely.
