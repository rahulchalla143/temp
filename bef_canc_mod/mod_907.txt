[**Hospital3 **] course notable for bradycardic arrest, MRSA pna, C diff colitis and was d/c to rehab.
with MRSA pneumonia, C diff colitis.
On admission here, pt thought not to have acute ischemia; finished course of PO vanco for c diff and IV vanco for MRSA pna.
[**7-25**], pt had resp distress but cxr showed layering pleural effusions L>R, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 44756**].
[**7-26**], patient had another episode of tachypnea, hypoxia at HD and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mngt.
SOB thought to be multifactorial from volume overload, pleural effusions, AF w/ RVR.
Leukocytosis to 13-14 persisted but ID work up negative besides his previous known infections, as above.
[**7-29**] Recurrence of tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension on [**7-29**] that was thought [**3-15**] aspiration vs flash pulm edema vs mucous plugging, again improved w/o intervention.
EF now 25% with new akinesis.
Cardiac cath considered for concern of recurring ischemia (INR elevated [**3-15**] coumadin, so held off for some time).
Vanco was started on [**8-1**] for GPC's in sputum and increased secretions.
[**2113-8-5**] Had HD session w/o incident and had acute onset of resp distress w/ sats 83% approx 30 min after arrival on floor.
MICU stay Underwent throacentesis with 1700 cc of serous fluid removed which was transudative.
He was thought to have flash pulmonary edema.
He was initially on a levophed gtt for hypotension, but with fluid boluses he was weaned off the gtt.
[**8-7**] -weaned off all pressors, -seen by cardiology and they decided to defer catherization until the patient was stable from a respiratory standpoint.
-Patient's stool was positive for C diff.
Aggressive suctioning with O2 therapy successfully resolved all of these episodes, and it was felt these episodes were secondary to mucus plugging.
Emesis guiaiac positive, stool guaiac negative.
PTT was supratherapeutic GI consulted, felt endoscopy would not be of benefit unless catheterization performed.
[**8-17**] Thallium viability performed revealed no reversible defects, as no tissue could be recovered by reperfusion, Cardiology decided catheterization would not benefit the patient and signed off.
[**8-18**] Thoracentesis performed 2L removed transudative negative for gram stain and culture, largely for respiratory comfort.
Pt had only one minor episode of respiratory distress after this time.
In summary this is a 73 year old Caucasian gentleman with a prior history of coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and anticoagulation, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
He was admitted for non-ST elevation MI, since admission his course has been complicated by recurrent respiratory distress with chest pain and hypotension and necessitating one intubation, pneumonia, upper GI bleed from supratherapeutic INR, and C. dificile on discharge this patients issues are as follows.
Resp distress:  Improved s/p thoracentesis and with nebulizer, chest PT and mucinex therapy.
Mucus plugging was likely cause of his recurrent resp distress.
Prior episode of pneumonia during stay successfully treated with levofloxacin.
Ischemic heart disease:  EF of 25%, now with new akinesis.
Unfortunately, invasive procedures will no longer benefit the pt owing to the lack of viable tissue left.
Sepsis:  Pt was septic requiring pressors x 3, resolved in MICU.
h/o MRSA pneumonia.
GI bleed:  No further episodes of GI bleed since [**8-16**]; this was probably secondary to his supratherapeutic INR  C. Dificile:  On discharge, he will be on day 10 of 14  DVT prophylaxis: Coumadin  Anemia: Likely from chronic disease, ESRD, on epogen.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for Oral Thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST elevated MI Sepsis with hypotension.
End stage renal disease now on hemodialysis.
Congestive heart failure (ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease.
Recurrent respiratory distress with mucus plugging.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Stable.Still requiring oxygen 2-3 L by NC or face mask.Chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to hospital if respiratory distress, chest pain recurs.
Please return if coffee ground or bloody vomiting recur.
