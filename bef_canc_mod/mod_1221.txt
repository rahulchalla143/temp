He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 64240**] and found to have hepatic artery thrombosis.
During that admission he was also found to have bile lakes, likely secondary to biliary ischemia secondary to hepatic artery thrombosis, as well as a common bile duct stricture, for which sphincterotomy with placement of two stents was peformed.
Since the time of his [**Month/Year (2) **], Mr. [**Known lastname 64239**] has had loss of appetite with failure to thrive.
He reports no nausea, vomitting, or abdominal pain, but "lack of taste buds."
He has also not been able to carry out his usual activities and has not been working.
He attributes this to physical weakness, including shortness of breath with walking more than room-to-room.
He has also been having fevers as high as 101-102 intermittently since the time of [**Date Range **].
No nausea or vomitting, no change in bowel movements or blood in bowel movements.
No change in urine output or dysuria.
No chest pain.
Past Medical History: -History of UGIB ([**2120**]) -Hepatitis C cirrhosis - s/p OLT [**12-31**] in the setting of decompensated liver failure [**12-25**] infection.
Genotype 1, treated with Peg-IFN and ribavirin several times with no response.
He has three Grade II varices with portal gastropathy s/p banding.
-hx L leg cellulitis, necrotizing fascitis, osteomyelitis and group A strep sepsis [**11/2123**], requiring skin graft -Chronic thrombocytopenia -Hypersplenism -Cellulitis [**2119**] -MVA [**2101**], surgery to R leg, multiple fractures to L leg -Failure to thrive after liver [**Year (4 digits) **] -Multiple episodes of acute renal failure with unclear baseline creatinine (was as low as .8 in [**12-31**], range .8-4.5)   Social History: Denies tobacco use.
No history of liver disease  Physical Exam: PE: VS T 95.5 BP 84/58 Pulse 60 RR 20 O2 96% on RA Gen: NAD, cachectic, pale HEENT: oropharynx clear, dry mucous membranes CV: RRR, no murmurs Lungs: clear bilaterally Abd: well-healed y-scar.
No appreciable ascites.
Ext: warm, no cyanosis.
Left leg extensively scarred below mid-shin with nonpitting edema below ankle, nontender, distal pulses strong.
Wife and patient both stated that he had been having intermittent fevers as high as 102 measured at home since the time of [**Month/Day/Year **], although this had not previously been documented.
Blood cultures grew enterococcus and Neisseria, and urine cultures grew pseudomonas.
He underwent CT guided drainage of a hepatic collection on [**10-23**].
The fluid grew out Enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
US showed there is slow flow in the main hepatic artery with a tardus and parvus waveform (velocity up to 32 cm/s), but no flow in the right hepatic artery.
There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation.
Regarding failure to thrive: This was likely multifactorial, with acute bacteremia and renal failure playing a role.
However, he had a long history of weight loss and poor PO intake (had required feeding tube for several months after [**Female First Name (un) **]) and was thought to also have some underlying depression.
On [**2124-10-25**] a liver became available and the patient underwent a second orthotopic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] due to the hepatic artery thrombosis and subsequent biliary necrosis and hepatic abscess.
Donor iliac artery conduit from the supraceliac aorta was performed.
The medial drain was noted to be becoming more bilious in nature and he was having increased abdominal pain and an elevation in his WBC.
An ERCP was attempted and extravasation of contrast was noted at the duct to duct anastamosis and a stent was placed.
Cholangiogram on [**11-10**] showed no leak and tube was capped with no subsequent fever.
