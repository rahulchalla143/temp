According to Mom, she had no focal movements consistent with a seizure but had drinking a lot of fluids, consisting of 10cans of diet coke and 4-16oz bottles of water.
Pt usually drinks a great deal of fluids and had a similar episode of MS changes 6mos prior, when she was found to be hyponatremic.
En route to OSH, she did have bladder incontinence.
CT of head showed no signs of bleed, but increased attenuation of frontal lobe c/w prominant sulci, encephalomalecia of right post temporal lobe.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was febrile to 102, with leukocytsosis, and elevated lactate with slightly improved Na to 118.
Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in R temporal lobe: s/p resection in [**2179**]; s/p 12 cycles of Temodar; s/p stereotactic radiosurgery on [**2181-12-26**] for recurrence 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
HTN 7.
: diagnosed w/schizophrenia w/childhood schizophrenia by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55381**]; seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55381**] for 20yrs; auditory hallucinations at baseline; last hospitalized in [**2169**] for suicide attempt 8.

Spinal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CXR: Mild increase in opacity of the right lower lung medially could represent atelectasis.
No pleural abnormality.
MRI from [**2182-7-5**]: Status post right temporal lobe brain tumor resection, with cystic CSF space at the surgical site.
Enlarging mural nodule with enhancement, measuring 6 mm in diameter, which is worrisome for progression of previously diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.
These findings are concerning for recurrence.
EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There is a continuous mixed delta and theta frequency slowing over the left temporal region.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in drowsiness due to the presence of continuous mixed delta and theta frequency slowing over the left temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges were seen.
A tachycardia was noted.
Pt's hyponatermia was thought to be secondary to a combination of dehyration and polydipsia.
Pt's mental status was most likely secondary to hyponatremia; and it gradually improved with correction of serum sodium.
CSF fluid also revealed no malignant cells and no growth of bacteria.
An EEG was performed which showed no seizure activity.
On the floor, Infectious Diseases was consulted and made the recommendation to stop the patient's empiric antibiotics as her CSF profile was not suggestive of bacterial meningitis.
A chest X-ray was repeated to investigate other sources of infection and found to be negative.
A repeat MRI showed nodules of enhancement along the posterior margin of the surgical cavity in the right posterior lobe, slowly increasing in size and concerning for recurrence (pt will have outpt f/u of this).
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for seizure d/o.
