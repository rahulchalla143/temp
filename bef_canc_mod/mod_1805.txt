Patient was found down on bathroom floor with copious bleeding from head and staff called EMS.
Discharged 4 days prior to current presentation with diagnosis of pneumonia.
Labs showed leukocytosis to 10.1, lactate to 2.4, Hct 28.5.
Head CT, Abdomen/Pelvis CT, and FAST negative for bleeding.
Forehead laceration from fall bled profusely and sealed with gel foam.
Was then found to be hypotensive to 80s despite numerous fluid boluses.
Pt endorsed light-headedness, some difficulty breathing, +productive cough x2 weeks (no blood).
Past Medical History: -Bladder cancer --HGT1 w/ CIS, s/p BCG Therapy with subsequent BCG-osis - was found to have suspicious etiology in [**8-2**] and subsequently has had three atypical cytologies -Heart Block s/p PPM -Atrial Flutter -Seborrheic keratosis -Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Skin -CKD 4 -Senile Cataract -Hypertension - COPD - CHF (Diastolic) - AAA (s/p endovascular repair) - with bleeding in small intestine during capsule endoscopy - could not identify source.
-Hyperlipidemia -DM type II -Prostate Benign Hypertrophy -Colonic Polyps   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital 599**] nursing home x2 years.
Family History: Denies any family history of diseases including blood/bleeding diseases and cancer.
Physical Exam: General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress  Neuro: Alert, oriented, appropriate.
Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, Dry oral mucosa, large beefy tongue  Lymphatic: JVP at level of ears with double pulsation.
Grade III holosystolic murmur at LLSB which increases on inspiration.
Small bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis, left greater than right, are minimally increased from prior.
There is no pulmonary edema.
[**2112-4-1**] R hand xray FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of the fifth proximal phalanx.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Stable 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, status post endovascular repair.
Slightly increased small bilateral pleural effusions and slight increased free fluid in the pelvis.
[**2112-3-31**] Transthoracic Echo The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) with mid to distal septal and distal inferior hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The RV appears dilated with preserved systolic function.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Left frontal scalp laceration and subgaleal hematoma without underlying fracture.
Bilateral sinus disease with air-fluid levels may indicate acute sinusitis.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative change with mild-to-moderate canal narrowing at C3-4 and C4-5 as above may predispose the patient to cord injury in the setting of trauma.
If there is clinical concern for cord injury and there is no contraindication, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
Unchanged mild compression deformity of C7.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 M with MMP, presents s/p fall and hypovolemia admitted to the ICU for hypotension.
# Hypotension: Dropped to 80s in setting of elevated Cr, Lactate and compressable IVC.
No fever or leukocytosis so unlikely sepsis/infection.
Patient had ECHO with worsening EF (45-50%) and LV systolic dysfunction new since [**7-/2111**] so it was felt that his hypotension was likely due to hypovolemia and poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
Acute MI was ruled out with CE flat x3 (though troponin 0.14 0.12 in setting of ARF)  He was not given any further fluid but transfused 3 units of PRBCs.
# Head laceration: Head lac not actively bleeding and surgiseal was applied in the ED.
# R 5th digit fracture - he was elgvaulated by hand surgery and placed in a splint.
# Macrocytic Anemia: HCT 28 on arrival and dropped to 23 after ICF resuscitation.
# Heart Block s/p PPM, Atrial Fibrillation: Coumadin on med list, but INR 1.
Coumadin was not restarted given head laceration and high risk of fall.
His aspirin was also held per Geriatrics recommendations (given chronic thrombocytopenia and history of GI bleeding).
He was in atrial fibrillation with a paced rate of 60.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 3 from baseline 2.3-2.5.
COPD: Unclear if patient has COPD or another underlying lung process.
# CHF (Diastolic): Lasix was held in the setting of hypotension.
# DM type II: Patient placed on a diabetic diet and his home insulin regimen.
He was returned to his usual insulin dose for discharge.
Health care associated Pneumonia - the patient was started on antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) while in the ICU out of concern for pneumonia.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
Polyvinyl Alcohol 1.4 % Drops Sig: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypotension secondary to volume depletion, bleeding and possible sepsis  Secondary diagnoses: Health-care associated pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Subacute delirium Level of Consciousness: Alert, oriented to person and place Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after falling and cutting your head.
Some changes were made to your medications: - Your blood pressure medications (are being held to prevent further hypotension or low blood pressure) - your coumadin (blood thinner) is also being held - you are being given a course of antibiotics to end on [**2112-4-8**]  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
