His hospitalizationwas complicated by aspiration PNA (RLL) and subsequently intubated.
He was also trreated for COPD exacerbation with high-dose steroids.
He was not having symptoms of cholecystits at that time and the plan was for a HIDA scan with close follow-up.
Past Medical History: Hep C HIV HTN Substance abuse (IVDU, EtOH, cocaine/heroin) Diverticulitis s/p resection '[**50**] and temporary colostomy reversed in '[**51**].
The wall of these two loops is not well defined and there is suggestion of possible pneumatosis intestinalis.
There is no definite evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
IMPRESSION: Two loops of dilated small bowel in the left mid abdomen with suggestion of possible pneumatosis intestinalis.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2164-9-7**] 7:48 PM UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Reason: cause of swelling in LUE below PICC placement IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus along the PICC catheter within the left brachial vein.
Dilated loops of small bowel without evidence of complete obstruction and contrast passing through all the way to the rectum.
Findings most likely represent an ileus, though partial or early obstruction are also diagnostic considerations.
Moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic free fluid.
Scattered foci of "tree in budding" within the lung bilaterally, worrisome for acute infection.
Diagnostic considerations include opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients and clinical correlation is recommended.
Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2164-9-10**] 9:32 AM IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive residual thrombus within the left brachial vein.
Chronic cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year old male with who presented with nausea and vomiting.

A CXR showed worsening of right lower lung opacity and new small right pleural effusion concerning for worsening infection.
A CT was done on [**9-10**] and showed dilated loops of small bowel without evidence of complete obstruction and contrast passing through all the way to the rectum.

Diagnostic considerations include opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients and clinical correlation is recommended.
Thrombus: A non-occlusive thrombus of L brachial vein secondary to PICC line placed [**9-7**].
An US on [**9-10**] showed Nonocclusive residual thrombus within the left brachial vein.
He had a new PICC placed on the Right side and also developed a thrombus with an US showing a short segment occluding thrombus in the basilic vein surrounding PICC line at the insertion site.
He then went to the OR on [**9-14**] for CCY/lysis of adhesions.
Pain: His pain was well controlled with a PCA.
Once on a diet we were able to switch him to his home doses of PO pain meds.
