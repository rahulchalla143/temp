Pt did have recent episode on [**3-27**]; he presented to ED with 3 days of fever, cough, shoulder pain.
Past Medical History: - h/o frequent infections complicated by anaphylactoid reaction.
Pt has been noted to develop urticaria, wheezing, and hypotension in setting of viral or bacterial infections.
This has been evaluated by allergy/immunology with no clear etiology.

There has been interval increase in opacities within the left lower lobe.
Although some of these opacities have a linear configuration _____ new increase in opacification within this region.
These findings could represent pneumonia and/or small left pleural effusion.
Tortuous head and neck vessels or a goiter are causing some tracheal deviation.
There are perihilar opacities with some interstitial markings.
These opacities have a linear configuration likely representing atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intraluminal clot is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was originally admitted with a chief complaint of fevers and a cough.
He was treated with levofloxacin for possible CAP, and given his history of anaphylactoid reactions in the setting of viral/bacterial illnesses, was treated with [**Doctor First Name 130**], zantac, steroids, albuterol PRN.
On HD#2, patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
He was also noted to have a bandemia.
Later that evening, patient was noted to be hypotensive (82/42) and was transferred to the ICU for concern of sepsis, complicated by volume overload.
He had poor urine output which was treated with multiple IV fluid boluses with good response.
These were ordered and specifically ordered to be added onto patient's admission blood samples as it was felt that doing the labs on later samples after time and treatment with steroids would be of no diagnostic value.
Patient's respiratory distress resolved as his lactic acidosis improved.
Given the patient's rapid improvement on steroids, and lack of evidence of further sources of infection beyond his suspected pneumonia, Vancomycin was discontinued.
Urine lytes were sent and his calculated FeNa was consistent with a pre-renal etiology.
His acute renal failure improved with IV fluids and his creatinine was trending back down when patient was called out to the floor.
On the floor, the patient continued to do well without any recurrent symptoms.
#DM: Patient's outpatient oral hypoglycemics were held secondary to poor PO intake and he was covered with an insulin sliding scale with good control of his blood glucose levels.
#Prophylaxis: Patient received pepcid and bowel regimen; He was started on heparin but was noted to have decreasing platelets.
Epinephrine 1 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Injection ONCE MR1 (Once and may repeat 1 time) as needed for anaphylaxis for 1 doses.
