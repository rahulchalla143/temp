# Septic shock: Patient was treated with IVF, levophed (from [**2175**] to 2230 on [**11-28**].
), and empiric vanc/zosyn given a history of MDR pathogens.
Prostate exam was unremarkable, demonstrating no tenderness and there was no evidence of colitis or hepatobilliary disease on CT scan and no evidence of abscess on rectal.
Patient remained afebrile on floor and his clinical picture drastically improved.
# UTI: chronic retention at baseline req.

Of note, patient may benefit from a urinary diversion (ex: appendicovescular shunt) to eliminate the issue of chronic indwelling foley.
# Anemia: HCT at admission 34.5 trended down to nidus of 25.4 now 29.4 without intervention.
With normal MCV, chronic blood loss seems less likely.
RDW slightly elevated suggesting RBC production.
