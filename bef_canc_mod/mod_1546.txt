Admission Date:  [**2164-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, PEG tube, trach  History of Present Illness: 65 year old woman with history of PE on lifetime coumadin, asthma, recent CABG [**4-20**] with long stay complicated by PTX, a fib, and pleural effusions presents with nonproductive cough, dyspnea and low grade fevers x 5 days.
She saw her cardiologist on [**2164-5-21**] and CXR confirmed left sided pleural effusion.
Initially on [**2164-6-3**] she complained of a stomach virus with profuse vomitting then later dry heaving for a few days.
Due to her worsening symptoms she decided to come to the ED.
The patient was found to have a stable left sided pleural effusion but they could not tap because of an INR of 9.
She remained afebrile in the ED.
She was also given levoquin 750mg IV ONCE just prior to transfer and sent to the MICU given her unstable hemodynamics.
She also reports weight loss x 1 month.
She denied any chest pain, weight gain, abdominal pain, recent nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, calf pain, recent travel, hemoptysis, hematemesis, black or bloody stools, dysuria, urinary frequency, headache, neck stiffness.

She is independent and performs ADLs without limitation.
No tob or drugs.
Family History: No family history of lung or cardiac diseases.

Mother: [**Name (NI) 2481**] Maternal GM: Uterine cancer  Physical Exam: On admission: GEN: Chronically ill appearing pale woman in mild respiratory distress HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, MMM, op with ?thrush, RESP: Reduced breath sounds at left field [**2-12**] way down, reduced sounds at right base, no egophony or rales CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with global hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-6-8**], left ventricular systolic function is minimally improved and the large/complex left pleural effusion is no longer visualized.
Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-13**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
New hydropneumothorax in the left side with decreasing right basilar opacity and new ground glass opacities in the left lung.
Decrease in size of left pleural effusion; however, increasing size of right loculated pleural effusion.
No intrabdominal abscess or colitis.
Substantial decrease in the amount of free intraperitoneal gas.
Left hemidiaphragm is again not well seen, suggesting substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with history of PE on lifetime coumadin, asthma, recent CABG [**4-20**] complicated by PTX, a fib, and pleural effusions presents with nonproductive cough, dyspnea and low grade fevers.
She saw her cardiologist on [**2164-5-21**] and CXR confirmed left sided pleural effusion.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: most consistent with an acute pneumonia.
She most likely aspirated after her stomach virus and developed a bacterial pneumonia.
Although community acquired pathogens are most likely, she is also at risk for health-care associated organisms.
There may also be a component of reactive airway disease.
Acute CHF is also a possible contributor given elevated JVP, wheeze, and the pleural effusions.
She was subsequently broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin and completed 10 days of vanc/cef and 8 days of levofloxacin.
She underwent thoracentesis with placement of pigtail catheter initially, given loculated pleural effusion.
She did develop a small PTX during the above procedure, which was monitored with serial CXR, and subsequently self improved.
However, she was intubated on hospital day 3, in the setting of tachyarrhythmia (SVT) to HR 180s, dropped her pressures to SBP 70s.
She was slowly weaned from the ventilator, however, failed her first extubation from multiple causes including poor nutrition, deconditioning/weakness, hypertension, tachyarrhythmia, mild volume overload and anxiety.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: intermittently had episodes of SVT into HR 140s.
Patient is very tenuous as she develops a fib with RVR with hypotension with minimal exertion.
# Leukocytosis: felt to be related to pnuemonia and stress response.
# Hypotension: Patient with hypotension primarily in setting of rapid a fib, suggesting that she is dependent on her atrial kick.
She was also treated for early sepsis for pnuemonia.
# Free air in abdomen: Small amount of free air seen in abdomen after PEG tube placement.
G-tube study was done that showed all contrast in the stomach so this was felt likely to be expected amount of air with PEG placement and not pathologic.
# Anemia: Patient required red blood cell transfusion on 3 occasions in the ICU, though the patient never had any signficant bleeding, she remained guaiac negative and and so her anemia was felt most likely due to frequent blood draws, poor nutritional status and laboratory fluctiations.
Her HCT on the day of discharge is 26.5 and should be rechecked every 3-7 days and transfused for HCT <24 given her cardiac history.
# Left upper extremity swelling: LENIs negative for DVT.
Patient has small amount of free air seen on her ABD XRAY which is presumably due to PEG placement as patient has no abdominal pain, has good stool output.
-repeat Abd Xray to ensure improvement in free air -consider increasing fiber content of tube feeds if needed for constipation .
