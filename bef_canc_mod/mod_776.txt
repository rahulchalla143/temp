Admission Date:  [**2116-10-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2116-10-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year old man, well known to hepatobiliary service, after a recent admission to [**Hospital1 69**] during which he was treated for multiple liver abscesses.
Mr. [**Known lastname 52114**] is being transferred on [**2116-10-17**] from his rehabilitation facility with achy right upper quadrant pain for one day and a fever to 103.
The pain is similar but more mild than the pain he felt on his initial presentation.
He denies nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea or urinary symptoms.
There were no precipitating or palliative factors for this pain and there was no radiation to his back, groin or chest.
He also complains of a gassy right upper quadrant pain, times three or four days, which is aggravated by eating.
He also reports that his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, with which he was discharged on the previous admission, had increased output two days prior to admission, which was bilious but resolved prior to admission.
He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, chills, fevers or change in his stool habit.
His prior medical history includes hypertension, diverticulosis and knee surgery and the recent medical history with the liver abscesses.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His physical examination was notable for tachycardia as well as tenderness to palpation on the right side of his abdomen.
CAT scan on admission showed the following results:  Large complex fluid collection in the right mid abdomen, extending across the abscess.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgery service and was brought that evening to CAT scan for CT guided drainage of the large complex fluid collection in the mid abdomen.
The patient underwent CT guided drainage the night of admission and this fluid was sent for culture.
It eventually put out two strains of E. coli and two strains of Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
He defervesced but, on the next day, he was tachycardiac and febrile and had enlarging erythema along his right flank.
In addition, there was some air collection, suggestive of an infection of the subcutaneous tissue.
Overnight, the patient's erythema along the right flank slowly spread towards the upper thigh and groin area.
On [**10-19**], it was decided that the patient had a serious subcutaneous infection and he was taken to the operating room for emergent incision and debridement of this subcutaneous infection.
After proper consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 52115**] and a large amount of pus was removed from the subcutaneous tissues.
Notably, the fascial layers were intact and alive, rule out necrotizing fasciitis.
In addition, wound cultures sent during this operation subsequently grew out Methicillin resistant Staph aureus as well as Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
During dressing changes, he received intravenous Morphine, which controlled his pain well.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient's diet was slowly advanced to a regular diet, which he tolerated without nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
On physical examination, on the 26th, the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs.
CV:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally save for some bibasilar wheezes.
Abdomen: Obese with four surgical scars from this admission; one large transverse one in the periumbilical region and three smaller ones, two in the right flank and one in the inguinal region.
He also has a vertical midline abdominal wound that is enclosed by secondary intention.
His extremities are warm and well perfused, with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Abdominal wall infection.
Intra-abdominal infection.
Chronic blood loss anemia, requiring multiple blood transfusions.
Pleural effusions.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Postoperative atelectasis.
