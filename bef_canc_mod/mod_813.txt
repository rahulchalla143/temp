Pt was waiting for LUE fistula to mature, however, due to clot formation superior to the fistula it was unable to be used for HD.
On [**6-3**], she had a graft placed in her Right UE and had the fistula in her left UE "disconnected" and stitched over.
The bleeding stopped with application of pressure but then the new surgical graft on her RUE started to bleed.
Surgery checked the fistula and said that it was erythematous and indurated but not infected.
During the workup the patient became hypotensive with SBP's in the 80's and was adequately resuscitated with a 1 L fluid bolus.
Has had multiple regimens of chemotherapy c/b GVHD - Chronic Graft vs Host Disease, mild (cutaneous, liver) - CKD Stage V: Unclear if secondary to chemotherapy, cyclosporin, or GVHD.
Had LUE AV fistula placed but found to have occluded left brachiocephalic vessel on fistalugram.
Now with RUE fistula.
- Hyponatremia felt to be due to increased fluid intake - s/p Thyroidectomy for thyroid mass, pathology was benign - Herpes zoster c/b post-herpetic neuralgia s/p nerve block   Social History: Married with 2 children.

However, the more extensive bleeding was from her old left extremity fistula which was recently reversed and prompted to bleed by the squeezing of the blood pressure cuff during hemodialysis.
An ultrasound of the new fistula did not show evidence of infection, although there was a surrounding hematoma.
Although the patient had no localizing symptoms, she had a high index of suspicion for infection given her chronic immunosuppression with steriods for GVHD and elevated lactate.
The patient was afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge and was discharged on a 14 day course of vancomycin IV for possible line infection.
# Right upper extremity fistula: The patient was instructed in how to bandage and care for her new fistula by both the surgical team and nursing.
# Hypotension: She had one episode of hypotension in the ED with a SBP=80.
This was most likely secondary to the extensive bleeding at dialysis and was responsive to a 1L fluid bolus.
# Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to her ESRD and her hematocrit returned to her baseline prior to discharge.
