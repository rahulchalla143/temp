Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 54 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension, RLE claudication s/p bypass grafts, squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, and recent admission to Neurology for complete right vertebral occlusion with bilateral posterior circulation infarcts for which she was restarted on her Coumadin who now presents with vertigo, dysarthria, and right facial numbness described as pins and needles.
She has had recurrent dizziness with any movement.
At the same time this morning she noticed dysarthria and difficulty getting her words out.
She continues to have unchanged bilateral blurry vision from the last admission (see below), which remains present with each eye closed individually.
She denies missing any doses of her Coumadin and reports taking 6 mg daily at home, and had an outpatient INR check on Friday (but is unsure of the result).
She denies fevers/chills, cough/cold, diarrhea, or pain/burning on urination.
The patient was admitted to the Stroke service [**Date range (3) 31604**] for unsteady gait (felt like she was lurching back and forth) and blurred vision in the setting of being off Coumadin x3 days prior to a dental procedure (INR 1.1 on admission).
A Code Stroke was called, and exam showed visual acuity 20/25 bilaterally, full strength, mild dysmetria on FNF on left.
CTA head/neck showed complete occlusion of the distal right vertebral artery, with abnormal increased MTT and decreased cerebral blood volume within the right occipital lobe concerning for posterior circulation event (equivocal MTT abnormalities in the cerebellum).
MRI/MRA head showed multiple infarcts in bilateral posterior circulation territory in the setting of a very irregular distal right vertebral artery with a short segment of high-grade stenosis versus a short dissection.
There appears to have been interval partial recanalization of the right vertebral artery compared to the CTA.
Family History: Hx of maternal hypertension.
Physical Exam: Physical Examination: VS: temp 97.3, bp 150/90, HR 48, RR 18, SaO2 99% on RA Genl: Awake, slightly drowsy, nausea HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear CV: Bradycardic but regular, Nl S1, S2, III/VI systolic murmur best at the LLSB, no rubs or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake but slightly drowsy.
No right-left confusion.
No evidence of neglect.
Facial movement symmetric but ?
Palate elevation symmetric.

Pertinent Results: MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2116-7-2**] 11:12 AM Multiple new infarcts, extensively involving the brainstem as described above, with near total loss of flow signal within the intracranial arteries of the posterior circulation.
Two new tiny foci of infarction in the right cerebellum.
Multiple subacute evolving infarcts in bilateral posterior circulation territory.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 54 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension, RLE claudication s/p bypass grafts, squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, and recent admission to Neurology for complete right vertebral occlusion with bilateral posterior circulation infarcts for which she was restarted on her Coumadin who now presents with vertigo, dysarthria, and right facial numbness described as pins and needles.
Her exam is significant for nausea, dysarthria, decreased light touch in right V2 (normal pinprick), slight weakness of left deltoid and triceps, and ataxia of the left>right arm with overshoot on the left.
Patient continued to decline and was found to have Multiple new infarcts, extensively involving the brainstem, with near total loss of flow signal within the intracranial arteries of the posterior circulation.
Pt became unresponsive with non purposeful eye movements.
She had deep agonal breaths.
She had a heavy phlegmy cough but was not moving any secretions.
Discharge Condition: expired   Discharge Instructions: Patient was found to have Multiple new infarcts, extensively involving the brainstem, with near total loss of flow signal within the intracranial arteries of the posterior circulation.
