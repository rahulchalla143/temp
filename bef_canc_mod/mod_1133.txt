He denies chest pain or lightheadedness.
He was evaluated by cardiac surgery and deemed to be of prohibitive extreme surgical risk for conventional surgical AVR.

No discoloration, nontender.
Extremities: 1+ lower extremity edemaleft, trace edema RLE.
2+ edema, tight fingers with decreased ROM c/w rheum arth.
Advanced a 20 mm x 6 cm Tyshak balloon and inflated while rapid ventricular pacing at 200 bpm to arrest the heart.
No significant coronary disease 2.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Dilated RV cavity.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Given severity of TR, PASP may be underestimated due to elevated RA pressure.
Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.4 cm2).
At least moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral subpleural interstitial opacities are noted, most likely representing nonspecific interstitial lung disease.
No masses or consolidations to suggest infectious process or neoplasm is demonstrated.
Small amount of left pleural effusion is present.
Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine but no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm is demonstrated.
No mediastinal, hilar or axillary pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
Pulmonary artery is substantially enlarged up to 4.2 cm with also enlargement of the right, 3 cm, and left, 2.7 cm arteries, highly suspicious for pulmonary hypertension.
No pericardial effusion is present.
There is no evidence of bowel wall dilatation or bowel wall thickening.
CT PELVIS: Inguinal hernia containing a most likely small bowel loop is noted without strangulation.
No lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted in the imaged portion of the skeleton in abdomen and pelvis.
Extensive degenerative changes are seen.
Small pericardial effusion is present.
Coronary arteries have conventional origin.
Aorta is calcified with focal aneurysmatic dilatation at the level of the aortic arch.
No aneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta throughout is demonstrated.
Substantial dilatation of celiac trunk is demonstrated up to 12 cm, aneurysmatic.
CT criteria worrisome for pulmonary hypertension.
Extensive coronary and aortic valve calcifications consistent with known aortic stenosis.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Inguinal hernia containing small bowel loop with no current evidence of obstruction.
Substantial enlargement of the prostate.

: none   Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old gentleman with history of severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation on low dose coumadin, systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), h/o DVT, HIT, GI bleed on coumadin and colon CA s/p resection came to [**Hospital1 18**] for a corevalvae for severe aortic stenosis.
# Severe aortic stenosis: [**Location (un) 109**] 0.4cm2, peak gradient 60mmHg prior to corevalve.
Currently doing well following surgery, no evidence of perivalvular leak or other complications.
[**7-10**] echo showed   trace paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
# Bradycardia: Noted to have bradycardia in the 30s prior to corevalve placement, so opted to have permanent pacemaker placed during corevalve procedure.We gave him cefazolin 2g IV q8H for 3 days as per protocol for placing a pacemaker.
No further issues of bradycardia during post-op course  # Chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure: most recent EF 40% on TEE .
# Atrial fibrillation:  At home he is rate controlled with metoprolol and anticoagulated with coumadin at home.
# Hematuria: Patient had hematuria after Foley placement.
Hematuria resolved in on [**2149-7-10**].
We felt this was most likely from some blood loss from the procesure as well as from his hematuria.
Differential included: blood loss from hematuria vs hemolytic anemia from corevalve causing shearing of RBCs vs GIB (though he has adenocarcinoma s/p colectomy GIB unlikely bc he did not have bowelmovements) vs TTP (he did have low platlets as well however his kidney function, mental status were fine he has no fever either).
There may also be a hemodiltuion effect bc he is net positive 3L since he has been and his platelets are also lowWe did not transfuse as he was not symptomatic and his Ht was stable.
No recurrent signs of acute anemia.
Most likely from blood loss from the procedure.
We continued to monitor his platlets and there was no further acute drop  # H/o HIT: Bivalrudin used in the peri-op period rather than heparin, however it was stopped.
# Discharged on lower dose of lisinopril than admitted with.
He was discharged without a current dose  #[**7-10**] echo (post corevalave) showed trace paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID do not give if he has diarrhea 3.
Warfarin 5 mg PO DAILY16 INR goal 2-2.5   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 701**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe aortic stenosis s/p corevalve and permanent pacemaker placement Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure Atrial Fibrillation Hyperlipidemia Hematuria on high dose anticoagulation therapy HIT- heparin induced thrombocytopenia [**2147**]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a smooth post-operative course and we moved you down to the main cardiology floor from the CCU.
