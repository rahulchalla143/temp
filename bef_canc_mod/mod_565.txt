Now readmitted with increased SOB and weight gain (148 on [**11-13**], 153 on [**11-14**], goal is 132).
CXR showed worse right pleural effusion aas compared to previous.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR [**Month/Day/Year 31820**], RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
Chronic mechanical hemolysis 8.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery  Social History: no hx of etoh or tobacco, lives at home alone, widower.
weight 153 lbs General: uncomfortable, mild distress, intubated HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic head, no nuchal rigidity, anicteric sclera, moist mucous membranes.
Neck: No thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
Chest: chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, lungs with decreased breath sounds, left greater than right.
III/VI systolic murmur, II/IV diastolic murmur Abd: Normoactive BS, NT and ND.
No masses or organomegaly Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness.
Ext: NO cyanosis, no clubbing.
2+ symetric edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis by doppler pulses bilaterally Integument: no rash Neuro: Solmnmelent but answer questions yes, no.
The aorta is slightly calcified and unfolded.
There is a moderate sized right sided pleural effusion.
These findings are consistent with left heart failure.
The severity of the cardiac decompensation is not significantly changed since the prior study.
A pacemaker overlies the left shoulder region with a single electrode extending into the apex of the right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: 1) Evidence of prior surgery.
There is now left ventricular decompensation of moderate severity associated with a right sided effusion.
Therefore he was intubated and remained intubated until [**11-18**] when he was successfully extubated/  The patient's respitary failure was though to be due to a combination of CHF, a large pleural effusion and possibly a PNA.
He was aggressively diuresed, and his plueral effusion was tapped and found to be transudative, and he was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Repeat CXR showed increased right pleural effusion compared to the CXR after the thoracentesis.
Pt achieved his ideal dry weight of 60.5 kg at one point, but wt returned to 63.5 kg which was thought to be secondary to sodium retention from the prednisone he took for gout flare.
CAD: The paitent is s/p RCA stenting on [**2128-7-30**] for reversible inferior wall defect.
Rhythm: Chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**].
Pt was initially started on digoxin for rate control while he was hypotensive and on dopamine gtt.
Chronic anemia [**1-26**] mechanical hemolysis MDS, and anemia of chronic disease.
9.Mechanical valve: Pt was on Coumadin which was held initiallya and bridged with Heparin gtt for procedures.
Gout: Pt developed a severe left foot pain localized at tarsal area.
The area appeared erythematous and tender to palpation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation Pneumonia Gout A-fib CAD   Discharge Condition: Stable, pt near his ideal weight, breathing on room air.
