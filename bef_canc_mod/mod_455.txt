Admission Date:  [**2167-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-11-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Indomethacin / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Echocardiogram CT scan   History of Present Illness: 86 year old man with Hx.
16 separate Cath's in our system, HTN, DM, Hyperchol, who presents to the ED after having several days of intermittant upper back pain with ratiation to the bilateral shoulders (in the past this has been described as an anginal equivalent for him).
Initially, he did not take any SL NTG for these episodes, but last night, had pain as above, but also involving the chest.
He took NTG with relief, but had to repeat this three times through the night, and at 5 am this morning, due to recurrent pain at rest, he came to the ED.
On arrival, history and nature of pain were concerning for a PE, CT neg for Ao dissection.
In the scanner, chest pain worsened, so put on nitro and hep gtt, and pain gone.
Became asymptomatic shortly after.
Past Medical History: * CAD * DM * hyperlipdemia * CHF * HTN * TIAs * GERD * upper GI bleed (no NSAIDS aside from ASA) * DVD * iron deficiency anemia * glaucoma * hyperkalemia with ace inhibitors * MI (most recent [**1-30**]) * CABG [**2146**], [**2156**] CABG times 2, multiple PCI's as follows: .
At end, 20% residual stenosis of the SVG with Timi 3 flow and no dissection.
No pain or ecg changes.
no tbx or ethanol.
was in the navy for some years   Family History: no CAD  Physical Exam: PE: .

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Lung findings consistent in appearance with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Hiatal hernia .
CXR [**11-21**]: Findings most consistent with moderate congestive heart failure.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
There is diffuse plaquing proximally.
There is a 80% stenosis of the LAD before S1 and D2; the LAD is then totally occluded thereafter.
There is an ostial occlusion of the LCX.
The RCA has proximal and mid total occlusions.
Vein graft angiography revealed SVG --> LPL with an 60% ostial SVG stenosis, a 40% mid-SVG stenosis, and a 90% mid-SVG stenosis with TIMI I-II flow beyond the stenoses.
Successful predilation using 4.0 X 20mm minirail balloon, stenting using 3.5 X 24mm Taxus stent and post dilation using 4.0 X 09mm NC Ranger balloon of the mid SVG (to LPL) with lesion reduction from 90% to 0% with plaque shift distally successfully treated with primary stenting using 3.5 X12mm Taxus stent.
Successful direct stenting of the proximal SVG (to LPL) using 3.5 X 12mm Taxus stent and post dilation using 4.0 X 9mm NC Ranger balloon with lesion reduction from 60% to 0%.
Successful direct stenting of the ostial SVG (to LPL) stenosis using 3.5 X 20mm and 3.5 X 08mm Taxus stents and post dilation using 4.0 X 9mm NC Ranger and 4.5 X 12 maverick balloons with lesion reduction from 60% to 5%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
TTE [**11-24**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include  inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 86 year old man with MMP, lengthy cardiac history incl CABG times 2, mult PCI, who presents with CP at rest, initially CP alleviated by NTG GTT, markers flat.
CP: Patient initially thought to have possible PE or aortic dissection.
Patient chest pain free during rest of admission.
CHF: Patient initially thought to have some volume overload and was diuresed.
He was also instructed to follow a low sodium diet.
Increased Imdur and Nifedipine for better BP control as pressures occasionally elevated to 160's-170's.
Held oral agents while inpatient initially because of catheterization and dye load and then because of ARF.
Obtained urine studies which were significant for rare eos suggesting AIN.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p cardiac catheterization and stent placement   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please come to the emergency department if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or other concerning symptoms.
