Shock/Hypotension: On the day of admission, the patient was hypotensive requiring pressors.
Given CAD history and TTE showing worsened EF, there was a high concern for cardiogenic shock.
There was no evidence to suggest hypovolemia or acute blood loss.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on admission ([**8-21**]) and inital pressures were as follows: CVP 9, RV 26/17, PAP 30/26, PCWP 21, which were felt to be more consistent with sepsis then cardiogenic shock, in the setting of a recent surgery.
Of note, the patient was afebrile throughout admission.
CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed ascites and free fluid in the pelvis, but no abscess or other site of infection was identified.
There was no record of difficult oxygenation on recent surgery.

No evidence of ischemic event on admission.
Pt did have some chest pain overnight on [**8-24**] and intermittently the following day.
The pain was reproducible with palpation of the epigastrium and did respond to treatment with Maalox.
There were no EKG changes at this time, and cardiac enzymes remained within normal limits.
Norvasc was held due to inital episode of hypotension.
has an ICD for history of NSVT.
SBO ([**8-19**]): Gyn-Onc followed along with patient during hospitalization, with no evidence of surgical complication or infection.
