Acute Respiratory Failure:  Pt was admitted with acute hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure and emergently transferred to the MICU.
She was intubated and placed on AC ventilation without problem.
Her CXR showed new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [**3-2**] hypertensive emergency (i.e.
forward failure due to increased afterload).
She was sedated with propofol prior to this and her precipitous drop in MAP was thought to be [**3-2**] propofol and vasovagal reaction from intubation.
Per pt's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is quite sensitive to anti-hypertensives and is at risk for orthostatic hypotension.
HTN thought to be secondary to chronic volume overload and significant vessel non-compliance.
Plasma metanephrin was sent off and pt ruled out for pheochromocytoma.
Renal Failure:  Dialysis was attempted on pt [**8-22**] but failed due to labile BP's.
SPEP sent to rule out multiple myeloma.
Altered Mental Status:  Pt was admitted to the hospital for altered mental status, per daughter, thought to be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy vs uremia vs. infection.
Leukocytosis:  Pt developed an elevated WBC count after being admitted to the MICU.
Leukocytosis resolved without antibiotics.
