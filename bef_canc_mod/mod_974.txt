RADIOLOGY  Final Report  [**2110-2-23**] 10:27 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: R/O ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old man s/p s/p esophagectomy, [**Last Name (un) 1236**].
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: R/O ptx REASON FOR EXAM: Rule out pneumothorax, patient post esophagectomy, anastomosis leak s/p bedside debridement.
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged with mild possibility mediastinal widening.
There is a small lower lobe atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusion have increased in the left side, given horizontal straight contour in the left CP angle, this is suggestive of a small air fluid level consistent with small pneumothorax.
There has been interval decrease in subcutaneous emphysema in the left side of the neck.
esophageal an Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old man with esophageal ca s/p transhiatal esophagectomy, now with wound dehiscence REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PLEASE EVAL.
esophageal anastomosis.
INDICATION: 60-year-old man with esophageal carcinoma status post transhiatal esophagectomy with gastroesophageal anastomosis.
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive air and soft tissue stranding within the soft tissues of the neck.
At the area of anastomosis, at the level of T1-2 there is a fluid collection with gas bubbles, consistent with anastomotic leak.
There is a simple fluid collection at the level of hiatus, without enhancing wall, measuring approximately 5 x 4.8 x 3.7 cm.
This could represent a postoperative fluid collection or sequelae of perforation tracking down the mediastinum.
There are trace bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis bilateral, lungs are otherwise clear.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There are multiple small subcentimeter lymphatic nodes noted in the mediastinum.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is an extensive stranding and marked edema of omentum and transverse mesocolon, that could still be consistent with postoperative state.
There are aortic vascular calcifications.
There is no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphatic nodes.
There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Upper mediastinal air and fluid collection, consistent with anastomotic leak at the level of the esophagogastric anastomosis at the level of T1-T2.
Larger fluid collection with thin wall at the level of the hiatus along the posterior gastric wall.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue fat stranding, consistent with wound dehiscence.
Interval development of bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, extending into the iliac arteries bilaterally.
Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 71037**] who was s/p transhiatal esophagectomy POD#12 was re-admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2110-2-23**] with dyspnea, cough and dehiscence of esophagogastric anastomosis seen on CT scan.
His neck wound was debrided at bedside using sterile scissors and forceps, yielding moderate amount of yellow fluid along w/ serosanguinous discharge and was then packed with sterile kerlix.
Frequent dressing changes (~every 2-3 hours) with sterile packing the neck wound were performed (initially w/ sterile gauze and then w/ iodoform gauze as wound size decreased).
His WBC continued to trend down and was within normal limits after [**2110-2-24**] and he remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Throughout the hospital course, he was ambulatory and in no distress.
Phenazopyridine 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for dysuria for 3 days.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 486**] [**Hospital1 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal anastomotic leak after esophagectomy   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4738**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] if you have increased or foul smellling drainage from your neck incision, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.
