No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Eccentric MR jet.
Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Conclusions PRE CPB The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A large secundum atrial septal defect is present (2 cm in length).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at least miild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
The interatrial septum is s/p repair with a patch.
No discreet jets are seen crossing the interatrial septum.
There are some small pinholes of left to right flow seen at the edge of the patch which disappeared after protamine reversal.
Initially after separation from bypass, inferior EKG changes felt to be secondary to right coronary air embolus were seen.
After resolution of the EKG changes, the mitral regirgitation was similar as to that seen pre-CPB.
Brief Hospital Course: She was taken to the operating room on [**2158-11-7**] where she underwent an ASD clsure via mini-sterntomy after a minimally invasive approach was aborted secondary to pleural adhesions.
She also sustained an injury to her right common femoral artery which was repaired.
She had atrial fibrillation for which her beta blocker was increased and she was started on amiodarone, pt converted with amiodarone to NSR.
Reapeat x-ray no sequele.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
Shower, no baths, no lotions, creams or powders to incisions.
