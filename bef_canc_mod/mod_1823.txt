She was admitted first to the Neuro ICU and then to the general/epilepsy neurology floor team from [**Date range (1) 25045**]/07 after having a generalized convulsion on [**7-23**] at work ([**Hospital3 **] neurology department).
Numerous push button events were captured without evidence of epileptiform activity.
She continued to have convulsions while in the ICU on [**2142-7-24**] despite the negative EEG evidence for epileptic events.
She had a workup for reversible seizure triggers.
The patient had a severely depressed TSH suggesting possible hypothyroidism as her trigger.
She became very angry after this fall saying that the 1:1 sitter didn't try to prevent it and the nurses were slow to respond.

She developed an inability to walk two days prior to discharge.
This appeared non-physiologic on physical exam and resolved spontaneously on the day of dicharge without specific intervention.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Convulsions non-epileptic convulsions.
No apparent distress.
No objective neurological defecits were detected on physical exam.
Neurological exam is presumed to be normal but the patient will not comply completely with formal testing.
These include not climbing up high ladders, not driving a car for the next six months, only swiming when supervised, and generally not putting yourself in situations where you might get injured if you happen to have a seizure.
