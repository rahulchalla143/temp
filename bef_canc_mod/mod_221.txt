HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a past medical history significant for CAD, status post a five vessel CABG in [**2157-10-26**], hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, whose cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted a carotid bruit on a routine physical in [**2162-11-26**].
An ultrasound in [**2162-12-26**] right ventricular significant right carotid plaque with 80-99% stenosis and a left moderate carotid plaque with 60-69% stenosis.
Then, an MRI in [**2163-3-26**] revealed greater than 80% stenosis of the right internal carotid and approximately 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid.
The patient underwent elective carotid catheterization today which revealed a 90% critical stenosis after the bifurcation of the right ICA at the bulb.
Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Status post hernia repair.
General:  The patient was a pleasant male in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the bases.
Groin:  Right-no hematoma or ecchymosis or tenderness.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, +2 dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
No angina with nonspecific T wave changes, 0.5 to 1 mm horizontal/downsloping ST depressions inferolaterally noted with exercise which resolved by ten minutes of recovery.
An EF was found to be 55% with no wall motion abnormalities.
Interval improvement with normal myocardial perfusion and no fixed defects.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 73-year-old male with CAD, status post CABG five years ago, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, here today for elective right carotid stent that went well except for a vasovagal episode with hypotension and bradycardia during the catheterization now on a Neo drip, currently doing well.
The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
