Admission Date:  [**2185-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-9-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Posterior tibial artery bypass with reverse saphenous  vein graft.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 25% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents with altered mental status x 1 day.
Patient was discharged Tuesday night following admission for SBP and foot infection; family states that he was slightly confused at time of discharge.
Wife denies any fevers or rigors at home.
History of possible renal failure and neuropathy from diabetes.
Coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending angioplasty x 2 in 12/89 and [**8-/2167**].
Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal atrophy.
Family History: The patient's father died of colon cancer at age 55; mother is alive in her late 80s with hypertension, status post CABG for an MI, and with history of stroke.
Multiple b/l heal fissures and ischemic ulcers with dry eschar on digits and right lateral midfoot, largest b/t 1&2 digits on R. Also lesions on L foot.
+paronychia right medial hallux.
Erythema of the forefoot and lateral foot on the R. Some dependent rubor of B feet.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2185-2-18**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
ECHO [**2185-2-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The mitral regurgitation is reduced.
CXR [**2185-2-19**]: A single portable image of the chest was obtained and compared to the prior examination dated [**2185-2-18**] demonstrating no significant interval change.
An enlarged cardiac silhouette associated with pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to underlying atelectasis, difficult to exclude pneumonia.
No new focal opacities are seen.
The right central venous line is grossly unchangedand terminates within the expected region of the cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 20-30% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents after recent discharge with altered mental status x 1 day and continuing chronic bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
#) Altered mental status: etiology unclear, but hyperviscosity secondary to Waldentrom's is unlikely given serum viscosity of 1.3 (nl 1.4-1.8).
After careful review, it appears patient has been experiencing increasing lower extremity pain and has self increased pain medication dosing.
After metabolic etiologies were excluded, it appears both altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory arrest were medicaiton induced.
Patient was re-evaluated by podiatry regarding foot ulcers, as these seem to be the source of his severe pain.
Septic shock was still most likely etiology pt hypotension on admission.
No evidence of sepsis or infection in our system.
#) Foot ulcers: As above, these are likely cause of severe pain.
Patient has known severe vascular disease with prior superficial femoral artery angioplasty.
Podiatry re-evaluated case and requested doppler studies of lower extremities, which confirmed severe disease.
Vascular surgery was consulted and decided to perform angiogram which revealed severe occlusive disease of the right lower extremity.
#) Cardiac: (a) Vessels: Pt p/w mild troponin leak, likely due to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis and renal disease.
Patient remained asymptomatic and serial ECG's showed return to baseline.
(b) Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical systolic function suggestive of non-ischemic etiology; ECHO [**2-17**] essentially unchanged with LVEF 20-30%.
#) OSA: pt with h/o OSA on CPAP, but has not been using for months now - will monitor overnight & apply supplemental oxygen prn - encourage family to bring in home machine .
#) Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia: serum viscosity essentially stable, no acute issues .
There were no complications intraoperatively and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
