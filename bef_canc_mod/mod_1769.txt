On left side a mild amount of calcified plaque is seen in the common and internal carotid arteries.
On the right side peak systolic velocities were 24 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 203 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
No ICA/CCA ratio could be determined on the right side due to complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery.
Occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.
Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
Filling defect in a moderate segment of the right superficial femoral artery may represent thrombus versus dissection.
Occluded dorsalis pedis and plantar arteries in the right foot.
Significant atherosclerotic disease in the lower extremity vasculature as described above.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 8711**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: SUN [**2195-7-5**] 8:53 PM   Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o male with PMHx of Ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe AS, Severe PVD and other medical comorbidities admitted after PEA arrest with CHF exacerbation s/p diuresis and hemodynamic optimization  # PUMP: ECHO shows LVEF of 45% with mild MR and AS.
ST depressions noted on EKGs from OSH.
The patient did not have any remarkable arrhythmias secondary to condition during this hospital stay.
# PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: A CTA of the lower extremities was done, showing the following: 1.
Filling defect in a moderate segment of the right superficial femoral artery may represent thrombus versus dissection.
Occluded dorsalis pedis and plantar arteries in the right foot.
Significant atherosclerotic disease in the lower extremity vasculature as described above.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
On the night of admission his right foot was noted to be cool to touch without an appreciation for a dorsalis pedis pulse.
The vascular surgery team did not recommend intervention as he is a poor surgical candidate and the operation would be major.
His right lower extremity became warmer over the next few days and a pulse returned without clinical consequence to his R foot.
Inactive issues: DM2: The patient has known non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, type 2.
MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 1000 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 582**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: #Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with a preserved EF of 45% #Severe 3-vessel Coronary Artery Disease with a 100% occlusion of the RCA (with collaterals) and an 80% occlusion of his LAD that is not amenable to percutaneous intervention #Severe Aortic Stenosis with a gradient of 40mmHg and a valve area of 1.0sq-cm #Peripheral Vascular Disease #Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient is alert and oriented x 3 and in good mental state.
Ambulatory Status: _____________---______   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 111747**],  You came to the hospital after a cardiac arrest at an outside hospital with congestive heart failure and intubated (tube in your airway).
The Metoprolol was higher than your home dose because we wanted to tightly control your heart rate given your severe aortic stenosis.
These are for your congestive heart failure and blood pressure.
After your cardiac catherization, you developed significant ischemia in your right foot.
We consulted vascular surgery who suggested we put you on a Heparin drip (a blood thinner) and your pulses returned and your foot became warm and pink.
After your catherization, you also developed a hematoma in your right thigh.
You have significant coronary artery disease and valve disease that we believe cannot be treated appropriately with medicines alone.
