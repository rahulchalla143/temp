# Resp Distress: Fever to 103.6, hx of worsening productive cough, and leukocytosis highly suggestive of PNA in this elderly female with severe underlying lung dz.
Lasix given emprirically given poor lung exam although fluid overload not evident on exam or imaging.
taper over 10 days - O2 NC to target sat in low 90s - should have pulmonary consultant once on floor for COPD .
#  Fever/leukocytosis: Although most likely source of infection is lung as above, fairly unmpressive imaging begs further consideration of infectious sources.
Abdominal tenderness is minimal with L>R.
#  Interval progression of CT findings: minimal but need to d/w rads whether this could be a recurrence of her malignancy .
# SVT: given hx of SVT exacerbated by albuterol, will continue AV nodal agents.
