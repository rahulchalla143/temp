No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-7-1**], left ventricular cavity size is smaller and the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced.
Partially reversible, large, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD territory.
Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion defect involving the PDA territory.
Severe systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the mid anteroseptal, distal anterior, distal septal, distal inferior and apical walls as well as the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls.

# ARF: Likely prerenal, creatinine was up to 9 on admission and patient required MICU admission for hypotension and hyperkalemia.
Renal US was unremarkable for structural renal disease.
Her ACEI was held given the renal failure and hypotension.
# Diarrhea: The diarrhea is likely the cause of the patient's presenting hypovolemia.
Stool studies for c diff and bacterial diarrhea were negative.
# elevated troponin: There was a mild troponin elevation to 0.06 with negative CK and MB in setting of hypotension and ARF.
There were lateral ECG changes.
She had a positive stress in [**8-2**] for which intervention has been considered though not yet pursued.
# Pancreatitis This was likely secondary to acute illness.
She has no abdominal pain.
# systolic CHF with EF 25%: She remained hypovolemic during the admission.
# Access - 2 PIV .
# PPx - Heparin SC; H2Blocker .
# FEN - cardiac diet .
# Communication - Discussed with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73900**]; Also spoke to PCP office, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31**] and faxed this report to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 73901**].
If patient weight increases by more than 2 pounds or she is clinically fluid overloaded, please restart lasix for fluid overload.
