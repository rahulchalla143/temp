STUDIES: CXR [**2178-4-21**]: IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No acute abdominal pathology, especially no retroperitoneal bleed.
Status post urinary diversion with ileal conduit with prominent lower ureters, unchanged since the prior study.
Fibroid uterus.
LENI'S [**2178-4-22**]: CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-30**], the current study is very limited secondary to poor echo windows/patient body habitus and limited data acquisition in the setting of a 'Code Blue' on the patient prior to study termination; cannot compare.
There is hazy opacification of both lungs, with possible volume overload or congestive failure.
Mild atelectasis at both lung bases.
Little change since prior study, with moderate congestive failure, interstitial prominence.
Low lung volumes.
Since the prior study, lung volumes are slightly improved with improvement of bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no evidence of focal consolidation.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
TTE [**2178-5-1**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-4-23**], findings similar but technically suboptimal.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

URINE CX [**2178-4-26**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL CONTAMINATION.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48yo female with extensive medical history including multiple allergies, asthma/COPD, multiple hypersensitivity skin reactions requiring previous burn unit admission, who was admitted with chief complaint of body pain and swelling.
Patient's exam did not demonstrate overt swelling on the medical floor although she was diffusely tender to palpation.
Initial concern for cardiac etiologies, PE, low albumin states to explain anasarca.
Pt developed erythematous skin rash and dermatology was consulted.
Hospital course also complicated by fevers, initially attributed to inflammation; however, pt grew MRSA from 1 blood culture and Klebsiella in urine.
Pt remained afebrile and and was continued on Linezolid per ID recs until [**2178-5-14**].
# Body pain, swelling: Concern for anasarca, though pt did not appear particularly edematous on examination.
Most likely combination of hypoalbuminemia and possible prodrome of hypersensitivity skin reaction (discussed below).
Pt's albumin quite low, likely [**3-4**] poor nutritional intake.
UA without protein and patient does not have a history of cirrhosis in addition to normal LFT's.
Other DDx included volume overload.
CE's were negative, and EKG was sinus rhythm with no ST changes/TWI.
Echo was a limited study, but demonstrated preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Other possibilites included venous insuffiency, or DVT/PE.
Edema improved, though progression to bullous skin rash as discussed below.
# Bullous Hypersensitivity skin reaction: Pt has a history of drug induced hypersensitivity skin reaction requiring treatment in burn unit and intubation on previous admissions.
As above, pt's developed erythematous and bullous skin reaction on upper extremities, back, buttocks and thighs.
Dermatology was consulted, and thought this likely represented previous reactions.
Skin exam on discharge greatly improved with no more sloughing, and pt had minimal to no pain.
Initially concerned for Asthma/COPD exacerbation and completed 5 day course of Azithromycin.
Also concern for related to skin reaction as above vs. IVIG treatment; though O2 requirement did not increase on IVIG and she continued to have oxygen requirement after skin improved.
Other possibilities include restrictive defect given body habitus and possible component of OSA as desats seem to occur more often at night when pt may be sleeping.
Pt had normal O2 sats and no complaints of dyspnea on day of discharge.
# Fevers: Pt developed fevers during IVIG treatment.
However, pt continued to spike fevers after completion of course.
On discharge, she was hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile for >72 hours.
# MRSA in BCx: Grew MRSA in 1 blood culture in addition to fevers as above concerning for bacteremia.
TTE was negative for vegetations, but suboptimal.
She remained afebrile for >72hrs at time of discharge.
# Klebsiella in urine: Initially thought to be UTI given positive UA and foul smelling urine per report.
However, given concern for toxicity and unclear if UTI since now symptoms, discontinued per ID recs since thought to be colonization.
# Pain control: Pain secondary to skin reaction.
On discharge, she was given a limited dose of Oxycodone as her pain had improved.
# [**Month/Day/Year **], pseudoseizures: History of non-epileptic [**Month/Day/Year 54422**] for which she has been seen by neurology.
Concern for psychiatric component as well.
She had several witnessed events which involved clenching bed rails, clicking mouth noises, eyes rolling back in her head.
Electrolytes and prolactin drawn immediately after the event were significant for normal electrolytes and elevated prolactin (97).
These events resolved without need for medication.
Neurology was consulted, and recommended to continue same dose of depakote for now as no clear evidence of [**Month/Day/Year 54422**].
# Hyponatremia: Na found to be low in setting of fevers, insensible losses secondary to skin reaction.
Pt was treated with IVF's and hyponatremia resolved.
# Anemia: Normocytic anemia.
No s/s bleeding.
Iron studies with no clear picture, suggested iron deficiency anemia, though no symptoms of bleeding.
Other etiologies include hemolysis, though Tbili, LDH were normal with elevated Haptoglobin.
# Constipation: Treated with senna, colace, lactulose prn.
# Abdominal pain: Pt initially presented with abdominal pain.
CT abdomen demonstrated no acute change and no RP bleed.
Pt's abdominal pain resolved.
LFT's were trended and were normal except for mild elevation in AP, which downtrended.
No abdominal pain for several days prior to discharge.
