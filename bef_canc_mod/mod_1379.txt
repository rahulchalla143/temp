Possible hematocrit level suggests this is hemorrhagic in etiology, but an underlying mass cannot be excluded and MRI should be considered.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is moderate right lateral ventricular blood, and a small amount of blood sedimenting in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] region.
Head CTA [**10-25**]: IMPRESSION: Large right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.
No definite aneurysm or AVM is seen.
Please note that a small AVM can be compressed by the hematoma and not be detectable on CTA.
It consists of multiple fragments of blood clots admixed with thin strands of tan white soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.
The vascular malformation or congophilic angiopathy.
No obvious tumor, but would permanents to be definite.
It consists of multiple fragments of dark red hematoma and soft tissue measuring 8 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.
Evolving large right parietal intraparenchymal hematoma.
No evidence of extension of hemorrhage.
No evidence of associated mass.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood with postoperative changes in the right frontoparietal region with small amount of blood products at the surgical site.
Mild vascular displacement and diminished and delayed filling of the frontoparietal arterial branches could be secondary to mild swelling and postoperative change in this region.
No arteriovenous malformation is seen.
No sinus thrombosis is identified.
Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
Left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

CT without contrast showed large mixed attenuation in the right parietal lobe with associated mass effect including compression of the right lateral ventricle, mod right lateral ventricular blood, and a small amount of blood sedimenting in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] region.
Pt found to be hypertensive to 160's, and was given prn labetalol with effect.
