No new pulmonary abnormalities.
Final Report TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.
INDICATION: Followup of small right-sided pneumothorax.
The previous small right- sided apical pneumothorax cannot be identified any more.
The lateral view discloses a mild degree of displacement of the subepicardial fat line, consistent with some remaining pericardial effusion.
The mild degree of posterior pleural sinus blunting is postoperative as it was not present on the initial study.
No new pulmonary infiltrates or atelectasis are seen.
Aortic valve disease.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Right ventricular function.
Valvular heart disease.

Large sized pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic guidance provided for placement of femorally placed arteraila nd venous access cannulae Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an independent workstation.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
No other change in valvular structure and function   Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name8 (MD) 6507**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2188-12-5**] 15:19     Brief Hospital Course: In the ED a transesophageal echo revealed a Type A dissection with pericardial effusion and cardiac compression.
He awoke intact and was extubated the following morning, having been kept intubated overnight due to some difficulty intubating him.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and Amiodarone was given with conversion to sinus rhythm.
He continued to have intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and coumadin was started for anticoagulation.
Ultrasound of right arm due to edema revealed non occlusive venous clot, continues on coumadin.
