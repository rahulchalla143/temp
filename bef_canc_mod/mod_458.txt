Admission Date:  [**2146-10-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-11-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-11-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Demerol / Haloperidol / Ativan / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue and Fevers, Melena  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Liver biopsy [**First Name3 (LF) **] (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) repeat [**First Name3 (LF) **] (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)  [**11-7**] - Exploratory laparotomy, duodenostomy, and oversewing of bleeding location on the ampulla.
History of Present Illness: 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who is status post liver transplantation on [**2145-12-7**].
After his liver transplantation, his course was complicated by recurrent hepatitis C with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis.
He was treated with Infergen and ribavirin, but this was discontinued as the patient developed seizures on this therapy.
His recurrent hepatitis C was therefore addressed by changing his immunosuppression from Prograf to rapamycin.
The switch to rapamycin was also done due to the fact that he had hepatocellular carcinoma, and evidence has demonstrated reduced recurrence of HCC in patients on rapamycin therapy.
The patient was recently admitted to the hospital in early [**Month (only) **] due to abnormal liver function tests.
His liver biopsy demonstrated moderate acute cellular rejection.
His liver biopsy demonstrated no features of acute cellular rejection, but there was evidence of grade 1 inflammation and stage I-II fibrosis.
The patient describes being extremely fatigued for one week, but decided to come to the ED when he had fevers to 102.8 last night with chills.
He describes having diarrhea [**2-21**] bm per day despite using lomotil.
However, he notes that his BM have not changed in frequency or consistency recently- instead he has had diarrhea since starting on an extensive course of liver medications, including bactrim for prophyolaxis while on sirolimus and prednisone taper.
He does not that the color of his diarrhea has changed in the past few days from brown to caramel colored.
He has some mild abdominal pain that he associates with his diarrhea, but no RUQ pain.
He denies chest pain, SOB, dysuria or change in urinary frequency.
He also denies confusion or change in skin color or abdominal girth.
CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED showing no acute intraabdominal pathology.
He was started on PO vanc for presumptive C diff, and was given 1 mg Rapamycin per GI recs.
- HCV: Genotype unknown.
Liver biopsy in [**9-/2144**] showed stage 4 cirrhosis and small well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Found to have grade 1 esophageal varices on EGD in 4/[**2143**].
Developed hepatic encephalopathy in [**2142**] requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**], started on lactulose with good effect.
These meds were discontinued due to suicidal ideation.
- HCC: Recently noted 1.4 cm enhancing lesion on liver imaging, proved to be small, well-differentialed HCC on bx in [**9-26**] s/p cadaveric liver transplantation on [**11-28**] (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]) - Hypothyroidism.
- [**2145-12-7**] liver [**Month/Day/Year **] - Psych: history of bipolar disorder managed with high dose wellbutrin.
Physical Exam: Gen: NAD HEENT: MMM no lesions CV: RRR no MRG RESP: CTAB no WRR ABD: soft, tender around incision site.
No guarding or rebound WOUND: Abdominal incision clean and dry, JP site recently opened with no evidence of active drainage.
No acute abdominal pathology.
Interval decrease in free fluid surrounding the liver with only a small amount remaining.
Interval removal of CBD stent without intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
CXR [**2146-10-23**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-31**], there is no interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
No pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
[**Date Range **] report: Successful biliary cannulation with the sphincterotome.
A caliber change was noted between the native and transplanted bile ducts.
[**2146-11-9**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: There are no focal or textural abnormalities within the liver.
Incidentally noted is a left renal cyst measuring 5.6 x 5.8 cm in sagittal dimension.
A single view of the right kidney shows no hydronephrosis.
Normal hepatic echotexture with no focal lesions.
Patent hepatic vasculature without evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
Moderate portal/periportal, and mild lobular mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, plasma cells, occasional neutrophils, and eosinophils.
Focal portal endothelialitis [**Doctor Last Name **].
Trichrome stain shows increased portal fibrosis with septa formation and focal minimal sinusoidal fibrosis (stage 2).
Iron stain shows minimal iron deposition in hepatocytes.
Note:  The findings are consistent with recurrent viral hepatitis C.  There is also venulitis which is consistent with acute cellular rejection.
Brief Hospital Course: 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who is status post liver transplantation on [**2145-12-7**] and presents with fevers at home and diarrhea.
# Fevers (MICU added course, primary team please update): There was concern for C.diff in the ED given diarrhea with fevers; treatment was started with PO Vancomycin.
Of note, another concern in a patient with known liver [**Year (4 digits) **] rejection would be SBP, but the patient does not have ascites on exam or CT and has only mild tenderness to abdominal palpation.
During his MICU course, he spiked a fever to 100.6 on [**11-4**].
# GI Bleed: While in the hospital, the patient began to pass burgundy colored stools with small blood clots on evening of [**11-1**] and subsequently triggered on the floor for hypotension (85/48).
He was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring in setting of GI bleeding for which colonoscopy indicated a bleeding at his sphincterotomy with hemostasis acheived.
He did have some maroon stools after the EGD, which may have represented a slow ooze with stable Hgb.
He received another unit PRBC that night, continued to have maroon stools and w/ continued low Hct's.
Had episode of ACR s/p steroids and re-bx confirming no evidence of rejection.
There was concern for rejection/HCV given elevated AlkPhos.
# Direct hyperbilirubinemia (MICU course, primary team to update) Patient had admission bilirubin of 3.3 with subsequent uptrend to 12 mostly direct fraction with obvious jaundice.
His recent [**Hospital1 **] showed a patent extrahepatic system.
The concern is for an intrahepatic process or infectious etiology such as virus.....  .
# Psychiatric Issues incl.
Bipolar Disorder: Continued Modafinil, Seroquel, Keppra, Effexor .
# Hypothyroidism: Continued Synthroid  The following is a brief summary of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course while on the [**Hospital 1326**] Surgery Service beginning [**11-7**]:  The patient was taken to the operating room for massive melena s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] sphincterotomy on [**2146-11-7**].
His SICU course was remarkable for post operative delirium, for which a psychiatry consult was obtained.
He was started on Ceftriaxone (later converted to PO Keflex) on POD 3 for erythema around his incision site.
By POD 8 the patient's pain was well controlled with oral medication, and was eating and voiding with no difficulty.
He was discharged on a 7 day course of keflex for management of his wound incision.
Of note, the liver biopsy performed during his operation was notable for recurrent HCV as well as acute rejection.
6. hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet [**Date Range **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
7. cholestyramine-sucrose 4 gram Packet [**Date Range **]: One (1) Packet PO BID;PRN () as needed for itching.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent hepatitis C Acute Kidney Injury GI bleed after sphincterotomy incision cellulitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions:  You were admitted for fever, fatigue, and increased diarrhea.
Because your LFTs were elevated, a liver biopsy was done, which showed infection and recurrent hepatitis C. [**Hospital **] was done and had a stent placed.
Fevers continued with elevated liver enzymes, a second [**Hospital **] was done with placement of 2 stents and a procedure called a sphincterotomy was performed.
