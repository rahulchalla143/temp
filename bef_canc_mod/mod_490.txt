Admission Date:  [**2192-6-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-7-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin Hcl/D5w  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: anuria  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 84 vent-dependent M with COPD, CHF, CAD, AS, afib, recent prolonged hospitalization for CHF complicated by spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma, referred from vent facility for fevers, altered mental status, and hypoxia/difficulty ventilating, as well as anuria.
He became anuric and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
CXR showed opacified L hemithorax--started levo/vanc.
Abd also distended and tender.
Surgery consulted and CT thorax obtained, which showed large L pleural effusion, large ascites; surgery did not think any acute surgical pathology.
coccygeal ulcer with eschar and surrounding erythema.
There is apparent slight shift of the mediastinum to the left, indicating a component of volume loss/collapse, possibly secondary to a mucus plug.
There is most likely an associated left-sided pleural effusion.
Resolving retroperitoneal hematoma extending along the left posterior pararenal space inferiorly to the left groin.
Large left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and collapse of the left lower lobe.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Large amount of ascites and anasarca.
Mildly thickened loops of small bowel with evaluation limited by ascites and lack of intravenous contrast.
The findings are likely secondary to anasarca.
Ischemia cannot be completely excluded, especially given the appearance of the heavily calcified SMA and close clinical correlation is advised.
Significantly shrunken liver with nodular contour and increased echogenicity consistent with cirrhosis.
Significant amount of ascites is also identified.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 84M with AS, CAD, COPD, vent dependent, now with likely Acinetobacter VAP, also Enterecoccus bacteremia, and oliguric renal failure .
L >> R pleural effusion--L effusion was last drained one month ago (3.5L removed) and has reaccumulated, likely sympathetic from ascites.
# Cardiovascular: chronic problems include: - [**Name (NI) 31196**] AS by last echo, so would avoid sudden volume shifts as patient is likely very pre-load dependent - afib--rate controlled with metoprolol .
# Acute oliguric renal failure, oliguric: Cr bumped from 1.0 a month ago to 2.0 three days ago and now up to 3.7.
Renal team offered dialysis to patient's family, but explained that with his other significant co-morbidities, dialysis would not be likely to change his overall prognosis, and healthcare proxy decided that dialysis would not be in keeping with patient's wishes.
# GI: Ascites: pt is not known cirrhotic, so cause of cirrhosis not clear, although his CHF and hypoalbuminemia.
low albumin state vs portal HTN.
should have diagnostic tap in am (has not had paracentesis before).
Tense ascites have displaced his PEG, contributing to the leak of bilious fluid from the PEG site and most likely also contaminating the peritoneum.
Not clear if this was the source of Enterococcus bacteremia, but covered with Abx as below.
- elevated AST/ALT--could be drug effect, infection, shock liver as patient was reportedly hypotensive - chemical pancreatitis--CT did not reveal pancreatitis .
# ID--Reportedly febrile yesterday; WBC 14 with 91% polys, cultures from OSH growing VRE in blood and Enterobacter in sputum.
For now, continue ampicillin for Enterococcus; Enterobacter was sensitive to imipenem (although not tested for meropenem) and aminoglycosides but no others, will use meropenem since less seizure risk in renal failure.
# Skin--breakdown on coccyx as well as upper back, and thin skin on arms with tears and ecchymoses.
