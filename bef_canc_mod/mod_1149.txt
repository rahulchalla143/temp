Their frequency has increased lately, with three episodes on the day she presented to the ED, and she was brought by EMS per her request because of left shoulder pain after the fall.
Her recent history is also notable for two episodes of BRBPR over the last few weeks, and black stools in the days preceding her presentation.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3649**] one week ago for evaluation of her falls and had abnormal labs per report, along with concerns about tremulousness.
Her SBP fell to the 70s and she was tachy to 110 and was given 1L IVF; also noted to have black guaiac positive stool on rectal.
Labs were remarkable for lactate 3.9, ARF with a Cr of 2.9, newly elevated LFTs (ALT 117, AST 295), and elevated Tbili at 7.1 EKG significant for RBBB w/ nonspecific changes and no priors for comparision.
An abdominal U/S was negative for an acute process.

No evidence of acute traumatic injury seen from the skull base through C6.
Attempts were made to bring the patient back for imaging through C7, however, the patient became unstable and was unable to return for the completion of the study.
Moderate neural foraminal narrowing is noted at multiple levels in the mid cervical spine as described above.
Correlation with mechanism of injury and patient's clinical exam is recommended, and if there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Diffuse echogenic liver, most consistent with fatty liver infiltration, however more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
No ascites is seen to indicate hepatic decompensation.
Evaluation for mass is limited due to difficulty with son[**Name (NI) 493**] penetration.
Gallbladder wall edema is nonspecific, but can be caused by significant intrinsic liver disease.
No gallstone seen.
Normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] exam of the kidneys, without hydronephrosis.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
No evidence of acute process.
Parenchymal involutional changes are unexpected at this age, as are vascular calcifications.
EEG ([**7-9**]): Normal waking EEG for a tense and anxious subject.
RUQ  U/S ([**7-12**]): Reversed slow flow in the main portal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 64573**] is a 57 year-old female with history of HTN, DM, alcohol abuse/dependence who initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED because of a fall and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for management of hypotension, ARF, and elevated LFTs.
# Melena/anemia:  The patient had guaiac positive black stools prior to transfer, but no evidence of hematemesis.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**7-16**] which revealed Grade 2 rectal varices and internal hemorrhoids.
The patient has an extensive alcohol history, and it was believed that these seizures were secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
EEG did not demonstrated evidence of active seizure, so it was believed that this seizure was due to EtOH withdrawal.
EEG showed no ongoing seizure activity so no antiepileptics were prescribed.
She had no more signs of withdrawal.
# Cirrhosis:  On admission, the patient had a RUQ U/S to evaluate for elevated LFTs and clinical evidence of cirrhosis.
Abd U/S on [**7-5**] demonstrated diffuse fatty liver infiltration but the study was unable to verify cirrhosis.
Hepatology was consulted, and the patient was found to be Hep B and C negative, but she had a positive smooth muscle Ab.
She underwent a repeat U/S on [**7-12**], which demonstrated an echogenic liver and reversed flow in the main portal vein.
A CTA was performed to evaluate for portal system thrombosis but it did not reveal any.
She was placed on Lactulose during this admission for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy but this was discontinued because patient was having increasing loose bowel movements and her confusion was thought to be due to withdrawal not encephalopathy.
She has acute alcoholic hepatitis, but her discriminant function was less than 32 on the hepatology floor.
# Thrombocytopenia:  The patient had persistent thrombocytopenia on this admission, which was thought to be secondary to her underlying liver disease.
Her thrombocytopenia improved and the episodes of bleeding were thought to be due to internal hemorrhoids or rectal varices not due to thrombocytopenia as patient's platelet count was 90-110 during these episodes.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient's Cr on admission was 2.2, which was elevated from her baseline of 0.8.
# Syncope/falls:  On admission, the patient stated that she had had multiple falls in the days prior to admission.
TTE was negative for valvular abnormalities, and Carotid U/S was negative for stenosis.
# DM: The patient has a history of diet-controlled diabetes, though has been on glyburide in the past.
She had [**Last Name **] problem with hyper or hypoglycemia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Lower GI bleeding Alcohol withdrawal complicated by Delirium Tremmens and seizures Alcoholic Hepatitis  Secondary Diagnosis: Hypertension Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for low blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and blood in your stool.
The loss of consciousness was likely related to blood loss and low blood pressure.
Upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy revealed a varices in your esophagus and stomach, varices in you rectum, and hemorrhoids.
Stopping drinking and good nutrition are the best things for your liver right now.
Please call your PCP or return to the emergency department if you experience: - blood in your stool or vomit - black tarry stools - confusion - abdominal pain and/or distension - loss of consciousness - fever greater than 100.5 degrees F  Followup Instructions: We made an appointment for you with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Tuesday [**2178-7-28**] at 3:00PM.
