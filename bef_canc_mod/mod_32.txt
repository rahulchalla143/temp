NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2158-6-19**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):     NOCARDIA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Gram stain is an equally sensitive means of detecting Nocardia in a       primary specimen.
Culture may be a more sensitive means of detecting Nocardia and       should be considered.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2158-6-23**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).

NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):     NOCARDIA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO NOCARDIA ISOLATED.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild  mitral regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define a structural  abnormality involving the aortic valve.
Three parenchymal abnormalities new over six months, the largest in the left lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] and two in the right upper and right middle lobes.
Given their nodular appearance and patient's symptoms of infection, Nocardia infection would be the most likely diagnosis, especially for the left lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] consolidation.
Echocardiogram on [**2158-6-16**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen.
Renal transplant ultrasound on [**2158-6-16**]: IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable renal transplant in the left iliac fossa with some mild fullness of the collecting system, which is reduced  when compared with the previous ultrasound from [**11-21**].
Brief Hospital Course: # Pneumonia: Patient improved on Vancomycin/Meropenem started empirically for sepsis broad spectrum coverage.
He was therefore transitioned to oral levofloxacin and discharged on this regimen, with specific instruction to contact his physician immediately if he had recurrence of any symptoms or fevers.
# HYPERTENSION: Continued metoprolol.
# Renal transplant: Initially with renal failure that resolved with treatment of sepsis and hydration.
# DM - Continued RISS, standing insulin.
