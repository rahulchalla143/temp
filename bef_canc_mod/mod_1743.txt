Admission Date:  [**2114-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-6-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Influenza Virus Vaccine / Shellfish Derived / Egg / Adhesive Bandage / Heparinoids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: recurrent sternal wound infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2114-9-25**] Right subpectoral latissimus flap transfer and closure of sternal wound   History of Present Illness: The patient is an unfortunate 67- year-old who is well-known to our service.
The wound separated, and since that time, she has had 3 other operations in an attempt to reclose.
She was seen in the office about 10 days ago and actually the wound looked great, and then suddenly she came in with high fevers and infection again.
We need to have definitive debridement and then placement of healthy muscular tissue, and definitive closure without any open wounds to get this closed.
It was difficult to convince the patient to go ahead with surgery; but I think she understands that ultimately she could die of sepsis if this is not done.
She does have a known meningioma that she has refused treatment previously.
