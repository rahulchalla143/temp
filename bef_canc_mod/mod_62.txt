She reports that the patient was largely independant prior to a [**Month (only) 116**] admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA bacteremia.
He began to develop some mild confusion and had a fall.
He reportedly did not have any sequelae after the fall and it is not clear if the patient had any secondary trauma although his changes in mental status have also occurred over the past couple of weeks.
He developed some diarrhea and his family was concerned that his confusion was [**3-4**] a UTI.
His rehab noted that the patient had a leukocytosis and so he was brought into the ED for further evaluation.
Exam was reportably notable for mild confusion (normally oriented times 3, but not oriented to time in the ED) a LUSB ejection murmur and cloudy urine.
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis with left shift but no bands, a lactate of 1.4 and a u/a with >50 WBCs and positive leuks.
EKG was notable for new ST segment depressions in V4-V6 with a rate of 117.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports recent confusion and possibly some chest pain within the past few days although he denies active chest pain and is unable to provide any additional information.

# Sepsis secondary to ascending urinary tract infection Blood and urine cultures from admission with pan-sensitive proteus mirabilis.
Presented with pyuria, fevers, altered mental status and leukocytosis to 18.2.
Became hypotensive and tachycardic shortly after arrival, which improved with fluid boluses.
Fevers, pyuria and leukocytosis resolved within a couple days, and his mental status slowly cleared to his baseline.
# Altered mental status Acute delirium in the setting of dementia.
Most likely secondary to infectious process.
He came in mildly confused and persistently did not know why he was brought to the hospital.
He became mildly agitated at times but could be reoriented.
No focal neurologic signs or symptoms.
# EKG changes When he became tachycardic to 117 in the setting of sepsis, he had new ST segment depressions V4-V6.
Improved when his heart rate normalized with fluid resuscitation.
Negative cardiac enzymes and lack of chest pain or symptoms suggestive of anginal equivalent.
EKG changes were likely secondary to demand with tachycardia.
# Hypernatremia On the day prior to discharge, he became mildly hypernatremic (146), likely from poor PO intake and restarting his home dose of 10 mg Lasix.
# Urinary retention He chronically has in indwelling foley catheter for his urinary retention.
Likely source of his proteus urosepsis.
#Loose Stools - during his admission he had several loose stools per day with small amount of urgency and fecal incontinence.
# CHF He showed no signs or symptoms of acute CHF.
His intake and weights should be monitored with lasix restarted for weight gain or signs of fluid accumulation.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter Irregularly irregular rhythm, but rate is well-controlled.
On review of note from his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**] he is not on coumadin due to increased fall risk.
# Dementia - stable.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 745**] Health Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: UTI c/b bacteremia (pan-sensitive Proteus Mirabilis) Orthostasis  Secondary diagnoses: Atrial fibrillation/flutter Dementia Hypocalcemia s/p aortic valve replacement CHF   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Oriented to person.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) due to high fall risk.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had an infection in your urinary tract and blood that gave you fevers, lowered your blood pressure and made you more confused.
We treated your infection with antibiotics, and we treated your low blood pressures by giving you IV fluids.
You have an appointment to follow up in [**Hospital 159**] clinic given  your recurrent urine infections and foley catheter.
