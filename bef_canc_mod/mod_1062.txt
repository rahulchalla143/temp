Admission Date:  [**2154-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-2-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain & distention  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis x 4  History of Present Illness: 78M h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35%), chronic GI bleed s/p Portacath placement [**2153**] for delivery of blood products, CKD, cardiac cirrhosis, presented to the ED with abdominal pain and distention, vomiting x1, as well as poor PO intake, x3 days after leaving AMA from nursing home and stopping his typical regimen of paracentesis every ~14 days.
Noted to have N/V and increased protrusion of umbilical hernia.
Paracentesis with 3L removed, negative for SBp.
CXR demonstrated incompletely evaluated opactiy in LL base, but considered atelectasis and effusion.
CT abdomen/pelvis limited with no IV contrast and nearly no oral contrast, nondiagnostic for diverticulitis or "infection"; no discrete transition point or prox SB dilatation.
Massive ascites on CT despite 3L paracentesis prior to study.
Admitted to ICU for anemia, massive ascites, and acute renal failure.
Past Medical History: # HTN # CAD: Reports CABG x3, first age 22(?
), CABG [**2140**], cath [**2151**] with patent lima-lad, occluded svg-om, near occluded svg-rca # CHF: TTE [**7-6**] with EF 35%, mild LVH and LV-HK, 2+MR, 4+TR; cardiac cath [**3-7**] to determine volume status with elevated biventricular filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, ventricularization of RA pressure consistent with severe tricuspid regurgitation.
# Afib: previously on coumadin but no longer secondary to GIB in  past # Cardiac cirrhosis: Requiring repeat sx paracenteses # Chronic GIB [**3-2**] AVMs # Colon polyps # HBV # CRI: cr 1.5-1.8 # Hypothyroidism # OA   Social History: Originally from [**Country 3397**].
Family History: Reported previously: Mother- HTN, ?died of MI; Father-83 yo and  died of "old age" but unable to verify this tonight, states "I don't remember."
Given the lack of intravenous contrast and near absence of oral contrast, the study is nondiagnostic for infection or diverticulitis as requested.
There is a large umbilical hernia which should be apparent on clinical exam (though not provided in the given history).
A gas- distended loop of small bowel appears to enter and exit the hernia sac without definite transition point.
No proximal small bowel dilatation, to CT criteria, is noted.
CXR [**2154-2-4**] In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], there is again substantial left pleural effusion.
The degree of pulmonary vascularity is essentially unchanged   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 78 yo M with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 35-40%), cardiac cirrhosis, CRI, chronic GIB and anemia who presented with abdominal pain, found to have acute on chronic renal failure and worsened anemia thus admitted initially to the ICU then transferred to the floor after stabilization.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.8, 3.3 on admission.
Further investigation revealed that pt had pre-renal failure due to dehydration and not hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal failure resolved prior to discharge.
# Hypotension:  Pt was noromotensive on admission, however developed hypotension after aggressive diuresis in the intensive care unit.
Hepatology and renal were consulted for the potential of hepatorenal syndrome.
Pt did not have hepatorenal syndrome, hence midodrine and octreotide that was initially started was stopped.
# Anemia:  Chronic anemia with baseline hematocrit ~20-30's.
Per daughter, pt requires frequent blood transfusions ~q2weeks in the setting of chronic GIB r/t AVM's.
# CAD/NSTEMI: Pt developed NSTEMI during ICU stay in the setting of renal failure, pt with known hx of CAD.
There were no changes on EKG.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Rate controlled on digoxin.
# CHF: LVEF 35-40% and massive ascites [**3-2**] cardiac cirrhosis.
Although with L pleural effusion, did not have evidence of fluid overload on admission.
During ICU stay developed new crackles on examination, with evidence on CXR, however was post blood transfusion and thought to be TRALI.
We dosed digoxin as above, rehydrated pt with IVF & [**Month/Day (2) 61990**] for renal failure.
# Abdominal pain: Had been a presenting complaint, however improved after paracentesis.
LFTs, amylase normal, lipase only mildly elevated and unlikely etiology of previous symptoms.
There was no evidence of infectious etiology per physical examination, labs or imaging.
Has large umbilical hernia filled mainly with ascites on exam, however hernia is reducible and nontender.
Abdominal pain resolved during hospitalization and has been attributed to abdominal distention.
# Hypoxia: Developed hypoxia in the intensive care unit where he was somnolent but with a low resp rate; however had only received minimal narcotics in the ED.
Evidence of atelectasis vs. L infiltrate, also with progresive crackles worrisome for a pneumonia, hence he received levofloxacin & ceftriaxone initially, however did not worsen hence the levaquin was discontinued.
# Thrombocytopenia: Developed during admission, no clear etiology thus ?sequestration.
+cardiac cirrhosis, negative HIT antibodies, no evidence of schitocytes on smear and negative DIC labs.
# Hypernatremia: Initially hyponatremic during admission with intravascular depletion, this resolved.
However developed hypernatremia after one episode of paracentesis, resolved with D5W bolus and encouraging pt to drink.
No seizure activity or mental status changes.
Liver function appears stable currently, however mild thrombocytopenia.
s/p paracentesis [**2154-2-5**], received paracentesis on day of discharge with removal of ~5L ascitic fluid.
We discontinued his Metolazone & furosemide daily as pt did not appear to be fluid overloaded, would recommend diuresis with evidence of overload while closely monitoring renal function.
# Complicated UTI: +UA noted on admission, urine culture with pansensitive P. mirabilis.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH on admission elevated to 13.
Thought to be due to cardiac cirrhosis and also uremia with pt.renal failure.
Pt refused lactulose during admission.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-30**] puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Mylanta 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ml PO every eight (8) hours as needed for indigestion.
