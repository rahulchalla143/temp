Admission Date:  [**2145-1-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-2-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-9-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Patient is a 55-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post catheterization with left anterior descending stents, chronic back pain status post multiple surgeries, hypothyroidism, hypertension, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and radiation, prostate cancer status post prostatectomy, and nephrolithiasis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-28**] from outside hospital, where he was intubated for respiratory distress after being found to have multilobar pneumonia, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus bacteremia.
Cause of the patient being on the floor was thought to be either accidental drug overdose as the patient was on chronic narcotics for lower back pain or sepsis.
His white blood count was elevated and he was also in acute renal failure, but his creatinine was already trending down from 4.1 at the outside hospital to 2.1 upon admission here.
Patient was initially on Vancomycin and levofloxacin for broad coverage given his persistent fevers.
Workup for the source of his bacteremia was undertaken with CAT scan of the torso without evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, although lumbar spine imaging was suboptimal due to the patient's metallic hardware.
The CAT scan did show multilobar pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
Echocardiogram on [**1-30**] showed no evidence of vegetations, left ventricular ejection fraction of 59% and no focal wall motion abnormalities.
Patient's acute renal failure resolved with aggressive hydration.
Coronary artery disease status post catheterization and stent to the left anterior descending artery in [**2144-2-5**].
Chronic back pain status post multiple surgeries.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and radiation 10 years ago.
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
Right salivary gland excision.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart:  S1, S2 with no murmurs.
Extremities:  2+ pulses, anasarca with 3+ pitting edema in all extremities.
Infectious disease/pulmonary:  Upon transfer to the medicine floor, the patient was afebrile without significant respiratory symptoms for the remainder of his hospital stay.
CAT scan in the ICU showed multilobar pneumonia.
Patient also reported with methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus bacteremia at the outside hospital.
Infectious Disease workup in the Intensive Care Unit was done as outlined in the history of present illness including CAT scan of the torso, echocardiogram, and blood cultures.
On the medicine floor, MRI of the spine with and without contrast showed no evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, but the study is limited by metallic lumbar spine hardware.
MRI of the head with and without contrast showed bilateral subdural hematomas without enhancing lesions or acute hemorrhage.
The subclavian catheter tip was sent for culture and did not grow any bacteria either.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was completed on [**2145-2-16**] to evaluate for endocarditis and showed no evidence of valvular vegetations, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal wall motion, normal cavity sizes.
Patient's CKs trended down to within normal limits by the time of transfer to the Medicine floor from the ICU, and the patient denied muscular pain at that time.
Acute renal failure:  Patient's acute renal failure resolved with hydration in the Intensive Care Unit and BUN and creatinine remained within normal limits the remainder of his hospital stay.
Patient also received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for costochondritis which he tolerated well without GI symptoms or changes in BUN or creatinine.
Neurology:  The patient was observed to have a generalized tonic-clonic seizure on [**2-7**], but had no further episodes throughout his hospital stay.
Patient was noted to have short periods of aphasia and staring 2-3 days following the generalized seizure.
Patient has no history of seizures, however, and the etiology is likely toxic metabolic.
Patient did not have any evidence of seizure activity throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Workup for the cause of his seizures were negative.
MRI of the head without contrast on [**2-7**] showed no evidence of stroke, or mass, or mass effect.
EEG on [**2-7**] showed encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizure activity.
Lumbar puncture with pleural guidance by Interventional Radiology on [**2-8**] revealed cerebrospinal fluid within normal limits.
A 24 hour bedside push button EEG was performed and was also within normal limits without changes during aphasic periods.
Mental status:  Patient initially confused and delirious after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor.
This is likely due to ICU psychosis and exacerbated by high dose narcotics.
Psychiatry was consulted and agreed that the patient's delirium was likely related to his intubations, sedation, and ICU stay, as well as exacerbated by high dosed narcotics.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with history of coronary artery disease and hypertension.
Patient's hypotension requiring use of pressors which resolved in the Intensive Care Unit as described above, and he was slowly restarted on his antihypertensives for his hypertension.
Pain:  History of chronic back pain on methadone at home.
Patient also developed rib pain consistent with costochondritis on the Medicine floor, which was due to his approximate 10 days of intubation.
Patient's costochondritis and rib pain improved entirely after two days of standing Naprosyn 500 b.i.d.
Upon transfer from the ICU to the floor, the patient was initially on Fentanyl patch 250 for pain control.
for chronic pain control.
for neuropathic pain.
Iron studies were most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Coronary artery disease.
for DVT prophylaxis.
