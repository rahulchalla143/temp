Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with hx afib (not on coumadin for fall risk), with ESRD (s/p cadaveric transplant now failed) on HD, with recent septic left knee p/w hypotension and fever c/w SIRS.
# SIRS: Patient with fever and hypotension, but fluid responsive.
Cause was septic joint.
Blood cultures had no growth.
No sign of systemic infection at the time of discharge.
# Septic Joint: Tap in ED demonstrated ongoing infection with significant WBC's and neutrophils.
# Afib: Pt had episodes of AFib with RVR before taking his medications (diltiazem and metoprolol).
# Hypogylcemia: The patient was noted to have hypoglycemia, which has been ongoing since last admission.
If he becomes hypoglycemic in the mornings despite having cornstarch at bedtime, he should get 2.5mg of prednisone at night in addition to the 5mg he takes in the morning.
# Anemia: The patient was anemic at presentation and his HCT decreased several points from his baseline (fluctuating, but anemic throughout).
# ESRD: The patient appeared with fluid overload on exam.
#PPD + CONTACT: Wife found to be PPD positive recently with clear chest xray.
The patient also has a clear chest x-ray.
If he has a sufficient reaction in both sites, this means he has been exposed to TB.
If he has no reaction in both sites, the test is meaningless.
If he has a reaction at the control site, but not at the tuberculin site, then the test is definitive and he has not been exposed to tuberculosis.
