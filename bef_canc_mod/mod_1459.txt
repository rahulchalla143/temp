** CXR: 1) Left IJ line with its tip in the brachiocephalic vein in the midline; no pneumothorax.
2) Faint right base/perihilar opacity, consistent with atelectasis versus early pneumonic infiltrate.
No evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
Chronic changes consistent with Crohn's disease.
A few mildly thickened loops of small bowel could be related to flare.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 78 y/o female with crohns disease on chronic steroids presenting with cough and fever.
Had persistent hypotension in ED and was enrolled in MUST protocol, now stable so being transferred to floor .
Sepsis:  Pt's sepsis was likely secondary to pneumonia and mild element of adrenal insufficiency (in setting of chronic steroids for Crohn's disease) causing transient hypotensions requiring pressors esp given bandemia, infiltrate on CXR and rapid improvement with abx.
UA negative and abd CT negative for acute pathology.
She was given high dose steroids in the setting of her hypotension and these were weaned down to her home dose by the day of discharge.
It was difficult to wean the pt's oxygen on the floor due to persistent hypoxia.
A CXR showed some evidence of failure so she was diuresed gently.
DVT/ saddle embolus: Pt with subtherapeutic INR on admission likely secondary to missed coumadin doses during acute illness.
She should have her INR closely monitored for the first several days following discharge due to fluctuating values.
CAD with h/o NSTEMI: Pt ruled out for MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
