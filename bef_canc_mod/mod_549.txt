Modest ST-T wave changes are nonspecific and baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status secondary to DKA.
Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
Her respiratory status was followed closely, given her history of bisystolic dysfunction.
She was also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.
On the floor she had some episodes of hypoglycemia (BS 40s).
# Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction:  Monitored closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.
Her BB and lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension and ARF, but restarted before [**Name (NI) **].
Chronic Pain: Her home regimen of oxycodone was held until her mental status cleared.
# Peripheral vascular disease:  The pt is s/p left BKA.
THe patient had a recent bypass graft on the right and it was found that to have gone down.
Per their note: "There does not appear to be any acute limb-threatening ischemia of the R foot.
There is no evidence of RLE infection as the cause of her hyperglycemia or altered mentalstatus."
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
