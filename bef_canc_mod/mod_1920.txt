History of Present Illness: HPI: Pt is a 71 y/o male with h/o dm2, cad s/p cabg, DVT/PE on long term anti-coagulation, ulcerative colitis on Asacol presents with brbpr starting at 9am of the morning of admission.
He'd been having lower abdominal pain for approximately the past week, a symptom for which he's been admitted in the past.
There, his vitals were intially stable with a hct of 36.7, though he was felt to be hypovolemic and this hemoconcentrated; his previous hct was 39 about five months ago.
Although an initial DRE showed only clot, he later passed a large, bloody bowel movement, and his bp nadired to the low 90's but rested there only transiently and easily rebounded to the 130's-140's with fluid; he then went to angiography for a tagged RBC scan where they found and embolized two vessels to the sigmoid colon.
Currently denies CP, SOB, abd pain or continued BRBPR.
)Right parietal intracranial bleeding following [**2152**] cardiac cath 5.
)Sinus node dysfunction s/p pacemaker 7.
He has no h/o ETOH/IVDA but quit tob 15 years ago.

No evidence of colitis or other bowel pathology present to explain the patient's bright red blood per rectum.
Stable appearance of left adrenal fat-containing lesion consistent with a myelolipoma.
Stable appearance of hypodense lesion within the caudate lobe of the liver, too small to fully characterize.
Subcentimeter attenuation lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney, too small to characterize.
3-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial A/P: 71 y/o male with dm2, cad, chf, uc presents with one week of lower abdominal pain and 2 episodes of brpbr on the day of admission.
An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized.
His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge.
- The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday, [**10-1**], which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding.
Given this, it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding.
Therefore, he had a repeat colonoscopy on [**10-5**] which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis, no polyps, w/ 8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon.
#Ulcerative colitis -- The patient's Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI.
#CAD/CHF - The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed.
After discussing this with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation.
#Access -- 2 large bore PIV's .
PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for ulcerative colitis w/o recent severe flares.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Rectal bleeding from inferior mesenteric artery tributaries supplying sigmoid colon.
Discharge Instructions: Please call physician if you develop shortness of breath, weakness in your legs or arms, sudden blurry vision or slurred speech, chest pain, faintness, or significant unexplained weight loss.
