No central or lobar pulmonary embolism.
Evaluation for segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli is limited by contrast bolus.
Ill-defined fluid posterior to the sternum could be explained by the recent surgery, although, infection cannot be excluded, and correlation clinically is recommended.
Possible filling defect in the left atrial appendage could be thrombus and can be further evaluated with echocardiography.
3.5 cm right upper lobe lung mass, concerning for malignancy.
Small bilateral layering pleural effusions.
Centrilobular emphysema.
1 cm pericardiac lymph node.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Diastolic intramyocardial flow is seen in the interventricular septum most likely representing intramyocardial coronary artery flow.
