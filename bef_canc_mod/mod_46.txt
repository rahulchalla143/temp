Per son, this is similar to when she has had UTIs in the past.
She does admit to sore throat and cough for a few days.

Past Medical History: - Paraplegia [**1-6**] Anterior Spinal Infarct ([**2128**]) - patient reports no sensation or motor function below T8.
- Thoracic Aneurysm Repair ([**2128**]) - COPD (no PFTs in system; has been on home O2 in past though none recently) - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - GERD - Suprapubic Catheter Placement / UTIs on Ppx Bactrim - Fecal Incontinence - Depression - Atraumatic comminuted L intertrochanteric femur fracture - Chronic sacral decubitus ulcers with past bilateral ischial tuberosity osteomyelitis - History of MRSA bacteremia [**11/2137**] thought to be due to sacral decub abscess and osteomyelitis  Social History:  Lives with son (recently returned home from rehab in late [**Month (only) 359**]) and has VNA.
No alcohol or illicit drug use.
Family History: Son has DM  Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL 4->2, MM slightly dry, posterior oropharynx very difficult to fully visualize.
Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
No drainage or significant surrounding erythema, appears to have good granulation tissue.
Ext: Slightly cool hands otherwise warm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis.
Small pressure ulcers on bilateral heels.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
Again seen is massive dilation and ectasia of the thoracic aorta with a particular contour abnormality noted along the course of the descending thoracic aorta.
No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Chronic bony deformity consistent likely with prior left thoracotomy is stable.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Markedly dilated and ectatic aorta similar to prior studies but accentuated by rotation.
There is a focal outpouching along the course of the descending thoracic aorta which may be superimposition of pulmonary vessels or true contour abnormality suggesting true or false aneurysm formation.
Addendum: In retrospect, in comparison to multiple prior radiographs, the contour of the descending thoracic aorta is stable and is unlikely to represent an acute process.
Additionally, there is subtle silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm which may correspond to increased opacity noted on the lateral view.
Atelectasis or an early infiltrate involving the right lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
Similar to the prior studies, there was again seen marked distention of several small bowel loops.
No free intraperitoneal air is seen on the decubitus radiographs.
There is again noted a fracture deformity involving the left proximal femur at the intertrochanteric region which is unchanged since [**2137-10-5**].
Brief Hospital Course: 73F with paraplegia, COPD, recurrent UTI, presenting with UTI, confusion, mild hypoxia and relative hypotension.
# Hypotension.
Pt was mildly low BP's with baseline 100-110's.
# Hypoxia.
No evidence of PNA.
Pt has fever to 101 at NP's office but was afebrile during hospital stay.
First urine cx had fecal contamination but subsequent one was neg.
Also had history of enterococcus in the past.
# Suprapubic catheter.
# Sacral decub.
# Abdominal distension.
Patient's abdomen is chronically distended, but soft, no signs of an acute abdomen.
KUB on [**10-19**] showed marked distention of several small bowel loops, but similar to the prior studies.
Pt did not have BMs for several days.
# Paraplegia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: UTI   Discharge Condition: good, satting 96% on 2L   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of fever altered mental status.
You were found to have low BPs and were in the ICU, where you recovered with IV fluids.
You were found to have a urinary infection, for which you were started on antibiotics.
START Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup 30 ML PO every 2 hours as needed for constipation 4.

A biopsy to rule out bone infection may be needed, but the biopsy can be performed only after all all antibiotics have been discontinued for more than 5 days, which should be the case at this date.
