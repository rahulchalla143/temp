HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male, status post orthotopic liver transplant in [**2178-12-24**], complicated by preservation injury requiring admission, now with increased LFTs and diarrhea.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, patient was alert and oriented, no acute distress.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, Roux tube site no erythema.
Peripherally 1+ edema bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was given D50 with elevation of blood sugar.
There were linear areas of opacity at the left lung base with interval improvement in the area compared to the previous study, with residual small left pleural effusion.
The left lower lobe opacities were felt to be related to atelectasis.
An EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with a rate of 52, with AV conduction delay.
Q-waves were noted in leads III and AVF, felt to be possibly related to a prior inferior myocardial infarction.
There was concern for cholangitis.
Bile culture demonstrated Citrobacter pansensitive, Enterococcus pansensitive and nonfermenter, resistant to Bactrim other pansensitive.
These were negative for C. diff.
Patient was noted to be extremely jaundice with an alkaline phosphatase of 154, T- bilirubin of 4.4, and an INR of 1.0.
There were new intrahepatic biliary dilatations noted predominantly in the left lobe of the liver.
Diffuse colon wall thickening was noted consistent with colitis.
There was concern for C. diff, and there was increased right pleural effusion and increased ascites.
There was no evidence of bile leak or stricture.
A renal ultrasound was done to evaluate elevated creatinine.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis in either kidney.
A 2-cm cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney was noted, and there was a small amount of ascites noted.
A postop liver duplex was done that demonstrated normal Doppler study, small fluid collection adjacent to the right posterior aspect of the liver.
Pathology report from the liver biopsy from the recipient demonstrated extensive large bile duct necrosis with marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils.
Patient required frequent suctioning for thick yellow sputum.
On [**2179-5-28**], he was noted to have a right neck swelling and a question of cellulitis.
On [**5-28**], he underwent a T-tube cholangiogram that demonstrated no leak, or obstruction, or intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
He continued on tube feedings, as he failed a swallow eval at bedside.
He required Lasix for diuresis for fluid retention.
Patient failed the swallow eval.
Sodium continued to stay elevated around 140-145.
His mental status was noted to be confused with inaudible speech at times.
He became tachycardic and tachypneic.
These were positive for Klebsiella sensitive to imipenem and meropenem.
A UA was positive, and urine culture also demonstrated Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem and imipenem.
He was transferred back to the SICU for close monitoring given concern for aspiration pneumonia.
A chest x-ray demonstrated no pneumothorax, small bilateral pleural effusions that were unchanged with retrocardiac linear atelectasis unchanged.
Throughout this, his LFTs continued to improve, with a fluctuation in the alkaline phosphatase with the range between 145 and 188.
A repeat bedside swallow eval was done with a video swallow on [**6-15**] which demonstrated mild delay in bolus formation with a single episode of penetration without aspiration.
Findings included normal size left atrium, elongated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with an EF greater than 55%.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded.
He had 1+ mitral regurgitation noted.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension noted.
No pericardial effusions were noted.
He denied shortness of breath.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Heart rate was in the 70s with a BP in a range of 110/160 to a systolic in the low- teens.
He was monitored with telemetry without incident.
His abdominal incision was clean and dry with Steri- Strips, and his T-tube was capped.
Diabetes type 2.
Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
