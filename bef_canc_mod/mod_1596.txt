Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] [**2114-1-17**] note Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14077**] has had increasing cardiac dysfunction primarily due to cardiac dyssynchrony secondary to chronic ventricular pacing.
He has hypokinesis of his septum, which is primarily related to his pacemaker.
He has increasing fluid retention and inability to get the fluid to his kidneys and perfuse them well.
An attempt to decrease the fluid accumulation and increasing Lasix has caused the deterioration of his kidney function, such that his BUN is 101 and creatinine 3.2 with concurrent hypokalemia and hypochloremia despite the concomitant use of Aldactone.
On direct presentation from home patient reports ~5lb weight gain with abd distension since [**1-17**] appt.
No changes made to medications, no dietary or medications non-complinance.
Denies any worsening peripheral edema; stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND, no palpitations.
Post-operative course complicated by acute renal failure, nephrology consulted deterioration in function secondary to poor forward flow.
Of note on night prior to transfer patient s/p mechanical fall while walking - denies any preceding dizziness, chest pain, palpitations.
On review of systems, reports pain at operative when coughing,he reports prior history of stroke, GI bleed in the setting of ASA, plavix; denies bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
A small mobile echodense mass associated with a pacing wire is seen in the right atrium near the interatrial septum.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the apical anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls, and severe hypokinesis of the mid septum.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function and focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.

As far as one can tell from a frontal view alone, the right atrial lead ends low in the right atrium and right ventricular lead along the floor of the right ventricle.
