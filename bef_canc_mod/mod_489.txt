Admission Date:  [**2121-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-5-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old white male with a history of type 2 diabetes and extensive peripheral vascular disease who was initially admitted to the Podiatry Service with a left forefoot cellulitis with associated fevers and chills.
There was no trauma or foreign body associated with the cellulitis.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Right lower extremity bypass.
Graft in the renal artery.
Umbilical hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
Extremities revealed left foot with erythema and edema, an open wound from incision 1 cm long.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 44-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, initially admitted for a left lower extremity cellulitis with hospital course complicated by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, complicated catheterization, and workup of left upper lobe mass found on a pre-catheterization chest x-ray.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was originally admitted on [**2121-10-23**] for left lower extremity cellulitis to the Podiatry Service.
On [**2121-10-25**] the patient developed shortness of breath and bilateral shoulder pain and ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
The patient had 1-mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL with 2-mm ST depressions in leads III, aVF, and V3 through V6.
The patient did not immediately undergo catheterization given that he was still febrile from his left lower extremity cellulitis, and it was unclear whether or not he would be okay to have stents placed given his history of osteomyelitis.
In addition, in the interval between developing the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient also had some hemoptysis which was followed up with a CT of the chest which showed a left upper lobe mass.
The procedure was complicated by a small dissection.
It should also be noted that the patient also had a echocardiogram after his myocardial infarction which was significant for a moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with a normal left ventricular cavity size, overall left ventricular systolic function preservation; although, mild basal inferior hypokinesis could not be excluded.
Simple atheroma on the aortic roots were seen.
The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation was seen.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened with mild mitral regurgitation.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient apparently had a left upper lobe mass which was seen on chest x-ray one month prior to his presentation with left lower extremity cellulitis at that time.
While in house the patient developed hemoptysis, and a left lower lobe mass was also seen on a follow-up chest x-ray.
A CT of the chest was done on [**10-27**] which showed a left upper lobe mass that was speculated which was 3.6-cm X 5.3-cm in size.
The patient was seen by the Pulmonary Service in house, and he was preliminarily diagnosed with a likely stage III-B bronchogenic lung cancer.
In order to make the full diagnosis, the patient would need a tissue biopsy; however, given his recent myocardial infarction, mediastinoscopy by Cardiothoracic Surgery was deferred until the patient recovered from his acute cardiovascular events.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for a left lower extremity cellulitis with intravenous antibiotics while he was in house.
The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and oxacillin for cultures which grew out Staphylococcus coagulase-positive bacteria.
The patient had a bone scan to both rule out metastases from his lung mass and also to determine if there was any osteomyelitis.
As per Podiatry, no osteomyelitis was suggested, and the patient was continued on oxacillin while in the hospital and changed over to oral dicloxacillin when he was discharged from the hospital.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient seemed to have some hyponatremia while in the hospital.
It was unclear whether or not the patient had syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
Left lower extremity cellulitis.
Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
A left upper lobe mass.
The patient was to follow up with the [**Hospital **] Clinic given his NPH insulin doses after being in the hospital and having increased insulin requirements in the setting of stress (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2378**]).
The patient was also instructed to follow up with his primary care physician regarding the results of his hyponatremia workup.
