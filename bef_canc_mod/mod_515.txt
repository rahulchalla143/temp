IMPRESSION: Areas of encephalomalacia from old right MCA distribution stroke and bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts.
No evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct or hemorrhage.
CTA uninterpretable due to suboptimal bolus from IV infiltration.
The patient may return to the department for a repeat CTA if clinically needed at no additional cost.

SLEEP: No normal transitions between wakefulness and sleep were seen.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and  disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy.
Infection, toxic metabolic disturbances, and medication effects are among the most common causes.
No clear epileptiform features were seen and no electrographic seizures were seen.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

FINDINGS: There are scattered areas of restricted diffusion, also with low signal on the ADC map, consistent with evolving infarction within the left middle cerebral artery territory distribution, mostly centered within the subcortical and deep white matter of the left prefrontal region and left temporal lobe.
Many of these lesions demonstrate increased T2 and FLAIR signal indicating that they are subacute in nature.
There is diffusely increased T2 and FLAIR abnormality in a region of previously noted right MCA distribution infarct consistent with probable underlying gliotic or malacic changes from a chronic infarct.
No significant areas of susceptibility artifact are identified.
No evidence of hydrocephalus, shift of midline structures, or abnormal signal void within the vasculature.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear normal.
FINDINGS: No significant flow-limiting stenoses or aneurysmal dilatation is identified.

Within the limits of the study, there is no evidence of AV malformation.
Subacute left middle cerebral distribution infarct involving multiple areas, mostly within the left prefrontal and temporal lobes, probably embolic in nature.
Contrast injection delineated what appeared to be a small bowel loop, however, no peristalsis was identified.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There is minimal right-sided hydronephrosis.
There are no renal stones.
Minimal right-sided hydronephrosis which may be secondary to reflux from the distended bladder.
The plan was to place a feeding jejunostomy tube, as he had failed multiple swallowing evaluations and coverage for continued TPN in the presence of functional bowel was in question.
His urinary catheter was exchanged and he was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for empiric coverage.
CXR was negative for acute process.
Outside blood cultures were positive for coag (-)staph and VRE.
At HD 12 a repeat video swallow evaluation was completed which showed that he was unable to tolerate anything PO without aspiration.
At HD 19 he was afebrile and doing well.
POD4 pt was noted to have R arm weakness and was unable to talk.
Stroke team was present on scene shortly thereafter and CT demonstrated LMCA ischemic defect without hemorrhage.
TEE demonstrated no mural thrombus, carotid u/s with <40% stenosis bilaterally.
On the evening of postoperative day 8, the patient experienced a 20-beat run of ventricular tachycardia, which was asymptomatic.
Following placement of the patient's J-tube for enteral feedings and subsequent embolic CVA, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by chronic aspiration and bile reflux resulting in numerous bouts of aspiration pneumonia.
This was complicated by the fact that the patient required aggressive diuresis to avoid CHF exacerbation, which also occured multiple times during his course.
This resulted in hypoperfusion of his bowel causing worsening of his bile reflux and subsequent aspirations.
Sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and E. Coli multiple times.
Urine cultures grew VRE and yeast on multiple occassions.
His blood also grew coagulase negative Staph on a number times, treated with line changes and appropriate antibiotics.
Aspiration events were treated with similar regimens, this included: aspiration precautions (ie sitting patient upright), stopping TF, NT suctioning, aggressive pulmonary toilet, hydrocortisone lavages, NGT decompression, and nebulizers.
Multiple interventions were performed during his hospitalization, including multiple therapeutic bronchoscopies and multiple studies and manipulations of his jejunal feeding tube.
Please separate section for dates and details of these interventions.
Interventional GI was consulted during his hospitalization to assess for possible endoscopic fundoplication to try and resolve his chronic aspiration.
However given his prior gastric surgeries, it was deemed that he was not a candidate based on the small gastric remnant (he was s/p BII) and friable mucosa noted on EGD.
He would tolerate a general anesthetic for laparoscopic or open surgical intervention to accompish this procedure.
The regimen initially consisted of Heparin gtt and coumadin, and for a brief period, Lovenox.
The patient also received multiple blood transfusions and was treated with Epogen and iron for anemia of chronic disease.
The wound care nurse was also following the patient for sacral decubitus ulceration.
The patient remained chronically ill, but relatively stable with marginal respiratory status dictating whether he was monitored on the floor or the ICU.
His final decompensation and eventual decline resulting in death started with his final transfer to the ICU on  HD 144.
Tracheostomy secretions were noted to be increased and CXR was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Cardiology was consulted and the troponin increase was thought to be due to demand ischemia.
A TEE performed on [**10-18**] showed normal LVEF, dilated R and L atria, mild valve dysfunction, and normal pulmonary pressures.
Full work up of his renal failure ruled out post-renal obstruction, as well as allergic interstitial nephritis.
No new pathogens were identified on cultures.
The patient's mental continued to gradually decline and the patient had become progressively non-verbal and eventually minimally responsive to stimulation.
His renal failure progressed, with his potassium eventually rising to 7.0 despite aggressive treatment with calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose/insulin.
He eventually became progressively more hypotensive and then was asystolic around 11:55 PM.
His family was present and he pronounced dead at that time.
Chronic aspiration 2.
Aspiration pneumonia 3.
Congestive heart failure 4.
Acute renal failure 5.
Respiratory failure 7.
