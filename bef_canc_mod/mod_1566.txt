Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Final [**2116-5-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
[**2116-5-13**] 1:13 pm MRSA SCREEN                              **FINAL REPORT [**2116-5-16**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2116-5-16**]):    No MRSA isolated.
[**5-10**] CXR: 1) Probable small focus of atelectasis and pleural fluid or thickening posteriorly.
In the absence of acute symptoms, this is unlikely to represent a focal infiltrate.
2) COPD, cardiomegaly, and ?
pulmonary hypertension.
EKG [**5-11**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse low voltage and non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-10**] no diagnostic interim change.
US [**5-14**]: IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] service on [**2116-5-10**] and was pre-op for R TMA debridement.
On [**5-11**], the patient went to the OR for debridement of R TMA site and vac placement.
There were no complications intra-operatively, and the patient was extubated without difficulty.
The patient was ruled out for an MI with troponins.
The patient's antibiotics were switched to Vanc/gent with HD for empiric coverage.
On [**5-13**], POD2, the [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] team took down the patient's vac - his TMA site appeared to be clean and healing very well.
Patient received an echo which demonstrated no significant change from previous, with no pericardial effusion.
In addition, the patient was complaining of some right arm pain and received an upper extremity ultrasound which was negative for DVT.
Hypotension requiring ICU care throught to be due to afib with RVR and improved back to baseline with rate control.
TTE nl without pericardial effusion and no evidence of infection; abx discontinued on [**5-15**].
Was hypotensive to 80s on [**5-17**] with hypothermia to 95.5 but no evidence of infection still on CXR or blood cultures to date.
# Afib with RVR: Has h/o failed cardioversion.
No signs of infection.
# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Questionable history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
[**5-11**] ABG showed respiratory acidosis with 7.10/89/50 but hypercarbia improved on [**5-15**] VBG of 7.39/50/148.
Could consider outpatient pulmonary evaluation of hypercapnia.
# PVD s/p LMA revision: No evidence of infection on arrival to the floor.
Pain controlled with tylenol and oral morphine.
# Right arm pain: C/o right arm pain over the last few weeks after being pulled by the right arm.

Given the low toxicity and expense of Vitamin B12 the patient was started on 1000mcg daily PO Vitamin B 12 supplementation.
B12 levels showed be followed for improvement.
# ESRD s/p failed renal transplant: On HD T/Th/Sa.
He did receive stress dose steroids in the setting of hypotension but now back on home dose.
Adrenal insufficiency workup not pursued due to clear association of hypotension with Afib with RVR and 5mg dose unlikely to suppress HPA axis.
# Communication: With patient.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
