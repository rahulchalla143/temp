[**2188-3-31**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis or worsening.
Moderate cardiomegaly slightly larger today than on [**4-24**], stable since [**3-29**], when mild pulmonary edema, subsequently resolved, was stable.
Calcifications and contour of the thoracic aorta suggest aneurysm is present but difficult to assess on this radiograph alone.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small lung volumes.
Moderate fluid overload.
The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval, the PICC line has been slightly advanced, the tip now projects over the lower SVC.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **]F with PMH significant for dementia, chronic diastolic CHF presenting with cough, lethargy and evidence of acute hypercarbic-hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation, initially thought to be neuromuscular in origin with potentiating URI, on IVIG, s/p extubation and transfer to medicine floor.
Acute respiratory failure/Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure - The patient was initially intubated given concerns for neuromuscular respiratory failure given a prior diagnoses of at least partial ptosis and a positive anti-cholinesterase antibody on outpatient laboratory studies.
She was also diuresed with Lasix to promote a negative fluid balance and she showed no signs of infectious concerns.
She remains on PO Lasix at this time, slightly reduced from her home dose and has remained on room air, appears euvolemic, without evidence of pulm edema.
##Baseline dementia with intermittant delerium secondary to hypoxemia, ICU delerium, medication effect of sedation - Per the patient's nephew, she is about where she is at her baseline but more lethargic on [**4-6**]; on [**4-7**] her mental status is slightly improved, and she now appears to be at baseline, alert and oriented x 2 (person, place).
## h/o Stroke - on Plavix at baseline given severe ASA allergy.
She was also on a statin, which was held at one point due to concern for neuromusclar disease, but can be restarted now that she is stable.
## Neuromuscular disorder NOS - this diagnosis is controversial, as the neurology consult team thinks that it is unlikely but the ICU felt it warranted consideration and treatment; Pyridostigmine given empirically.
## C.diff colitis - pt noted to have loose stools persistently, initial C. diff [**3-28**] negative, however still with persisent loose BM's, although benign abd exam, normal CBC, afebrile.
## Glaucoma - cont combigan, travatan eye drops.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation & [**Hospital **] Care Center - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure C. diff infection/colitis arterial line placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure secondary to a neuromuscular disorder and heart failure.
Pyridostigmine was used to treat your neuromuscular disorder and lasix was used to remove fluid.
After transfer out of the ICU, your breathing continued to improve, but you started to have diarrhea from an infection of the gut(c.diff) and required antibiotics.
