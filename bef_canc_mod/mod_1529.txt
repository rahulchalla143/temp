Admission Date: [**2105-3-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2105-4-10**]   Service:  MED   The patient initially presented to the General Medicine service with chief complaint of fevers and cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, AAA repair in [**2096**], obstructive-sleep apnea on BiPAP, who was admitted to the Medicine service with complaints of fevers and cough productive of greenish sputum and weakness.
The patient was found to be hypotensive at 70/40.
Chest x-ray revealed a spiculated mass in the right middle and right lower lobe by measuring 2.2 x 3 cm.
Patient was treated for post obstructive pneumonia with levofloxacin.
CT was performed, which confirmed the presence of this spiculated mass as well as subpathologic adenopathy.
No metastatic lesions were noted.
Patient had an EKG on admission and on review, was found to have a Q wave in lead III as well as ST depressions in V1, V2, V4, V5, and right bundle branch block.
On [**3-28**], patient developed chest pain.
An EKG revealed ST elevations in lead II, F, and ST depressions and V1 through V5.
Patient maintained his pulse throughout, but did become hypotensive to systolics in the 80s.
The patient's allergies include statins, which cause dizziness.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline between 2 and 2.4.
Obstructive-sleep apnea and on home BiPAP.
History of colonic polyps noted to be hyperplastic in nature.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had a history of hypertension and died of MI at age 67.
[**Name (NI) **] mother had a history of rectal cancer.
DATA:  Echocardiogram:  EF 25 percent, RA markedly dilated, left atrium markedly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular function is depressed.
3 plus TR, trivial MR, and no effusion.
Patient developed complicated VT complicated by hypotension and subsequently developed V. fib.
Patient had a left main coronary artery stenosis of 30 percent, LAD 80 percent heavily calcified stenosis of D2 with 50 percent stenosis, left circ with moderate diffuse disease.
Post procedure, the patient's course was complicated by CHF as well as ventricular tachycardia and V. fib.
EP performed a conduction study, which was normal with no His-Purkinje system disease.
The patient had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
Patient has a history of severe obstructive-sleep apnea.
For his presumed post obstructive pneumonia, the patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.
During his admission, the patient developed right upper extremity cellulitis.
An ultrasound was performed to rule out acute thrombosis and was significant for a right cephalic vein subacute nonflow limiting chronic occlusion.
Patient was treated with oxacillin for seven days for right upper extremity cellulitis.
The patient was also noted to have right lower extremity edema that was asymmetric compared to left.
An ultrasound was performed, which was negative for acute DVT.
Renal insufficiency.
Patient maintained good urine output and had no evidence of urinary tract infection.
Iron deficiency anemia.
The patient has a history of hyperplastic colonic polyps.
Patient was maintained on pneumoboots, subQ Heparin later changed to Lovenox given patient's presumed hypercoagulability with lung mass as well as bowel regimen.
It would be Interventional Pulmonary Clinic to have repeat CT and possible bronchoscopy performed.
He has no evidence of VT, V. fib for greater than three days prior to discharge.
Mentating without difficulty.
Ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular fibrillation status post ablation.
Chronic renal failure.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Right upper extremity cellulitis.
