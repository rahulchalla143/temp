She describes waking up at 5am on the day of admission because of severe pain from post-herpetic neuralgia in her left face.
She then began feeling very short of breath and wheezy for the next 20 minutes.
No associated chest pain.
No fevers or chills.
No nausea or vomiting.
She denies any similar symptoms in the past.
She has not had any orthopnea or prior episodes of PND.
No pleuritic chest pain, no dyspnea on exertion, no LE edema or weight gain.
She has been able to mow the lawn and go up a flight of stairs without any difficulty.
No recent travel.
She does not have a personal or family history of blood clots nor does she have a history of miscarriages.
No nausea or vomiting.
She appeared to have increased work of breathing and she had b/l rales on exam; guaiac was negative.
The team was concerned about the possibility of PE, but they did not obtain CTA chest because of her advanced kidney disease.
Although the team was concerned about the possibility of heart failure, she was given SL nitroglycerin and ASA but not started on lasix or BP medications.
She did receive clindamycin and levofloxacin for concern of a possible RLL infiltrate.
Her pain was mild and she was not having any difficulty breathing.
Has had multiple regimens of chemotherapy c/b GVHD - Chronic Graft vs Host Disease, mild (cutaneous, liver) - CKD Stage V: Unclear if secondary to chemotherapy, cyclosporin, or GVHD.
Had LUE AV fistula placed but found to have occluded left brachiocephalic vessel on fistalugram - Hyponatremia felt to be due to increased fluid intake - s/p Thyroidectomy for thyroid mass, pathology was benign - Herpes zoster c/b post-herpetic neuralgia s/p nerve block   Social History: Quit smoking 36 yrs ago.
Family History: No fam history of blood clots Her mom deceased age 87 of cerebral hemorrhage.
Father deceased age 48 of malignant hypertension.
Additional brother with hypertension and emphysema  Physical Exam: 97.6 129/69 111 18 94% 2L Very pleasant woman in no distress.
Neck supple, no thyroid enlargement, no adenopathy.
Abd soft and not tender, no palpable mass, no hepatomegaly.

SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..    Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2203-5-16**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Blood Cultures*2 [**2203-5-16**]: No growth  Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen [**2203-5-15**]:   **FINAL REPORT [**2203-5-17**]**    Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2203-5-17**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
HBsAg-NEGATIVE HBsAb-POSITIVE HBcAb-NEGATIVE HCV Ab-NEGATIVE  OTHER STUDIES ============== ECG [**2203-5-14**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3.
Cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2203-2-15**] there has been interval loss of R wave in leads V2-V3.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small basal effusion.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2203-5-14**]: CONCLUSION: Periventricular ischemia and scattered lacunar infarcts.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Bibasal effusions along with increased interstitial markings and confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes.
The differential considerations are fluid overload, or CHF.
Scattered tiny calcific densities in the left breast may represent fibroadenomas.
No mediastinal masses.
%) with basal inferior hypokinesis and possible septal hypokinesis (views are technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
--Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-1-6**], the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular systolic function is more depressed with new regional wall motion abnormality, the mitral valve chordae appear tethered, mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
The LAD had a bifurcation lesion with a 50% stenosis in the mid-LAD and 70% stenosis in the D1 branch.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 11mmHg and severely elevated left heart filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 28mmHg.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 59332**] is a 68yo woman with h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p SCT in [**2199**] and stage V CKD who presented with acute dyspnea in the setting of pain, hypertension, and volume overload.
# Dyspnea and Hypoxia:  She most likely developed flash pulmonary edema from sudden hypertension from the pain in the setting of chronic renal disease.
This was discontinued as the likelihood of PE was very low given hypoxia and tachycardia resolved with diuresis.
She had no evidence of infection or pneumonia.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was done during her admission to evaluate for suspected diastolic dysfunction, however showed new inferior basal wall motion abnormality and new moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, see below.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] showed EF 40-45%, but likely overestimated given significant new MR. Likely secondary to ischemic event, either from plaque rupture given family history, hyperlipidemia, or vasospasm.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which did not show evidence of occlusive disease.
# Sinus Tachycardia:  Most likely this was secondary to pain and dyspnea, unlikely to be PE.
She was empirically started on a heparin gtt, but stopped when she was no longer hypoxic.
# CKD stage V:  On admission, the patient had mild signs of uremia on exam and labs but denies frank symptoms apart from volume overload.
Unfortunately, occlusion of left brachiocephalic makes left AV fistula unusable.
She had Hep C and Hep B antibiodies sent.
# Graft vs Host Disease:  Pt was continued on home prednisone after discussing with oncology.
# Post-herpetic neuralgia:  Pt was continued on home pregabalin and nortriptyline for pain control.
# Small vessel ischemic disease on Head CT:  Neuro was consulted and recommended aspirin, which was started.
# h/o thyroidectomy:  TSH was WNL.
# Hyponatremia: Chronic, will monitor .
