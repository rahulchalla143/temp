There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, stable.
There are multiple hypodense regions within the liver, consistent with bile lakes, also apparently stable.
There was slight diminished flow in the left hepatic artery.
Normal flow and waveforms seen in all vessels except for diminished flow in the left hepatic artery.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with bile lakes, appears similar to the previous study.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical acquisition through the abdomen and upper pelvis was performed according to the liver CTA protocol.
There is atherosclerotic calcification involving the coronary arteries.
Multiple low-density lesions are again identified throughout the liver which are unchanged in size and appearance compared to most recent MRI of [**2118-5-9**] and thought to represent bilomas with internal debris related to hepatic artery occlusion.
There is moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation which is more prominent when compared to the prior MRI.
No enhancing liver masses are identified.
There is near-complete occlusion of the hepatic artery with minimal flow identified within it.
No perihepatic fluid collections are identified.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
Several low-density lesions are noted in the right kidney which are too small to characterize but most likely represent tiny renal cysts.
There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
There is mild atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted within the osseous structures.
Degenerative changes noted, most prominent within the thoracic spine.
Intrahepatic biliary dilatation which is more prominent when compared to the prior MRI of [**2118-5-9**].
Near-complete hepatic artery occlusion with minimal residual flow and multiple bile lakes noted throughout the liver, stable in size and distribution compared to most recent MRI of [**Month (only) **] [**2117**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis & HCC s/p OLTx [**2114**] c/b multiple episodes of acute cellular rejection, multiple episodes of biliary sludge / stones requiring repeat ERCPs, and delayed arterial thrombosis resulting in ischemic cholangiopathy and bile lakes, who is directly admitted from home for elevated transaminases on outpatient labwork, but also with biliary obstructive symptoms.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with biliary obstruction, but concerning for possible [**Known lastname **] rejection.
This represents another incidence of obstruction comparable to prior episodes.
Following ERCP, his labs trended upward again likely due to mechanical manipulation of the structures around the biliary tree, and then trended downward again the day following admission.
He received levo/flagyl during this admission for possible cholangitis (no evidence of this on ERCP) which were stopped the day of discharge.
His neurological exam was fully intact with no focal deficits.
Biliary obstruction may have predisposed to a statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.
Acute renal failure.
This may have been due to transient myoglobinuria from a possible mild rhabdo (as above) vs. dehydration.
Furosemide and lisinopril were held in the setting of ARF but resumed on discharge.
Alcoholic cirrhosis s/p [**Known lastname **].
During this admission, he was re-evaluated by the [**Known lastname **] team for possible future re-[**Known lastname **], as complications from continued biliary obstruction are likely to occur.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Biliary obstruction - Jaundice/itching - Myalgias (possibly secondary to mild rhabdomyolysis)  Secondary: - s/p OLT in [**2114**] - Coronary artery disease - Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with complaints of itching skin, thigh pain, and jaundice.
An ultrasound and CTA scan of your abdomen showed widening of the biliary ducts within the liver and impaired blood flow through the hepatic artery.
ERCP showed some strictures of the biliary tree as well as the presence of gallstones with some leaking of bile into the adjacent areas of liver.
This obstruction of the bile duct is most likely what caused your symptoms of itching and jaundice.
