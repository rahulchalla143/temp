She was discharged on her previous dose of Morphine PCA and was admitted again [**2192-2-17**] with hypotension and fevers.
She has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status changes and renal failure, thought to be secondary to narcotics overdose and decreased po intake.
He denies that she has had fevers, chills, night sweats, N/V, pain, cough, aspiration events, diarrhea, foul-smelling or a change in urine, change in her ambulation or motor ability.
In ED, her FSG was 129, she was afebrile at 97.6 with BP 178/64.
There was a concern for narcotics overdose from her PCA and she was given narcan 0.4mg x3.

Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] [**6-30**] with R thumb/forearm cellulitis s/p several courses of Vancomycin 22.
Osteomyelitis   of   the   right   second  toe  with chronic ulceration s/p distal  phalangectomy  of  the  right  second toe with ulcer excision  Social History: The patient lives with her husband.
Family History: Father has CAD, Mother with CVA  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.6 BP 160/75 HR 72 RR 14 97% RA General: somnolent, arousable, follows commands [**1-28**] of the time, NAD HEENT: pupils equally round and reactive, EOMI (for as much as pt can cooperate), very dry mucous membranes Neck: supple, no tenderness or stiffness Lung: CTA bilaterally Chest: right chest tunnelled line site slightly erythematous without exudate or tenderness Cor: RRR, nml S1S2, no m/r/g Abd: obese, surgical scars well-healed, NABS, soft NTND Ext: trace edema BLE up to knees bilaterally, superficial ulcer on heel of left heel Neuro: somnolent but arousable, moves all extremities, follows commands [**1-28**] of the time, cranial nerves intact grossly  Pertinent Results: UA ([**2-28**]): 6.0/1.010/negative leuks/negative nitrite .
STUDIES: CXR ([**2192-2-28**]): Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions without evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
A contrast enhanced MR study would obviously be more sensitive means to assess for metastatic neoplasm.
Several days later, the patient became somnolent and occasionally apneic.
She was given two doses of narcan with transient improvement in her mental status, but she became extremely hypertensive, necessitating transfer to the MICU for observation.
She made a surprisingly fast return to baseline with holding her pain medications.
This decline in mental status was almost certainly related to her methadone and multiple pain medications.
Fever: The patient was noted to have low-grade fevers during the first week of her hospitalization.
Given continuing fevers on Vancomycin and [**12-2**] blood culture bottles on [**3-8**] that grew staph epi, the Hickman catheter was discontinued.
Urinary tract infection: In addition to her line infection, the patient had a positive UA with a urine culture which grew Pseudomonas.
Her renal function improved with fluid hydration suggesting a prerenal etiology.
History of PE and DVT: She was continued on Coumadin with a therapeutic INR throughout her hospitalization.
Chronic arachnoiditis: As described previously, the patient's morphine was intermittently held throughout this admission for altered mental status.
On discharge, her pain is very well controlled with only demand doses of morphine PCA, without a basal rate.
HTN: The patient was intermittently hypertensive throughout this hospitalization, particularly in the setting of holding her pain medications.
Her hydralazine was held on admission given low blood pressures, but was restarted prior to discharge.
LE spasticity: Tizanidine and baclofen were held for altered mental status and may be restarted as an outpatient.
