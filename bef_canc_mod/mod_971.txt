TECHNIQUE: Please note that this study is being submitted for second-read request.
Axially acquired images were obtained through the head without contrast due to patient's renal failure.
There is potential mild fullness at the level of the vocal cords with some aerosolized secretions; however, this area is difficult to assess without IV contrast.
A significant amount of streak artifact is present from dental amalgam limiting evaluation in this area.
The non-contrast appearance of the soft tissues of the neck are also within normal limits with no cervical lymphadenopathy.
The maxillary sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening.
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized cervical spine.
Given limitations of a non-contrast examination, no evidence of abscess.
Mild sinus disease.
ATTENDING NOTE: There appears to be diffuse mucosal thickening in supra-glottic region.

[**4-29**] CT neck with contrast: IMPRESSION.
Given limitations of a non-contrast examination, no evidence of abscess.
Mild sinus disease.
ATTENDING NOTE: There appears to be diffuse mucosal thickening in supra-glottic region.
Supraglottic edema: The patient was seen by ENT on the day of admission; larygoscopy revealed significant pooling of yellow secretions R>L with edema of the b/l false vocal folds that limited evaluation of the glottic structures; the true vocal folds were not clearly seen.
The etiology of the patient's symptoms remained unclear; he was therefore covered empirically for fungal infection with fluconazole (2 week course planned, IV while inpatient, PO as outpatient) and for bacterial infection with Unasyn, which was converted to augmentin PO for 2 week course upon discharge.
Repeat visualization by the ENT team demonstrated improved edema, and they felt a laryngitis was most likely bacterial or fungal (had a visual question of a fungal appearance); ie: possible fungal supraglottis.
Fevers: Unclear etiology; assumed to be associated with the viral/bacterial/fungal illness causing his suprglottic edema.
There was no evidence of esophageal trauma.
S/P Transplant: The patient was unable to take his immunosuppressant medications for approximately 2 days due to his odynophagia.
The patient was noted to be hypertensive while in the MICU with SBPs ranging from the 120s to 170s (generally in the 140s-150s).
Given the patient's inability to easily take oral medications, he was not treated for his hypertension while in the ICU.
Disp:*22 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Laryngitis Supra-epiglottic edema s/p liver transplant   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty swallowing and swelling at the throat, plus fever.
You never had airway swelling, compromise, or obstruction, but were monitored overnight in the ICU.
If you have further throat swelling, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, or high fevers, or pain with swallowing, then call your physician or return to the hospital.
