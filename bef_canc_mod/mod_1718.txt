Due to involvementof the transverse foramina, CT angiography should be considered because of the potential for vertebral artery injury.
Right thyroid nodule can be evaluated by ultrasound when clinically appropriate.
Comminuted fractures of both temporomandibular joints, with subluxation on the right and complete dislocation on the left.
Fracture of the left squamous temporal bone, with trace pneumocephalus in the middle cranial fossa.
Bilateral preseptal hemorrhages and right retroorbital contusion/hemorrhage.
Shattered spleen (grade 5 injury,) with extensive active arterial extravasation arising from the superior pole, and massive hemoperitoneum.
Additional foci of active bleeding in the left upper quadrant are also not excluded noting extensive pooling of the extravasated contrast.
Suspected focal dissection and potentiallly partially occlusive thrombus of the suprahepatic IVC, although flow is patent.

Bilateral anterior acetabulum and right inferior pubic ramus fractures.
[**2184-1-14**]:  right tib/fib x-ray:  IMPRESSION: Shin laceration, with shallow impaction fracture of the anterior tibial cortex; correlation with physical findings is suggested as the appearance raises concern for an open fracture.
Comminuted fractures of the bilateral temporal bones and mandibular condyles, with subluxation on the right mandibular condyle and complete dislocation on the left with a displace angulated fracture.
Fracture through the left squamous temporal bone with associated nearby intracranial pneumocephalus along the floor of the middle cranial fossa.
Bilateral preseptal hemorrhages and right retroorbital fat stranding suggesting contusion with suspected hemorrhage.
Uncomplicated splenic arteriogram with coil and Gelfoam embolization of the upper pole branch distribution.
Right greater than left proptosis, with interval increase in dense fluid collection posterior to the globe.
There is enlargement of the superior ophthalmic veins and cavernous sinuses,right more than left, increased compared with the prior study concerning for carotid-cavernous fistula.
Bilateral enlargement of the cavernous sinus, dilatation of the superior ophthalmic veins and proptosis with definite right-sided prominence of pathology.
Altogether, these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of right-sided carotid cavernous sinus fistula, which in the meantime has been also identified by conventional angiography.
Multiple fractures of the facial skull as previously reported.
No acute intracranial abnormality  [**2184-1-15**]: trans.
Unsuccessful embolization of the carotid cavernous fistula.
Unsuccessful embolization of the carotid cavernous fistula.
C2/C3 flexion distraction with fracture of the posterior C2 body and transverse processes, better demonstrated on CT C-spine.
Posttraumatic annular tear of the C2/C3 intervertebral disc as well as a tear of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
Questionable mild injury to the posterior ligamentous complex at the C2/C3 level.
Extensive prevertebral hematoma from skull base to C4 as well as diffuse hemorrhage involving the suboccipital soft tissues.
No evidence of cord contusion.
Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent with pleural effusion with some basilar atelectasis.
Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
The presence of bilateral mild-to-moderate pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, mild fluid overload.
There is no evidence of complications.
Interval embolization of the right superior ophthalmic vein.
Persistent right-sided proptosis and preseptal soft tissue swelling.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
No gross territorial infarction.
Fracture lines involving the body of C2 extending to the bilateral transverse processes, compatible with a "Hangman's fracture" are still evident though the previously noted distraction of C2 on C3 is improved status post anterior C2-C3 fusion with intervertebral disc spacer placement.
Known associated prevertebral hematoma and swelling.
Systems based hospital course as follows:  INJURIES: - bilateral comminuted mandibular fx (OMFS non-operative) - basilar skull fx (non-operative) - L squamous temporal bone fx (non-operative) - Post C2 body fx w/ C2-3 flex-distraction (s/p ant fusion ortho-spine) - bilat preseptal hemorrhage (s/p neuro IR coiling/optho following/stable IOP) - tiny bilateral PTX (stable) - splenic injury (s/p splenectomy) - bilat anterior acetabular fx (stable, WB as tol) - R inferior pubic ramus fx (stable, WB as tol) - laceration x2 R anterior shin/knee (stable, WB as tol) - Shallow impaction fx ant tibial cortex (stable, WB as tol) - RLL contusion (stable, WB as tol)  Neuro: Patient was intubated in trauma bay for altered mental status.
Given hx opiate abuse chronic pain service was contact[**Name (NI) **] [**1-23**] to assist w pain control issues.
CT of the head and c-spine were completed as part of trauma evaluation revealing likely carotid-cavernous sinus fistula as well as C2 hangman's fracture.
Type I CC fistula w enlarged superior ophtalmic vein was seen and embolized.
Repair was initially deferred secondary to presumed pulmonary infection and hesitance to insert ortho spine hardware in setting of active infection.
Per ortho/Nsurg, CT head/c-spine performed [**1-27**] revealed interval placement of multiple embolization coils within the right superior ophthalmic vein.
There is persistent right-sided proptosis and preseptal soft tissue swelling.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
On [**2184-2-3**] she underwent a repeat cartoid angiogram and had placment of 3 coils to the right carotid sinus fistula.
Right ophthalmologic injury noted with ophtho consult obtained on [**1-14**].
Bedside evaluation [**1-15**] was notable for bedside periorbital blood evacuation by opthalmology.
[**1-16**] optho exam was notable for pressures as follows: R eye pressure 18,23,21.
Pulmonary: Patient was intubated in trauma bay for altered mental status/agitation.
Noted to have small B/L PTX though chest tubes not required.
[**1-19**] patient made progress weaning ventilatory support.
Trajectory of pulmonary progress improved such that patient met criteria for extubation [**1-24**].
Speculated that poor gag at this time may be related to superior laryngeal nerve stress in setting of recent neck instrumentation.
S&S tried PMV eval [**1-27**] which patient did not tolerate due to coughing and increase secretions.
GI/GU: Trauma scan revealed splenic laceration for which patient was brought to IR for attempted embolization.
Foley was placed as part of trauma evaluation.

Eval by ortho notable for non-op management.
She was reported to have severe coughing with the cuff deflated and recommendations made to down-size trach tube before attempts made to allow oral intake.
She was evaluated by Opthamology for further assessement of visual acuity, but exam deferred related to patient's mental status, but recommendations made for lacrilube to right eye every 2 hours.
She did experience coughing after swallowing thick nectar and pain with chewing.
