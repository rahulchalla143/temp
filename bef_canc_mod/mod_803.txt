Intraosseous access obtained.
Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with h/o CVA and baseline non-communicative, aspiration pna, hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt who was brought in from NH by son for nausea and vomiting.
Also noted to have increased yellow secretions.
CT head was done given h/o hydrocephalus and new onset vomiting.
CT was concerning for enlarged 3rd ventricle thus neurosurgery evaluated pt and felt unlikely to represent signficant change.
CT Abd/Pelvis done which showed bibasilar opacities c/w aspiration pneumonia.
Pt given Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for aspiration pna.
Also of note, during the multiple line attemps, pt became increasing tachycardic, hypotensive, vomiting with ?aspiration.
Of note, pt was admitted [**Date range (1) 39587**] with fever,cough and intially tx for aspiration pna but subsequently found to have C.diff and Proteus UTI; d/c'd with 10D meropenem and 14D flagyl.
He was then readmitted [**Date range (1) 27450**] for recurrent c.diff, VRE UTI and yeast UTI and d/c'd on flagyl, fluconazole and tetracycline.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's dementia Bipolar disorder PVD DM type II Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt (son says it was placed 3-5 years ago  at [**Hospital3 **] with no revisions, unknown cause of hydrocephalus) H/o subdural hemorrhages (unknown if before or after shunt placed) Hearing loss with hearing aids Cataracts Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia h/o SIADH with fluid restriction of 1L per day h/o aspiration PNAs s/p recent CVA ([**2190-6-3**]) Recent C. diff infection h/o VRE UTI   Social History: Resides in NH.
Family History: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's and Bipolar Disease.
VP shunt - scalp site easily compressible HEENT: Pupils: 6-4 mm B/L Neck: Supple.
Lungs: Coarse crackles B/L.
Cardiac: Heart sounds are irregularly irregular, with a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla.
Hypoactive bowel sounds Extrem: Cold peripheries.
Extensive tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities at the lung bases are suggestive of aspiration.
Poorly defined areas of hypodensity in the left kidney are new from a prior study from [**2188**] and raise concern for infectious or ischemic process.
No evidence of acute bowel process.
No midline shift.
Persistent dilatation of the lateral ventricles.
These findings may be chronic but correlation with signs of increased cranial pressure recommended.
Renal U/S ([**8-19**]): IMPRESSION: No definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] correlates identified for bilateral renal hypodensities seen on previous CT, with no solid masses identified.
The nephrographic abnormalities on recent CT are suspicious for infectious or ischemic process and their lack of visualization may relate to limitations of this study.
There is still some right infrahilar and left suprahilar opacification consistent with aspiration.
However, some of this may also reflect crowding of vessels due to poor inspiration.
Right UE U/S ([**8-23**]): IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right upper extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: # Aspiration pneumonia Initially febrile with leukocytosis.
He had sputum cultures sent, which grew MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.
At time of discharge, his fevers and leukocytosis have resolved, he continues to have SpO2 in the upper 90s on room air, and his secretions have improved.
# Hypovolemia Labs initially suggestive of significant volume depletion with hypotension, increased calcium, BUN, hematocrit.
He received 4L IV NS in the ED via intraosseous line as no peripherals or central lines could be placed.
Also, he was tachycardic, likely both from volume depletion and holding his antihypertensives due to hypotension.
His blood pressure and heart rate normalized with volume resuscitation, and his TLC was d/c'd once PICC access was obtained with IR assistance.
# Hypertension Occurred a few days after his hypovolemia and hypotension were corrected.
Likely due to a rebound effect from being off his home antihypertensives, especially clonidine.
The hypertension resolved after these medications were resumed, albeit at lower doses and with clonidine given PO.
His EKG showed stable LVH and new TWI in the anteroseptal leads.
# N/V CT showed no acute abdominal pathology.
[**Name (NI) **] son felt that his mental status was at baseline.
Following extubation, TFs were restarted gradually with high residuals, so he was started on reglan for presumed diabetic gastroparesis as the cause of his vomiting.
There may have also been contribution by his UTI, as this has caused these symptoms in him previously.
# Anemia Hematocrit initially 41.9 due to hemoconcentration from dehydration.
No coffee grounds were noted since the ED, and his stool was guaiac negative x2.
# FEN Initially had to hold TF for high residuals, but after reglan was started, we were able to advance him to a goal of 45ml/hr, which was well tolerated.
He received 35 units glargine qhs due to initial decreased enteral intake, but this was increased to 60 units glargine qhs at discharge as he is at goal with TFs and having glucose levels upper 200s, lower 300s.
# R UE swelling Doppler U/S performed and showed no evidence of DVT.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain: Max 4g/day.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing on exam.

Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus type 2, controlled, with complications Peripheral vascular disease Hypertension Prior cerebrovascular accident Chronic anemia Hydrocephalus with ventriculoperitoneal shunt   Discharge Condition: Stable.
This was likely because the tube feeds were passing through your bowels very slowly, perhaps due to diabetes.
We also found a bladder infection, and treated both infections with IV antibiotics.
It became high later, but improved when we restarted your outpatient medications.
If you experience any nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, fevers, chills, increased sputum, blood in the vomit or stool, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention or come to the emergency room immediately.
