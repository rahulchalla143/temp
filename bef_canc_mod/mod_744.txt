However, his wife stated that he has had more dyspnea on exertion and fatigue recently.

The patient also has a history of sleep apnea.
A recently performed echocardiogram showed moderate severe aortic insufficiency with ejection fraction of approximately 25%.
A repeat cardiac catheterization performed on [**2131-9-3**] showed one vessel branch coronary artery disease, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild biventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary arterial diastolic hypertension.
[**6-24**] echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 20% to 25% with multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical akinesis, anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, inferior hypokinesis/akinesis as well as lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20% to 29%.
History of myocardial infarction.
