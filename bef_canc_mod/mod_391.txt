This morning she triggered again for hypotension (80s/50s), fever (101.1), and AMS (A+OX1 when normally A+OX3).
The team evaluated her and thought likely sepsis given leukocytosis on am labs, fever, and recent procedure.

There is no focal airspace consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Moderate thoracic kyphosis is again noted with mild anterior loss of vertebral heights.
ERCP ([**8-27**]): IMPRESSION: There is dilatation of the common bile duct and distal intrahepatic ducts.
There is an irregular appearing filling defect at the distal common bile duct.
TTE ([**8-29**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Indeterminate diastolic indices.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
No ampullary or pancreatic mass identified.
Redemonstration of 17 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, which is stable from [**Month (only) 116**] [**2108**], however concerning for metastasis given the history of rectal cancer.
Interval development of moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, new since [**2108-8-18**].
Biliary-pancreatic Junction Brushings ([**8-27**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Atrial Fibrillation: Her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate presented itself as shortness of breath, flash pulmonary edema resposive to Lasix, morphine, Nitro drip.
On [**9-3**], cardioversion was performed, with restoration of sinus rythym for several hours.
# Septic Shock/Ampullary Mass: Patient had outpatient ERCP on [**8-27**].
On [**8-29**], she had hypotension, fever and WBC to 15 and was transferred to the MICU due to biliary sepsis in the setting of post ERCP obstruction.
Patient dropped pressures acutely  with zubsequent urgent intubation.
CT scan abdomen showed no evidence of an ampullary mass.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
When you came to the emergency department, we found that your heart was beating very fast in an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
In order to better control your blood pressure, we increased your Diovan to 240 mg a day and added a new medication called Amlodipine.
On your last admission, a CT scan showed that you may have a mass near your pancreas.
This procedure was complicated by an infection in the liver and gallbladder, called cholangitis.
This was a serious type of infection called sepsis and you were admitted to the medical ICU.
They gave you antibiotics to treat the infections and medications to keep your blood pressure up.
The biopsy taken was negative for malignancy and a follow-up CT Scan showed no mass in your pancreas.
