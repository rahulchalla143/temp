No acute cervical spine fracture.
Degenerative changes with posterior disc-osteophyte complex at C6-C7 level causing mild spinal canal narrowing at that level, which increases risk of cord injury.
Bilateral lung apices show septal thickening, may be related to fluid overload.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
Small focal left parieto-occipital scalp hematoma/soft tissue swelling.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion.
Focal area of hyperenhancement in the hepatic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent a vascular malformation vs flash-filling hemangioma.
Collapsed bowel, with prominence of the ascending colon and hepatic flexure, mild bowel wall thickening/underlying injury can not be excluded.
Bilateral breast calcifications.
Plain films pelvis ([**11-17**]): No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
A left-sided pacer is present.
No fracture or dislocation identified.
There are mild degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint and acromioclavicular joint.
There is increased right lower lobe opacity, suggesting increase in small right pleural effusion seen on prior CT, although underlying consolidation not excluded.
There is also left basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis as well as possible effusion.
There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
TTE ([**11-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There is a trivial pericardial effuison that appears similar on the prior study.
CT C-spine ([**11-19**]): No fracture or subluxation.
Mild degenerative changes.
C-SPINE NON TRAUMA FLEX ([**11-20**]): There are no areas of fracture.
Altered mental status: History not clear, but most likely due to temazepam overdose +/- oxycodone.
She was on propofol on arrival to the ICU, which was held to reassess mental status.
She became agitated but did not open eyes or follow commands, so was kept on propofol overnight.
Psych was consulted and 1:1 sitter initially ordered as it was unclear if the overdose was intentional or not.
The patient did not remember the events leading to admission, but had no history of suicidal ideations, so psych said she did not need 1:1 sitter or Section 12.
Pleural effusion: Appeared on repeat CXR and most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of fall.
No fever, leukocytosis, O2 requirement, or sx suggesting pneumonia, so antibiotics were held.
Patient had no desats during admission on room air.
Elevated troponin: Troponins trended on HD1 and reached plateau (Trop -> .17) , with normal MB-index.
EKG showing only paced rhythm and unable to assess symptoms while intubated.
Most likely demand ischemia in setting of her fall leading to admission.
Notably patient had another set of cardiac enzymes drawn on HD5 in the context of mild chest-pain and shortness of breath.
Thought to be due to fluid overload given that patient was receiving IVF boluses for reduced urine output.
Reduced Urine Output: Patient was noted to have reduced UOP on transfer to the floor.
There was no evidence of acute bleeds, the patients Hct remained stable.
Patient also on coumadin during stay, excluding period when patient had supratherapeutic INR.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) Puff Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

The patient was tolerating PO, was afebrile, without evidence of acute bleeding, breathing comfortably, with stable vital signs.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after your were found unconscious and unresponsive by your husband.
It is possible that your took too many of your sleeping or pain pills.
When you became conscious, we removed the tube.
We ruled out any major injuries to your head, neck, chest, and abdomen.
If you have fevers > 102, vision changes, loss of consciousness, confusion, very low urine output, light-headedness, tingling/weakness in your arms, chest pain, severe nausea/vomting, bloody diarrhea, or any other concerning symptom, please call your PCP or report to the nearest ED.
