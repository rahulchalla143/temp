However, secondary to persistent fever, hypotension, and hemoptysis this discharge was delayed.
Over the next several days the patient's fevers continued to spike, and the patient was placed on ceftazidime to cover to gram-negative rods as well as vancomycin and Flagyl.
The patient's laboratories became consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation, and she became persistently hypotensive requiring pressor support as well as intravenous fluids.
At this time, it was decided that the patient should be continued on her mode of cardiopulmonary resuscitation not indicated and no aggressive measures taken for resuscitation.

Over the next two days, the patient's blood pressure began to drop and she subsequently became hypotensive.
