There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-1-24**], the mitral regurgitation is probably worse (and almost certainly underestimated in both studies), and the pulmonary hypertension is also worse.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 y/o female with significant risk factors for CAD, s/p CABG, AVR, s/p atrial thrombus on anticoagulation, PM for complete heart block who presented with acute dsypnea, and hypertension urgency.
# Dyspnea: Presumed diagnosis was flash pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic hypertension, restenosed bio-prosthetic valve, and non-adherence to medication regimen.
Echo prior to discharge showed severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis and worse mitral regurgitation compared to previous studies.
Therefore, she was scheduled for appropriate follow-up, including with cardiothoracic surgery.
# CAD/CHF: Medical management for these chronic problems were as above.
There were no findings to suggest ischemia as an etiology to her decompensation.
