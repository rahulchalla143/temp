Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] is a 69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF (EF 60-70%, 3+ MR) and GAVE who presents following an episode of hematemesis and maroon stools at home.
At that time, she was found to be more anemic than usual and was given IVF and 2u pRBC in the ER, after which she developed flash pulmonary edema and required intubation and a short stay in the MICU.
Of note, during her last hospital stay, she was noted to have lateral TW depressions and + troponins which were felt to be due to demand ischemia.
She states that she first felt tingling and pain in her fingers and toes, to the point where she was unable to put her feet on the ground.
No nausea prior to her vomiting.
15-20 mins later, Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] then felt the sudden urge to have a BM and had a liquid maroon stool which was guaiac positive.
She denies any abdominal pain associated w/ the BM.
+ persistent burping, but that has actually decreased in frequency since her last admission.
She has never had an episode of hematemesis before.
She was evaluated by GI and taken for an EGD which showed findings c/w GAVE.
Her angiodysplasias were coagulated w/ an argon laser and the pt was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring of fluid status and serial Hct's.
She remained hemodynamically stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] w/o any further episodes of hematemesis or melena, and her Hct remained stable, so she was transferred to the medical floor for futher monitoring.
DM type II - c/b nephropathy and neuropathy 2.
CAD - suspected by stress test ([**Doctor Last Name 4001**]) in [**2153-5-22**]: Mild global hypokinesis.
Anemia: multifactorial (ESRD + iron deficiency [**12-27**] GIB) - colonoscopy on [**2153-8-7**] -> two nonbleeding polyps in sigmoid - EGD [**2153-8-7**] -> sig for erythema, edema, and erosion in the antrum c/w gastritis in addition to erythema in the proximal bulb c/w duodenitis - EGD [**12-31**] demonstated GAVE 6.
MMM w/ thrush on tongue, improved since last admission.
NECK: Neck supple, no JVD.
III/VI soft systolic murmur heard at RUSB, II/VI holosystolic murmur heard at LLSB.
CHEST: CTAB, except for few crackles at bases bilaterally.
ABD: Soft, protuberant abdomen, no fluid wave, no ascites; + BS; obvious ventral hernia, otherwise no masses; no hepatomegaly.
R index finger has ?
- Stomach: Flat Lesions Multiple angiodysplasias/watermelon stomach was seen in the antrum compatible with GAVE.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
- Impression: Watermelon stomach in the antrum, Angiodysplasias in the first part of the duodenum, Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum .
CXR [**2154-2-26**]: No evidence of CHF or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
EGD [**2154-2-27**]: Mild erythema in the first part of the duodenum Angioectasia in the antrum Erosion in the cardia Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum ..   Brief Hospital Course: 69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF and h/o UGIB/GAVE, now presenting with hematemesis and melena.
An EGD was performed which showed bleeding in gastric antrum, likely due to GAVE.
# THRUSH: Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] has thrush, but it appeared improved since her last hospitalization.
# CAD: Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13231**] has CAD, given that she had a stress MIBI that showed EKG changes but no perfusion defects at normal workload.
She has no h/o of MI, but does have elevated troponins at baseline.
During her last admission, she experienced lateral TW depressions as well as a troponin leak felt to be due to demand ischemia.
She was continued on a beta-blocker and statin, but was not given an aspirin due to her UGIB.
She had crackles at her L lung base on exam but no shortness of breath or hypoxia.
She was continued on her regular HD schedule and her volume status was managed by renal.
# DM II: Her fingersticks were monitored QID and she originally was on her regular glipizde dose as well as a regular insulin sliding scale for additional coverage.
# ESRD: Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] has been receiving HD since [**2153-11-25**].
# FINGER LESIONS: It was noted prior to discharge that Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] has some lesions on the tips of her fingers.
