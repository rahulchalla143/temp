No acute intracranial pathology identified.
Probable small mucus retention cyst within the right maxillary sinus.
[**2142-7-23**] - CXR IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
[**2142-7-24**] - EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no actual pushbutton activations despite a few possible errors.
The routine EEG appeared normal in wakefulness and in drowsiness or sleep.
Automated detection captured one episode of rhythmic shaking.
The EEG slowing seemed likely artifactual due to the head movement.
The movements captured on video did not appear to represent an epileptic seizure.
There were some segments with normal posterior background amidst the movement, and the movements were very asynchronous.
There were no epileptic events on her EEG.
She continued to have convulsions while in the ICU on [**2142-7-24**] despite the negative EEG evidence for epileptic events.
She had a workup for reversible seizure triggers.
The patient had a severely depressed TSH suggesting possible hypothyroidism as her trigger.
She became very angry after this fall saying that the 1:1 sitter didn't try to prevent it and the nurses were slow to respond.
