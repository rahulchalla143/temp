Brief Hospital Course: 64yo M with HIV, HBV, HCV, HCC, cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] ([**6-4**]), a history of DVT/PE and nephrolithiasis, who was admitted on [**5-28**] for antibiotic treatment of a VRE UTI and bridge from coumadin to heparin for lithotripsy procedure [**6-1**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fevers, confusion, unstable vitals consistent with urosepsis/shock, requiring transfer to the  MICU and broad antibiotic therapy, now transferred back to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service, stable, and ready for discharge.
# UTI/Urosepsis/Urolithiasis: On admission, an oupatient culture was reported as growing Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus.

During the middle of the night, he was noted to have altered mental status.
Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: The patient was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia thought to be secondary to an aspiration.
Other etiologies considered were hypoxia secondary to volume overload from IV fluid boluses (last echo in [**2132**] was normal) and pneumonia.
Antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with meropenem was started on [**6-2**] and vancomycin was added on [**6-3**] to provide better coverage for MRSA.
CXR on [**6-3**] showed a stable left lower lobe consolidation with new opacity and air bronchograms in the right middle lobe that could possible be atelectasis.
Respiratory aspirate cultures  were without growth.
S/P OLT: The patient has a hx of hepatitis B, HCC, and is s/p OLT one year prior to presentation.
On admission he had stable LFTs and no signs of encephalopathy on tacrolimus, cellcept, and bactrim prophyllaxis.
Following his lithotripsy, the patient developed with abdominal distension concerning for ascites, confirmed by ultrasound, along with positive asterixis.
In combination with his altered mental status, this was concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
