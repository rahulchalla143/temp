Admission Date:  [**2165-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-9-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-8-17**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease including two prior coronary artery bypass grafts, myocardial infarction in [**2139**] and a lung nodule who had presented for catheterization pre-operative work-up for lung mass resection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease with two prior coronary artery bypass grafts in [**2145**] and a saphenous vein graft to his left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to his posterior descending artery.
Myocardial infarction in [**2139**], hypercholesterolemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, lung nodule and emphysema.
Chest, no wheezes, crackles or rales.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was tender in his lower abdomen.
Bilateral groin hematomas were tender but no bruits were present.
CKs have been 42 and 45 and EKG on admission revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 120 with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray revealed no cardiomegaly, no pneumothorax with mild to moderate CHF but no effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient arrived in the CCU and after approximately 30-40 minutes became severely hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 40's to 50's.
He also became tachycardic initially and then bradycardic.
The concern was that he had developed pericardial tamponade.
Second concern was that of hemodynamic status and a Swan Ganz catheter was passed from his left femoral sheath which revealed a central venous pressure of 6, right ventricular pressure of 31/5 and a wedge pressure of 11 consistent with mild hypovolemia.
He was sedated and intubated and an abdominal CT scan was done because of the concern of enlarging bilateral groin hematomas.
The abdominal CT revealed stranding of right groin consistent with small hematoma but no retroperitoneal hematoma was found.
