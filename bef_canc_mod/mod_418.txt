NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Findings are consistent with pulmonary edema, including noncardiogenic causes, including ingestion and drug reaction, as well as pulmonary hemorrhage or unusual condition such as chronic or acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
Possible short segment of small bowel wall thickening in the left mid abdomen.
The differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious, ischemic and inflammatory etiologies for enteritis.
Rectal wall thickening and perirectal stranding suggestive of proctitis.
Lack of intravenous contrast, limits sensitivity for the detection of a small intra-abdominal abscess.
No large intra-abdominal abscess.
Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar consolidations and scattered ground glass opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
Unchanged bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi.
Right renal low attenuation lesion, incompetely characterized, likely representing a cyst.
------- MRI c-spine [**2128-1-24**]: CONCLUSION: Mild degenerative disc disease with a small midline protrusion at C6-7 that does not contact the spinal cord.
The study is limited in quality due to motion artifact, but there is no definite evidence of neural foraminal encroachment.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 47 year old man with history of Type I diabetes mellitus found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, likely in DKA, also found to have multifocal PNA and acute renal failure/metabolic acidosis.
1) Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Pt with a history of type I diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled in the past with multiple hospital admission for DKA.
As per HPI pt found unresponsive with significantly elevated blood sugar transferred from OSH for intensivist management of DKA.
DKA likely secondary to infection, with possible sources being pneumonia +/- recent tooth extraction.
Given significant renal failure patient's insulin regimen has required close monitoring and daily adjustments.
2) Respiratory Failure: Pt found unresponsive at home and intubated at OSH and remained intubated when transferred to the MICU.
Found to have combination of pulmonary edema and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
Determined to have sputum cultures positive for MRSA and treated for multifocal pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
3) Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: On admission ABG was 6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6.
Also found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 5.1.
Metabolic acidosis felt to be due to a combination of DKA, rhabdomyolysis, infection and question of ingestion.
Acute renal failure likely secondayr to dehydration and hypotension secondary to DKA leading to a pre-renal/ATN picture.
Metabolic significantly improved with resolution of DKA as well as treatment pneumonia.
Renal failure has continued to trend down and is 2.8 at time of discharge.
Please also monitor bicarbonate and assess for whether oral bicarbonate supplementation needed.
Patient has remained afebrile for nearly his enture time on the medicine [**Hospital1 **].
5)Diarrhea: Patient has had diarrhea since about [**2128-1-18**].
Had guiac positive stool.
Had cervical MRI which was negative for mass or abscess.
Seen by neuro that felt he has a C5/C6 radiculopathy or an upper trunk plexopathy likely [**2-23**] to being found down.
8) Chronic Neuropathic Pain: Patient has hx of chronic pain, especially in his back.
Pain has been managed with fentanyl patches and IV morphine.
Suspect that pain will improve when patient not bed bound and able to be more mobile.
9) Scrotal Edema: Pt has significant pain from scrotal edema which is [**2-23**] fluid resucitation and continued volume redistribution.
Suggest monitoring creatinine and stopping this medication if worsening Cr or if scrotal edema improves.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain/fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Diabetic ketoacidosis, Acute renal failure, Methicillin resistant staph aureus pneumonia, C5/C6 radiculopathy Secondary: Type I diabetes mellitus, Anemia possibly secondary to blood loss, Chronic Neuropathic pain, Depression   Discharge Condition: Stable, clinically improved   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital because you were found to be unresponsive and were in diabetic ketoacidosis from very high blood sugar.
You were also found to have a severe pneumonia and have been treated on antibiotics which you will need to continue taking until [**2128-2-1**].
You were also found to have renal failure which is resolving.
If you experience fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath or persistently high blood sugars please contact your primary care physician or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
