Admission Date: [**2164-1-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2164-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was admitted to our Emergency Room on [**2164-1-16**], complaining of chest pain since the evening prior.
He had a known history of myocardial infarction with prior left anterior descending coronary artery stenting in [**2161-9-10**].
Immediate scanning of the patient revealed a type B aortic dissection with patent vasculature to his SMA and renals.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post two stents.
Atrial fibrillation.
Status post myocardial infarction.
IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed first degree AV block.
CT scan of the chest showed type B dissection extending into the right femoral vessels.
Heart:  He had S1 and S2 heart tones with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  He had positive femoral pulses bilaterally and positive dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who examined him and noted lability of his blood pressure.
TEE later that day showed normal left ventricular function with normal valves and no dissection of the ascending aorta, as well as a normal right ventricle and left ventricle.
His blood pressure was 100/44 on an Esmolol drip and a Nipride drip.
Serial lactates were also drawn.
He also had maintained his peripheral positive dorsalis pedis and femoral pulses bilaterally.
The patient was also seen by Cardiology when he developed what appeared to be atrial fibrillation.
He was also given 6 mg bolus of adenosine with no change and then a 12 mg bolus of adenosine which had terminated the supraventricular tachycardia and resumed sinus rhythm in the 70s with a prolonged QT.
He had no abdominal tenderness and continued to make good urine.
The following day, he had no further supraventricular tachycardia.
He did receive a single dose of ibutilide for that initial episode of atrial fibrillation.
Later that day, the patient did complain of a sharp pain in the center of his back which prevented him from taking a deep breath.
He also was noted to have a lingering slow nose bleed.
Later that evening he had a single episode of supraventricular tachycardia with his heart rate to 130s.
He also complained of severe urinary retention.
EP continued to follow the patient for his random tachycardia.
He had some slight erythema in his left upper extremity antecubital space.
Flomax was started on the patient for urinary retention.
Warm packs were placed for his left upper extremity antecubital erythema.
On house-day 6, the patient continued to have elevations in his blood pressure to 162/80.
Magnesium Citrate was given for complaints of constipation by the patient.
MRA performed on the 11th showed his type B aortic dissection originating in the distal subclavian and extending all the way down to the right common iliac.
It also noted all mesenteric vessels originated from the true lumen and two right renal arteries and a single left renal artery all arise from the true lumen.
In addition, there was incidental notation of several hepatic and multiple bilateral renal cysts including a 1.2 cm cyst in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
The patient continued to have good urine output and otherwise was doing well, other than mild depression over his lack of blood pressure control and having to remain hospitalized.
The patient complained of dizziness but was much better at the time of exam with a blood pressure of 105 where he remained in sinus rhythm.
He was also encouraged to use his incentive spirometer and cough and deep breath, given his limited ability to ambulate at the time of blood pressure issues.
The patient did not complain of any chest pain or abdominal pain.
On postoperative day 10, he did have much better blood pressure control with decreased Labetalol with a blood pressure of 126/79.
He was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one week, his cardiologist, and to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately three months for continued monitoring of his type B dissection.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post type B aortic dissection.
Atrial fibrillation/AV nodal reentrant tachycardia with ablation.
Status post myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending coronary artery stenting times two.
