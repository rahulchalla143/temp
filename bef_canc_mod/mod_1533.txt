Patient has had progressively worsening stridor and dysphagia - evaluated in [**Hospital **] clinic ([**Hospital 64107**]) in [**Month (only) 547**] and sent for CT of neck [**4-3**] that showed a large soft tissue neck mass.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was hypoxic requiring 3L NC; WBC 12.3 with a L shift and had a CXR showing RML PNA.
ENT saw pt in ED and on laryngoscope he had diffuse edema of B/L vocal cords but not epiglottitis with marked airway narrowing.
At NH had been noted to have increasing lethargy, confusion on [**4-8**] with increasing cream colored sputum.
It was unclear if it was recurrence of his cancer or a complication of his surgery several months ago.
Underwent rigid bronchoscopy and biopsy [**4-10**] to obtain tissue of this mass, which showed squamous mucosa with fibrosis and perivascular acute and chronic inflammation, no malignancy identified.
Also had EGD at the same time, which showed a widely patent anastomosis, no masses, multiple gastric polyps.
Had CT chest to assess of new lymph nodes/metastatic disease, which showed CHF/new ascites, but no metastases, LAD.
Did show partial mass as seen on CT from [**4-3**].
On [**4-13**], went to OR again for tracheostomy, direct laryngoscopy/biopsy of hypopharyngeal mass as it was felt they did not get enough tissue the first time, pathology still pending.
Had multiple episodes of hypotension, decreased UOP.
Underwent echo which showed new decreased EF 30-35%, moderately dilated LA/moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with HK of basal wall.
Moderate pulmonary HTN.

Had an initial biopsy which did not show evidence of malignancy.
Given the rapid growing nature of the mass and his h/o esophageal adenocarcinoma, malignancy was high on the differential.
He had a tracheostomy placed during his second biopsy as there was concern of the mass compromising his airway.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64107**] of ENT at which time they will discuss how to treat the mass and how long he will need to have his trach.
