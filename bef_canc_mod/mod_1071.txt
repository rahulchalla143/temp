Ms. [**Known lastname **] had stent placed in the setting urosepsis due to 5.5 mm calcium oxalate impacted right kidney stone.
She reports that around 1130 morning of night of admission she developed generalized pruritis.
This progressed to blurry vision and back (mostly right) pain followed by diffuse four-extremity pain.
She notes that she had nausea and vomiting X2 during this time.
She also had joint pain which has been present since [**9-12**].
She denies any new medications or exposures.
Her only sick contact is her son who has a sinus infection.
She then developed sepsis with urine culture positive for E. coli.
Her post-hospital course was signifiant for urinary retention (possibly due to narcotics) on [**10-7**] with foley catheter placement and repeat placement on [**10-11**].
She was readmitted due to fever, abdominal pain and a UA at that time at [**Hospital3 **] had [**11-23**] WBC and she was started on Levaquin IV X3 days and she was discharged with oral bactrim again and with a foley catheter.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 84786**] with fever, LE pain and rash, hypotension and a positive UA.
On [**12-7**], patient had a cystoscopy, ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy and basket extraction of right ureteral stone, along with placement of a double-J stent.
She was d/c'd on bactrim and within few hours after taking bactrim, was readmitted to hosp with presumed urosepsis and treated wtih course of levaquin.
She states she had the same reactions every other time she became "septic" which she correlates with some sort of GU procedure or urinary retention.
Labs were significant for a leukocytosis and a non-gap metabolic acidosis, a leukocytosis and a UA with 3-5 WBC and negative nitrite.

Imaging/results: CXR portable [**12-26**]:  mild pulm edema .
Mild dilatation of the upper pole calix of the right kidney.
A few small echogenic foci with ring-down artifact in the renal pelvis may represent small amounts of gas in the collecting system of the right kidney.
This may be due to recent removal of right ureteral catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: 45year old female with complicated recent urological history with obstsructing stone s/p stent [**9-26**] complicated by urosepsis, then urinary retention and recurrent UTIs, lithotripsy/stone removal/stent exchange on [**12-7**], now transfered from OSH 24hours after stent removal [**12-24**] with fevers/hypotension presumed to be urosepsis.
Pt was admitted once again with presumed sepsis after stent removal.
Her urine looked quite dirty with a lot of debris which supported the diagnosis.
Given her unusual prodrome of symptoms prior to her last 3-4hospitalizations, detailed history was obtained from pt/boyfriend multiple times and each time it appeared that this may be her unusual manifestation of infection but there was no clear answer why.
They decided to d/c IV abx and give trial of bactrim, which she recieved first dose 12/26 8pm, and by 8:30, developed pruritis, diffuse myalgias, arthlagias, flushing, SOB, anxiety, tearing of eyes with blurry vision, diffuse skin pain.
These appear to be the exact symptoms which the last few times have been misinterpreted in ER as urosepsis.
On review of all of her records, it is now clear that pt has recieved bactrim on multiple occasions after her first exposure in [**9-12**]  and each time has had this similar reaction  (pt recieved bactrim on [**10-4**] (first exposure), then 2nd exposure on [**10-14**] with similar symptoms starting within 12hours (back pain, flushing, fevers, hypotension, arthralgias), then 3rd exposure [**12-8**] wtih symptoms occuring a few hours after, then 4th exposure [**12-25**] am with symptoms occuring shortly after that led to this admission, and now 5th exposure [**12-29**] with symptoms occuring 30min after)  which was interpreted each time as urosepsis given time correlation with invasive urological procedure.
Was seen by derm for her severe hypersensitivity reaction with concern for [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
She did have debris in her urine once again to suggest some mucositis (which is likely what had occured in past and was interpreted as UTI).
All her Abx were d/c'd since now the suspicion for UTI was low.
Was seen by ophtho given vision changes who reassured that there was no conjunctival involvement.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bactrim Hypersensitivity-severe reaction Possible mild UTI post stent removal   Discharge Condition: STABLE normal mental status ambulating independently  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a complex of symptoms which we initially thought were due to sepsis from UTI but are now more clearly related to severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) to bactrim (sulfa drugs).
You probably did not have a UTI after your stent removal and again, the whole set of symptoms with fever/rash/diffuse pain/blurry vision/eye pain/joint pains were all due to bactrim.
Now you have no stone and no stent and should not have any infection issues.
