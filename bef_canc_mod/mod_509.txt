Admission Date:  [**2164-7-2**]       Discharge Date: [**Numeric Identifier 24223**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old male with coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146**] and [**2145**] with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the LPL, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending and mitral regurgitation, recent PCIs of saphenous vein graft to LPL, details unknown and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery, status post stent in [**State 108**].
There is a 50% proximal stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to LPL and an 80% mid vessel lesion, and at that time the vessel was stented times two.
He presented on [**2164-7-2**] with complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath.
The patient went into pulmonary edema and was intubated also with a history of mitral regurgitation.
The catheterization showed wedge of 13, severe mitral regurgitation, left main 80%, proximal left anterior descending 80%, mid left anterior descending 100%, proximal circumflex 70%, saphenous vein graft to LPL 90%, left internal mammary artery normal.
The patient had no complications.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, see history of present illness, diabetes mellitus on Glucophage, Actos and Prandin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, status post transient ischemic attack, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
AT-HOME MEDICATIONS:  Furosemide 80 q.d., Enteric coated Aspirin, Allopurinol 30 q.d., Imdur 60 q.d., Atenolol, Actos, Prandin, Glucophage, Pepcid, Lipitor 20 q.d., Digoxin 0.25 q.d., Lisinopril 10 q.d., Colace and Ophthalmic drops.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no history of smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination vital signs revealed temperature currently 96.6, blood pressure 105/51 with a heartrate of 63.
Neck, no jugulovenous pressure.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Electrocardiogram precatheterization showed minimal ST depressions in V5 and V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent brachytherapy on [**2164-7-4**] without complications.
On [**7-6**], the patient was given multiple doses of Metoprolol and started on Captopril and Norvasc which were titrated up, so there was a very high blood pressure and then on [**7-6**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.1.
Then two hours later when he became short of breath with oxygen saturations down to 80% acutely chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V4 and V5, thus he needs a second precatheterization.
Then blood cultures grew out gram positive cocci in clusters and he was started on Vancomycin for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage and continued on Levofloxacin for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage and pneumonia coverage.
Congestive heart failure, the patient with a previous echocardiogram that states that ejection fraction was 15% with 4+ mitral regurgitation, however, echocardiogram done here on [**7-4**] showed minimal decreased systolic function and trace mitral regurgitation.
Infectious disease, cultures grew out Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from blood cultures and from arterial line catheter tip.
Sputum culture showed rare growth.
Hematology, the patient was noted to have coffee grounds from nasogastric tube.
Aspirin and Plavix were continued for treatment of stent, however, he was continued on Protonix and guaiac stools times three.
