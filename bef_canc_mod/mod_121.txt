Admission Date:  [**2115-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Crixivan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old man with HIV (CD4 of 9, [**7-/2115**]) complicated by neuropathy, not on [**Year (4 digits) 2775**], with recent admission for aspiration pneumonia ([**8-10**] - [**8-22**]) with hypotension requiring ICU care initially treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, transitioned to Meropenem to complete an 11 day total course.
He also continued to have mild dyspnea on discharge and never fully reached his baseline prior to the pneumonia.
He describes severe lightheadedness on standing which makes it difficult for him to walk and this is further complicated by his continued dyspnea especially with exertion.
He noted that he was taking in large amounts of fluids during his prior hospitalization, but his fluid intake decreased on discharge.
He denies headache, vision changes, new weakness or numbness, palpitations, or syncope.
He denies cough, wheezing, chest pain, feves, chills, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, or upper respiratory symptoms.
He notes that he was supposed to be seen by VNA and PT on Friday, but his VNA did not come until Tuesday and they found him to be profoundly orthostatic and recommended that he go to the ED.
In the ED he was afebrile with BP 89/72 and was noted to be orthostatic (no vitals provided).
Given his poor venous access, a R subclavian triple lumen was placed.
Labs were notable for leukopenia (3.2) and stable chronic renal failure with cr of 2.5 (baseline 2.2-2.8) and normal lactate.
Overnight, he complains of lightheadedness on standing and shortness of breath with minimal exertion.
On ROS, he denies chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, leg pain or swelling, wheezing, cough, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or blood per rectum.

Pending results: [**2115-8-31**] 04:04PM BLOOD HIV GENOTYPING-PND  [**2115-8-29**] BLOOD CULTURE ( MYCO/F LYTIC BOTTLE) BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE-PRELIMINARY; BLOOD/AFB CULTURE-PRELIMINARY INPATIENT   Brief Hospital Course: 60M with HIV/AIDS (last CD4: 9, VL: 75K, [**2115-8-4**] not on ARVs) admitted with orthostatic hypotension, transferred to ICU with hypotension refractory to 4L NS and tachycardia in the setting of positive blood cultures concerning for sepsis.
# Sepsis: Patient initially admitted to medicine for orthostasis and dyspnea (below), but developed rigors (without fevers) and hypotension with tachycardia.
Blood cultures (1/2 bottles) returned positive for pan-sensitive coagulase negative staph.
He did not have any further rigors or temperature spikes.
# Dyspnea: Recent admission for multifocal pneumonia treated with 11 days total of Vanc/Zosyn then Miropenem.
In the abscence of clear source of infection without fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or cough on admission.
Patient does not have clinical signs of heart failure.
He was thought to simply be recovering from severe pneumonia.
PE though on the differential was felt to be less likley given that he is not tachycardic or hypoxemic.
Emperic antibiotics were initially deferred given lack of symtpoms, above, but later in his hospital course were initiated given concern for sepsis (above).
# Orthostatic hypotension: Patient has documented orthostasis from prior admission that did not resolve prior to discharge.
This is likely complicated by his underlying HIV neuropathy which may also be contributing to orthostasis.
Hematocrit is stable since discharge making acute blood loss an unlikely explanation for orthostasis.
# CKD: Creatinine 2.1, which appears to be his stable baseline since [**2104**].
# Depression: Stable.
# GERD: Stable.
