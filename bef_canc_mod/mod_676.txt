Diverting ostomy and repair of anastomotic leak.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35654**] is a 58-year-old man with multiple polyps in his colon who underwent a total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis on [**12-8**].
Initial postoperative course was complicated by bleeding requiring urgent re-exploration on the night of surgery.
He denies nausea, vomiting, but did have fevers and no chills.
MEDICATIONS:  Loperamide, Protonix, Roxicet and pancreatic enzymes.
Abdomen was severely distended with palpable loops of small bowel.
There was guarding and rebound, left greater than right lower quadrant, no shakes, no palpable hernias.
Abdominal x-ray showed free air into the diaphragm and dilated loops of small bowel.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, ostomy repair of an anastomotic leak.
His intra-abdominal cultures grew out organisms consistent with fecal soilage of the peritoneal cavity.
Once on the floor he had really no acute issues.
His bowels, as I mentioned, were slow to return to function, however, once ileostomy started to work he had no interruption in function.
Of note, the patient was on a Somatostatin drip for approximately a week to slow down his NG tube output, however, once his ileostomy started to consistently function, he continued with elevated NG output.
KUB confirmed placement of the NG tube in the stomach and it was decided that clamping trials would be initiated.
His residuals after four hours of clamping were 55 and 10 and NG tube was removed without difficulty.
The patient does have significant reflux disease and intermittently had trouble with his reflex, however, never had any evidence of bowel obstruction and tolerated his diet throughout.
He is being discharged to home on Protonix, Imodium prn and Tylenol for pain medication as well as his preoperative medications.
