Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old female with a multiple medical problems PMH significant for possible seizure disorder admitted for a  fall complicated by hypotension and mental status change and found to have a UTI.
#Fall: Patient found not to have a fracture.
She was seen by PT who thought that she was a high fall risk and recommended going to a rehab hospital.
Likely element of autonomic dysfunction.
# Change in Mental Status: Change in mental status may be due to polypharmacy, post-ictal confusion, primary CNS, and hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatology did not think that there was a liver etiology for her issues.
It is unclear if she has some unifying diagnosis to explain her liver abnormalities, hypothyroidism and seizures.
She did have elevated ferritin and some evidence of pituitary dysfunction.
# UTI: Prelim speciation as E.coli sensitive to bactrim.
# Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease and/or malnutrition.
# Nutritional status: Patient came in with low albumin and found to have low albumin.
