INDICATION: 80-year-old man with abdominal pain and known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
COMPARISONS: Prior abdominal ultrasound from [**2154-5-9**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without intravenous contrast, and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
Intravenous contrast was not administered because of renal insufficiency.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is subsegmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe, but no effusions.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no surrounding stranding.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The distal common duct measures approximately 8 mm in diameter without evidence of stones.
There are some scattered pancreatic calcifications.
Of note, there are enlarged periportal lymph nodes.
There is a 25 mm hypoattenuating focus in the right kidney, which has previously been ascertained as a simple cyst by ultrasound.
There is also a tiny 5 mm hyperdense cyst in the upper pole.
The appearance is likely unchanged allowing for differences in technique, and there is no evidence of a surrounding hematoma.
There is also a common iliac artery aneurysm on the right measuring 27 mm in diameter.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There are prostate calcifications.
BONE WINDOWS: There are marked degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine, but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Likely similar appearance of abdominal aortic aneurysm, allowing for differences in technique, with maximum diameter of 40 mm.
Moderately distended gallbladder, with stones.
No intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Prominent periportal lymph nodes.
Elevated density of the hepatic parenchyma, which could be seen in amiodarone therapy for example.

FINDINGS: The echotexture of the liver appears normal, and no focal lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Some tenderness is present about the gallbladder, more so than in adjacent areas.
Although much of the wall is normal in thickness, there are areas of focal wall thickening, with intramural edema in some areas, particularly along the mid and fundal portions up to a maximum thickness of 6 mm.
There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: High suspicion for cholecystitis.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) MR.  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Compared with the findings of the prior study, there has been no significant change.
Posterior akinesis and lateral and distal septal hypokinesis are present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2153-4-23**], there has been probably no significant change.

Medications: general anesthesia  ASA Class: P2 Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
There were no complications.
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was not attempted.
Biliary Tree: A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the common bile duct.
These findings are compatible with biliary obstruction.
