Mr. [**Known lastname **] past history is remarkable for Stage 3 rectal cancer, status post pelvic exenteration performed in [**2187**] at an outside hospital with a subsequent development of an enterocutaneous fistula in the perineum.
At this institution he has been receiving oral feedings only and no J-tube feeds.
Over the past 24 to 48 hours, the patient complained of increased output from his ileal conduit along with a feeling of fatigue and joint pains which have been worsening over the past week.
He denies fevers but, as stated above, he does have occasional chills in the recent past.
He denies abdominal pain and output from the perineal region.
At the time of presentation, the patient denies nightsweats, chest pain and shortness of breath.
He denies anorexia or polydipsia.

Enterocutaneous fistula, status post enterectomy.
Atrial flutter.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Acute renal failure.
History of Clostridium difficile diarrhea.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The neck is supple and nontender without lymphadenopathy.
The abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended with a well-healed surgical scar.
The colostomy is pink and moist with liquid stool present.
The perineal examination demonstrates mild purulent drainage from a small fistulous opening.
The extremities are warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The urinalysis demonstrated greater than 50 white blood cells, although there were multiple species of bacteria present.
IMAGING:  A chest x-ray done at the time of admission did not demonstrate evidence of pneumonia.
Given his high volume of urostomy output and stool output he was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for volume resuscitation.
Given the purulent material witnessed at the site of the prior fistulous tract, a computerized tomography scan was done to assess for an intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic fluid collection.
Using the prior fistulous tract, a computerized tomographic-guided drainage of this abscess was performed.
Approximately 30 cc of purulent material was aspirated and a drain was left in place.
On hospital day #2, due to positioning and transfer, the patient abscess drain became dislodged.
His blood pressure was stabilized with intravenous fluids and no pressor support.
The patient's culture results from the abscess drainage demonstrated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus and Corynebacterium.
Vancomycin for his chronic Clostridium difficile colitis.
On hospital day #4, the patient was started on Imodium for his increased stool output.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.
