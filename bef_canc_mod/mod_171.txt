She was treated with IV lasix and levoquin for COPD exacerbation (5 day course).
A TTE was done which was notable for EF30-35% w/ mildly dilated LA, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum and apex of the LV.
She was tachycardic with HR 120s and with O2 sats 100% on NRB, and diffuse wheezes on exam.
Per the notes, she was thought to be hypotensive at the OSH as her BPs were being taken in her left arm despite a known history of inaccurately low BP in her left arm compared to her right arm.
Per son, no f/c/sweats.
-COPD - FEV1 - 90%; FVC - 82%; FEV1/FVC - 90% - c/w mild obstructive ventilatory pattern, DLCO mildly reduced -CVA - 4 [**Last Name (un) **] - Sx were blurry vision -LBBB .
She smoked one pack of cigarettes for 60 years and quit at the time of her diagnosis of a lung nodule in [**10-9**].
Her father died at age 86 of diabetes and heart disease.
Oropharynx is without erythema, exudates, or thrush or lesions.
LYMPH:  No anterior cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy.
[**4-8**] HSM at RUSB.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  No C/C/E SKIN:  Warm and dry with no rashes.
Otherwise no acute change.
CXR: Evidence of previous left partial pneumonectomy is seen, with expected fluid collection, and volume loss.
Right lung is grossly clear, with background changes of emphysema and increased pulmonary vascular markings, indicating superimposed pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is identified.
[**2121-2-13**] - Chest CT scan - postoperative appearance of the lung with loculated apical and basilar pleural fluid collections at the left side.
The 15 mm long, irregulary shaped infiltrative abnormality in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe is unchanged.
Severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
Severe atherosclerotic calcification involves theleft anterior descending artery.
There is mild regional systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the inferior wall and inferior septum.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3)are mildly thickened.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2111**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and  echocardiographic data.
[**2121-3-19**] persantine mibi: IMPRESSION: Normal pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion with global hypokinesis and a low calculated LVEF of 37%.
[**3-19**] carotid us: IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicate bilateral 70-79% ICA stenoses .
Parvus tardus of the right main renal and interlobar arteries suggests possible renal artery stenosis and further evaluation with MRA is suggested.
[**3-20**] stress: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with uninterpretable ECG for ischemia.
Nuclear report sent separately   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 77 year-old female with a PMH of Stage 1a Squamous Cell Lung Ca status post-partial left upper lobectomy, COPD presenting to OSH with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Hypoxia - The patient has a recent diagnosis of CHF and underlying COPD.
Given the fluids given at the OSH, her hypoxia was attributed to CHF as with diuresis in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was no longer hypoxic.
On the floor the patient denied shortness of breath and was saturating well on room air.
CAD - The patient's ECHO revealed focal akinesis/hypokinesis which suggests the presence of CAD.
Her enzymes remained stable and she had no telemetry events.
Acute renal failure - The patient's baseline Cr is 0.8 - 1.1, she had elevated creatinine in the hospital and several reasons may have contributed such as overdiuresis, and the dye she received at the OSH for the CTA.
Her urine lytes were consistent with intrinsic reanl causes.
Her renal function improved slightly prior to discharge and after discharge her urine was positive for ENTEROCOCCUS 10,000-100,000, the patient was notified and as she was asymptomatic she said she would notify her doctor at her upcoming visit if this changed.
Anemia - The patient has a new baseline hematocrit in the upper 20's to lower 30's.
Stage 1A Lung Cancer - The patient is not on any current therapy at this point in time , and will need a follow-up CT in 3 months to monitor RLL nodule.
She should continue to have her malignancy followed by her oncologist as an outpatient.
History of CVA - The patient had no issues during her course and was continued on  aggrenox and lipitor.
Possible Renal artery stenosis: The patient's renal us revealed  parvus tardus of the right main renal and interlobar arteries, which suggests possible renal artery stenosis.
Dilated cardiomyopathy, secondary to viral etiology 2.
CAD 3.
Acute renal 4. carotid stenosis secondary: 1.
Stage 1A Squamous Cell Lung cancer 2. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3. cerebral vascular accident 4. left bundle branch block   Discharge Condition: good, off oxygen and tolerating medications   Discharge Instructions: 1.
You were admitted with shortness of breath and were found to have heart failure, you were treated with lasix.
If you have no problems with the medication (ie lightheadedness, dizziness), you should increase the dose to 10mg daily.
Return for fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or worrisome symptoms.
CT scan for a 7 mm intermediate nodule in RLL that will need 3 month follow up from [**3-/2120**] .
