She took this only for one day due to severe itching.
Her RLE/hip pain has been extensively worked up with negative LENIs, Lumbar spine MRI and hip plain films in the past.
On admission to the floor, leg/hip pain somwhat improved with morphine.She denies any headache, vision changes, double vision, chest pain or SOB.
Feels warm but no chills.
Diagnosed [**2134**] (16 years old) when she had swollen fingers, arm rash and arthralgias.
- Malignant hypertension.
History of  hypertensive crisis with seizures.
History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought to be due to the  posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome.
- Thrombocytopenia.
- Thrombotic events.
- History of left eye enucleation [**2139-4-20**] for fungal infection.
- History of vaginal bleeding [**2139**] lasting 2 months s/p DepoProvera injection requiring transfusion.
- History of Coag negative Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-16**] and [**5-17**]   Social History: Single.

On T1- weighted images, there is a focal rounded region within the right femoral head measuring approximately 9 mm in a subchondral location, which is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red marrow.
No sclerosis is seen on the corresponding plain films.
There is a small right hip joint effusion and a small amount of fluid in the left hip joint as well, at the upper limits of normal.
There is no soft tissue abnormality, no muscular edema, and no fluid collections.
Small right hip joint effusion.
No bone marrow edema in the proximal femurs or the pelvis.
Nonspecific small focus of low signal on T1-weighted images in the right femoral head is nonspecific but may represent an unusual focus of red marrow.
TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Findings consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**], pulmonary hypertension has developed (also present on the study from [**2140-5-20**]).
Pericardial effusion is also new.
V/Q scan ([**9-21**]): Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate no focal defects with improved ventilation to the posterior right basal segment.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show improved perfusion to the posterior right basal segement with a persistent small defect but no new findings.
Chest x-ray shows cardiomgealy and left basilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to suggest acute pulmonary embolism.
There is nonocclusive focal thrombus seen in the left subclavian vein, where the vein is not fully compressible.
Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the left subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 24 yo with h/o of Lupus, HTN, and lupus nephropathy started on peitoneal dialysis during this admissionwho was admitted initially for R hip pain.
She then had an episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness and transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
MICU Course: On [**9-20**], the patient triggered for hypotension (82/45), hypothermia (92.9) and altered mental status with difficult arousability in setting of recent blood transfusion.
Patient's home prednisone dose was increased from 5 to 15mg with thought that patient may be stressed in setting of acute illness.
If, in 24-48 hours (once cultures have had 48-72 hours to grow) no source has been located, would d/c antibiotics except for levofloxacin.
Would continue levoflox for total 5 day course for pneumonia possibly ?
aspiration pneumonitis during episode of altered mental status.
If patient has leg pain again, may consider neurogenic source such a piriformis syndrome as suggested by neurology.
Neuro also recommended PT with TENS unit and referral to pain clinic although patient's pain is currently absent.
In addition to her known HOCM, this showed (1) a small pericardial effusion, and (2) pulmonary hypertension with an estimated tricuspid gradient of 50 mm Hg.
We did evaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making chronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.
Her hypotensive episode was thought to be due to a delayed clearing of the morphine due to her renal failure.
On day 2 of her MICU stay, she developed a fever to 102.
There was question of retrocardiac opacity on CXR, though not clear.
Rheum consult obtained given hip discomfort, who felt septic joint unlikely.
Neurology consult obtained who felt autonomic seizure unlikely.
Pt initiated peritoneal dialysis.
Her hip pain has resolved completely without further intervention.
Source unclear at this point, but CXR with question of retrocardiac opacity.
Hip, due to small effusion, could be septic arthritis but no pain with movement on exam makes this less likely.
# Labile blood pressure: h/o of difficult to control BP with episodes of hypertensive emergency in the past.
Having nausea in setting of new PD, no evidence of intracranial bleeding on clinical exam, though INR had been supratherapeutic so remains in differential, though not bradycardic.
# Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.
Pain resolved without intervention.
Continued to monitor and would avoid narcotics, restart slowly if pain resumes.
# Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue.
Did well with PD on [**9-22**] but did report some nause and cramping.
Likely due to chronic hemolysis consistent with SLE>  #.
Prior SVC thrombus: Physical exam with L arm swelling consistent with this.
No flow limitations.
Currently on 15mg in setting of acute illness (day 2).
# General care: FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of hyperkalemia as above, replete other lytes prn, PD initiated, Proph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate as needed for hyperkalemia and lactulose prn as per home regimen.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypertensive urgency Transient Hypotension due to Narcotics Sciatica .
Secondary: End stage renal disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Hip/leg pain resolved.
Ambulating without assistance.
We gave you pain medications and blood pressure lowering medications.
Your blood pressure then dropped which was caused by the pain medication, and you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) where you recovered quickly.
During your stay in the ICU, you developed a fever and were started on antibiotics.
You had an MRI of your hip done, which did not show an acute infection.
You were also given some blood for your anemia.
Your Hip pain may benefit from physical therapy or outpatient anesthetic joint injection.
If you develop fevers, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, worsening of hip pain, headaches, changes in your vision or any other symptoms that concern you please return to the emergency room or call your doctor.
