On presentation to the emergency room, the patient was lethargic with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, dry mucous membranes, and a heart rate between 30 and 40.
Lasix was given for congestive heart failure and then he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer observation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed atrial fibrillation treated with Digoxin and on admission the level was 2.3; history of gastrointestinal bleeding; Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the urine; anemia; hypertension; status post large MCA stroke on [**2154-4-30**] on the right leaving the patient with left-sided neglect and left hemiparesis; and gastric polyps.
The chest revealed coarse breath sounds transmitted diffusely with rales bibasilarly.
There were occasional wheezes noted over the right middle lobe region.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Genitourinary examination revealed Foley catheter draining cloudy amber urine and leaking at the insertion site.
The extremities revealed no edema and no rash.
There was a small shallow ulcer roughly 1 cm across over the left lateral malleolus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of acute renal failure with creatinine going from 0.5 to 3.6 with minimal urine output.
He was also begun on Ciprofloxacin and treated from [**6-14**] to [**6-23**] for urinary tract infection.
He began receiving hemodialysis while in the unit for his acute renal failure and developed a right thigh hematoma from the catheter insertion site for which he received two units of blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
His hospital course was significant for an increase in creatinine to a maximum of 7.3.
The differential diagnoses were thought to be acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis possibly with minimal chain disease.
on [**2154-6-22**] to treat acute interstitial nephritis empirically.
The decision was made to initiate hemodialysis due to worsening electrolyte abnormalities and volume overload.
No retroperitoneal bleed was noted.
After being transferred to the medical floor, the patient remained stable except for a continued drop in his hematocrit such that he received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells over the course of [**6-25**] to [**6-29**].
His blood pressure was felt to be volume sensitive and we are in the processing of titrating his Lopressor down from 100 mg b.i.d.
which was initially used to control his atrial fibrillation to a dose that will be better tolerated by his blood pressure.
His stay over the last two weeks of admission has been mostly uneventful except for an acute mental status change that appeared due to a urinary tract infection with subsequent urosepsis.
Urinalysis sent off showed a high epithelial cell count and cultures of the Foley specimen of urine grew out both yeast and Staphylococcus aureus.
There was no evidence of an endovascular infection.
Repeat urinalysis and urine culture grew out only yeast at 106 colony forming units per milliliter and no Staphylococcus aureus.
During the course of his stay on the medical floor, he has remained afebrile and other than the acute mental status change, he has remained otherwise stable.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute renal failure progressive to chronic renal failure; urinary tract infection, status post urosepsis; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular disease; dementia.
