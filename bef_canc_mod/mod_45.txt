History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 72 y/o woman with PMH notable for paraplegia [**1-5**] anterior spinal artery infarct, indwelling suprapubic catheter with frequent UTIs admitted with altered mental status and hypoxia.
Of note, she is currently on nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for a UTI (?
She apparently also complained of nausea and may have vomited so lactulose was held today.
She was originally on peripheral dopamine for BP improvement but as this was not effective, it was changed to peripheral levophed with subsequent improvement in blood pressures to 120s systolic.
She specifically denies any shortness of breath or any abdominal pain.

Chest x-ray ([**2137-11-6**]) There is bilateral atelectasis.
There is no evidence of focal consolidation that would be indicative of pneumonia.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
There is again evidence of post-surgical changes.
There is no pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Large sacral/coccygeal decubitus ulcer extending up to the inferior sacrum.
Abnormal signal involves both sides of the inferior sacrum, likely from a combination of osteomyelitis.
Te possibility of a superimposed nondisplaced left sacral alar insufficiency fracture cannot be excluded.
2.6- cm rim-enhancing high T2 structure in the left gluteal soft tissues lateral to and apparently communicating with the ulcer tract -- ?
abcess collection vs packing material in recess of ulcer.
Stable appearance of the ulcer tracts extending up to the ischial tuberosities bilaterally with abnormal signal and enhancement about the posterior aspect of the ischial tuberosities, consistent with osteomyelitis.
Old left intertrochanteric fracture only partially imaged on today's study.
Prominent sacral Tarlov's cysts.
Distended large bowel most consistent with ileus.
Unchanged bilateral white matter foci of hyperintensities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images may correspond to chronic microvascular ischemia.
No evidence of acute infarction, masses, or other lesions.
Limited MRA evaluation of the brain due to a significant image degradation from motion artifact demonstrates no identifiable stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm in the visualized vessels.
There is no evidence of focal slowing or epileptiform discharges.
CT-guided drainage of left gluteal abscess ([**2137-11-15**]) 1.
Successful CT-guided aspiration of approximately 1 cc of bloody pus from the left parasacral/left gluteal collection.
Persistent left intertrochanteric fracture.
Chest x-ray PA and lateral ([**2137-11-16**]) There are multiple healed rib fractures from prior thoracotomy on the left, with residual osseous deformity.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: A 72 year-old woman with past medical history notable for paraplegia secondary to spinal artery infarct, COPD, and indwelling suprapubic catheter admitted with mental status change, fever, and leukocytosis.
Septic shock.
She presented with low blood pressure, elevated white count, fever, and mental status change.
Overnight, she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage of sepsis from UTI versus other source, such as large stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.
A blood culture from this first hospital day later grew out methicillin resistent staph aureus.
A urine culture grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] but no significant bacteria.
They agreed that sacral decubitus ulcer was the likely source for bacteremia and recommended MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for sacral osteomyelitis as well as TTE to [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for valvular vegetations.
The echocardiogram, as above, was negative for endocarditis.
Altered mental status.
It was believed at the time that her altered mental status was due to fever and infection.
Per their note, the altered mental status was likely secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the context of infection.
However, they recommended MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for stroke and consideration of lumbar puncture.
MR brain showed no acute abnormalities.
Her oxygen sats have been fine on RA, CXR was negative for infiltrate, and MR as above was negative.
Urinary tract infection / leakage around suprapubic catheter.
She was noted to have leakage around her suprapubic catheter.
[**Female First Name (un) 159**] was called and instructed us to restart her oxybutynin which had been stopped for concern of mental status change.
Sacral decubitus ulcer and ischial ulcers.
She presented with a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer and two stage III ulcers over the ischial tuberosities.
This showed a small fluid collection in the left gluteal soft tissue concerning for abscess.
One cc of bloody pustular fluid was drained that later grew out MRSA.
Chest x-ray showed volume overload but no infiltrate.
With treatment of her infection her oxygen requirements gradually improved.
We treated superficial fungal infections under the breast and in the groin with miconazole powder.
Paraplegia s/p spinal artery infarct.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for yeast.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Sepsis secondary to osteomyelitis .
Secondary Diagnoses Chronic sacral and ischial decubitus ulcers Paraplegia secondary to anterior spinal artery infarct Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Fecal incontinence   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
We believe the source of the infection was the ulcer over your lower back.
Cultures we took of the blood grew out bacteria that likely originated from this ulcer.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have fever, change in mental status, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
