Bilateral linear atelectases.
Extensive postoperative changes as described above.
No evidence of endoleak or contrast extravasation.
Cystic area posterior to the body/tail of the pancreas measuring 11 mm is also unchanged.
No evidence of aortic dissection or intramural hematoma.
Multiple low-density lesions within both kidneys, likely representing cysts, all of which are not well characterized on this examination.
11-mm cystic lesion within the body/tail of the pancreas.
An MRI can be performed for further evaluation of the cystic lesion and can be performed at the same time the renal lesions are characterized.
Left thyroid nodule.
This can be more fully evaluated with a thyroid ultrasound  [**2175-8-2**] Carotid Series No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.
[**2175-8-8**] EKG Sinus rhythm, 68 Left axis deviation Extensive T wave changes may be due to myocardial ischemia which are new from previous - consider ischemia  [**2175-8-1**] MRI 1.
Enhancing 2 cm solid mass within the lower pole of the right kidney with possible pseudocapsule around it.
These findings are concerning for renal cell carcinoma, possibly low-grade.
Two cysts within the body/tail of the pancreas, the larger of which is 1 cm in size without evidence of pancreatic duct dilatation.
Followup of these lesions with MRI is recommended within one year.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 63902**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2175-7-30**] for surgical management of dilated aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm.
A preoperative CT angiogram was performed which incidentally identified an 11-mm cystic lesion within the body/tail of the pancreas.
This revealed two cysts within the body/tail of the pancreas, the larger of which is 1 cm in size without evidence of pancreatic duct dilatation.
An enhancing 2 cm solid mass within the lower pole of the right kidney was identified with a possible pseudocapsule around it.
Follow-Up of these lesions with MRI was recommended within one year.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was negative for any flow limiting disease in his internal carotids.
On 9/805, Mr. [**Known lastname 63902**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent bypass from his right subclavian to his right common carotid artery without complication.
On postoperative day one, he developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone was started.
He required aggressive diuresis and chest PT.
Heparin and coumadin were resumed for anticoagulation for his mechanical heart valve.
He developed some sternal drainage for betadine dressing changes were started and a wound culture was sent which revealed no bacteria.
Mr. [**Known lastname 63902**] developed some dysuria for which levofloxacin was started given his history of recurrent urinary tract infections.
A postoperative CT scan showed normal postoperative changes without an endoleak.
You should shower daily, let water flow over wounds, pat dry with a towel.
