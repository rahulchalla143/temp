Admission Date:  [**2138-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-3-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: bloody bowel movement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD colonscopy  History of Present Illness: 70 F with pmhx of GIB, hypoplastic MDS/aplastic anemia on immunosuppression, angiodysplia in the cecum/prox ascending colon, ?
ileal resection [**3-26**] in [**State 108**] for bleeding ulcers.
Possible angiodysplasia presents with 1 episodes of BRBPR after dinner, with clots with brown stool.
She recently had some nausea no vomitting over past 3 days, with some diarrhea/normal stools.
She recently was long hospitalized in [**State 108**] for GIB, complicated by multiple cscope, EGD, push enteroscopy, pill endoscopy and finally an distal ileal resection for bleeding ulcers, complicated by [**Female First Name (un) **] torulopsis fungemia, treated with fluconazole.
She was discharged but was readmitted in [**State 108**] 3 days later for additional GIB, which resolved without intervention.
Past Medical History: aplastic anemia HTN GERD ulcerative ileitis s/p terminal ileum and proximal ascending colon resection Hypercholesteremia   Social History: Denies tobacco, EtOH, illicits, IVDA.
Family History: Father deceased from MI at age 71.
No h/o malignancies.
Blood flow images show no focal perfusion abnormality.
Dynamic blood pool images and the delayed image show no abnormal radiotracer localization to suggest active gastrointestinal bleeding.
IMPRESSION: No scintigraphic evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**] - Previous side to side ileo-colonic anastomosis of the ascending colon.
No evidence of bleeding and no bleeding source was seen.
There were no angioectasias in the remaining colon and the distal 5 cm of terminal ileum appeared normal.
Internal & external hemorrhoids.
Small bowel enteroscopy [**6-2**] - Mild erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis.
Large hiatal hernia.
Abnormal mucosa in the stomach.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder is distended but maintains a thin wall without evidence for intraluminal stones or sludge.
There is no pericholecystic fluid.
There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Normal liver without evidence for infiltrative process.
No pneumothorax.
Widened superior mediastinum, probably due to distention of vessels accentuated by apical lordotic projection.
CXR (port) [**6-5**] - There continues to be prominence of the right superior mediastinum which likely reflects a small hematoma.
Alternatively, this also could represent prominent vascular structures.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
The lungs are grossly clear and there is no effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the right superior mediastinum may reflect a small hematoma or aberrant vascular structure and is not significantly changed compared to one hour prior.
MRI liver [**6-6**] - results pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 70 with history of GI bleed secondary to angioectasias and ulcerative ileitis, aplastic anemia, and hypertension who presented with bright red blood per rectum.
A GI bleed study was negative for active bleeding.
However, the pt subsequently had no furhter episodes of BRBPR and her Hct remained stable without need for further pRBC transfusions after the second hospital day.
2) MDS/Aplastic Anemia - The pt was continued on 50 mg cyclosporine daily.
Her prednisone dose was increased from 10 mg daily to 60 mg daily to give the pt stress dose steroids in the setting of GI bleed, which was eventually titrated back down to 10 mg daily by the time of discharge.
3) Chronic Renal Insufficiency : With Cr elevated to 1.9 on admission and baseline Cr between 1.2 to 1.5.
Urine lytes were c/w a prerenal etiology, likely in the setting of blood loss due to GI bleed.
She was given blood products as above and IVFs with a decrease in her Cr back to baseline.
4) Elevated transaminases - Had been noted as an outpatient in [**4-26**] and medications, including fluconazole, danazol, and a statin were d/c'd.
Although the pt did have a significant GI bleed on presentation, she was never hypotensive, thus making shock liver an unlikely etiology.
A RUQ US was unremarkable and a liver MRI was obtained to r/o any evidence of fungal infection given her recent h/o candidemia, the results of which were pending at the time of discharge.
The liver service was also consulted and she was ruled out for autoimmune hepatitis as well as acute hepatitis C, CMV, hemochromatosis, and EBV.
By the time of discharge, her transaminitis was resolving and was thought to be secondary to medication effect.
5) UTI - The pt was noted to have a fever up to 102F on hospital day 4 and was pan cultured which revealed a Klebsiella UTI sensitive to cipro.
She was placed on cipro with resolution of fevers and will complete a 7 day course of antibiotics as an outpatient.
6) Vascular Access - The pt has a history of poor vascular access.
Surgery attempted port placement on [**6-5**], which had to be aborted due to technical difficulty.
A CXR performed after the procedure was significant for a question of a possible R sided mediastinal hematoma.
7) Hyponatremia - Na noted to be 120 on hospital day 3 in the setting of being hypovolemic, likely from GI bleed.
The pt never had any mental status changes that were noted.
8) Hypercholesterolemia - Placed on heart healthy diet.
Statin had been held as an outpatient due to elevated liver function tests as above.
9) HTN - Lopressor and HCTZ were held on admission in the setting of GI bleed, and were restarted by the time of discharge.
Slow Magnesium 9.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 5 days: take as needed for pain.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: GI bleed Transaminitis [**2-21**] med effect UTI  Secondary Diagnosis: Aplastic Anemia HTN   Discharge Condition: Good, ambulating, eating well, breathing well on room air.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a GI bleed and had a GI bleed study, colonoscopy, and small bowel enteroscopy that did not find a source of bleed.
Your GI bleed has since resolved and your blood counts have been stable for 1 week.
