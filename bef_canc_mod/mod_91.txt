Admission Date:  [**2175-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Doxycycline / Tetracycline / Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2175-2-15**] Right heart catheterization   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year-old Chinese ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] dialect, related to Cantonese, history) speaking female who presents for acute onset of shortness of breath and palpitations.
She has a complicated PMH: is s/p L pneumonectomy for TB in [**2160**] that was c/b post-pericardiotomy syndrome; has newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, with chronic hypoxia on home 3L O2 and CPAP; and a history of breast cancer s/p R mastectomy and chemo in [**2170**]-[**2171**].
She says that she woke up this morning at 0500-0600 and felt a sharp pain over her heart, shortness of breath, sweatiness, HA and blurry vision.
The pain radiated down her arm and into her shoulder and "liver region".
She says this was similar to her symptoms last week when admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], but the intensity of this episode was far greater, especially with regard to her heart rate and SOB.
She denies cough, fevers, but + chills.
[**Name (NI) **] night sweats but + diaphoresis.
Has had 3-4 days of nausea and diarrhea, with 3-4 bowel movements/day (essentially since discharge).
She does not feeling generally short of breath for a few months, with decreased appetite over the last 1 month and a 2-lb weight loss.
A CXR was done and showed minimal change from [**2-6**].
EKG with sinus tachycardia, no significant changes.
Labs without elevation in WBC, normal lactate, cardiac enzymes normal in ED x 1. .
Currently she reports feeling at her baseline with no SOB or chest discomfort.
Past Medical History: - TB S/p extrapleural left pneumectomy with mediastinal repositioning and serrated mediastinal flap [**2160**] c/b myopericarditis treated with ibuprofen, c/b pericardial effusion and tamponade - Pulmonary hypertension - OSA/nocturnal hypoventilation - Right-sided stage I breast cancer ER/PR neg, HER-2/neu negative, diagnosed in [**5-7**] --- s/p lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy in [**6-6**] and s/p 4 cycles adriamycin and cytoxan on [**2171-10-9**] --- s/p completion mastectomy was done on [**2172-3-12**] as radiation would have compromised pulmonary function further ---s/p weeks of taxol c/b neuropathy   Social History: The patient lives at home with her husband and son.
Family History: Her mother's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of mid-40s.
Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple, no JVD CHEST: No chest wall tenderness.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Transmitted BS in left lung but right lung clear with no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, mild TTP in epigastric area, otherwise nontender, non-distended, no rebound or guarding.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Trace aortic regurgitation is now seen.
Intravenous saline contrast injection does not suggest right-to-left shunt.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension, with PA systolic pressure of 70mmHg on room air, with normal to mildly elevated mean PCWP of 13 mmHg.
With 100% inhaled oxygen, the PA systolic pressure decreased to 62mmHg from 70mmHg, and mean PA pressure decreased from 45mmHg to 38mmHg, with a decrease in PVR from 730 dynes-s/cm5 to 645 dynes-s/cm5.
Inhaled nitric oxide caused no significant change in pulmonary pressures or PVR above 100% oxygen.
Left post-pneumonectomy chest with typical changes.
On the right, massive apical post-infectious, potentially post-tuberculous changes are seen with a retraction of the hilar and apical lung parenchymal structures.In the remaining lung, extensive fibrotic scars are seen.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities in the right lung.
The pre-existing minimal pleural effusion has completely resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 43 yo F with a history of TB s/p L pneumonectomy c/b post-pericardiotomy syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, OSA, and R stage I breast cancer s/p R mastectomy in [**2171**] presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, and hypoxia.
# SOB/Chest pain: Patient with long history of hypoxemia and is on home O2 and CPAP, although her compliance with the CPAP is questionable.
It was felt that most likely she had some event at home (O2 not on) that led to her presentation.
She has a history of pulmonary HTN, with echo during last admission demonstrating significantly worsening pressures and RV dilation.
She had a CXR in the ED without PNA although with pleural effusion that has been relatively stable; however she had no cough or clear fevers at home so this was not thought to be a contributing factor.
She had no desaturation events overnight.
This demonstrated severe hypercapnea with a pCO2 of 106.
Patient was placed on BiPAP in the ICU and pCO2 levels only mildly improved.
She was encouraged to wear her supplemental oxygen at all times and to use BiPAP whenever sleeping or feeling tired.
The etiology of patient's significant hypercarbia and hypoxia was unclear.
Her recent CT chest also showed some evidence of pulmonary edema/effusions.
Patient reports her symptoms are largely unchanged over the last few months, however, she is requiring frequent hospital admissions.
An echo was performed that showed no evidence of shunt.
Ultimately the decision was made to undergo right heart catheterization to evaluate pulmonary pressures.
The catheterization showed decreased pressures with increased oxygen delivery.
Patient had an episode of increased somnolence and hypercarbia (pCO2 132) after starting the sildenafil.
He ativan dose was decreased, she was placed on BiPAP and her pCO2 returned to her baseline of 115 and her symptoms resolved.
She was encouraged to wear her supplemental oxygen at all times and to use BiPAP whenever sleeping or feeling tired.
# Sinus Tachycardia/Palpitations: This was felt to be most likely from hypoxia.
Initially dehydration from recent diarrhea was also considered.
Per medical records the patient's tachycardia is chronic and asymptomatic.
She was symptomatic with lightheadedness, hypotension (SBP 80s), and neck palpitations.
The arrhythmia resolved abruptly with vagal maneuver.
The decision was made not to start a low dose beta blocker as patient has problems in the past with orthostasis and this may exacerbate those symptoms.
# DISCHARGE: [**Hospital1 **] PULMONARY REHAB # CODE: FULL  Medications on Admission: - Levothyroxine 25 mcg PO DAILY - Ranitidine HCl 150 mg PO BID - Alendronate 70 mg PO once a week: every saturday.

Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB/wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**3-7**] hours as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary edema Sinus tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Patient has persistent sinus tachycardia (her baseline) and stable blood pressures.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after presenting to the emergency department for shortness of breath and chest pain.
Because of your high oxygen requirements and your need for BiPAP you were transferred to the ICU where you were closely monitored.
The following changes were made to your home medications: 1) START Sildenafil 20 mg by mouth three times a day to help your oxygen levels 2) START Lorazepam 0.25 mg by mouth at night to help with anxiety while on BiPAP machine  It is very important the you use your supplemental oxygen at ALL TIMES and that you use your BiPAP EVERY NIGHT.
