Admission Date: [**2168-12-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2169-1-3**]   Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old Russian- speaking male with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), type 2 diabetes, and chronic renal failure who presents with two days of extreme shortness of breath at rest and dull 7/10 chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder.
Positive paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, two-pillow orthopnea, and positive peripheral edema.
The patient has not had any change in his medications or diet.
In the Emergency Department, found to have evidence of congestive heart failure and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.2 (baseline of 2) and ST depressions in V2 to V4 on electrocardiogram.
He was given Plavix, nitroglycerin, and morphine and is now pain free.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery    bypass graft in [**2157**]; status post cardiac catheterization    in [**2168-3-22**] at an outside hospital (no stents    placed).
Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy; baseline creatinine of    2.
Chronic renal failure.
Peripheral vascular disease with right leg    revascularization.
Back pain secondary to spinal stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure elevated to the angle of the jaw.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
The lungs with crackles two thirds of the way up with diffuse wheezing.
Mild distention, tympanitic to percussion.
Lower extremities with 2 plus lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Creatine kinase elevated at 1030, MB was 15, and troponin was 0.85.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema.
An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, normal intervals, T wave inversions in V2 through V4, and ST depressions in V2 through V4.
IMPRESSION:  This is an 80-year-old male with coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2157**]) here with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and acute congestive heart failure with hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen.
Currently chest pain free.
The patient continued to    be a good candidate cardiac catheterization; however,    limited by poor renal function.
(b)  Pump:  The patient demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30 percent with multiple wall motion abnormalities.
Current presentation thought to be due to decompensated heart failure.
Medications were titrated to optimize congestive heart failure.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Thought to be likely due to    congestive heart failure.
MENTAL STATUS ISSUES: The patient demonstrated multiple    onsets of agitation and confusion thought to be secondary    to a communication barrier.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was    placed on a cardiac and diabetic diet.
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with acute exacerbation.
Hypoxia secondary to pulmonary edema from congestive heart    failure.
Acute hyperglycemia.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Peripheral vascular disease.
