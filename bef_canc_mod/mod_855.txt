ECHOS  [**9-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**9-30**]: Repeated echo (unchanged, except for only MILD mitral regurgitation)  RADIOLOGY  [**9-21**] CT ABDOMEN: Interval development of worsened pulmonary opacities, most pronounced in the right base.
Interval development of a large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen with decrease in the previously seen free fluid.
This may reflect underlying sepsis, CHF or low albumin state, particularly given the associated anasarca and edematous changes in the bowel as noted above.
Approximately 400 cc of clear yellow fluid were recovered & sent for culture.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Few tubular gas-filled structures within the left liver lobe.
It is unclear whether these represent air within the portal venous or biliary system.
There is no air within the mesenteric vessels, or loops of intra-abdominal large or small bowel.
Slight interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for worsening aspiration.
Slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Subcutaneous edema persists.
After CVL placed, negative echo & abdominal CT showing new ascites, she was admitted to the SICU for resuscitation and reversal of her supratherapeutic INR.
[**9-22**]: Diagnostic paracentesis showed serous inflammatory ascitic fluid, and the patient was taken for ex lap & abdominal washout.
A diffuse inflammatory process awas encountered, but no frank infectious collections were seen.
She remained in SICU postop, and was weaned off pressors & ventilatory support.
NEURO: Her pain was controlled with small doses of morphine & her agitation was controlled with ativan & seroquel.
CV: Echocardiograms showed good cardiac function, with mild mitral regurgitation.
FEN/GI: Abdominal pain gradually improved after surgery.
Initial fluid avidity resolved after surgery & she was diuresed down to her baseline weight of 55kg.
Hypernatremia treated with free water boluses.
Patient had an GI bleed from a hemorrhoid which caused us to stop anticoagulation for L subclavian DVT.
Anticoagulation was stopped due to GI bleed.
h/o MRSA infection.
C diff negative.Prior to D/C patient was kept on Gent/Zosyn for Pseudomonas in urine and blood.
Patient has a R port-a-cath  DISPO: being discharged to vent rehab.
