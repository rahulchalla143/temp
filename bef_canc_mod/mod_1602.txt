History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old man with severe psoraitic arthritis, Crohn's disease (on prednisone) and recent bilateral DVT (on coumadin) presents with atraumatic right femoral neck fracture.
He was exercising Sunday, 6 days prior to admission and felt a [**Doctor Last Name **] in his left hip and noticed a burning pain and required a crutch to help him walk afterwards.
Pain increased throughout the week and eventually left him bedbound.
One day prior to admission, he stepped out of bed and felt severe pain in his right anterior hip area and fell to the ground.
He continued to have full range of motion of his ankle and did not have any numbness or tingling.
In the ED, he was afebrile with stable vitals, labs revealed INR of 4.5.
CT head was normal, CT pelvis/hip/femur were notable for diffuse osteopenia and acute femoral neck fracture.
Of note, patient has had multiple admissions in the past several months.
He was admitted from [**2162-4-23**] - [**2162-5-7**] for diarrhea likely from Crohn's flare and was started on 40 mg prednisone at that time.
His platelets fell during that admission, which was thought to be due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia from SQH, so he was switched to fondaparinux, which resulted in rectal bleeding, likely complication of Crohn's.
His PF4 Ab came back positive during that admission, so he was continued on fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
He was discharged to rehab, where he developed large volume rectal bleeding and was readmitted on [**2162-5-11**] requiring transfusion.
He was admitted again on [**2162-7-20**] - [**2162-8-2**] for bilateral leg swelling and redness and found to have bilateral posterior tibial DVTs.
Labs were notable for a pancytopenia, though it is unclear if that was due to heparin.
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

[**2162-8-31**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:  IMPRESSION:  Large amount of free intraperitoneal air with stranding adjacent to the sigmoid colon in the right lower quadrant, suggesting sigmoid colon perforation.
Questionable area of decreased blood flow with normal blood volume, and mildly increased mean transit time in the left frontal lobe, which are nonspecific and may represent an artifact.
No acute territorial infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
There are low lung volumes.
Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe could be due to increasing atelectasis but aspiration could also be present.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
An x-ray of the pelvis showed a transcervical right femoral neck fracture.
The patient had supratherapeutic INR on admission from anticoagulation for DVT which was diagnosed on [**2162-7-21**], so arthroplasy was delayed one day while the patient was reversed with IV vitamin K 5 mg x 2.
Post-operative pain was controlled with oxycodone and home oxycontin.
PF4 antibodies were positive, but serotonin release assy was negative.
Over the course of the next 3 days, the patient began to notice a dull progressing to sharp and extreme pain in his right lower quadrant.
During the operative course, there was a 50cc blood loss and a 2 liter fluid requirement.
Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, the patient complained of incisional pain but was otherwise well.
He was able to move all extremities with good peripheral pulses and no evidence of shock/sepsis.
His pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA and he remained NPO with intravenous hydration.
There were no acute events overnight, and on [**9-1**] he was deemed stable for transfer to the surgical floor for additional recovery.
The Neurology service was consulted and a cat scan of the head was ordered which showed no evidence of acute ischemia or vessel occlusion.
[**Last Name (un) **] this imaging, he had continuous EEG monitoring to look for evidence of seizure activity after an apparent significant effect of lorazepam to his mental status.
In 24 hours, he returned to his baseline mental status.
He was however found on the morning after the episode to have a necrotic, ischemic colostomy and went to the operating room on [**2162-9-3**] for reopening of recent laparotomy, resection and revision of colostomy and mesh repair of incisional hernia  A vac dressing was placed on the wound.
The GI service was consulted regarding tapering of his prednisone dose.
On POD #6 from the ostomy revision, the patient was noted to have frank blood from the ostomy.
Appointments for follow-up were made with the acute care service, orthopedics, and his GI provider.
