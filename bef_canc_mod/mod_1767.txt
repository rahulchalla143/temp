The patient has had a prior history of a questionable lesion on her SVC ([**11-1**] ECHO).

Right femoral vein thrombosis: Chronic with no acute issues.
Hypokalemia ??????
Patient required aggressive IV potassium repletion for hypokalemia.
Metabolic acidosis: On admission had combination of elevated lactate and ARF though also non-gap component as well (possibly from ostomy output though does not report increase in this; now partly from IVF).
