There are small R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-12-7**] ST-T wave changes are no longer present and inferior R waves are smaller.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Status post recent ileostomy takedown with right lateral abdominal wound and underlying subcutaneous fluid collection, which could be a postoperative seroma, given timeframe.
Small fat-containing incisional hernia.
No extraluminal oral contrast identified; however, there is increased extraluminal gas compared to next preceding study suggesting an anteriorly located bowel wall leak given the intraluminal air-fluid level seen at the anastomosis and continuation of extraluminal gas with small bowel loop.
Surrounding inflammatory changes evident though no focal fluid collection identified.
Stable small right pleural effusion with compression atelectasis.
No other new cardiopulmonary vascular abnormalities are identified.
On POD 1 she was transferred to the ICU with Acute Kidney injury.
She had an ECHO performed that showed EF >55% but severe pulmonary HTN.
On POD 2 and 3 she continued to have marginal but improved UOP and was given boluses intermittently and 1 unit of pRBCs for hct 22.3.
On POD 4 her wound developed some erythema and a few staples were removed and swab was done and small amount of fluid expressed.
This swab was sent for micro and eventually grew Proteus and Enterococci.
Through POD 4 into 5 she had an acute increase in oxygen requirement that responded well to nebulizer treatment but in this setting her wound was noted to have more induration and most of the remaining staples were removed.
The fascia was intact on exam but more murky fluid was expressed and the wound was packed.
She had a CT scan done on POD 5 that showed no evidence of contrast extravasation at the anastamosis however there was extraluminal air near the anastamosis  that could represent a leak.
TID dry dressing changes continued to her surgical wound site and IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone continued for a total 7 day course to be completed [**2159-3-10**].
She went to rehab with ostomy appliance over fistula site for skin protection and dry antimicrobial packing in midline surgical incision.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her pain was well controlled.
