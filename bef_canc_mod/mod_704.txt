The patient presented with several days of worsening mental status.
Over the past few months, the patient has had multiple admissions related to ovarian cancer and complications, thereof.
Over the ensuing days, the patient had increased lethargy and decreased responsiveness.

She became hypotensive despite hydration.
[**2131-12-29**], the patient was found to have perforation of her anastomosis with peritonitis and intraabdominal abscess.

GENERAL:  The patient was a fairly well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
NECK: Slightly dry mucous membranes.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy and no elevation of her central venous pressure.
