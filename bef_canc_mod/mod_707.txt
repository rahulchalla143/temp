Admission Date:[**2162-10-29**]           DISCHARGE DATE [**2162-11-16**]   Date of Birth:   [**2101-10-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MED ICU  HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for nonHodgkin lymphoma of the stomach diagnosed in [**2156**], status post resection chemotherapy and XRT.
She initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**10-8**] of this year with the chief complaint of two to three weeks of cough with yellow-sputum production.
She also complained of progressive dyspnea, sore throat, and headache.
At the time of admission to [**Hospital3 417**] she was hypoxic and afebrile with a white cell count of 17,000 including 52% bands and extensive bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Hospital course at [**Hospital3 417**] was completed by infection with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Pseudomonas in the sputum and the development of a 6-cm area septation and cavitation in the left upper lobe.
She also had some liver-function test abnormalities and some question of cardiac function.
She reportedly ruled out for a MI at [**Hospital3 418**].
NonHodgkin gastric lymphoma (large and cleaved follicular-cell type).
Status post trans-abdominal resection of stomach and distal esophagus in [**2136**], status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy.
Echocardiogram in [**2156**] reportedly showed left ventricular hypertrophy with right ventricular hypertrophy and mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There were several crusted erythematous lesions near the right angle of the mouth.
HEART:  The heart was regular without evidence of murmur.
LUNGS:  Auscultation of the lungs revealed rhonchorous transmitted upper airway sounds, anteriorly, with expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds and no palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities showed no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
SKIN:  Examination of the skin was notable for the crusted-erythematous lesions at the angle of the right mouth.
There was a positive Legionella urinary antigen test.
Bronchoscopy washing from [**10-11**], showed Aspergillus fumigatus.
Fungal culture of the right lower lung tissue showed no growth to date at the time of admission to [**Hospital3 **].
Chest CT, without contrast, perform on [**10-28**], showed a 6-cm area of cavitation in the anterior left upper lung likely secondary to fungal infection with septations and air, but no fluid levels.
There was also bilateral air-space disease with some sparing of the left lung base in the right upper and middle lobes.
There was small-to-moderate effusion on the left side, without evidence of pneumothorax.
There was some subcutaneous emphysema on the right chest wall.
Lower extremity Dopplers were performed on [**10-9**] and showed no evidence of DVT.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound performed on [**10-9**] showed no acute pathology.
The indication for mechanical ventilation was hypoxic respiratory failure.
This was mainly due to thick, copious secretions from her left upper lobe cavitary lesion.
Review of the pathology slides from her wedge resection at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital showed no evidence of BOOP.
She remained on Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan for several days after admission cultures at that point ruled Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
A day later the antibiotic regimen was changed to Trinamm and Bactrim because of a possible drug reaction to Zosyn.
The patient became acutely tachycardiac and depressed with a drug-like rash on her torso.
Skin scrapings of the erythematous lesion around her mouth, sone at the time of admission were positive for HSV-1.
She required less and less of a need for mechanical ventilation.
At the same time she began tolerating trials with a Passy-Muir valve, which she now remains on for most of the day.
Neuromuscular:   The patient was profoundly weak at the time of admission and remains profoundly weak at the time of discharge, most likely due to critical-care myopathy with the possible contribution of steroid-induced myopathy.
Endocrine:  The patient had some trouble with glycemic control at the time of admission, most likely secondary to supplemental corticosteroid doses.
The corticosteroids were also thought to be the cause of her metabolic alkalosis at the time of admission.
The metabolic alkalosis has gradually resolved as the corticosteroids had been tapered off.
There was no evidence of active bleeding.
She does have a history of pernicious anemia for which she received vitamin 12 shots (100 mcg every month).
Left upper lobe pneumonia secondary to Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Critical care myopathy + or - steroid-induced myopathy.
