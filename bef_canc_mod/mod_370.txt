Admission Date:  [**2150-10-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2150-11-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-3-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old male resident of nursing home with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on supplemental oxygen at four liters nasal cannula, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, status post left below the knee amputation and right above the knee amputation, who presents with worsening shortness of breath times nine hours.
The patient is a very poor historian but denies any fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or urgency.
He denied any new cough and no sputum production.
His shortness of breath symptomatically improved with the oxygen.
Chest angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Interstitial lung disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen at four liters.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block.
Anal cell cancer, status post resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Diabetes mellitus times twenty years.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, he is a middle age man in moderate respiratory distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Neck - There is no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs revealed distant breath sounds bilaterally, no crackles, no wheezes or rales.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
There is no hepatomegaly.
Extremities - right above the knee amputation and a left below the knee amputation with no edema and moves all four extremities spontaneously.
Urinalysis showed moderate blood, no nitrites, trace protein, negative glucose, negative ketone, 3 red blood cells, 20 white blood cells, few bacteria and no yeast.
CT angiogram of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, diffuse increased interstitial markings with patchy areas of ground glass opacifications most pronounced at the bases.
The patient has a baseline chronic lung disease likely consistent with an emphysematous pattern as well as possible fibrotic changes at the lung bases.
Most likely diagnosis is congestive heart failure.
The patient had a blood culture from [**2150-11-1**], that showed enterococcus as well as coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus that was Methicillin resistant.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral coarse interstitial pattern, mild progression since [**3-26**], no consolidation or effusion, stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
No evidence of a deep vein thrombosis although the popliteal vein on the left was not visualized.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 57 year old male with a history of severe lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease, diabetes mellitus, who presents with hypoxic respiratory distress and initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was felt to be in hypoxic respiratory distress secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Pulmonary embolus was ruled out in the Emergency Department with a chest CT angiogram.
He was also initially started on Levaquin for coverage of a possible pneumonia associated with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as his chest x-ray showed increased interstitial infiltrate.
On hospital day two, however, the patient became tachycardic, tachypneic and hypotensive with decreasing oxygen saturation.
This was thought to be due to sepsis as his blood cultures came back four out of four bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin.
The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement and while he was on the Medicine floor, his oxygen requirement was titrated to keep his oxygen saturation around the high 80s to low 90s.
Cardiovascular - The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous inferior myocardial infarction.
He initially denied any chest pain on admission and electrocardiogram was similar to his prior electrocardiogram in [**2150-3-26**].
However, on hospital day, he became hypotensive, tachycardic and tachypneic with decreasing oxygen saturation.
His hypotension was thought to be secondary to sepsis and he was gradually weaned off Levophed and transferred to the Medicine floor when his blood pressure was stable off pressors for more than 48 hours.
On the Medicine floor, he did have one episode of transient hypotension to systolic of 60s to 70s that responded to intravenous fluid boluses of 500 ccs.
Infectious disease - The patient was initially started on Levofloxacin for coverage of pneumonia and received five days of the antibiotic.
However, on hospital day two, the patient became tachypneic, tachycardic and hypotensive with decreased oxygen saturation.
This was presumed to be secondary to sepsis and he was pancultured and started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin in addition to the Levaquin for more broad spectrum coverage.
Blood cultures, four out of four bottles, cultured from his port-a-cath and peripherally, grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus.
Endocrine - The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
Code Status - The patient's condition was explained to him in great detail and he did not wish to be intubated if he had further respiratory distress.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Anal cell cancer.
