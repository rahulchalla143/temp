No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Chronic occlusion of the left subclavian artery and vein with numerous vascular collaterals demonstrated within the anterior chest wall.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence of an acute ischemic event.
The pt's chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of recurrent pneumonias.
Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.
Pt had another CTA in the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC.
Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.
Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol.
AVOID benzos as pt has paradoxical response.
Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around 28.
Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal TIBC, ferritin.
Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his SVC stented.
