HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old woman status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2130-12-5**] for primary sclerosing cholangitis who has been undergoing chemotherapy for a Stage 3 [**Year (4 digits) 499**] cancer.
The patient developed a fever on the day of admission up to 101.0 degrees.
The patient denies any nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath or diarrhea.
Ulcerative colitis.
Cardiac examination was normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and her surgical incision from the liver transplant was clean, dry and intact.
The CTA at the time showed multiple lesions within the liver, scattered between both the left and right lobes.
There were also new lesions located in Segment 3 and biliary air both within the liver and the common bile duct.
Due to the patient's fevers and known Enterococcus the patient had an infectious disease consult.
Infectious Disease recommended doing an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the liver lesion for culture of questionable malignancy.
Over the next couple of days, the patient became afebrile with good response to the change from Levofloxacin to Zosyn.
On hospital day #3, the patient was transferred from the floor to the Intensive Care Unit due to labile hypotension.
The aspiration of the ultrasound-guided drainage of the hepatic abscess yielded a small amount of clear yellow fluid.
This was sent off to Microbiology where it revealed Enterococcus Faecium which was resistant to Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, Penicillin and Vancomycin.
The patient was once again pancultured, but there was no growth in either the aerobic or anaerobic bottle from that date.
The patient continued her two week course of Zosyn which was then discontinued and then as the patient remained afebrile and with white count declining the patient was discharged to home on Synercid.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in good condition:  Afebrile, pain well-controlled on oral medications, tolerating a regular diet without difficulty.
