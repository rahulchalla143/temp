He describes the pain as [**8-16**] sharp, located on his LUQ, non-radiating, and constant.
He went to the bathroom and had a small loose bowel movement.
He states that the pain was different then the prior pain that he felt with his pancreatitis.
He also states that he felt sweaty with chills, nausa, and non-bilious vomiting.
He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody stool.
Past Medical History: HIV/AIDS w/ hx of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11395**], and opthalmic zoster Depression Self inflicted stab wound Two prior hospitalizations for pancreatitis  Social History: The patient is divorced but living with his children and a fiance.
He no longer is consuming alcohol at this time, but on occasion he does have a glass of wine.
It is not certain whether she also had  lung cancer or whether it was metastatic from breast.
His father  died from lung cancer, had a history of peptic ulcer disease and  hiatal hernia.
Physical Exam: Vitals - 95.7  88  132/80  22  100% RA Gen: lying in bed, groaning, appears in great pain HEENT: asymmetric left pupil, right reactive, dry mmm, no JVD CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmur/rubs/gallops RESP: rhonchi in lower lobes b/l Abd: rigid, tender to palpation on LUQ and LLQ, + BS Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: A&O x3 Skin: no rash  Pertinent Results: LACTATE-3.1* AMYLASE-508* LIPASE-1401*  RUQ US - No evidence of gallstones or cholecystitis.
Edematous pancreas.
CXR - 1) No free air under the diaphragm.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
2) Curvilinear calcific density at the right hilar region that may represent mural calcification of the ascending aorta.
This raises the question of syphylitic or collagen vascular disease of the aorta.
MRCP - slight irregularity in dilated side [**Last Name (un) **] of pancreatic duct.
EGD - erythema erosion of antrum c/w gastritis .
Pancreatitis in patient with evidence of prior pancreatitis.
A small fluid collection is seen between the stomach and the pancreas.
Hemangioma in liver.
Atelectasis of the left lung base.
[**4-19**]: CT ABd/Pel 1) Interval worsening of disease with new intra-abdominal ascites, small bilateral pleural effusions, and increased size of focal peripancreatic fluid collections within the lesser sac.
There is again seen hypoenhancement within the distal body/tail of the pancreas consistent with focal pancreatic necrosis.
A limited ultrasound was performed demonstrating a pocket of fluid in the left lower quadrant and a spot was marked overlying the skin suitable for paracentesis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedural complications.
Samples were sent to the laboratory for analysis and cytology.
[**4-23**]: CT Abd:  IMPRESSION: Necrosis of the pancreatic tail, with surrounding small fluid collection, but overall less inflammatory changes since [**2188-4-19**].
No vascular complications identified.
[**4-26**]: CT HEAD: There is evidence of fluid collections in the right frontal and left parietal/occipital scalp.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or mass effect.
There is no major vascular territorial infarct.
There are no osseous lesions.
There is near complete opacification of the frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus, maxillary sinuses, and ethmoid air cells.
Necrosis of the pancreatic tail, with slightly reduced surrounding inflammatory changes, but no definite organized fluid collection.
Persistent moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, and a right perihilar density as well.
[**4-30**]: CTA Chest: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pulmonary embolus.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 47 yo male w/ PMHx sig for HIV/AIDS off anti-retroviral therapy, pancreatitis, depression who was in his USOH last PM when he awoke this AM from sleep with acute onset abdominal pain.
He describes the pain as [**8-16**] sharp, located on his LUQ, non-radiating, and constant.
He went to the bathroom and had a small loose bowel movement.
He states that the pain was different then the prior pain that he felt with his pancreatitis.
He also states that he felt sweaty with chilla, nausa, and non-bilious vomiting.
He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody stool.
In addition, his CT scan on [**4-19**] showed necroting pancreatits.
Therefore he was transferred to the ICU and intubated for tachypnea and respiratory failure due to increasing metabolic acidosis.
[**Hospital **] hospital COurse: The patient was admitted to the MICU for increasing pain from pancreatitis and CT scan which showed increased nectoric areas as compared to the one 1 week prior.
His mental status declined and he became rigid and hyperthermic.
He was intubated for decreased mental status and respirtory alkalosis [**1-9**] to rigid rib cage and decreased inspiratory effort.
His rigidiy resolved once he was intubated and he had no further problems with increased tone.
For antibiotics, he was initially started on Imipenem but was changed to Zosyn due to leukopenia.
He continued to have leukopenia so it was switched to levofloxacin.
He underwent a thorcentesis which showed an exudative sympathetic effusion high in amylase.
He was having slowed and altered mental status while he was in the ICU requiring multiple antipsychotics.
The etiology of his pancreatitis still remaines unclear.
He needs to seek medical attention if he develops fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or any other concerning symptoms.
