Admission Date:  [**2190-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-11-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / Aspirin / Nsaids / E-Mycin / Ciprofloxacin / Levofloxacin / Phenylephrine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Syncope   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: craniotomy  History of Present Illness: This is an 89 year old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal episode.
Per notes he received 2.5 hours of his dialysis session but during the last 15 minutes he was noted to slump in his chair and to lose consciousness for 2-3 minutes.
There was no overt seizure activity noted.
No tongue biting or loss of bowel or bladder function.
No head trauma.
As per recent discharge summary his baseline is "confused" and has been deteriorating rapidly over the past several months with episodes of delerium and generalized failure to thrive.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, normal intervals, no acute ST segment changes, no change from prior dated [**2190-10-3**].
He had a head CT which shows a large new left sided fluid collection with mass effect.
Exam in the emergency room was notable for inability to follow commands and withdrawal to painful stimuli.
Past Medical History: -ESRD on HD -AV graft thrombosis and stenosis -Dementia -Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive -Asthma -pulmonary hypertension secondary to VSD -Anxiety/Depression -Chronic Bronchitis/COPD -Traumatic Type II Dens fracture with chronic left jaw, eye, ear, and neck pain -Hypertension -Hypercholesterolemia -Incontinence of stool -Benign prostatic hypertrophy -12-mm left superior parietal meningioma -Macular degeneration and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy -Pancytopenia, possible MDS -Left Renal calculi s/p lithotripsy .
In [**2168**] he retired as a professor of political science.
No alcohol history.
Physical Exam: 99.8 BP: 139/50 P: 87 R: 17 O2: 94% on RA General: Alert, unable to respond to questions of orientation, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, poor dentition Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, loud HSM at apex radiating to axilla Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, well healed surgical scars in left abdomen GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, left upper extremity fistula with palpable thrill Neurologic: PERRL, EOMI, blinks to threat bilaterally, smiles symmetrically, will not stick out tongue, increased tone in upper and lower extremities throughout, withdraws upper extremities to pain, screams in pain to painful stimuli in lower extremities and withdraws slightly, reflexes 2+ and symmetric in biceps, triceps, brachioradialis and patellar, toes downgoing, gait not tested.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Cannot exclude a prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Cannot exclude a prior inferior myocardial infarction.
[**11-13**] CT head IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring 2.6 cm, new with mass effect.
Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty with some hemorrhagic elements.
This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly containing CSF secondary to hypotension.
[**11-14**] EEG  Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very frequent and occasionally rhythmic and persistent sharp waves with following slowing, primarily in the left posterior temporal region or left hemisphere but occasionally with a generalized distribution, and due to the slow and disorganized background.
The focal sharp waves indicate an area of cortical hypersynchrony in the left hemisphere, likely more posteriorly.
They suggest a focal lesion in that area.
The repetitive discharges suggest brief electrographic seizures, but there was no definite clinical effect.
Stable large predominantly chronic subdural fluid collection overlying the left frontoparietal convexity reaching that vertex; the overall appearance is suggestive of a chronic process, either "liquefied" subdural hematoma or true hygroma, with fibrovascular strand formation.
While the significant degree of mass effect on the subjacent brain is unchanged, there is further subfalcine herniation, with 12 mm rightward shift of the normally-midline structures; this measured 8 mm on the admission study.
No new cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
Persistent left subdural fluid collection with mass effect, with mild decrease in size and attenuation when compared to prior study.
[**11-16**] CXR Slight improvement of the left lower lobe atelectasis with stable small left pleural effusion, otherwise unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yoM with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.  Had focal seizures activity on EEG and per Neuro started on Dilantin.
Pt was taken to OR for evacuation of fluid collection with Neurosurgery.
On day after procedure, pt noted to be unresponsive, tachypneic and very stridourous.
Bronched, but no obvious abnormality seen.
