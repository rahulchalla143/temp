Today, he was unable to climb any steps as he felt lousy intially.
Then he developed severe [**10-25**] pounding chest pain which was associated with SOB and sweating.
He did not have any dizziness or syncope with that.
He called EMS and enroute, he was found to have AFib w/ RVR and was given bolus of Amio IVB without any effect.
He also had some ST depressions in the inferolateral leads in the setting of tachycardia and so he was started on heparin.
Cath from [**2169-4-7**] -- Three vessel coronary artery disease with patent LIMA to LAD and occluded SVG to Ramus and jump segment to R PDA.
-- Severe aortic stenosis.
-- Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction -- severe AS w/ peak gradient of 55 mmHg, valve area of 0.65m3 -- EF of 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities Hemodynamics: -- moderately elevated R & L sided filling pressure with RVEDP of 15mmHg and LVEDP of 18mmHg -- moderate PAH with a PASP of 50mmHg -- CI depressed at 2 L/min/m2   Past Medical History: - CAD s/p CABG x 3 in [**2158**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, and SVG to RCA) - S/P stenting [**2164**] of mid RCA, PTCA of proximal RCA and PDA - DM - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Left leg cellulitis - OA - Renal cell carcinoma (unchanged in 4 months) - Depression - Asbestos Lung - Spinal stenosis   Social History: Lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 2312**] Denies EtOH use Quit smoking in [**2104**] .
Family History: Father - MI in his 60's Mother - died of unknown cancer   Physical Exam: VS: 95.2, 100, 107/74, 21, 100%/NRB Gen: appears comfortable, mild conversational dyspnea HEENT: PERLA, EOMI, Dry MM Neck: distended neck veins, JVD ~ [**7-23**] cms Heart: tachycardia, regular rhythm, distant heart sounds, could not appreciate any murmur Lungs: mild expiratory wheezing, crackles at bases bilaterally Abd: distended, tympanic, bowel sounds normoactive, soft/NT Ext: 1+ edema bilaterally, changes from venous statis on right, resolving cellulitic changes on left  Pulses: Right: Carotid 1+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 1+ Femoral 1+ Popliteal 1+ DP 1+ PT 1+   Pertinent Results: [**2169-4-14**] CArotid Duplex Ultrasound 1.
Occluded left internal carotid artery.
No significant right ICA or CCA stenosis (right ICA stenosis is graded as less than 40%).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and infero-lateral hypokinesis (?multi-vessel CAD?).
There is at least moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-2-24**], there are new regional wall motion abnormalities c/w multi-vessel CAD.
The degree of aortic stenosis (moderate to severe) is probably similar (currently lower gradient probably secondary to decreased cardiac output).
[**2169-4-17**] Vein Mapping There is a patent right greater saphenous vein, however, there is reflux throughout and varicosities below the knee.
There are patent bilateral lesser saphenous veins of small diameter and the left greater saphenous vein is only visualized at the saphenofemoral junction and not seen throughout the rest of the leg.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-4-14**] for further evaluation of his aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
He was evaluated by the cardiac surgical service given that a recent cardiac catheterization revealed occluded vein grafts from his prior CABG in [**2158**].
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed an occluded left internal carotid artery and mild plaque in the right internal carotid artery.
Haldol was used for periods of postoperative delirium.
Foley was reinserted for urinary retention on POD #7.
culture sent for diarrhea amd was negative twice.
