CT chest showed possible basilar interstitial fibrosis with evidence of pulmonary HTN, and moderate pulmonary HTN estimated on TTE.
As part of his evaluation, patient underwent a bronchoscopy and VATS on [**2152-10-23**] with lung biopsy, pathology revealing moderate-to-severe interstitial fibrosis with honeycomb change and organizing pneumonia.
He has also finished a 5-day course of levofloxacin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
Chest film showed possible volume overload, and patient was given furosemide 40 mg IV x 1, with good UOP.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C c/b cirrhosis, HCC, s/p liver transplant [**2146-8-10**]  - most recent liver biopsy [**2151-10-7**] with stage II fibrosis and grade 2 inflammation.
- started on PEG-IFN and ribavirin [**2152-1-22**] Hypertension DM Anxiety Depression Back Pain, Hip Pain, s/p R hip replacement   Social History: Disabled from work, unemployed, does not smoke.
He is married   Family History: Positive for cancer, nonspecific in his mother, father and sister and diabetes in a grandmother.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 109/49  HR 90  RR 35  100% on BiPAP, FiO2 100% General: Alert, oriented, moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: diffuse crackles bilaterally Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly.
Paradoxical abdominal movements with respiration.

He was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but his lung biopsy was concerning for UIP with superimposed BOOP vs. acute UIP exacerbation.
Pt also with known baseline pulmonary hypertension and volume overload.
He was initiated on vancomycin and cefepime given clinical and radiographical deterioration.
On [**10-30**], patient desatted into the 50s on full vent support, FiO2 of 100% PEEP of 10, and had EKG findings consistent with acute ischemic changes.
This acute decompensation was believed to be due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with subsequent R-to-L shunt through PFO, complicated by acute right heart strain with ischemia.
