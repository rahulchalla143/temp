Admission Date:  [**2113-4-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line placement (Attempted EGD, patient unable to tolerate w/ low oxygenation)   History of Present Illness: 73 year old male with history of renal transplant, CAD, PVD, DM presenting with marked fatigue, poor appetite, nonproductive cough and generalized weakness/failure to thrive.
He was found to have profound anemia with HCT of 18.7 (baseline high 20s-30s), acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.5 (baseline [**1-29**]), new cerebellar lesion on CT head, and RLL pneumonia.
While in the ICU, he was treated with cefepime, vancomycin and azithromycin for pneumonia in an immunosuppressed patient.
He developed acute shortness of breath after admission and evaluation revealed pulmonary edema (though imaging suggestive of noncardiogenic etiology), and was diuresed.
He was transfused 3 units of blood, had negative stool guaiacs, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency, and had negative hemolysis labs (haptglobin 677).
Hematocrit at transfer 24.5, and CT torso did not reveal intra-abdominal source of blood loss.
Renal transplant service followed the patient and his acute renal failure was thought to be due to dehydration/pre-renal azotemia with ATN.
Troponin was elevated at 0.16-0.18, thought to be due to renal failure and anemia.
His neuro exam was nonfocal and the lesion was thought to be a chronic infarct vs. metastases as opposed to an acute lesion.
Currently, the patient continues to complain of weakness/fatigue and generalized feeling "unwell."
He complains of back pain, leg pain, neck pain and a headache--all are chronic per him.
HTN 3. hypercholesterolemia 4.
CAD s/p MI ([**2104**]) 5. severe osteoarthritis of the hips/shoulders/knees 6. spinal stenosis 7.
PVD s/p R SFA-tib/peroneal trunk NRSVG (99), jump graft from R tib/peroneal trunk to distal R PT NR cephalic VG ([**4-/2105**]), PTA of R SFA-PT bypass ([**10-2**]), angioplasty L CIA ([**11/2104**]), L CFA-PT [**Name (NI) **] with in-situ SVG ([**1-29**]), b/l TMA, b/l sesamoidectomies 9. lung adenoca s/p VATS/wedge resection of nodule 10.
Family History: Significant for lung cancer in the patient's father who developed this at age 75, but subsequently died of a stroke.
Physical Exam: gen-sitting up in chair, uncomfortable/fatigued HEENT-EOMI, MM dry, R IJ in place-c/d/i, JVP could not be assessed, neck thick chest-[**Month (only) **] BS at bases, R>L, RLL crackles, otherwise clear.
heart-RRR, no M/R/G, nl S1 S2 abd-obese, soft, nontender over graft, + BS ext-marked LE edema of both legs--4+ pitting to knees, L>R.
venous ultrasound [**5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left leg.
TTE [**4-27**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Diastolic function could not be assessed because of significan mitral valve disease.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild non-rheumatic mitral stenosis.
Lungs show interlobular septal thickening and bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities, which given lack of interstitial abnormality on CT from [**2113-2-27**], is most suggestive of non cardiogenic pulmonary edema given normal heart size and lack of pleural effusion.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Stable appearance of transplanted kidney within the left lower quadrant.
No stone, hydronephrosis, or perinephric fluid collection.
Generalized atrophy of the muscles, especially involving bilateral iliopsoas, which may account for patient's lower extremity weakness.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and branch vessels.
# Failure to thrive / poor PO intake Poor PO intake / nausea / vomiting initially had a very long differential, including med toxicity (sirolimus), uremia, depression, diabetic gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease, colonic mass, obstruction, and chronic mesenteric ischemia.
EGD, small bowel follow through, and gastric empyting study were all attempted, but could not be performed given poor room air saturation (for EGD) and back pain / not tolerating procedure (when laying flat for SBFT and GE study).
Reglan 5 mg QID was started emperically; after 3 days his diet improved, and all nausea / vomiting ceased spontaenously.
# Anemia secondary to chronic renal disease Admission hct was 18.7.
On the medical floor his HCT remained stable, however he was transfused another unit of PRBCs to help with his generalized weakness.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/bacterial pnemonia He was admitted with respiratory distress, secondary to acute on chronic diastolic CHF.
He was diuresed aggressively with 120 mg IV daily lasix, and then was backed down after re-initiation of renal failure.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure, autolgous renal transplant Renal transplant was consulted.
He was thought to have ATN [**1-28**] to anemia and hypotension.
His rapamycin level was also found to be elevated, secondary to med toxicity with azithromycin.
# Weakness / Muscle Aches The differential for his weakness was quite extensive: anemia, depression, renal failure, polymyalgia rheumatica, motor nerve dysfunction.
On arrival, head CT showed a cerebellar hypodensity.
Neurology was consulted, who thought this was consistent with prior chronic CVA changes and did not represent an acute CVA.
Given his gait difficulty and muscle atrophy on CT, spinal cord impingement was considered.
This can be performed as an outpatient or a PET scan can be done to rule out metastasis.
Because of weakness, muscle atrophy, diffuse aches, and moderately elevated CK, his home statin was stopped.
His weakness improved as his diet and mood improved.
The statin can probably be restarted as an outpatient, given his severe PAD and presumed CAD.
Given lack of symptomatic changes with respect to peripheral neuropathy, we kept holding off on this medication.
# PAD Vascular surgery determined right AKA the best management option.
Dressings were changed and decompression of the sacral wounds was utilized.
# DM type 2 uncontrolled with complications Transitioned to lantus and blood sugars ranged 100-200.
