Vascular Surgery was requested to see the patient on [**2108-2-8**] for abnormal peripheral vascular resistance studies which demonstrated significant superficial femoral artery tibial occlusive disease.
He is status post left first metatarsophalangeal joint resection with minimal bleeding.
The patient's ulcer is a chronic ulceration and he underwent resection and debridement.
It is noted postoperatively that the foot and ulcer area was quite dusky and we were consulted because of the skin vascular changes and the abnormal peripheral vascular resistant studies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, status post renal transplant in [**2105-9-27**].
Coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty with stent in [**2105-10-28**].
Known peripheral vascular disease, right superficial femoral artery to tibial peroneal trunk, nonreverse saphenous vein graft in [**2105-2-25**], femoral peroneal to distal tibia with nonreverse cephalic in [**2105-4-27**] with a transmetatarsal ampicillin at that time.
Recommendation to consider arteriogram and cardiology consult for perioperative risk assessment, given the patient had diabetes, end stage renal disease and is status post renal transplant.
The patient was seen by Cardiology who felt that if he is at high risk, he likely would need a cardiac catheterization and if low risk we would probably be able to proceed with surgery.
There were no anginal symptoms and normal hemodynamic response to pharmacological stress with an uninterpretable electrocardiogram.
Nuclear report demonstrated a fixed inferior wall defect, unchanged since prior study.
The patient then underwent arteriogram on [**2108-2-10**] which demonstrated patent common iliac with a distal stenosis 56% just proximal to the bifurcation.
The patient had patent hypogastric arteries.
There was mild disease of the popliteal artery.
There was occluded trifurcation with extensive collateralization around the knee.
No cardiac intervention or diagnostic study was indicated with the results of the Persantine MIBI.
The [**Last Name (un) **] Service followed the patient for his diabetic management.
He underwent on [**2108-2-15**] a left common femoral to the posterior tibial bypass with in situ saphenous vein, angioscoping and valve lysis.
Postoperative day #1, he was continued on Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin, secondary to his allergy to Penicillin.
There were no overnight events.
He had a palpable graft pulse and incisions were clean, dry and intact with a biphasic posterior tibial.
The patient was on bedrest with the leg elevated and nonweightbearing on the left leg.
The patient had bedside sharp excisional debridement on [**2-17**] of the wound edges done in the metatarsophalangeal joint resection on [**2-7**].
The patient underwent several other sharp excisional debridements at the bedside of the wound ulcer to clean the wound edges.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient stable, graft patent, leg wounds clean, dry and intact.
Foot wound as described.
4 hours prn for pain 10.
Neuropathic ischemic left foot ulceration, status post first metatarsophalangeal joint resection with multiple bedside debridement, skin edge eschar with delayed primary closure.
Superficial femoral artery tibial disease status post left common femoral to posterior tibial bypass with insitu greater saphenous vein with angioscoping and valve lysis on [**2108-2-15**].
Type 1 diabetes mellitus insulin dependent with episodes of hyperglycemia, controlled.
Hypertension controlled.
End stage renal disease, status post renal transplant of [**2105-2-25**], immune suppressed, stable.
Pseudomonal Staphylococcus coagulase positive wound and bone infection, intravenous antibiotics.
