The pressure is associated with bilateral elbow/arm muscular pain.
He tells me that these symptoms started about three months ago, off/on and getting progressively worse.
Also denies any abd pain.
ROS also negative for fever/chills, +frequent cough with "upper respiratory problems".
GERD symptoms are more burning in nature compared to these symptoms.
EKG NSR at 69, nl axis, nl intervals, S1Q3T3 pattern, no other ST-T changes.
He is now admitted for a cardiac catheterization and further management of his cardiac disease.

EKG [**6-10**]: NSR at 69, nl axis, nl intervals, S1Q3T3 pattern, no other ST-T changes.
CXR [**6-10**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated severe three (3) vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main demonstrated no angiographic evidence of any flow limiting lesions.
The left circumflex was diffusely diseased including an 80% lesion at the origin of the vessel.
The right coronary artery demonstrated a hazy 80-90% lesion in the proximal portion of the vessel along with mild diffuse disease throughout the remainder of the vessel.
There was no significant pressure gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.an elevated left heart filling pressure (LVEDP 24 mm Hg) along with a normal central aortic pressure (124/70 mm Hg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Patient is status post sternotomy and CABG with no significant change in the appearance of the mediastinum.
Lung volumes remain low and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Right upper lung field linear atelectasis is unchanged.
Layering left pleural effusion and atelectasis persists.
No evidence of overt failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 16745**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-6-10**] for further management of his chest pain.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel disease.
On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname 16745**] developed atrial fibrillation which converted back to normal sinus rhythm with intravenouos beta blocker and repletion of his electrolytes.
