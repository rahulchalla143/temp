In ED was packed by ENT with bilateral packings which required continuous O2 monitoring and stay in the MICU, she was monitored and IR guided emolization was considered, but pt declined the required general anesthesia for an elective procedure with risk of stroke as well from emolization.

She did have occasional episodes of minimal epistaxis which was managed with courses of afrin and supportive measures and her hematocrit remained stable after 3 total units of blood transfusions.
She did have some pressure headaches from the packing which was stable on percocet and dilaudid as needed.
2)s/p MVR: for severe mitral regurgitation 6 yrs ago-- stable for now-- initially coumadin held and reversed with vitamin K and 2units of FFP and eventually she was restarted on coumadin with goal INR around 2.5-3.0 as her risk of bleeding is significant.
3)Anemia: acute on chronic with blood loss anemia on top of anemia of chronic disease with baseline hematocrit around 30.
