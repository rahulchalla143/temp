Irrigation and drainage of the colocutaneous fistula.
History of Present Illness: 55M with recent diagnosis of gastric cancer who underwent a total gastrectomy with J-tube placement on [**2169-4-5**].
His post-operative course was complicated by a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (which was coiled) and an infected perisplenic hematoma which failed non-operative management (IR drained twice on [**4-16**] and [**4-30**]) and ultimately required open drainage in the OR on [**2169-5-8**].
He was discharged to rehab on [**2169-5-12**] with a wound vac over his left abdominal wound.
He returns from rehab today as he was noted to have stool output through his wound vac.
A fistulogram was obtained to further assess but did not show evidence of communication with the fistula.

Extensive decrease in size of previously visualized bilobed perisplenic hematoma with a drain which appears in place.
Previously visualized hematoma in the left lateral abdominal wall appears decreased in size and this area appears open to air.
4.Persistent small left pleural effusion with adjacent air space  atelectasis.
New collection of extraluminal gas and/or stool in association with marked edema involving a segment of hepatic flexure of colon, with pericolic stranding.
Findings are worrisome for a necrotic portion of bowel or a perforation of bowel.
Small bowel distention with transition to smaller caliber bowel within the right lower quadrant.
Findings may represent early small-bowel obstruction versus ileus.
Slight increase in size of the perisplenic air and fluid collection along the track since the interval removal of the surgically placed catheter.

ST-T wave abnormalities are new.

The patient continue to be febrile, with high fistula output.
CT abdomen on [**5-22**] revealed decrease in size of previously visualized bilobed perisplenic hematoma.
On [**5-30**] patient reported increased abdominal pain and CT scan was obtained.
CT demonstrated new collection of extraluminal gas and/or stool in association with marked edema involving a segment of hepatic flexure of colon, with pericolic stranding, which were worrisome for a necrotic portion of bowel or a perforation of bowel.
On [**5-31**] patient went in OR, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, complex lysis of adhesions, exploration of the right colon with drainage of mesenteric micro perforation, irrigation and drainage of the colocutaneous fistula and diverting loop ileostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Post operatively patient was transferred in ICU, intubated secondary for hypotension and persistent tachycardia.
[**6-1**]: worsening tachycardia (ST to 150-160) and hypotension, fever spike (102), given 1L fluid bolus, neo gtt restarted, repeat Hct sent (27->24), given 1 unit PRBCs; neo gtt able to be weaned [**6-2**]: Persistent tachycardia (120s) Received 500ml albumin & 1u pRBC w/o change in heart rate.
Went for B/L LE ultrasounds that were neg for DVT but noticed complex loculated fluid collections within the lower abdomen, surgery notified but do not want further workup at this time as this may be post-surgical changes.
[**6-4**]: off pressors, + flatus, stool in ostomy, hemodynamically stable [**6-5**]: SQH restarted, stool sent for c diff, TEE ordered to evaluate for vegetation per ID, and was negative for valvular vegetations.
[**6-7**]: Afebrile, fiber added to the tube feed secondary to persistent diarrhea.
[**6-8**]: Stable, screened for Rehab [**6-15**]: Discharged in Rehab By system: Neuro: The patient received PO oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
This was managed with IV Lopressor, and was thought to be related to his underlying infectious process.
The patient's hypotension was treated with pRBC, albumin and fluid boluses.
Pulmonary: He was found to have a stable left-sided pleural effusion on CT scan with no evidence of loculation or pneumonia.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially placed NPO due to his noted stool output from his left flank wound, which previously was suspicious for a fistula but was found not to be so on fistulogram during his previous hospitalization.
A colocutaneous fistula in this area was present on initial CT when he re-presented on [**2169-5-15**].
He was fitted with an ostomy appliance, and provided TPN given his decreased oral intake.
The ostomy nurses were follow the patient for both fistula appliance change and new ileostomy teaching/change.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
His wound culture, however, was noted to grow Klebsiella and E coli which were resistant to Zosyn, which was discontinued;he was previously discharged on daptomycin and Zosyn for known VRE in his abdominal collections, and this was modified to include these antibiotics as well as Flagyl per ID recommendations.
ID was re consulted and secondary to low fistula output and good clinical picture, patient was discharged on Flagyl, Cipro and Micafungin.
Hematology: The patient received total 3 units of pRBC during this admission for low HCT level and hypotension.
At the time of discharge, the patient was stable, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating some intake of a regular diet with Tube feeds supplementation, ambulating with some assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled with oral agents.
Medications on Admission: Medications at rehabiliation: metoprolol 2.5Q6, zosyn, daptomycin, doxazosin 8', trazodone 25', tylenol, percocet, zofran   Discharge Medications: 1. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

*Replace fluid loss from ostomy daily.
*If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, dislocation.
