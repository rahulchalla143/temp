global hypokinesis.
EKG with sinus rhythm no ST or TW changes.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
His father had an MI at later age.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
2/6 systolic ejection murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Poor air movement.
No HSM or tenderness.
+ abdominal hernia.
Ext: [**12-1**]+ ankle edema bilaterally.

Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
TTE ([**1-29**]): Severe LVH with moderate LV dilatation.
Moderate to severe global LV hypokinesis with inferior akinesis.
Bioprosthetic AVR with very high gradients (mean 49).
Unable to assess if vegetation or thrombus on aortic valve.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation (UNDERestimated due to shadowing).
Diastolic dysfunction with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-1-9**], overall LV systolic function has decreased significantly.
The gradient across the aortic prosthesis is slighlty higher.
No hydronephrosis of the renal transplant.
Unremarkable renal transplant Doppler examination with only slightly elevated resistive indices but unremarkable waveforms.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior wall hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8 cm2) by planimetry.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate to severe prosthetic aortic valve stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Elevated BNP, history and exam consistent with CHF.
Likely precipitated by AS and HTN, and TTE showed worsened systolic function (which improved after diuresis) and increased aortic valve gradient.
He also had a slightly elevated troponin likely in the setting of demand given normal CK-MB.
He was diuresed with lasix IV in 100mg boluses with improvement in symptoms and was weaned off oxygen.
2) Hypertensive emergency: No evidence of renal artery stenosis on doppler study.
Hydralazine was used for intermittent hypertensive episodes.
He was restarted on clonidine 0.1mg PO BID, nifedepine 60mg CR was switched from qam to qhs, metoprolol and valsartan continued, and lisinopril stopped secondary to cough.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure s/p renal transplant: Baseline creatinine 3.0.
Nephrology was consulted and felt this was due to his chronic nephropathy and volume shifts.
Opthamology saw pt and noted a blurred optic disc.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
