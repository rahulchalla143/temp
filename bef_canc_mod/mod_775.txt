No right pleural effusion is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity likely representing areas of atelectasis and/or consolidation.
No pneumothorax.
#) Ischemia - No issues during this hospitalization.
#) Pump function - no evidence of CHF.
Will require close outpatient monitoring of her potassium.
Beta-blocker should be maintained at low-dose given poor pump function.
#) Dementia - Patient was restarted on aricept as bradycardia less of a concern after pacemaker insertion.
