On [**2173-10-7**], the patient experienced asymptomatic hypotension (88/60).
Labs obtained at tha time revealed a HCT of 18.7 following 1 unit of blood earlier in day as well as worsening acute renal failure.
he was placed on boots and TEDS for DVT prophylaxis.
The surgical dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent drainage.
While in the hospital, his post-operative course was complicated by abnormal liver function tests.
Hepatology was consulted, and recommended an ultrasound with dopplers and a CT scan to rule out biliary obstruction- both were negative.
The patient then went to ERCP given the pattern of his LFTs for a definitive diagnosis.
ERCP showed stenosis at previous sphincterotomy site and so extenstion of sphincterotomy was done.
The procedure was complicated by bleeding, likely secondary to thrombocytopenia.
Patient also developed RLE cellulities; US w/ dopplers were negative for DVT.
Common bile duct stenosis s/p ERCP with extension of sphincterotomy   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a right knee replacement.
