She developed [**9-7**] pain radiating throughout her chest that was not relieved with anti-acids.
She developed N/V and dyspnea.
She went to [**Hospital **] hospital and was noted to have ST segment depressions in V2-V6 and I,II, aVL along with STE in AvR/V1 which resolved with Nitrate therapy.
Her chest pain lasted for several hours.
She received IV heparin, 300 mg of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 and remained chest pain free until this morning where her symptoms recurred with similar EKG changes to initial presentation.
Due to her diffuse EKG changes and recurrent chest pain, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was chest pain free and denies any complaints.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular function with mild hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral walls consistent with conronary artery disease.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCX had a 99% lesion in its mid segment.
The RCA had a 40% lesion in its mid segment with a possible ulceration.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation in the LVEDP consistent with mild diastolic dysfunction.
There was mild systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 141/73.
On pullback across the aortic valve there was a minimal gradient of 4 mmHg.
Mild elevation in LVEDP consistent with mild diastolic dysfunction.
Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo F h/o HTN, + smoker, who presents from OSH with NSTEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization and stenting of LCx.
She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease involving LCx (90% ->stented, with 0% residual), and RCA (40% with possible ulceration).
We continue medical management with aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, clopidogrel and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.
She was hemodynamically stable and chest pain free through out her admission.
To evaluate for cardiac risk factors, we checked a lipid panel, which was uremarkable, and an HbA1c, which was pending at the time of discharge.
She will also need a carotid ultrasound as an outpatient to evalute for carotid atherosclerosis.
She appeared euvolemic, with no edema and good urine output, throughout her hospitalization.
# HTN: Her antihypertensives had been held at the OSH and she was hypertensive during her admision to [**Hospital1 18**].
- Please schedule a carotid artery doppler study to evaluate for carotid artery stenosis.
Please followup and intitiate treatment for hyperglycemia if appropriate.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 3. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: [**11-29**] Tablet, Sublinguals Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction.
You will need to get an ultrasound scan of your carotid arteries as an outpatient to check for any potential blockages in the blood flow to your brain.
