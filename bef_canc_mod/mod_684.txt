Borderline low precordial voltage in the precordial leads.
Following revision of the intraventricular shunt, there has been a decrease in the ventricular size as measured both across the frontal horns at the level of the caudate heads and at the level of the third ventricle.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI Brain [**3-6**] - Increased hydrocephalus since the previous study 18 hours previously.
There are no new infarctions.
Otherwise, unchanged appearance of numerous susceptibility artifacts throughout the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem consistent with micro-hemorrhages or cavernomas  CT Head [**3-9**] - Small focus of intraventricular blood in the right lateral ventricle unchanged since [**3-6**].

He was lethargic and nauseas with worsening ataxia and he underwent a revision of the distal portion of the VP shunt.
He later developed some increasing abdominal distention but his he had flatus and his belly was soft.
However, he had an episode of emesis that evening and then again overnight requiring NG tube placement by general surgery.
On [**2-28**], he had a loose BM in am and was advanced to sips- vomited x2, was switched back to NPO, and had an unremarkable UA for symptoms of urinary urgency.
On [**3-1**] he had a repeat KUB which continued to show dilated small bowel and was transferred to the general surgery service for management of his ileus.
On [**3-2**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] had episodes of respiratory distress with an increased oxygen requirement.
CT abdomen showed dilated small bowel with decompression in terminal ileum.
He was taken to the OR on [**3-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for abdominal exploration for obstruction vs. infection.
CT showed significant increase in ventricular size.
Only 5 cc could safely be withdrawn from the shunt and he only minimally improved.
His post-op CT showed significant decrease in ventricular size and his drain was raised to 10cm H2O.
Overnight, patient developed a limited R lateral gaze and was seen to be staring.
EEG was ordered and to rule out seizure activity.
An MRI w/o contrast was ordered to rule out stroke and stroke neurology was consulted.
EEG showed complex partial seizures and epilepsy team was consulted for appropriate management.
On [**3-8**], patient's exam remained stable, he was placed on Dilantin for his complex partial seizures and his level was 11.1.
A repeat head CT showed improvement of hydrocephalus and CSF was sent for vancomycin trough.
Patient had lateral and upward gaze limitation, but was following complex commands.
He passed a speech and swallow and could have a regular diet.
He tolerated die without nausea or vomiting.
ID consult recommended a repeat CSF culture to completely ensure that he has no evidence of meningitis.
CSF as of [**3-14**] showed no evidence of growth.
He had a fever of 101.6F in the afternoon and a fever work up was initiated.
On [**3-16**], CT head showed slightly larger ventricles and small amount of IVH in L lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
EEG was also re-ordered to re-evaluate for seizure activity.
LENS showed RUE blood clots in axillary and basilic veins.
Although, 1 hours later he was much better given his neurological change in exam a head CT was obtained which demonstrated resolved IVH and small ventricles.
New Left frontal catheter tract ICH without significant mass effect.
Patient also spiked fever to 102.5.
Over the weekend, patient was found to have positive c.diff culture and fevers were thought to be from a combination of IV vancomycin and c.diff.
Cardiology recommendations were to start him on metoprolol 12.5 PO BID for tachycardia.
LENS were negative for new DVT and showed some resolution of the axillary and basilic clots in the RUE.
