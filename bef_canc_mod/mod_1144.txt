History of Present Illness: This is a 25 yo female who has a complicated course post ERCP pancreatitis who now is admitted for pulmonary embolism.
This was complicated by post-ERCP pancreatitis for which she was aggressively hydrated and developed respiratory failure.
A mediastinal mass was discovered and she had a biospy done.
She developed a pneumonthorax from the procedure.
She also underwent an exploratory laparotomy and developed abdominal abscesses as a result.
She was at rehab in [**Hospital1 **] on a course of Zosyn and JP drains to treat her abdominal abscess.
She came to [**Hospital1 18**] to replace her PICC line, but at IR, she was discovered to have bilateral upper extremity DVTs and left lobar artery pulmonary embolism.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2140-10-16**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.

Bilateral venograms demonstrating occlusion at the level of the subclavian/axillary junction, with multiple collaterals.
Pulmonary emboli involving the branch point of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery branching into segmental arteries, extending into subsegmental branches.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Presacral fluid collection is mildly enlarged.
Presacral collection also slightly smaller, and is likely interconnected to pockets containing catheters.
Brief Hospital Course: 25 yo female with post ERCP pancreatitis complicated by abdominal abscess admitted for bilateral upper extremity DVTs and PE.
# DVT and PE - likely secondary to immobilization or multiple PICC's.
She stayed on lovenox during her hospital course because it would be easier to stop if she were to have any procedures regarding her abdominal abscess and JP drains.
She had constant low grade fevers throughout her hospital course likely from the abdominal abscess.
Cultures from all 3 JP drains grew out stenotrophamonas sensitive to Bactrim.
Interventional radiology got a sample from her abscess by aspiration and that culture also grew stenotrophomonas.
# C-DIFF -  patient was Cdiff positive presumably from her anitbiotics course.
# NAUSEA AND VOMIT - she had intermitted nausea and vomit of unclear etiology.
There was no abdominal pain or change in diarrhea.
Possible explanation include irritation from the abdominal abscess or antibiotics.
# EDEMA - she had dramatic edema from fluids that was given to her from her last hospital course for pancreatitis.
However, she continues to have edema in her upper thighs and abdominal.
# BED SORE ULCERS PPX - she has a superficial ulcer on her right heel from immobilization.
# FEN - she was on a regular diet and per nutrition recommendations, she had juice-based supplements.
