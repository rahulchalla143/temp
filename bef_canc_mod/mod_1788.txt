MODERATE GROWTH.
Upon admission he was complaining of right shoulder and rib pain.
Review of the imaging showed right sided rib fractures [**11-27**] (3, [**4-27**] segmental fractures, right clavicle and scapular fracture, and T2-7 transverse process fracture.
He was also reported to have a small right pneumothorax.
On HD #4, he was intubated for increased work of breathing, progressive hypoxia, and copious secretions.
He was also noted to have an irregular heart rate which was controlled with metoprolol.
His pulmonary status worsened and on chest x-ray was found to have a right lung collapse requiring placement of a chest tube with re-expansion of the lung.
With his hemodynamic instability, cardiology was consulted for a mild elevation in the troponins and an echocardiogram was done on HD # 4.
He was reported to have periods of agitation and the weaning process was delayed.
On HD #8, he developed stridor and difficulty ventilating.
His rib pain has been controlled with oral analgesics.
He has resumed his home medications except for his metoprolol.
He has been tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.
