Patient also noted to have hyponatremia and RLE cellulitis.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with O2 sats in the low 80s off of oxygen.
Mr. [**Known lastname 65646**] has a history of severe COPD requiring intubations in the past and this is likely playing a role in patient's presentation.
Other etiologies (or contributing diagnoses) include: CHF (elevated BNP, negative cardiac biomarkers, CXR showing pulmonary congestion and Kerley B lines ??????
concern for medication non-compliance or dietary indiscretion vs. valvular deficit vs. ACS/MI vs. hypertension as inciting etiologies), PNA (no obvious infiltrate but WBC is left-shifted).
His lab chemistries showed elevated bicarbonate to 42, suggestive of metabolic compensation for worsening respiratory acidosis, but he clinically appeared to be improving.
His exam and laboratory findings suggested hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely combination of his cirrhosis, heart failure and ?SIADH given his pulmonary process.
Low sodium thought to be contributing to altered mental status, so it was corrected with diuresis and fluid restriction.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/DELIRIUM: Patient and HCP complain of some altered mental status over the past few days.
Likely due to combination of hypoxia/hypercarbia, low sodium, encephalopathy or medication effect.
He was initially treated with BiPAP for his respiratory distress, but it was discontinued after discussion with the patient and his HCP.
He was started on lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy and had adequate BM.
His delirium was attributed to holding his night time dose of risperdal (3mg) on admission and reversal of his sleep-wake cycle.
Thrombocytopenia thought to be due to medication vs. cirrhosis, however patient without chronic thrombocytopenia as expected from a cirrhotic.
It was thought to be unlikely due to HIT as the degree of thrombocytopenia and timing of thrombocytopenia did not fit.
As he did not show evidence of bleeding, he was not given platelet transfusion.
Patient has also had leukopenia to ~[**2-8**] during previous admissions as well.
Possibly due to post-viral illness leukopenia, which could have triggered his COPD exacerbation as well.
# LOWER EXTREMITY ERYTHEMA: Cellulitic changes on RLE with scabbing at the center, concerning for early cellulitis.
As patient has past MRSA infection, he was covered for MRSA cellulitis with Vancomycin and the erythema improved.
He remained with some mild erythema on the right leg, but this appeared to reflect chronic venous stasis as opposed to any active cellulitis.
# CIRRHOSIS: Patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis and history of portal hypertension and varices.
# PROSTATE CANCER:  Continue Lupron as per outpatient providers  # PYRUVATE KINASE DEFICIENCY WITH RESULTING MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA:  Continued on folate.
