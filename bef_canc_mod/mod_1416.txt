Admission Date:  [**2127-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11304**] Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with a history of high grade invasive transitional call carcinoma of the bladder s/p laproscopic cystectomy and neobladder formation [**2-24**] and multiple complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia presenting to the ED for evaluation of fast heart rate.
The last inpatient stay was from [**2127-6-10**] through [**2127-6-18**] during which time he had sepsis from obstructive pyelonephritis and had a right sided nephrostomy tube placed.
He grew Klebsiella from the urine and bloodstream and was discharged to complete a course of ciprofloxacin.
On [**2127-6-16**] his left percutaneous nephrostomy (placed for obstructive nephropathy) was internalized to a JJ ureteral stent after balloon dilation of a left utretero-iliac anastamotic stricture.
He also reported change in his taste which has always preceded an infectious complication, and constipation.
He was given a total of 6 liters of IVF and had no other BP readings <100.
Evaluation for source of abdominal discomfort included a CT abdomen with contrast.
Diverticulitis vs. focal colitis.
Past Medical History: 1. h/o MI - 17 yrs ago, treated at [**Hospital **] Hospital, per patient treated with a "clot busting medication" (possibly tPA), hospitalized x 6 days and discharged.
Has recurrences of AF/RVR during last hospitalization.
3.High-grade invasive transitional cell carcinoma 4.Osteoarthritis of ankles 5.C.
Gastritis/duodenitis 8.Left Percutaneous nephrostomy tube for presumed obstructive uropathy.
9.Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube, emergent, for obstructed pyelonephritis.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There is left lower lobe opacity that may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of overload, effusion or pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Extensive left lower quadrant stranding adjacent to loop of sigmoid colon and descending colon and also the ileal neobladder with several punctate foci of extraluminal air.
Given the lack of hematuria and significant urine WBC's this most likely represents a bowel process, likely acute diverticulitis vs focal colitis.
Recommend repeat CT examination with rectal contrast to evaluate for wall thickening and perforation.
Stable appearance of perinephric stranding with moderate right and mild left hydronephrosis.
Double J bilateral ureteral stents in place.
Stable appearance of left pelvic fluid collection likely representing a lymphocele.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, stable since dedicated chest CT examination from [**2126**].
The acute findings involving the stranding and free air were posted in a wet read and discussed with the urology resident at time of study, and were rediscussed with recommendations for repeat CT with rectal contrast at 10:00 p.m. on [**2127-6-30**].
there is, however, irregular wall thickening along a segment of the sigmoid, which is again concerning for sigmoid diverticulitis, although no discrete diverticulum is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the Urology service for abdominal pain and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate in the 140s.
CT A/P was performed which showed a small pocket of free air in the abdomen near his neobladder.
There was also some stranding around the sigmoid colon, possibly suspicious for diverticulitis.
It became evidence that his recent IR internalization of his nephrostomy tube had been difficult secondary to ureteroileal anastamotic stricture, and that significant manipulation had been necessary to place the stent.
This was a hypothesis for the presence of free air in the abdomen.
General surgery was consulted for possible diverticulitis, and recommended conservative management with IV antibiotics.
Infectious disease commented on the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in the patient's urine - it was advised that linezolid not be started because the bacteria was likely present secondary to colonization of the existing foley catheter in an ileal bladder.
Medicine was consulted for management of his uncontrolled atrial fibrillation and recommended increasing his metoprolol from 100 mg PO bid to 125 mg PO tid, which improved his rate somewhat.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 100 mg po bid [**Last Name (STitle) 197**] 2 mg daily Ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, diverticulitis    Discharge Condition: stable    Completed by:[**2127-7-5**
