# GI bleeding: Patient has had multiple episodes of lower GI bleeding in the past.
His current episode is likely secondary to hemorrhoids versus diverticulosis.
He did not have any nausea/vomiting or hematemesis to suggest upper GI source though this is technically a possibility.
There were no signs of mesenteric ischemia on CT scan, though diverticulosis was noted.
Pt was admitted initially to the MICU for management of his lower GI bleed.
Given pt's long history of hemorrhoidal bleeds with banding, and pt's risk factors at age [**Age over 90 **], Surgery did not think pt would benefit from hemorrhoidectomy at this time.
# EKG changes: Patient has had no complaints of chest pain but had TWI on EKG done in ED.
This likely represents sequelae of anemia and demand ischemia given Hct of 21.1.
Pt had no additional cardiac symptoms during admission.
# h/o gout: Stable.l Pt did not have any symptoms of gout flare, and was continued on home Allopurinol.
#pruritis: Pt complained of some mild itching on back.
There weere no lesions or rashes visible.
# PPx: pneumoboots, bowel regimen .
Disp:*90 Packet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable (29.2), afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management of lower GI bleeding.
This was most likely related to your hemorrhohids.
You were lightheaded and had a very low blood level.
This should help to keep your stools soft and reduce your tendency to bleed from straining when constipated.
