Admission Date:  [**2204-4-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2204-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-7-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: feeling unwell   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Internal Jugular Line placement  History of Present Illness: 66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD, CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague symptoms.
He reports that he started feeling unwell yesterday afternoon with nausea, lightheadedness, and some shortness of breath.
He denies chest pain or pressure, palpitations, vomiting, sweating.
He was noted to be altered by his wife with concern re: difficulty speaking, perhaps a left sided facial droop and possible left hemianopsia, but limited evidence for this.
The patient denies having any difficultly speaking or visual changes, but says that he was confused and seeing things that weren't there.
His wife reported to the neurologist that he never had a facial droop.
He reports chronic DOE, no CP at rest or with exercise, + claudication (calf pain) with ambulating 2 blocks, denies orthopnea, sleeps on 4 pillows at night.
He reports LE edema at baseline.
He was found to have new [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated cardiac enzymes.
He was hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine and sent to the ED.
He was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain.
A bedside U/S in the ED was neg for pericardial effusion.
Cardiology consult was requested for stat ECHO in ED, to look for new WMA, but was not performed.
There was some concern for aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w/o contrast, which was negative for aneurysm.
Neurology was consulted for concern re: TIA and they did not feel he had a primary neurologic process.
Due to persistent hypotension, a RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed.
He was not given any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e/o infection.

Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
Reversal of flow in the right vertebral artery, suggestive of subclavian steal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with global hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  CT abdomen/ pelvis: [**2204-4-8**] 1. normal caliber thoracic and abdominal aorta.
no hematoma detected.
Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of appendicitis.
Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst, but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF 25-30%.
He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam.
His hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and demand ischemia.
His CE were trended, showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.
Repeat Echo showed stable EF of 25-30%, RV free wall hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
The patient was transferred to the CCU for further management of cardiogenic shock.
Throughout hospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history of recently diagnosed LV thrombus.
Of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor on patient secondary to severe PVD.
# Coronaries: Upon admission serial EKG showed nonspecific ST changes in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning for ACS.
Cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation of troponin to 0.95 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of worsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.
Atenolol was held secondary to renal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned to carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved.
Carvedilol dose uptitrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge but other anti-hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated levels.
# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Patient admitted with oliguric renal failure with Cr elevated to 5.0 from baseline of 2.6.
Likely etiology secondary to ATN in the setting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow.
Renal was consulted for help with management given his possible need for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.
# Altered mental status/reported neurologic changes: Presented with vague neurologic complaints of confusion, dysarthria, and facial droop which had resolved by presentation to the ED.
Initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion from hypotension.
Neurology was consulted and felt that initial presentation was consistent with a TIA.
Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure might be needed as below.
# Known LV thrombus: Pt with history of LV thrombus documented on prior TTE.
Pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] to confirm that dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeutic anti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.
# Transaminitis: New this admission, likely secondary to poor forward flow given his presentation of hypotension.
# Incidental CT findings - noted incidentally on CT A/p.
Large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires outpatient surgical follow-up.
Disp:*900 units* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1) Hypotension 2) Acute renal failure  Secondary Diagnosis: 1) Diabetes 2) Systolic Heart Failure 3) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a cat-scan of your abdomen to see if there was something obstructing your kidenys.
We also stopped many of your blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood pressure initially.
The neurologic service came to see you and said you did not have a stroke but may have experienced what we call a TIA with no residual symptoms.
Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of appendicitis.
Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst, but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique.
Enlarged pretracheal lymph node.
