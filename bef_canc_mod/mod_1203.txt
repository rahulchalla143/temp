There is continued effacement of sulci and slight compression of the right lateral ventricle, with unchanged 2 mm leftward shift of the normally midline structures.
There is no new hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarct.
Mild mucosal thickening is present in the anterior ethmoid air cells.
No new hemorrhage or fractures.
Proximal M1 segment occlusion of the right MCA with large area of right-sided acute infarction involving the right temporal greater than parietal lobes, right globus pallidus, and putamen.
New concurrent left-sided punctate areas of acute infarction involving the left apical anterior parietal cortex, left occipital lobe, and left cerebellum.
As there is no obvious plaque at the right carotid bifurcation as of [**2202-9-26**], proximal cardiac embolic source is felt more likely.
Redemonstration of mild-to-moderate microvascular ischemic disease.
Please note that current exam is not optimized for evaluation of intracranial metastasis without contrast administration.
* TTE 8/x/10 (prior to PFO closure) -Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
-IMPRESSION: Well-seated atrial septal occluder in place.
Trivial aortic regurgitation.
No significant pericardial effusion.
TTE revealed a PFO, and a right peroneal DVT was noted on LE Dopplers.
The patient was scheduled for TEE on [**9-28**], but SICU team felt there was a change in mental status and ordered repeat CT which showed no interval change.
On the neuro-medicine floor the patient went for her TEE on [**2202-9-30**], which again revealed a PFO, and which did not show any evidence for clot or aneurysm.
There was no complications of closure and a retrievable IVC filter was also placed because of the right leg DVT and our stroke Neurology team's preference not to place the patient on warfarin or heprin gtt post procedure.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN anxiety QD 5.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Left facial droop and a left hemiparesis.
The stroke occurred due to the blockade of a major blood vessel that supplies a large part of the right side of your brain.
A catheter was placed in this blood vessel and the blockage was removed, but some brain tissue was already damaged from the stroke, which is the reason for your right-sided weakness.
Your stroke was likely the result of a blood clot passing through a leak in your heart called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).
