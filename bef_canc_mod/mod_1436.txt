Left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental acute pulmonary embolism.
Persistent but slightly decreased right infrahilar density now measuring 11 x 13 mm.
Interval resolution of left upper lobe opacity.
Left upper lobe 7-mm nodule unchanged from the most recent prior, but new from [**2122-3-8**].
Multiple new wedge deformities within the thoracic spine.
Bilateral LE LENIs - IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus extending from the distal right common femoral vein into the mid superficial femoral vein and proximal deep femoral vein.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a promient fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular size with preserved global and regional systolic and diastolic function.
Moderately dilated right ventricle with borderline normal free wall function in the setting of abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Moderate aortic root dilatation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The other findings are similar  Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o F w/ a h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], COPD and recent hospitlization for PNA/COPD presents from neurologist oupt office for labored breathing found to have pulmonary emboli.
# Pulmonary Emboli: The patient had no history of PE in the past.
She was on coumadin for afib and CVA but subtherapeutic on admission.
She had lower extremity ultrasounds performed which showed nonocclusive thrombus extending from the distal right common femoral vein into the mid superficial femoral vein and proximal deep femoral vein.
She had an echo performed that did show evidence of right-sided heart strain, consistent with PE (see above for full report) but no evidence of right heart failure and was relatively unchanged from prior.
She denied any chest pain on the medicine floor and repeat EKGs were without ST elevatoin.
Metoprolol and cardizem doses were decreased, as pt had bradycardia.
# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: Continued on mestinon and imuran.
# LLL nodule: Of note, imaging showed a LLL ground glass nodule that should have f/u CT scan in [**9-19**] months (see report) and also right infrahilar density which was decresae din size from prior but which recommended outpatient PET scan to determine if possible malignancy given history of lung cancer.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: - Pulmonary Embolism - COPD exacerbation  SECONDARY: - Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were brought to the hospital for difficulty breathing, and were found to have a blood clot in your lung.
