Admission Date:  [**2132-4-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-4-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-10-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old woman with long history of pulmonary problems dating back to her diagnosis and subsequent treatment of Hodgkin's disease.
She is on nocturnal home ventilation for chronic respiratory failure.
She was seeming to improve over the recent months until about one month prior to admission, when she noted onset of allergy symptoms (i.e., nasal congestion, increased pulmonary secretions from the trach).
However, the last two weeks prior to admission, she noted increasing shortness of breath, edema, and weight gain.
She denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, or palpitations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HEENT showed anicteric sclerae, reactive pupils.
Neck was supple with positive jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed absent breath sounds on the left status post pneumonectomy.
There were basilar crackles and coarse rhonchi on the right.
There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities showed 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities.
There is no clubbing, cyanosis, calf tenderness, erythema, or palpable cords.
Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion and increased interstitial markings on the right.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment for her increasing shortness of breath.
However, interventions were limited by her concurrent severe hypotension, with her systolic blood pressure running at baseline from the 70s to 80s.
Given that, IV Lasix was initially attempted to treat her congestive heart failure, without significant improvement.
However, the patient showed no significant improvement in objective or subjective parameters while on pressors, and the dopamine was weaned off.
Given her hypotension, it was not felt that Natrecor, other pressors, or Flolan could be reasonable options at this point.
Arrangements were in the process of being made for such when the patient continued to spiral downward clinically, with worsening blood pressures.
