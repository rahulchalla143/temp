Admission Date:  [**2120-2-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-4-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for renal failure in setting of heart failure.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular central venous line placement.
He is now presenting with acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, and volume overload.
His recent admission was notable for ongoing difficulties with hypotension in the setting of significant volume overload.
Work-up demonstrated evidence of an infiltrative process in his heart, and fat pad biopsy was consistent with amyloid.
He also underwent heart catheterization, which demonstrated inappropriately low systemic vascular resistance, and he was felt to have autonomic dysfunction resulting in inappropriate vasodilation.
In addition, he was seen by hematology/oncology who were concerned that he likely has a plasma cell dyscrasia given the monoclonal spike on his SPEP.
They recommended that he be seen as an outpatient for possible bone marrow biopsy.
Finally, he was treated for C diff infection during his stay and was discharged on a course of flagyl on [**2-12**].
At rehab today, his labwork revealed renal failure with Cr of 4.1 (up from 2.6 on discharge) and K+ of 5.3.
The patient was asymptomatic, but the physicians at his rehab did not feel comfortable giving him fluids for his renal failure in the setting of his volume overload and heart failure.
CXR showed large b/l effusions (ED read).
He sleeps with his head propped up but he was unable to clarify if he gets short of breath with lying flat.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Smokes two cigarettes per day, long history of heavy smoking.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thyroid enlargement.
No thrills, lifts.
Poor air movement at the bases with some diffuse lower crackles.
He has mild tenderness in the area of his recent biopsy site.
No guarding or rebound.
EXTREMITIES:  Diffuse swelling in his arms and legs with pitting edema.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
His hypotension was believed due to a combination of impaired cardiac output from infiltrative cardiac amyloidosis, autonomic dysfunction, and decreased effective circulating volume secondary to amyloid infiltration of peripheral vasculature with resulting capillary leak.
Urine output, furthermore, decreased and on the first hospital day he became anuric, likely from renal amyloidosis.
We spoke with the renal service about the possibility of CVVHD for volume overload, but they said that this was not an option given his hypotension.
On the second hospital day, the palliative care service was consulted and it was decided to continue the vasopressin as long as he remained interactive and conscious, but to otherwise withdraw all unnecessary treatments, including close monitoring of urine output and blood pressure.
On the third hospital day the patient passed away likely as a result of worsening renal function and hyperkalemia.
