On day of admission, she had difficulties even swallowing water.
Anesthesia was called for intubation for MAC anesthesia.
CT chest showed fluid distention of the stomach and fluid layering up to mid esophagus.

Cardiomegaly is again noted with diffuse ground-glass opacity concerning for pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right with bibasilar consolidation, likely representing compressive atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Aortic calcifications again noted.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, stable cardiomegaly.
Fluid distension of the esophagus suggesting dysmotility.
Left adrenal nodule is incompletely assessed.
EGD [**2105-4-4**]: Impression: Food in the whole Esophagus Erythema and friability in the lower third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis Retained fluids in stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Trial clears with close monitoring.
Barium Swallow [**2105-4-5**] FINDINGS: The patient has mild esophageal dysmotility.
There is no abnormal dilation, stricture, or evidence of achalasia.
IMPRESSION: Mild esophageal dysmotility.
No evidence of achalasia.
Manometry [**2105-4-8**]: no signs of achalasia, final read pending   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 88 year old female with hx of a. fib and right brachial artery embolism on dabigatran, CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, hypothyroidism who presented with dysphagia and was found to have esophagitis and food particles throughout the esophagus without evidence of stricture on barium swallow.
Manometry showed no signs of achalasia.
Dysphagia: Patient presented with intermittent dysphagia.
She had a CT of the chest which showed large amounts of food in the esophagus with air fluid levels.
She was intubated for her EGD given food seen on CT scan and concern for aspiration.
Her EGD showed large amounts of food in the esophagus as well as esophagitis without evidence of strictures or malignancies.
Food was removed and she was extubated without incident.
Barium swallow showed no stricture.
Manometry showed no signs of achalasia.
Etiology of dysphagia remains unclear.
Gastroenterology thinks esophagitis likely is contributing to esophageal dysmotility, though there is concern for dysmotility elsewhere in the GI tract including in the colon given constipation and the stomach as this was full of food.
Diastolic CHF: Torsemide dosing recently increased from 20mg to 40mg for worsening LE edema.
It was restarted when she developed an O2 requirement on [**2105-4-6**].
She then was oxygenating well on room air and had minimal LE edema.
Her torsemide dose was subsequently decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg prior to discharge as she developed a contraction alkalosis and appeared euvolemic to slightly dry.
She was instructed to weigh or if she developed lower extremity edema.
On dabigatran on off-label dosing for afib and right brachial artery embolism.
Anemia: Recent extensive workup for source of anemia was unrevealing (pt is s/p EGD, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy).
She had no evidence of active bleeding  # Transition issues: 1.
Patient needs to be followed up for thrombocytopenia and leukopenia as outpatient with consideration of hematology follow up if this fails to resolve 5.
Patient complained of difficulty hearing, and found to have bilateral ear wax impaction.
Left adrenal nodule found incidentally on CT chest, should have adrenal protocol CT as outpatient to further assess  # Communication: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 575**] (son, [**Name (NI) 382**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22335**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22334**] # Code: Full (confirmed with HCP)   Medications on Admission: 1. digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO once a day.
Simvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Greater [**Location (un) 1468**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Dysphagia  Secondary: diastolic heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with trouble and pain with swallowing.
A study called esophageal manometry was performed and showed no evidence of achalasia.
You can further discuss the final result with your GI doctor.
