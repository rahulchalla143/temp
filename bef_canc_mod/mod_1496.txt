Ms. [**Known lastname 104221**] recently completed a course of chemotherapy and XRT for a small cell lung cancer, which was in the right lung.
This was treated as a limited stage small cell lung cancer, with recognition that there were several other lesions bilaterally.
Most notably, there were bilateral apical nodules as well as multiple other smaller nodules noted both lungs.
She has some hot flashes on occasion, but denies any fevers or chills.
She has an occasional dry cough, which is not productive of any purulent sputum or hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: Bladder cancer, status post partialcystectomy in [**2186**], orally treated diabetes, hypertension, bilateral lower extremity leg fractures with extensive reconstruction being done in the left ankle region, left breast cancer in [**2182**], status post lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, status post radiation for this and tamoxifen for 7 years, status post right vocal cord in situ squamous cell carcinoma and intraepithelial squamous neoplasia resected in [**2194**] and [**2195**].
Family History:  No family history of bleeding dyscrasia  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Well-nourished, well-developed woman, in no apparent distress.
No facial asymmetry.
No oropharynx or nasopharynx mucosal abnormalities.
There is no thyroid enlargement.
There is no tactile fremitus or egophony.
BACK: There is no spine or CVA tenderness.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended, without mass or hepatosplenomegaly.
There is evidence of multiple surgical repairs of her bilateral lower extremities.
Pertinent Results: IMPRESSION:  1) Enlarged right hilum with worsening surrounding ground glass and interstitial opacity.
2) Persistent bilateral nodular opacities.
FINDINGS: Since the previous examination, the left-sided chest tube has been removed and no pneumothorax is identified.
There is decreased prominence of the left upper mediastinum since the previous examination.
Areas of consolidation within the left upper and right lower lobe are probably unchanged although appear less conspicuous due  to marked increase in interstitial and air space opacity throughout the remainder of the lungs.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax following removal of chest tube.
Marked progression of interstitial and air space opacities bilaterally, superimposed upon pre-existing left upper and right lower lobe consolidations.
The findings could reflect pulmonary edema due to transfusion, drug toxicity, or less likely cardiogenic causes, or other etiologies such as diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
HISTORY:  Status post left upper lobe [**Year (4 digits) **] resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
Short of breath, low sats, evaluate CHF.
There are diffuse patchy interstitial and alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, demonstrating moderate interval improvement compared with [**2196-8-5**].
Pleural thickening, focal area of relative lucency, and surgical sutures noted at the left lung apex.
Patient became tachypneic and began to desaturate while on oxygen.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H PRN () as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral pulmonary nodules, Acute Shortness of Breath   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, productive cough of green/[**Last Name (un) 104223**] sputum, fever, chills or pain not relieved with pain medicine.
