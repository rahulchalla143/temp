Admission Date:  [**2119-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-6-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: At time of encounter patient was intubated, thus history is from patient's wife and prior records.
There, head CT showed a small L posterior temporal SAH, which was confirmed on head MRI/A.
In the ED, he was sedated with propofol and was seen by neurosurgery who assessed that his SAH was too small for operative management, and care was deferred to neurology.
Electrolytes returned markedly abnormal and the patient reported had a 7 beat run of vtach, followed by wavering heart rates greater than 100 in afib, and then in NSR and in the low 60s.
Cardiology was in the department, and saw the pt's rhythm strips, declaring that this particular rhythm was unlikely the cause of his syncopal episode.
They recommended repeat head CT to evaluate his SAH, and will assess for need for EEG based on his course and responsiveness.
The ER covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, but LP was not performed in the ER due to the pt's "changing heart rhythms."
Per wife, has not been complaining of headache, has felt very sleepy for last few weeks, no c/o CP, no SOB over usual baseline (dyspneic with walking one flight of stairs), no c/o abd pain, no diarrhea, +constipation.

- per discussion with radiology resident, also no central PEs seen on this study.
Cannot rule out subsegmental PE given timing of contrast not ideal for this.

repeat head CT: Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left posterior temporal lobe, without significant change in size from 12:30 p.m. today.
No acute traumatic injury in the cervical spine.
head MR/MRA (neuro attg read) from [**Location (un) 620**]: scattered FLAIR and T2 abnormalities c/w small vessel disease.
There was a small SAH in the left parieto-temporal region.
There were no DWI or T2* abnormalities.
(rads read) INCREASE SIGNAL SEEN IN THE UPPER MID BRAIN AND MEDIAL THALAMI COULD BE CONSISTENT WERNICKE'S ENCEPHALOPATHY IN PROPER CLINICAL SETTING.
EVIDENCE OF SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE IN THE LEFT TEMPORAL SULCI CONSISTENT WITH THE FINDINGS SEEN ON THE RECENT CT.
MILD TO MODERATE BRAIN ATROPHY AND SMALL VESSEL DISEASE.
EKg: NSR at 70, nl axis, nl intervals, no TWI, no STT changes, no Qs.
also have EKG rhythm strips showing several instances of sinus pauses up to longest of about 2 seconds interspersed with a narrow tachycardia.
UA: blood but negative for infection Blood culture: pending serum tox screen negative except for positive benzos urine tox screen negative .
Predominantly sinus rhythm with a brief episode of sinus bradycardia to 47 BPM at 9:34 am.
Frequent isolated APBs and 2 atrial couplets.
Moderate isolated ventricular ectopy.
One episode of "palpitations" showed sinus tachycardia at 107 BPM with a single isolated APB.
Compared to Day 1 (2-day study), atrial tachycardia was not seen.
Limited exercise tolerance.
No symptoms of chest pressure or chest tightness.
No EKG changes of ischemia with exercise performed.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87M with a history of TIA and HTN who presented s/p fall with loss of consciousness to [**Location (un) 620**] and was found to have a small left subarachnoid hemorrhage, a thalamic CVA, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
EEG showed no epileptiform foci.
Repeat head imaging showed a CVA in the thalami and Left caudate nucleus.
CVA is likely thromboembolic related to atrial fibrillation.
Echo showed no structural abnormalities and no patent foramen.
He continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status consistent with hospital-related delirium and was treated with haldol prn agitation.
His deficits throughout hospital course and at discharge were right sided hemiparesis and eyelid opening apraxia.
Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: He had a newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation on admission with RVR.
He was treated with anticoagulation as above (the left sided subarachnoid hemorrhage had resolved radiographically as of [**6-18**]) and was also started on a beta blocker.
Leukocytosis: WBC 31 on [**6-14**], blood culture on [**6-12**] right PICC with coag neg staph in [**2-15**] sets (likely contaminant).
Also completed 7 day course of vanc/cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia on [**6-25**].
He did have FOBT stools on [**6-20**], but no melena or BRBPR.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1108**] Rehab Unit at [**Hospital6 1109**] - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Subarachnoid hemorrhage left posterior temporal lobe Thromboembolic stroke, left thalamic infarct Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Anemia Delirium Secondary Chronic renal insufficiency Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Polymyalgia rheumatica   Discharge Condition: stable, PEG tube in place, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a stroke and bleed in your head.
Your stroke is likely from your atrial fibrillation (irregular rhythm).
You were treated with several medications including blood thinners and medications for your irregular heart rhythm.
In addition, you were found to have an infection and were treated with multiple antibiotics.
If you have any of the following symptoms, you should return to the emergency room: Fevers, chills, cough, diarrhea, new weakness, headaches or any other serious concerns.
