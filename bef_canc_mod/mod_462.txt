Admission Date:  [**2195-10-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-11-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-10-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old man with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and known two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The patient is admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital for treatment of ureteral obstruction due to prostate cancer.
He had an uneventful postoperative period until 5 AM with chest pain, shortness of breath, and anterior and lateral ST depressions 2 mm to 3 mm in size.
At [**Hospital1 69**] the patient presented with acute shortness of breath, pink frothy secretions from the mouth.
He was intubated immediately for impending respiratory failure.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse pulmonary edema.
The patient subsequently ruled in for non ST elevation MI with CK over 1100.
Significant findings at catheterization included elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 28, 90% proximal LAD lesion, 70% mid left circumflex lesion and no significant right coronary artery disease.
The patient had his LAD lesion stented.
The patient was also noted to have significant aortic stenosis with a valve area of approximately 0.8 cm squared and gradient of 39 mm.
Coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes mellitus type 2 for 20 years, hypercholesterolemia status post right hip replacement [**2179**], revision in [**2187**], cholecystectomy, prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy, XRT, and ureteral stents, hypertension, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine around 2.0.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  Intubated man in no distress.
HEENT:  Moist oral mucosa, no JVD, brisk carotid upstroke.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border and [**2-11**] holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema; 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Right axis deviation.
New ST depression V3 through V6.
Chest x-ray:  Pulmonary edema bilaterally.
After the LAD stent, the patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor for treatment of coronary artery disease.
He did not have further chest pain or shortness of breath throughout the admission.
He responded well to Lasix diuresis with decreased wedge pressure and increased cardiac index.
Echocardiogram on [**10-26**], revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction approximately 45% to 50% and inferior wall hypokinesis.
These medications were titrated up to their maximum doses after the patient became hypertensive post extubation on [**10-28**].
BOWELS:  The patient was noted to have severe aortic stenosis.
The patient had occasional PVCs and short runs of NSVT within 72 hours post catheterization.
The patient had interstitial markings on the chest x-ray.
The patient received a BAL after he spiked a temperature.
The patient was treated for the pneumonia with a course of Ceftazidime and Vancomycin, which was changed to IV Levofloxacin and the cultures did not grow organisms.
RENAL:  The patient was noted, prior to admission, to have baseline renal insufficiency and baseline creatinine of approximately 2.0.
This was felt to be possibly secondary to a die load or to the hypotension that the patient had experienced.
Renal ultrasound was obtained to rule out obstruction in the ureters and bladder.
The ultrasound revealed no obstruction.
He was seen by the renal consultation service and a workup for cause of acute renal insufficiency on top of the chronic renal insufficiency was in progress at the time of discharge.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have "MRSE" urinary tract infection at the outside hospital prior to admission.
The patient also completed a course of Ceftazidime/Levofloxacin for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia as above.
He was noted to have guaiac-negative stools.
He received several doses of Zyprexa with reduced agitation.
Coronary artery disease status post LAD stent, post non ST elevation MI.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Prostate cancer status post ureteral reimplantation and suprapubic tube placement.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
