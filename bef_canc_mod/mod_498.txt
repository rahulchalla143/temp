The patient had recently been discharged on [**2141-2-23**] after being admitted for 4 days for transaminitis with biopsy revealing changes consistent with chronic Hep C but no evidence for acute rejection.
The patient presented to the hospital with a week's history of diffuse abdominal pain, found in the ED to be febrile to 101.3 with SBP in low 100s for which he was given IVF, Vanc, Levo, Flagyl, and Decadron with transient drop in pressure to the 90's.
A chest film at the time was revealing for multilobar pneumonia.
Given evidence for infection and hypotension, the patient was admitted to the MICU for treatment of sepsis from PNA complicated by ARF.
The patient was treated with the antibiotic regimens as detailed above and was additionally diuresed for question of pulmonary edema as exacerbating factor.

Nasal Aspirate: [**2141-3-11**]: No virus isolated .
These may represent foci of aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia.
There is no evidence of congestive failure.
No definite pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia as described.
3-04-06L Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelvis - The liver is normal in echotexture and architecture, without focal lesions.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is seen.
The left, middle, and right hepatic veins are also patent, with normal direction of flow; there is exaggerated respiratory variation due to the patient's snoring.
Right hepatic index is 0.74.
These are slightly increased since the last examination, but may be due to position, as waveforms are within normal limits.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Chest - No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes are demonstrated.
Prominent right epicardial lymph node measuring 8 mm is identified.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, unchanged in the interval.
No pericardial effusion is demonstrated.
Lung window images demonstrate patchy areas of ground glass opacity within both upper lobes, and both lower lobes, with more consolidative appearance noted towards the bases.
Airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
Small amount of perihepatic fluid is again noted, as well as a trace amount of fluid along the left pericolic gutter.
BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are apparent.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal ground glass opacities with more consolidative appearance in the lung bases bilaterally, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Abd/Pelvis - There are dependent atelectatic changes of both lung bases, with a consolidation at the left lung base.
Small right pleural effusion.
Lymph nodes are seen anterior to the left lobe of the liver, unchanged.
No perihepatic fluid collections.
There is a small amount of stranding around both kidneys, which is stable.
The pancreas shows some fatty infiltration, also with some stranding, unchanged since last exam.
Bowel loops are unchanged in configuration; there is no evidence of obstruction.
This is a small amount of stranding, but no free fluid in the abdomen.
No free air.
No free fluid or free air.
Left lower lobe consolidation and bilateral dependent atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of free air or bowel distention.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Head - IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2141-3-15**]: Portable Chest - Compared to the prior radiograph of [**2141-3-11**], there is incomplete resolution of the pulmonary edema.
There are no pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.

Pneumonia - The patient was transferred from the MICU to the floor with multilobar PNA and sepsis, likely secondary to immunosuppression s/p orthotopic liver transplant.
As detailed in H+P, all sputum and blood cultures were unrevealing including extensive workup for atypical pathogens including crypto, CMV,EBV,legionella,AFB, and chlamydia Pneumoniae.
S/p Liver Transplant - The patient was admitted s/p orthotopic liver transplant for indications of HCC and hepatocellular carcinoma.
The patient continued to have chronic abdominal pain (see below) which was not thought to represent acute rejection.
The patient demonstrated a mild transaminitis throughout his hospital course but with levels that were relatively stable and without evidence for severe hepatic dysfunction.
Abdominal Pain - The patient was admitted with known chronic abdominal pain, previous workup for which has been unrevealing.
However, this resulted in recrudescence of the patient's pain for which his pain regimen was changed back to a Fentanyl Patch with standing oxycodone q 4hours (with refusal allowed) as well as an increase in Neurontin from 100mg po bid to tid.
Leukopenia - The patient developed a leukopenia with nadir ANC as low as 800.
Hypertension - The patient's outpatient regimen of Lopressor 50mg po bid and Norvasc 5mg po qd was initially held given the patient's hypotension on admission.
During his MICU course, Lopressor was reintroduced with introduction of Lisinopril 5mg po qd instead of Norvasc, likely secondary to history of DM, although most recent HgA1C 5.5% and patient is off DM meds.
The patient's BP was well controlled during hospital course with stable renal function after resolution of initial failure in setting of sepsis.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
