Admission Date: [**2126-7-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2126-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-3-8**]        Sex:  M  Service:  LIVER TRANSPLANT SURGERY SERVICE   BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 60 year old white man who is status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2126-2-22**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a transfer from [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital after 36 hour history of upper GI bleed and melanotic stool.
This bright red blood vomiting was quickly followed by severe nausea and diarrhea.
The patient does have a history of grade III esophageal varices, but otherwise there is no history of GI bleed.
Patient had been noted to have episodic thrombocytopenia since as early as [**2125-6-26**].
Over the last 2 to 3 months, the patient has had several hospital admissions for malaises and nausea and vomiting.
He has undergone extensive work up with multiple cultures to test for viral and bacterial etiologies.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was transported immediately to the surgical intensive care unit where he was found to have an extremely low platelet count of less than 5, hematocrit of 20.5.
Aforementioned orthotopic liver transplant.
Esophageal varices.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
There is no evidence of any scleral icterus.
Cardiac examination shows heart regular rate and rhythm with no evidence of any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, with no evidence of any distention.
No evidence of any distention or tympany.
CLINICAL COURSE:  Shortly after arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient had an internal jugular catheter to provide central venous access placed without complication.
Once a nasogastric tube could be placed, it was seen that the patient continued to have bright red blood upon lavage.
On the night of admission, Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 131**] performed an upper GI endoscopy.
At that time, possible etiologies for the patient's thrombocytopenia included hemolytic urea mix syndrome, ITP, and a possibility of graft versus host disease following liver transplant.
Care in the intensive care unit focused on re-establishing physiologically safe levels of platelets and bringing hematocrit back up.
Despite several course of IVIG, there was reportedly very little resolution or improvement in the platelet count despite multiple transfusion of platelets and other blood products.
On hospital day 7, the patient underwent bone marrow biopsy for assess for graft versus host disease.
This turned conversation to considering splenectomy versus rituximab or splenic sequestration.
He recovered from the surgery extremely well with a gradual rise in his platelet counts.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
