Per his wife, he has had very frequent episodes of chest pain more than 10 during dialysis since he was started on hemodialysis in [**2153-8-16**].
His chest pain resolved and has not returned since, and he went home the next day.
His wife noted that the workup for his chest pain has been negative in the past including a cardiac catheterization done in [**2153-9-16**] which showed normal coronary arteries.

History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of questionable congestive heart failure likely secondary to volume overload from an infected dialysis.
Prior cardiovascular evaluation, echocardiogram in [**2154-1-16**] was a limited study and showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, no known wall motion abnormalities or valvular disease.
Parathyroid adenoma in the left lower pole of the thyroid.
History of multiple pneumonias and recurrent pneumonia.
ALLERGIES:  Ciprofloxacin causes mouth swelling, but no difficulty breathing.

Dyspnea:  Patient's shortness of breath is most likely secondary to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure secondary to missing hemodialysis on the day of presentation and having it interrupted on the days prior.

Chronic renal failure.
Anemia of chronic renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.

APPOINTMENTS FOR FOLLOWUP:  Please plan to have dialysis done at your home, Hemodialysis Center following your previous regimen.
