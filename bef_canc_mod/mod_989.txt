Admission Date:  [**2176-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-5-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**] Chief Complaint: transfer for evaluation of transaminitis, possible endocarditis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP left knee irrigation and debridement; evacuation of a large hematoma; synovial biopsy and partial synovectomy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 31 y/oM with h/o DM1 on HD, ESRD on HD, and bipolar disorder which has led to inconsistent HD adherence in the past (most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2176-8-12**] - [**2176-9-3**] for ESRD/Bipolar c/b fistula bleeding and need for HD line) now transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with fevers, polymicrobial bacteremia, and transaminitis.
In brief, patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] ICU with fever and hypoxemia after [**Hospital1 2286**] on [**11-4**].
He was covered with Vancomycin until blood cx's grew out [**Month/Year (2) 8974**] and he was switched to Nafcillin.
TTE on [**11-6**] without evidence of vegetations.
However, patient spiked T to 101.4 one week later, and blood cx's drawn from his temp HD line grew Enterococcus raffinous and micrococcus on [**11-14**] and VRE (E. Facecium) on [**11-17**].
The day of transfer a new systolic murmur was heard.
In addition, patient was noted to have worsening transaminitis (bili 7.6, AP 674, GGT 572, AST 60 ALT 50) with some RUQ abdominal pain.
Patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of possible endocarditis and transaminitis.
Surgery consulted on patient, RUQ showed no evidence of acute cholecystitis, so patient was deemed not a surgical candidate.
He denied abdominal pain and admitted to some diarrhea.

New massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of CHF could represent dilated cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
Left lower lobe likely atelectasis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Very mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-5-31**], a very small circumferential pericardial effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.
No CT findings of acute pancreatitis or of complictations of pancreatitis.
Small bilateral effusions, right greater than left, but decreased from [**2176-6-8**].
Enlargement and heterogeneity of the liver, consistent with hepatic congestion in the setting of right heart failure.
Left Knee X-ray: [**11-26**]  Worsening appearance of the left knee with new erosions,increased sclerosis, and fragmentation.
Findings are concerning for infection given the clinical history although they could also be seen in progressive Charcot arthropathy.
Images demonstrate cannulation and opacification of proximal portion of the pancreatic duct which appears prominent.
Subsequent cannulation and opacification of the biliary tree reveal normal-sized CBD, intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts, and cystic duct as well as the gallbladder without evidence of filling defects or strictures.
Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo M with h/o of DMI, ESRD on HD, bipolar now transferred from OSH for polymicrobial bacteremia and transaminitis.
Elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic pattern:  The ddx includes but not limited to cholangitis (given fever, leukocytosis, and possible partially treated process at OSH that worsened with discontinuation of gram negative/anaerobic coverage), cholestasis from sepsis, medication-induced hepatotoxicity (i.e.
nafcillin given peripheral eosinophilia), and vanishing bile duct syndrome.
Patient was initially covered for possible cholangitis with linezolid/cefepime/flagyl though he denied any abdominal pain.
RUQ showed tiny fluid adjacent to the gallbladder, a non-specific, otherwise without evidence of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
HIDA scan showed markedly poor hepatic uptake of radiotracer compatible with severe hepatocellular dysfunction; no evidence of central biliary obstruction.
MRCP and subsequent ERCP showed no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation nor evidence of cholelithiasis.
Pt orginally had a tunneled HD catheter, which was then taken out when [**Month/Year (2) 8974**] was discovered.
TTE [**11-6**] negative for vegetations.
Pt then had a temporary HD line in R groin, which grew enterococcus raffinosis and micrococcus in one sample, but no others.
TEE was deferred as patient had recent history of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 329**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, and the risk of procedure were felt to outweigh benefits.
Given patient's multiple episodes of bacteremia and new murmur on physical exam, the infectious disease team recommended treating patient with full 6 week course of daptomycin (end date [**1-3**]) from last positive culture for presumed endocarditis.
Patient tolerated the procedure well, without any acute complications.
Olanzapine was held due to possible side effect of cholestasis and restarted on [**2176-11-27**].
Patient required several doses of halidol during hospitalization for agitation, but this resolved by the time of discharge.
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy:  This was likely to due to infection and progressive hyperbilirubinemia, hyperammonemia as well as renal failure.
Head CT at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**] showed no acute pathology.
He was treated with lactulose, rifaximin for empiric treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
Acute on chronic anemia of iron-deficiency and CKD:  His baseline Hct ~28%.
He received a total of 3 units of PRBCs following evacuation of septic hematoma on [**11-28**].
Pt had eosinphilia (up to 20%) in the past.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Please draw CK weekly while on on daptomycin and fax results to [**Hospital **] clinic: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 432**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Recurrent Bacteremia Transaminitis of unclear etiology left knee septic hematoma  Secondary Diagnoses: type I Diabetes Mellitus End- Stage Kidney Disease on [**Location (un) **] partially healed left tibial fracture   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile for more than 72 hours; hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from an outside hospital with recurrent fevers and an elevation of your liver enzymes.
We did many tests to determine what the source of the infection and why your liver enzymes were elevated.
Your left knee also became very swollen from a large collection of blood.
We treated your fevers with antibiotics- you will need to take Daptomycin for a total of 6 weeks (end date [**1-3**]).
Please call your physician or return to the emergency room if you develop any additional fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, increased swelling your leg or any other complaint.
