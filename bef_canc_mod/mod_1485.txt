Sepsis: The patient was transferred to the MICU hypotensive and septic from a likely respiratory source based on preliminary culture data.
The patient's blood pressures remained labile hypo- and hyper-tensive often associated with bouts of atrial fibrillation to the 120s.
Prior to transfer to the medical floor the patient was stabily extubated and off pressures & fluid resuscitation.
His sputum culture showed pan-sensitive Morganella.
On the floor, he remained afebrile with normal white count and satting well on room air.
He is at high risk for aspiration.
- Recommend Altzheimer's clothing to prevent undressing to prevent this tube from being removed again.
Acute renal failure:  The patient was admitted with pre-renal acute on chronic renal failure due to significantly poor PO intake.
Through free water tube feed bolus & high free water iv fluids the patient's sodium was safely and slowly lowered.
On transfer to the floor, he had a free water deficit around 2 L. This resolved with aggressive free water repletion in tube feeds.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  The patient intermittently developed atrial fibrillation with rates to 120s-130s.
They are currently holding off given his fall risk.
Coagulopathy:  The patient was found to have an INR of 1.8 without clear explanation and no history of anticoagulation.
CAD:  The patient's admission EKG indicated ST depressions with T wave inversions in the setting of a rapid rate.
Troponins were mildly elevated as the patient was in renal failure, but no clear evidence of infarction was discovered.
No beta-blocker as above.
No evidence of bleeding was found and he was not transfused.
Tongue twitching:  The patient was found to have a twitching tongue on admission that was attributed to either old stroke or hypernatremia.
He had no further seizure activty off Keppra.
Depression: His remeron was stopped in setting of altered mental status.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
