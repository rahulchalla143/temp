She has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypertensive urgency with symptoms of headache and abdominal pain.
Has had extensive work-up for abdominal pain including ex-lap on [**2141-10-27**] which was negative.
Patient states that her headache and abdominal pain are similar in characteristics to her previous admission.
Patient denies any fever, chills, nightsweats, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stool, dysuria, hematuria, change in vision, hearing, weakness or numbness.
She morphine 4mg once for pain and 4mg Zofran for nausea.
Malignant hypertension - Baseline BPs 180's - 120's - History of hypertensive crisis with seizures - History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought due to the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, associated with LE paresis in [**2140**] that resolved 4.
Thrombocytopenia: - TTP (got plasmapheresisis) versus malignant HTN 5.
Anemia 8.
History of left eye enucleation [**2139-4-20**] for fungal infection  9.
History of vaginal bleeding [**2139**] lasting 2 months s/p DepoProvera injection requiring transfusion 10.
History of Coag negative Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-16**] and [**5-17**] 11.
Thrombotic microangiopathy: may be etiology of episodes of worse hypertension given appears quite labile .
S/P Ex-lap for free air in abdomen, ex-lap normal [**2141-10-27**]   Social History: Single and lives with her mother and a brother.
Abd: normal bowel sounds, midline scar well-healed, soft, nontender, prior PD site with dry dressing, patient with tenderness to palpation over prior PD cath site, no guarding/rebound Ext: no edema, no clubbing, WWP.
A possible secundum type atrial septal defect is seen by color Doppler (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
There is no significant resting LVOT gradient, but a mild gradient (30mmHg peak) is seen with Valsalva manuever.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional/global systolic function and mild inducible LVOT gradient.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Possible secundum type atrial septal defect.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-10-19**], a possible secundum type atrial septal defect is now suggested.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study with saline contrast and/or a TEE would be better able to characterize the possible atrial septal defect.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Cardiomegaly with findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar linear opacities suggesting atelectasis, although developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
[**12-20**] MRV IMPRESSION: No appreciable change since the MRV chest exam dated [**2141-5-30**].
Again seen is occlusion of the right internal jugular and left brachiocephalic veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 24 year old Female with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with abdominal pain and headache consistent with her usual hypertensive urgency and was found to be in hypertensive urgency in ED.
Her BP remained elevated so she was switched to nicardipine 1mg/kg/min.
While on the floor the patient had question of angioedema and markedly elevated BP.
Patient's Aliskerin was also held for conern for angioedema.
The renal team removed her tunneled dialysis catheter that had a cuff out, and replaced it with a temporary femoral line.
Hypertension persisted throughout the morning with BPs 210s-240s systolic.
Due to persistent hypertension, she was transferred to the ICU for further care.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reported severe abdominal pain over the site of recently removed PD catheter.
She reports bilateral calf cramping but no leg swelling.
She denies any difficulty breathing or chest pain.
Angioedema: On [**12-20**] the patietn developed facial swelling and evidence of angioedema by ENT.
She denied difficulty with her breathing at that time, but was very somnulent.
The patient underwent MRV that showed no progression of her clot.
She continued to have abdominal pain post-op.
She continuned to complain of abdominal pain throughout her admission and continued to requested IV dilaudid.
She had dialysis on [**12-19**].
The patient also had her PD catheter removed on [**12-21**] secondary to chronic abdominal pain.
The patient was scheduled to have dialysis on [**12-23**].
Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Her coumadin was held during last admission for supratherapeutic INR.
There was no evidence of active, acute bleeding.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosis: Rheumatology was consulted and does not suspect acute flare and dsDNA, C3, C4 nl, ESR and CRP slightly elevated.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Hypertensive urgency 2) Abdominal pain 3) End stage renal disease on hemodialysis 4) Venous thromboembolism   Discharge Condition: Signed out AMA   Discharge Instructions: Pt signed out AMA  Return to the hospital with any concerning symptoms.
Be sure to call your doctor's office on [**Month/Day/Year 766**] to arrange hemodialysis and review your medications and discuss follow-up plan.
