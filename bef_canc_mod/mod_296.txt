Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 137  113  34  164 - - - - - - gluc 164 5.1  15  1.9 Ca: 8.9 Mg: 2.2 P: 3.6  WBC 12.4  HCT 43.8  PLT 291 N:73.0 L:17.1 M:3.4 E:6.1 Bas:0.4  PT: 14.2  PTT: 28.6  INR: 1.3  Radiology: CT head - There is some motion artifact on the examination.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Hypodensities in the subcortical white matter as described on the earlier studies are unchanged as are hypodensities in the basal ganglia.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears to still be preserved with no new clear area of acute infarction.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is an acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory with focal areas of restricted diffusion seen peripherally in the left MCA distribution near the cranial vertex.
Additionally, there is a more wedge-shaped area of restricted diffusion in the far posterior left parietal lobe.
There is some increased FLAIR signal intensity corresponding to areas of restricted diffusion.
No obvious susceptibility artifacts are identified to suggest hemorrhagic transformation.
However, there is circumferential mucosal thickening, mild in the right and moderate in the left maxillary sinuses.
There is also a small amount of fluid seen in the sphenoid sinus.
MR ANGIOGRAM: There is irregularity and thickening seen of the extracranial left internal carotid artery at the skull base with narrowing of signal intensity in the center of the artery.
Evaluation for aneurysm is not possible due to the motion artifact.
Acute infarction of left middle cerebral artery territory as described above.
Given the multifocal, non-confluent areas of restricted diffusion, this suggests an embolic event.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] irregularity and thickening of the extracranial left internal carotid artery at the skull base.
There is signal intensity seen throughout the intracranial arterial circulation suggesting no significant stenosis.
Carotid u/s: No evidence of carotid stenosis bilaterally.
Repeat HCT [**10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of probable old infarcts in the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and pons as described.
HCT [**10-22**]: Increased hypodensity along the left frontal and parietal regions, consistent with the evolving left MCA stroke.
New approximately 1.6 x 0.9 cm hyperdensity is seen within the subcortical region of the left parietal lobe, consistent with blood.
This could represent petechial hemorrhage, although developing hematoma cannot be excluded.
HCT [**10-23**]: Hypodensity involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter in the left frontal and parietal lobes, consistent with infarction is again demonstrated, not significantly changed compared to the previous study.
Focal area of hyperdensity in the left superior parietal lobe is also unchanged, consistent with blood products.
There is no subfalcine herniation, and negigible compression of the left lateral ventricle.
Opacification in the frontal sinus, ethmoid sinuses, maxillary sinuses, and sphenoid sinus is again demonstrated, most evident in the left maxillary sinus, with some loss of ethmoid septae- has there been prior sinus surgery?
ECHO: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
?A possible new distal septal wall motion abnormality may be present.
MRA: There is an area of suspected high-grade stenosis at the distal left internal carotid artery, as it enters the petrous segment.
CTA of head:  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 69yo man w/ PMH significant for breast cancer, renal cell ca, and hepatocellular ca who p/w acute onset difficulty speaking and RUE weakness.
The most likely etiology of these symptoms was an embloic stroke in the left superior division MCA territory.
On arrival within the 3hr IV tPA window, he had a head CT showing no evidence of hemorrhage.
Within one hour of the tPA he seemed to improve, with better language function (able to string short sentences together, approx 7 words long) and improved right arm strength (could hold the arm off the bed and provide some resistance to testing, with persistent hand and wrist weakness).
He went for MRI which showed evidence of a left MCA stroke consistent with embolic etiology.
MRA of the brain had a questionable thickening in the left carotid, and this was repeated later in his hospital course.
He went immediately to carotid u/s for further evaluation, which showed no stenosis.
A head CT showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
He had no hypotension.
His repeat head CT the next day showed a small focus of hemorrhage, but he began to improve.
An ECHO showed no evidence of PFO, ASD, or thrombus, but did demonstrate a new area of hypokinesis.
This was followed up with a CTA, which showed significant ICA stenosis.
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 100 unit/mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1100 (1100) units/hour Intravenous  ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): Continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-70 until therapeutic INR on coumadin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke  Hepatocellular carcinoma s/p hepatic lobectomy, renal cell cancer s/p right nehprectomy, breast cancer s/p mastectomy, s/p colon resection for diverticulosis, TIA   Discharge Condition: Improved - has some trouble with comprehension, continues to have word finding difficulties, right arm weakness.
Please return to the emergency department for worsening symptoms or new numbness/tingling/weakness.
