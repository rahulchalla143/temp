Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Post-pyloric tube placement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] is a 68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis C/ cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a history of CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting in [**1-/2118**], HTN, GERD, DM type 2, dementia, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 111043**] for fever and hypoxia felt [**1-31**] RLL pneumonia and treated with Flagyl, Vancomycin and Levofloxacin empirically, now presenting with recurrent fever, hypoxia and mental status changes for 1 day.
Per rehab reports, on [**2120-1-10**], patient developed a fever (to 102), hypoxia (91% on 2L) and lethargy ("stopped speaking").
A CXR revealed persistent bilateral pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis versus infiltrate.
However, while in the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] developed increasing respiratory distress and was intubated for increased work of breathing.
Hepatitis C/cirrhosis /HCC, status post cadaveric liver transplant in [**2118-4-28**] 2.
Coronary artery disease, status post RCA and LAD stenting 3.
Hypertension 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 6.
Dementia  Social History: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 111044**] recently moved to a NH ([**2119-1-29**]) secondary to his progressive dementia.
No h/o IVDU or blood transfusion prior to [**2104**].
No murmur or rub.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
EXT: 3+ pitting edema bilaterally to hips.
In ED, patient subsequently developed increased work of breathing and was intubated, although a repeat blood gas was essentially unchanged.
There are stable emphysematous changes bilaterally, and stable prominence of the interstitial markings and upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution.
Moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly increased.
No pneumothorax.
Persistent opacity at the right base is suggestive of compressive atelectasis versus consolidation within the right lower lobe.
IMPRESSION: Increased right pleural effusion.
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis versus consolidation at the right lower lobe.
Stable pulmonary congestion and emphysematous change.
No ascites was demonstrated.
No attempted paracentesis or marking of spot was made.
There is mild pulmonary edema.
Bilateral effusions are present along with atelectasis at both lung bases that appear unchanged when compared to the prior examination.
No osseous abnormalities are seen.
No pneumothorax is identified.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
A right diaphragmatic contour is obliterated and a density along the lateral wall is suggestive of pleural effusion layering mostly posteriorly.
There is no conclusive evidence for any parenchymal infiltrate.
In answer to specific question of free abdominal air, there is no conclusive evidence of such finding, but this cannot be completely eliminated as the patient is in semierect position only.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis C/cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a h/o CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting, dementia and recent admission for pneumonia, now presenting with a 1-day history of fever, hypoxia and mental status changes.
1) Fever: A CXR on admission was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate (atelectasis versus pneumonia), and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Flagyl and Ceftazidime pending culture data.
In light of these results, Vancomycin was D/C'd on [**2120-1-11**], and Cipro was added for double gram negative coverage pending final organism identification and sensitivites.
Sensitivities revealed Klebsiella resistant to Cephalosporins, and sensitive to Imipenem.
The sputum culture eventually grew Klebsiella with the same sensitivities as in the urine, and Cipro was D/C'd on [**2120-1-15**].
2) Respiratory failure: His initial respiratory failure was felt most likely secondary to pneumonia +/- chemical pneumonitis in the setting of a depressed mental status.
A CXR on [**2120-1-11**] was consistent with mild CHF, and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was gently diuresed while on the floor with Lasix 20 mg IV prn with goal negative 500cc/day, with good response.
Both Metoprolol and Captopril were titrated up, with improved blood pressure control, although systolic blood pressure remains elevated at discharge (130-160).
No acute issues while in hospital.
6) DM type 2: While in hospital, Avandia was held and patient was kept on a regular insulin sliding scale, with fair glycemic control.
7) Dementia: Patient admitted with acute on chronic mental status change, likely in the setting of his acute infection.
At baseline, he is minimally verbally responsive, but certainly interactive.
8) FEN: While in the ICU, a bedside swallowing evaluation and video swallowing revealed aspiration with thin liquids but adequate swallowing with pureed foods/nectar-thick liquids consistency.
A caloric count was performed while in hospital, which revealed sub-optimal caloric intake.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Four (4) Puff Inhalation Q1-2H () as needed for wheezing.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 29393**] - [**Location (un) 2251**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Right lower lobe pneumonia Hypertension Coronary artery disease status post RCA and LAD stenting Status post cadaveric liver transplant in [**2118-1-29**] Diabetes mellitus type 2 Dementia  Discharge Condition: Patient discharged to nursing home in fair condition.
Patient should return to the ED if recurrent fever, N/V, increasing oxygen requirements or mental status change.
