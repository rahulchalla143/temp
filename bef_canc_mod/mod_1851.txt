Patient reports four days prior to admission she began to feel fatigued and a decreased appetite.
Two days prior to admission, she reports black stools after hemodialysis (3-4 episodes) as well as three episodes of vomiting with a small amount of dark-red blood.
On the day of admission, patient had a recurrence of black, tarry stools and immediately went to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Patient did not report hematemesis on the day of admission.
She denied a history of NSAIDS, EtOH, previous GI bleeding, and she has never had an EGD or c-scope.
ROS was positive for mild peri-umbilical abdominal pain, mild dysphagia to pills in last several months-weeks, increasing fatigue recently, and depression.
Oxygen saturation dropped post-procedure and patient was hyperventilating, CXR revealed left left lower lobe collapse.
Hypertension 4.
Depression 5. s/p rheumatic fever in childhood 6. h/o seizure in [**5-26**] [**2-21**] HTN per pt, has not been on anti-seizure meds in many months (without further seizures).
- Many aunts/uncles with cancer.
- No family h/o renal problems.
Physical Exam: VITALS: T 98.4, HR 98, BP 178/80 99 100%RA GENERAL: Awake, alert, oriented x3 with flat affect in moderate distress complaining of headache.
Moderate aeration.
Decreased breath sounds on lower lung fields.
ABDOMEN: Normal bowel sounds, slightly hard abdominal muscles, no distension, no tenderness, scar from prior transplant on right.
RECTAL: Guaiac positive stool in ED.
No peripheral edema.
IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-2-27**] 6:48 PM The mediastinum is shifted to the left, which in combination with new left retrocardiac opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse.
Also partial collapse of the left upper lobe is present obscuring the aortic arch.
There is interval improvement of pulmonary edema and decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-7-31**] no change.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-2-28**] 3:55 AM  REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with left lower lobe bronchus impaction.
The mediastinum currently is positioned more centrally with partial but significant improvement of left lower lobe collapse.
Still present left retrocardiac opacities consistent with partial atelectasis as well as there is opacity in the left upper lobe consistent with non-resolving atelectasis.
There is no appreciable failure.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: 60-year-old female with a h/o ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy, HD-dependent, anemia, and hypertension presenting from the MICU with upper GI bleed [**2-21**] bleeding duodenal ulcer s/p clipping and cauterization.
# Upper GI bleed [**2-21**] bleeding ulcer: Patient presented with both melena and intermittent hematemesis x2 days consistent with a clinical picture of an upper GI bleed.
EGD was revealing for esophagitis, non-bleeding gastric ulcer, and a large bleeding vessel in the duodenal bulb, which was clipped and cauterized.
Several days into her hospital stay, the patient had gastroccult-positive emesis x1 episode.
She then tolerated her renal diet well and did not have any more vomiting episodes.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had a hematocrit of 16.7 at admission, [**2-21**] UGIB.
# ESRD - Patient has a h/o IgA nephropathy in [**2169**], and a renal transplant in [**2173**].
# Depression - Per patient, she reported depression to MICU and to medicine team.
She states that since the beginning of HD in [**2193**], she's noticed worsening mood over recent months.
She denies homicidal ideations.
She was treated with anti-depressants in the past but they caused restless leg syndrome.
Psychiatry reported patient does have chronic depression with passive suicidal ideation.
# HTN - At home patient is on labetalol 200mg QID and lisinopril 40mg daily to control her elevated blood pressure.
She reports a h/o seizures in the past due to severe hypertension.
However, after her first inpatient hemodialysis and upon transfer to the floor, her blood pressure rose dramatically (SBPs 180-190s) and she was given 10mg IV hydralazine to a minimum effect, she also reported a severe headache and nausea.
Labetalol 200mg QID was re-started with a stable hematocrit at 27.5, and her symptoms resolved and blood pressure dropped to SBPs 140s.
Lisinopril was also restarted and only had a minimum effect on the blood pressure.
No hearing or visual disturbances, but they are associated with nausea.
Since arrival to the floor, she had several severe headaches that woke her up.
However, there were other headaches that were not associated with acute elevations in BP or hemodialysis treatments.
She was managed with morphine for pain control.
# Left lower lobe lung collapse: After patient had EGD procedure in the MICU, her oxygen saturation dropped and she began to hyperventilate.
Patient has a scheduled endoscopy within the next 8 weeks for the follow-up of the ulcers and this could also be addressed at this point.
