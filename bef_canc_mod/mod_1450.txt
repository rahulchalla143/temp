The patient reports approximately one month of increased chronic abdominal pain.
He denies any nausea or vomiting.
He has chronic anorexia and reports he has been not eating much of anything except clears over the past weeks.
[**First Name (STitle) **] who has attempted trials of increasing his PPI and dronabinol without much effect.
Not much nausea nd no vomiting.
He does endorse a productive cough over the past week with green sputum but no fevers or dyspnea.
No chest pain.
His vital signs were stable there but labs were notable for a lactate of 6 and lipase of >900.
He had no signs of organ hypoperfusion, however, so he was sent here after being seen by surgery there given his complexity and plan for an ERCP tomorrow for reassessment of a metallic stent in place.
He received 50 mg of prednisone for presumption of need for abdominal imaging.
Currently, he reports abdominal pain is [**8-10**] severity.
He denies other complaints.

There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Heterogeneous and edematous appearance of the pancreatic head with multiple calcifications is highly suggestive of acute on chronic pancreatitis.
A neoplastic process is less likely given that the pancreatic duct is not dilated.
Pneumobilia and gallbladder gas might be related to common bile duct stent.
Mild left intrahepatic duct dilation, which is unchanged from previous ultrasound.
Biliary stent in situ within the distal CBD which limits evaluation of the CBD.
Diffusely enlarged pancreatic head and uncinate process with multiple small phlegmonous areas which are increased in size from previous CT.
Findings in keeping with known pancreatitis.
Significant duodenal wall thickening with luminal narrowing.
3.7-cm partially necrotic portacaval lymph node with other notable retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
There is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old man with history of chronic pancreatitis and necrotic pancreatitis presenting with increased abdominal pain, anorexia with malnutrition, weight loss and failure to thrive.
He also recently began drinking again and developed acute on chronic pancreatitis.
# Acute on chronic pancreatitis: Patient had abdominal pain and significant anorexia with a lipase >900 in the context of chronic pancreatitis most consistent with acute pancreatitis.
[**Last Name (un) **] score was [**1-2**] indicating low risk of mortality at this time and appropriate for initial admission to floor.
Bili is negligible and strongly suspect that etiology of recurrence of acute pancreatitis is continued alcohol abuse.
Pt received antibiotics at OSH but no clear source of infection and these were stopped.
MRCP showed some areas of phelgmonous changes consistent with known pancreatitis.
There was significant duodenal wall thickening with luminal narrowing but not obstruction.
His pain was managed with oxycodone which he required q 3 hours.
The patient was also evalauted for malabsorption with fecal elastase and fecal fat which were both unremarkable.
# Malnutrition, severe with anorexia; The patient's malnutrition was likely multifactorial [**2-2**] anorexia due to continued pancreatitis, alcoholism and depression.
Nutrition was consulted, and gave recommendations about starting D5W at 50 cc/hr given concern patient at risk for re-feeding syndrome.
GI did not recommend PICC placement for TPN, and also did not feel that starting tube feeds again was warranted.
He had a GJ tube placed in the past and had complications from it, but as he was not a good candidate for TPN (given psych and substance abuse history and risk of line infection), and as nutrition is ideally given enterically in pancreatitis, we felt the benefit far outweighed the risks and he [**Known lastname 1834**] IR guided J Tube placement on [**4-23**].
During his hospitalization he did advance his diet to solids but he had persistent pain, so it was restarted on clears and then advanced to clears.
# Hypotension - After transfer to the floor, the patient had an episode of hypotension 64/40 on [**4-15**] that responded to IVF.
He was started on meropenem for coverage of pacnreatic necrosis and biliary flora.
Due to increasing benzo requirements, he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
There is are extensive patterns of difficulties with confrontation and manipulative behaviors (including with the pt's AA sponsor).
The patient himself is highly dependent and still lives at his parents house - relying on quick fixes to relieve any anxiety/depression.
# Depression Patient was evaluted by psychiatry who recommended medical/alcohol rehab, continuing citalopram and minimizing benzos.
# Diabetes Mellitus: pt was placed on insulin sliding scale and started on lantus as his AM sugars were consistently elevated.
# Transitional issues -follow up blood cultures, fecal fat and elastase -J tube placed  Medications on Admission: citalopram 10 mg  PO daily dronabinol 2.5 mg by mouth twice a day Lipase-Protease-Amylase 5,000 unit-[**Unit Number **],000 unit-[**Unit Number **],000 unit Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
