Flexible sigmoidoscopy   History of Present Illness: 45yoM with EtOH cirrhosis (h/o variceal bleeding, ascites, SBP), DM2, who presented to his PCP with bright red bloody diarrhea starting 4am this morning with 4-5 episodes since.
Last night felt subjectively "warm" but no recorded fever, no vomiting or abdominal pain, but feels weak and fatigued.
He had gross blood on rectal exam, but he had clear NG lavage.
BUN 35 and Cr 1.2 is slightly above baseline.
Coagulopathy within baseline.
Pt's blood pressures trended down to 90/40 just before transfer, put pt mentating well, no CVL was placed but pt has 3 PIV (16g and 18g x2).
Of note, pt was admitted in [**5-/2142**] for first Dx of SBP complicated by variceal bleeding with banding x3 and EtOH hepatitis.
He also had strep viridans bacteremia with negative TEE and completed 14d Vancomycin.
He was then admitted early [**6-/2142**] for RUQ pain and fevers, had inconclusive U/S, no diagnostic para due to paucity of fluid, pt thought to be poor surgical chole candidate so managed medically, no other source of fevers found, and symptoms improved by discharge.
ROS: As above, otherwise with RUQ pain just started today from people mashing on his abdomen, and increased confusion for [**3-15**] wks noted as transposing numbers, trouble answering questions in the ED.
Otherwise no SOB, CP, palpitations, no increase in his BLE edema, no urinary problems.

[**2142-7-20**] flex sig: Solid yellow-brown stools noted in the transverse colon.
No stigmata of bleeding noted.
Patchy erythema in the rectum compatible with colopathy.
No evidence of retro- or intraperitoneal bleed.
Findings of hepatic cirrhosis with a moderate amount of low-attenuation abdominal and pelvic ascites, splenomegaly and varices.
Marked splenomegaly and mild to moderate ascites.
Gallbladder sludge and cholelithiasis similar to prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo male with h/o EtOH cirrhosis (h/o variceal bleeds, ascites, and SBP) and DM2 who presents with 1 day of bright red blood per rectum and found to have nonbleeding esophageal ulcer, grade [**2-11**] esophageal varices, and colopathy.
# GI bleed:  Patient with known esophageal varices and rectal varices as well as prior admissions for variceal bleeds presented with BRBPR x1 day.
He initially had BP's at baseline in the 110's but BP's decreased to the 90's in the ED.
NG lavage was negative and he had a grossly positive rectal exam in ED.
CT abdomen showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued and the patient was continued on his home Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
The patient underwent an EGD and sigmoidoscopy which showed no active bleed, but was significant for a small esophageal ulcer and distal grade I-II esophageal varices, gastric antral vascular ectasia, evidence of hypertensive gastropathy, and patchy rectal erythema consistent with colopathy.
He continued to have small amounts of BRBPR in the MICU with a stable hct and stable BP's, and he was re-started on his home Nadolol, Lasix, and PPI [**Hospital1 **] with discontinuation of the PPI drip.
He continued to have blood coating his stools but this slowed down prior to discharge.
His bleeding was likely a result of colopathy.
A pleural effusion was noted on exam thought to be hepatic hydrothorax without evidence of fever or cough.
Diuretics were initially held given hypotension but restarted prior to discharge.
# Macrocytic Anemia: Secondary to GIB but now back at baseline, likely secondary to bone marrow suppression from EtOH toxicity and slow bleeding from colopathy.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Bright red blood per rectum, Esophageal varices, Esophageal ulcer, Colopathy Secondary Diagnosis: Alcoholic Cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
An EGD was done which revealed nonbleeding esophageal varices which are varicose veins in the esophageal lining.
In addition, there was a nonbleeding ulcer in the esophagus.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed varicose veins in the rectum but no source of active bleeding either.
