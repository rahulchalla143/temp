Colonoscopy at that time showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
EGD showed no bleed.
Over last week she has had difficulty with HD due to a clot in her tunneled line.
Her husband notes increased lethargy and disturbance with sleep-wake cycle.
Got levofloxacin for aymptomatic bactiuria in ESRD patient.

There has been interval removal of a left subclavian vascular catheter.
A preexisting right subclavian catheter is unchanged in position, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is otherwise no significant change since the recent radiograph of several hours earlier.
[**3-8**]: TAgged RBC scan: No abnormal areas of tracer uptake.
[**3-11**]: Head CT: There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There are multiple areas of periventricular white matter hypodensity that may represent chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There are air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus.
There is slight mucosal thickening of left maxillary sinus .
Tracer is seen within the hepatic flexure and extending antegrade into the transverse colon, and descending colon with an appearance consistent with active bleeding at this site.
No focal, lateralized, or discharging abnormalities were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Possibly abnormal due to the excessively drowsy record obtained which, in the absence of medication or sleep deprivation, might indicate an early encephalopathy.
No definitive discharging abnormalities were seen, however.
[**2175-3-15**]: Angiography - Abdominal: IMPRESSION: Nonselective aortogram, selective gastroduodenal arteriography, selective arteriography via the third order branches of the SMA and second order branch into the ileocolic artery demonstrated no active bleeding.
No intervention was performed.
No blood was seen in the cecum.
The clot was washed off with active oozing seen from likely an angioectasia or Dieulafoy's.
2 1 cc Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Petechial-like lesions were noted in the cecum and hepatic flexure.
TPA was instilled without effect and the patient underwent dialysis catheter change.
The patient had a history of multiple pior admission for GI Bleed.
She began to have guaiac positive dark stool in the ICU.
She underwent tagged RBC scan from [**3-14**], which showed possible R hepatic flexure diverticuli.
The patient was hesistant to undergo any further procedures for several days.
General surgery was consulted and felt that the pt was a poor surgical candidate.
She had cauterization and capping of bleeding vessel.
In the ICU she ruled in for an NSTEMI by elevated CK/MB and tropT, likely [**1-26**] stress from GI bleed.
Serial EKG showed no changes.
Her ICU course was also complicated by ICU delirium with a nl EEG, TSH, B12, and folate.
She also had a seizure (episode of laterally deviated eyes and tense muscles while returning from HD, attributed to lowered seizure threshold with combination of meropenem and haldol.
She was incidentally found to have 50% stenosis of SVC.
She has no signs or symptoms at this time.
For prophylaxis the patient received PPI, venodyne boot, and her home synthroid and paxil.

Please tell the physicians there or contact your primary care physician if you experience blood from your rectum, black tarry stools, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats or other concerns.
