Family History: Father had IDDM and HTN, brother with DM, HTN.
However, there is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 58M with a history of pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple procedure and chemo, biliary cirrhosis requiring repeat paracentesis, and DM presented with AMS [**1-27**] hypoglycemia.
# Hypotension: Initially on dopamine 5mcg/kg/min with SBP 80s, MAPs>60.
?s liver disease and ascites and rapid repletion of Na, we attempted to avoid IVF boluses to maintain BP.
We could not r/o sepsis as being cause of hypotension especially since pt had leukocytosis.
At risk for SBP and had been refusing cipro PPX at home.
# Hypoglycemia: Altered mental status most likely due to hypoglycemia due to decreased PO intake for the week prior to admission with initial FSBG of 22.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Given BUN and Cr ratio and comparing to past records, this acute renal dysfunction was most likely pre-renal secondary to decreased PO intake.
Chronic renal failure could be related to DM and ESLD.
# Biliary Cirrhosis with ESLD: Patient initially was at [**Hospital1 18**] for paracentesis.
We treated empirically for SBP as above.
We treated with patient's pain with Dilaudid IV gtt and titrated as needed to best treat his pain.
