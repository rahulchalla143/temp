Admission Date:  [**2126-6-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-6-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-5-26**]     Sex:  M  Service:  NEUROMEDIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old man with history of hemophilia A, transfusion related HIV, hepatitis B and C, and recent left frontal subdural hematoma in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year who presented to the Emergency Room on the day of admission after having had increasing headache over the prior few days.
When he awoke on the morning of admission, however, the headache was more severe and localized over the left temporal parietal region and accompanied by mild nausea.
He was then sent to the Emergency Department for a STAT head CT in order to rule out an acute subdural hematoma.
Patient has been off his antiretroviral therapy because of severe side effects for the past several weeks by patient choice.
Transfusion related hepatitis B and C infection.
Acute left frontal subdural hematoma in [**2126-3-31**] with a history of presentation similar to the current one.
MEDICATIONS:  Factor 8 prn, given particularly with increased physical activity or other signs of bleeding, Bactrim double strength 1/2 tablet po q.d.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for hemophilia.
The patient was a middle-aged man in no acute distress.
There were no carotid bruits.
There was a soft ejection soft systolic murmur best heard along the left upper sternal border.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
The right pupil was slightly oval in shape, but both were reactive and there was no afferent pupillary defect.
There was no pronator drift and rapid fine finger movements were normal.
Elementary and cortical sensation were normal apart from decreased vibration sense in the left foot.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's STAT head CT revealed a small subdural hematoma over the left parietal lobe.
There was minimal mass effect with effacement of adjacent sulci but no shift of midline structures.
There was small residua of the recent left frontal subdural hematoma.
12 hour factor 8 infusion per his hematologist's recommendation and neurologic observation.
An Infectious Disease consult was obtained because of concern for the possibility of a central nervous system infection being responsible for the recurrence of the subdural hematoma within a short time.
The Infectious Disease Team felt that although he was at increased risk for central nervous system infections because there was compromised immune status, one would inspect intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage from central nervous system infection and that a subdural hemorrhage would not be expected to re-bleed due to a parenchymal abnormality.
They felt that a dural process was possibly responsible, although he had no meningeal signs.
A central nervous system vascular study was recommended in order to rule out a vascular malformation as a cause.
Since the patient had not had significant head trauma prior to either of the two recent subdural hematomas, the cause was puzzling.
The headache improved slowly over the days of hospitalization and a follow-up CT scan showed reduction in size of the left parietal subdural hematoma.
He was also to have a follow-up MRI and MRA of the head within four weeks of discharge to rule out an underlying vascular lesion assuming that his intracerebral blood collections had resolved by that time.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute left parietal subdural hematoma.
