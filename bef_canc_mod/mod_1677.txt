Male with a past medical history of medically-managed CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2179**], CVA, severe aortic stenosis seen on cath [**7-22**]  presenting to the ED with marked respiratory distress.
When EMS arrived on scene he was noted to be in profound respiratory distress but was able to talk to the paramedics.
He was intubated emergently in the field and given nitropaste for his hypertension.
Diffuse pulmonary opacities raise concern for pulmonary edema though a superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
His CBC was notable for a leukocytosis 12.5, Hct 35.1.
CT Head showed no acute process.
Of note, he was apparently scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10121**] in the AM for AVR for his history of Aortic stenosis.
CARDIAC HISTORY: CAd s/p 2 MIs - CABG: - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: - PACING/ICD: 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - CVA [**2195**] without residual deficits - Gastric Ca s/p Bilroth II ([**2177**]) - Recurrent hyperplastic polyps w/ high grade dysplasia - HTN - BPH  Social History: Per prior d/c summary.
No alcohol, or illicit drug use.
HEENT: Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Diffuse ronchi and wheeze bilaterally.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2201-1-15**]: IMPRESSION: Decreased bilateral pulmonary edema with resultant right greater than left small pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2201-1-20**]: IMPRESSION: Aspiration with all consistencies of barium despite head maneuvers.
MICRO: BLOOD CX [**2201-1-7**]: NO GROWTH BLOOD CX [**2201-1-8**]: NO GROWTH BLOOD CX [**2201-1-12**]: NO GROWTH .
Male with a past medical history of medically-managed CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2179**], CVA, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe/critical aortic stenosis presenting with hypertensive emergency, respiratory distress s/p intubation, pulmonary edema.
Aortic stenosis: Patient with critical-severe aortic stenosis noted in [**Month (only) 216**].
# CAD: Pt has history of CAD with prior cath in [**7-/2200**] showing 2 vessel disease, he was managed medically.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated in the field for altered mental status.
Respiratory distress likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
He had intermittent hypoxia, thought to be related to flash pulmonary edema when pt became hypertensive with agitation.
# Afib with RVR: In setting of flash pulmonary edema.
However, given recent GIB and history of gastric CA, he was not anticoagulated.
His delirium resolved somewhat and he is intermittantly alert and oriented.
He has had no further agitation.
Given that delerium waxes and wanes, would recommend low dose Haldol PO if needed for agitation.
# HTN: His BP was difficult to control when he became agitated, requiring nitro gtt initially.
His BP improved as his delirium and agitation improved.
# Hypernatremia: [**1-14**] hypovolemia and no po intake.
As noted below, pt had to be NPO for several days.
# Aspiration, failed swallow eval: Pt's voice was hoarse after extubation, and he repeatedly failed swallow evals, and eventual video swallow on [**1-15**].
Initial source was thought to be RP bleed from valvuloplasty or GI as he has a history of gastrict cancer.
Hcts remained stable after transfusions, however, CT scan was negative for RP bleed, but showed splenic infarct.
PF4 antbodies and iptic density density sent.
He had slight drop after surgery, but was without other s/s bleeding.
# Acute renal failure: Likely pre-renal/poor forward flow in setting of critical AS.
# Gout: Allopurinol held during admission given changing renal function.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7, CBC on sunday [**1-25**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Critical Aortic Stenosis s/p Valvuloplasty Hypertension Coronary Artery disease Hypernatremia Delerium Aspiration Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had severe aortic stenosis and required a valvuloplasty to open the stiffened artery.
This worked well and the aortic stenosis is better.
We adjusted your medicines to treat your fluid overload and help your heart work better.
You became delerious during your hospital stay and required some medicine to help your sleep.
We found that your swallowing is very weak and you are aspirating food and fluid into your lungs.
