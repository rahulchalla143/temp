Studies CT head [**12-24**] There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no cerebral edema or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute ischemic event.
Sulci and ventricles are prominent, likely age related involutional changes.
Mild confluent periventricular hypodensities, likely represent sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.
A focal hypodensity of in the right putamen (2:17), may represent a remote lacunar infarct or a prominent virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space.
Extensive intracranial and extracranial vascular calcifications are noted.
The remainder of paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
CT C-spine [**12-24**] There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease involving the cervical spine is most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with endplate sclerosis and intervertebral disc space narrowing.
There is posterior disc osteophyte complex formation at the corresponding levels with mild impingement on the thecal sac.
There is no critical central canal stenosis.
Imaged lung apices demonstrate thickening of interlobular septae compatible with intersitial edema.
Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.
Round density projecting over right maxillary sinus is partially imaged and likely represents a retention cyst.
No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, as described above.
In the setting of high clinical suspicion for ligamentous or cord injury, may consider MR for further assessment.
Instersitial edema in imaged lung apices.
There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema, which appears slightly worse in the interval.
Previously noted right pleural effusion and right basilar opacification has essentially resolved.
There is no pneumothorax or left-sided pleural effusion visualized.
A BB marker indicating the site of patient's tenderness is located adjacent to the sixth right lateral rib.
Irregularity of this rib is compatible with a remote fracture, as seen on the prior chest CT from [**2163-10-10**].
No acute fractures are visualized.
IMPRESSION: No acutely displaced rib fractures visualized, with remote right lateral sixth rib fracture.
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
Scrotal U/S The patient reports a longstanding history of swelling in the right hemiscrotum, which is also corroborated with a CT from [**2-28**], [**2163**], which shows right-sided hydrocele in the imaged portion of the scrotum.
There is marked enlargement of the scrotum on gross inspection, which corresponds to a 5.2 x 6.6 x 8.0 cm heterogeneously echoic collection without internal vascularity, which is consistent in appearance with a hematoma.
While on initial imaging, this appeared to be located in the left hemiscrotum, views obtained with a curved transducer showed that the hematoma is located in the right inferior hemiscrotum (image 75).
The right testis is slightly displaced by the right hemiscrotal hematoma and measures 3.6 x 1.6 x 5.4 cm.
The testis shows a homogeneous and symmetric echotexture without evidence of laceration.
The left testis, also displaced, measures 2.4 x 2.9 x 4.0 cm and shows a homogeneous echotexture with normal color flow and waveforms.
There is a trace left-sided hydrocele.
Vascular calcifications are noted bilaterally.
The marked scrotal enlargement correlates with a heterogeneously echoic hematoma located within the right hemiscrotum measuring 8 cm with no internal vascularity.
There is no evidence of testicular parenchymal abnormality, though both right and left testes are displaced by the hematoma.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of testicular torsion or vascular compromise.
Recommend followup imaging after resolution of symptoms to confirm resolution of the right testicular collection.
Complex right-sided hydrocele and trace left-sided hydrocele.
The complex right-sided component has been present since at least [**2163**].
CXR [**2165-12-26**] Mild to moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema has improved since [**2165-12-24**].
Mildly enlarged heart size is unchanged.
There are no discrete lung opacities concerning for an superadded or coexisting pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema has improved since [**2165-12-24**].
Mildly enlarged heart size is stable.
CT Abd/Pelvis/chest [**2165-12-26**] CT OF THE THORAX: There is diffuse alveolar consolidation involving all lobes, particularly the lower lobes as well as thickening of the interlobular septa.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes (2:25) that do not meet pathologic criteria.
Hilar lymphadenopathy cannot be assessed due to consolidation.
There is cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch.
A small hiatal hernia is again noted.
No focal liver lesions are identified on this non-contrast CT. Post-surgical clips from prior right adrenalectomy are noted.
The gallbladder is distended, likely due to fasting.
There are diffuse calcifications of the abdominal vasculature.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air or free fluid.
The small bowel is unremarkable.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is severe intervertebral disc space narrowing and endplate sclerosis at L3-L4.
There are no suspicious osseous lytic or blastic lesions.
Extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation and septal edema, consistent with pulmonary edema.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine at L3-L4.
No other CT findings to explain acute back pain.
Cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease.
CXR [**2166-1-3**]- Since [**2165-12-29**], mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lung atelectasis (left side more than right), have improved.
Mildly enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2165-12-29**], mild pulmonary edema, small effusions and left lower lung atelectasis have improved.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] (on mycophenolate, cyclosporine, prednisone immunosuppresion), failed pancreas [**Known lastname **], hypertension, admitted for injuries sustained after mechanical fall and dyspnea, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
# Hypoxia: History of chronic diastolic heart failure with recent exacerbations over the past several months, has been getting diuresed prior to transfer to the ICU but continued to be hypoxic on NRB.
Temporal association of increasing hypoxia s/p FFP tranfusion raises suspicion of fluid overload (transfusion association circulatory overload).
CXR consistent with fluid overload, but also could not rule out infectious process in patient that has underlying immunosuppression.
He did develop a fever in the MICU and CT torso showed multifactorial pneumonia and Right-sided effusion.
ECG showed atrial fibrillation with changes c/w old ECGs, however new T wave changes in V5/V6, so his cardiac enzymes were trended and remained flat.
He was -1.8L fluid after ICU stay with elevated JVD suggesting he was still volume up so he was continued on lasix at 80mg po BID per [**Month (only) **] recs.
# Acute on chronic [**Month (only) **] failure: s/p [**Month (only) **] [**Month (only) **] in [**2157**].
# Acute onset back pain: In setting of elevated INR w/ scrotal hematoma retroperitoneal bleed is possible, although INR was only midly elevated and his hematocrit has been stable.
This pain was different in nature and location from his pain s/p fall.
A CT torso was performed which showed no aortic pathology or RP bleed but did show a single non-displaced rib fracture.
His pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch and his hemotocrit remained stable.
# Atrial fibrillation: INR supratherapeutic.
Coumadin held and was reversed with FFP 4 units and vitamin K 5mg due to concern for RP bleed as above.
# Right scrotal hematoma: Secondary to fall and supratherapeutic INR.
Has been evaluated by Urology, no acute interventions needed during this admission.
# Adrenal insufficiency s/p right adrenalectomy in [**2163**]: Continued home regimen of fludricortisone.
Anemia secondary to kidney failure.
# Type I diabetes mellitus: Continued home glargine regimen and provided sliding scale insulin.
# Coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p stent of Ramus Intermedius in [**2156**]: Continued home aspirin and statin therapy.
Check ca/phos/PTH levels as outpt # Started renogel 800mg TID # Lasix increased to 60mg PO BID as outpt # Repeat testicular U/S once this acute episode resolves, to see if there is an underlying predisposition to bleeding, urology follow-up appointment scheduled  Medications on Admission: amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
