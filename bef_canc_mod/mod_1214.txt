MICRO: Blood Cx ([**7-2**]): Pseudomonas aeurginosa Urine Cx ([**7-2**]): no growth Stool Cx ([**7-2**]): no C. diff, Salmonella, Shigella, or Campylobacter Blood Cx ([**7-4**], [**7-5**], [**7-6**], [**7-7**]): no growth Stool Cx ([**7-6**]): no C. diff CMV viral load ([**7-8**]): not detected Stool Cx ([**7-8**]): no C. diff, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia .
LLL consolidation, worrisome for PNA with possible superimposed atelectasis.
Right pleural effusion and increased interstitial markings reflecting mild pulmonary edema.
Abdominal U/S ([**7-3**]): Minimal amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
The amount of fluid within the abdominal quadrants would be a high-risk procedure even for a diagnostic aspiration and we would recommend deferral of attempting sampling at this time.
PA&LAT CXR ([**7-3**]): Chronic bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities/atelectasis, possibly due to chronic aspiration.
Unchanged cirrhotic-appearing liver, without suspicious hepatic lesion or intrahepatic fluid collection to suggest abscess.
Contracted gallbladder related to recent meal.
Biliary sludge and stable cholelithiasis but no findings of acute cholecystitis.
Patchy opacity in the right lung base may represent aspiration or infection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, underlying infection not excluded.
Findings compatible with cirrhosis and portal HTN.
Wall edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis.
Mandible XR ([**7-9**]): Patchy osteopenia of the mandible.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS in [**2153**], which has been c/b encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, ascites, hydrothorax, and multiple infections, and septic right hip who presented to an outpatient appointment for reclast at which time she was was noted to be hypotensive and confused, and was sent to the ED.
# Sepsis: The pt presented with vomiting, hypotension, and altered mental status and was found to have 7.8 WBCs with 23% bands.
U/A was negative and urine culutures showed no growth.
A CXR revealed a LLL consolidation suspicious for PNA, however the pt denied respiratory symptoms and was not hypoxic.
An abdominal U/S revealed an unchanged cirrhotic-appearing liver, w/o evidence of abscess or ascites.
An abdominal CT revealed wall edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis.
Blood cultures came back positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however no source was identified.
Antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime to cover Pseudomonas and flagyl for potential GI source considering proctitis seen on CT. A PICC line was placed.
# ARF: On admission the pt was noted to have a Cr of 1.5 which was felt to be prerenal secondary to hypotension.
# Diarrhea: Pt reported several loose BMs prior to admission and experienced several days of watery diarrhea during this admission.
An abdominal CT revealed wall edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis, however this was felt to be unlikely to explain her watery diarrhea.
# Poor dentition: There was concern that her dentition may be a source of infection so dental x-rays were done and dentistry was consulted.
# HCV cirrhosis: S/p TIPS in [**2153**], has been c/b encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, ascites, hydrothorax, and multiple infections.
Continued home meds plus increased lasix to 120mg QD and increased spironolactone to 150mg QD.
# S/p hip fracture and ORIF in [**11-11**], c/b polymicrobial septic hip s/p washout [**6-/2158**], hardware removal [**9-12**], with wound vac in place at home.
