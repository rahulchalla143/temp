Admission Date:  [**2176-7-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2176-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently admitted from [**7-15**] to [**2176-7-19**] for presumed bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough, shortness of breath and fevers.
During his last admission two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.
He underwent bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial lesion, which was normal.
Sputum sample was done at that time showed no growth.
The plan was to treat him for one week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for pneumonia prophylaxis.
He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was due to low potassium.
He had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening cough and presented to the Emergency Department.
He denied any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.
Initially he was stable, but then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia, which resulted in his elective intubation.
Chest x-ray showed no focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.
The patient then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Stage three squamous cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2175-2-26**], status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**] treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy and carboplatin and Taxol.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Atrial fibrillation in the postoperative period.
History of prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2172-2-26**], status post radical proctectomy with penile prosthesis in [**2172-8-27**].
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
History of pulmonary embolus postoperative in [**2175-6-28**].
Myocardial infarction with a troponin of 4.1 in [**2175-6-28**].
Transient ischemic attack in [**2165**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Small pericardial effusion in [**2176-5-27**], which subsequently resolved.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary artery bypass graft.
His father also had coronary artery disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This was a gentleman who was intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli.
There were no bruits in the neck.
Occasional ectopic beats.
Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with transmitted breath sounds on the right.
Abdomen was soft and mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.
Skin showed no evidence of rashes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the hospital the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis versus atypical pneumonia.
Infectious disease:  The patient did not develop a focal infiltration throughout his hospitalization.
He remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay and his white blood cell count decreased daily.
He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.
White blood cell count returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.
Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus atypical pneumonia.
The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical therapy.
To manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily weights.
The patient responded to this well and felt overall that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.
Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.
Three sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of myocardial infarction.
He had a number of electrocardiograms that were checked to ensure that he did not have a significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not worse.
Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding scale.
The patient had been using Care Group Respiratory Services at home for pulmonary physical therapy and O2 assistance and so this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary treatments.
Possible atypical pneumonia.
