Renal US at [**Hospital 100**] rehab reportedly showed no obstruction.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to surgical service on [**2197-6-15**] - [**2197-6-19**] when she presented wtih Cr 1.8, fevers and underwent necrotic wound debridment.
While in the ED, the patient became hypotensive with SBP in 70-80.
Note from [**Hospital 15303**] rehab notes decreased output through stoma and decreased urine output.
-Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
-Lumbar scoliosis and spinal stenosis.
Currently at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility  Family History: Positive for CAD, diabetes, negative for inflammatory bowel disease, or colon cancer.

ECHO [**2197-5-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal thinning/akinesis of the distal  septum, apex, and distal anterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is prominent mitral annular calcification.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w coronary artery disease.
Minimal functional mitral stenosis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-12-1**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia (mid-distal LAD lesion).
The rhythm is now atrial fibrillation (previously sinus).
Brief Hospital Course: This 83 year old woman status post colectomy and end ileostomy for colon adenoma and UC on [**5-10**] c/b NSTEMI, presented with acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency and hypotension.
Her hypotension resolved with fluids and she was admitted to the MICU for further management.
It was believed renal failure was largely prerenal in origin, given her low FeNa.
Her hypotension was attributed firstly to poor PO intake and her usual antihypertensive medications.
# Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemia but could be component of sepsis given bacteremia - IVF, adequate hydration - follow urine output .
# Acute on Chronic renal failiure: Etiology not clear.
Pt appears to have pre-renal component, but elevation in Cr is out of proportion to what one would expect in pre-renal.
Renal US w/o obstruction.
# CAD/NSTEMI: - continue Plavix, statin - hold Imdur, B-blocker, digoxin .
