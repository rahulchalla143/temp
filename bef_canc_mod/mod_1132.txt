Pt states that the wound never completely healed after the staples were removed on [**4-9**] and then progressively enlarged w/ associated "yellowish/blood-tinged" fluid drainage.
LLE Femoral: P. Popiteal: P. DP: D. PT: P.  DESCRIPTION OF WOUND: R groin wound: opened along length of prior incision, + purulent drainage mainly from small cavity at distal/medial aspect of wound that probes ~2.5cm deep but without tracking elsewhere, no tenderness here but +TTP at proximal/lateral aspect of wound; no other overt areas of fluctuance, +surrounding erythema w/ fibrinous material within wound   Pertinent Results: [**2181-4-19**] CT angio chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site.
Normal appearance of the abdominal aorta and its major visceral branches.
Mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
[**2181-5-1**] RUQ U/S: No evidence of gallstones or bile duct dilatation.
[**2181-5-6**] CXR: There is a stent in the aorta.
There are low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort.
There are bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity as well as atelectasis at the lung bases.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2181-4-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
The patient is a 72 year old gentleman with a history of AVR and aortic aneurysm repair, L CFA-axillary bypass graft [**2174**] and R femoral to axillary bypass PFTE graft [**2181-3-27**] admitted with right groin wound dehiscence and S. anginosus and MSSA bacteremia with course c/b rupture of a mycotic aneurysm at his femoral graft site.
Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli.
CT angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass graft anastamosis with the femoral artery.
Widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site.
Although, no drainable fluid collections or abscesses are seen, this would be concerning for infection in the presence of clinical symptoms.
Normal appearance of the abdominal aorta and its major visceral branches.
Unchanged appearance of an isodense right lower pole renal lesion and multiple indeterminate left renal lesions since the earlier study.
He was taken to the OR after developing several small bleeds from his operative site concerning for herald bleeds from a ruptured aneurysm.
In the OR on [**4-24**] he was found to have fresh clotted blood at his femoral graft site with concern for a disrupted femoral anastomosis.
He was found to have inflammatory changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon at his rectus.
Patient remained intubated on return from OR  Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken back to the OR on [**4-25**] for exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision which was left open.
[**4-25**] - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision which was left open.
Patient remained intubated on return from OR  [**5-3**] - Abdominal closure with mesh.
On [**5-4**] patient had decreased urine output in setting of increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and muscle paralysis.
Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward.
Patient passed bedside swallow eval and was transition to oral nutrition.

The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
He waa dmitted on [**4-17**] with a wound dehiscence and fever.
[**2-26**] blood cultures drawn [**4-17**] grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on [**4-17**] and [**4-19**].
A wound swab of the right groin site has grown MSSA as well as mixed flora.
A CT Torso on [**4-19**] showed "a widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site."
The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for coverage of S. anginosus and MSSA BSI as well as a polymicrobial wound infection.
On day of discharge, pt's BUN/creat =65/2.6, thought to be likely due to dehydration.
