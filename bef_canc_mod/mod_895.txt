Admission Date:  [**2132-5-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-5-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-9-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 27 year old woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes, severe hyperemesis gravidarum this past year and a recent admission the week prior to admission for coffee ground emesis who at the time was found to have antral ulcer with a visible vessel that was successfully thermally treated and injected.
She now presents with recurrent coffee ground emesis.
The patient reports that she vomited one time the afternoon of admission which brought her in and she has continued to have around ten episodes of hematemesis.
She denies bright red blood per rectum and no tarry stools and no abdominal pain.
She has had three episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and her recent A1c is 7.2%.
Severe hyperemesis gravidarum requiring total parenteral nutrition.
Status post cesarean section in [**2132-2-24**], it was at 33 weeks secondary to hyperemesis.
History of gastric antral ulcer treated on [**5-13**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has no history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeds in the family.
There is diabetes in the family.
Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Heart was tachycardiac with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her lungs had pure inspiratory effort but clear to auscultation without wheezing.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Gastrointestinal bleed - It was felt that this patient had a likely gastrointestinal bleed from the same antral ulcer that was previously seen on the week prior to admission.
She was scoped which showed a bleeding ulcer in the antrum which successfully had hemostasis with epinephrine BICAP electrocautery with good cessation of bleeding.
She was stable for approximately 48 hours in the Intensive Care Unit and then her hematocrit fell again and she was sent back to esophagogastroduodenoscopy at which point this showed active bleeding from the antrum, prepyloric region with unsuccessful injection therapy.
There was successful embolization of the proximal gastroduodenal and an antral branch of the proper hepatic artery.
Unfortunately, at this point the patient's hematocrit continued to drift down and she had another endoscopy which showed a bleeding ulcer in the antrum that was again successfully electrocauterized with cessation of bleeding.
It was at this point that further studies from the heme workup of her elevated PTT came back and so she was treated initially with fresh frozen plasma and then activated Factor VII.
At the time of this dictation, the patient had no evidence for further bleeding and her hematocrit is stable in the high 30s.
Coagulopathy - The patient's PTT continued to rise over the course of her admission and a heme consult was obtained who recommended a mixing study.
She has not received any further Factor VII at the time of this dictation, and she has no evidence for active bleeding.
The patient was continued with her Lantus with the dose halved and three-quartered based upon NPO status.
Her fingersticks ranged from being within the normal range to being elevated when she started the steroids, however, this was controlled without complication with the sliding scale and Glargine.
Obviously the patient had been through many severe illnesses over the course of her pregnancy including hyperemesis gravidarum as well as the current gastrointestinal bleed.
