Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: Admit Labs WBC-4.7 RBC-3.81* Hgb-11.4* Hct-33.4* MCV-88 MCH-29.8 MCHC-34.0 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-193# Neuts-89.2* Lymphs-5.6* Monos-3.6 Eos-1.2 Baso-0.3 PT-12.9 PTT-39.2* INR(PT)-1.1 Glucose-117* UreaN-20 Creat-0.9 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-105 HCO3-23 AnGap-14 ALT-120* AST-83* AlkPhos-436* TotBili-1.3 Lipase-17 Calcium-7.4* Phos-2.8 Mg-1.5* Lactate-1.7 K-4.0  CRP-61.1*  CT LUMBAR SPINR ([**5-31**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Erosive endplate changes at the L4-5 level consistent with known chronic discitis.
Assessment for any acute foci of infection si limited.
No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Bilateral atelectasis, right greater than left, unchanged.
Multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are enlarged and measure up to 1 cm.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive in the detection of intrathecal abnormalitites and should be considered if there is concern for ongoing/ recurrent infection in the disk, vertebrae or spinal soft tissues.
No pathology identified to account for the patient's presentation.
Exam is unchanged from [**2146-2-23**], with unchanged dilatation of the extrahepatic common bile duct which is within normal limits for post- cholecystectomy.
No choledocholithiasis seen.
Left pleural effusion.
WBC SCAN ([**6-1**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute osteomyelitis, discitis or focal infection.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 47 yo F with recurrent admissions fot line associated bacterimia now presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors.
# Sepsis / Hypotension / Fevers - While the patient did have a downward-trending WBC on admission, her high fevers and hypotension requiring pressors made sepsis the likely cause of her symptoms.
Given her medical history, it was most likely that the source of her sepsis was a line infection.
Additionally, blood cultures from and outside hospital showed coag neg staph in multiple bottles.
A CT scan of the lumbar spine was performed and showed erosive changes at L4-5 that were consistent with known chronic discitis.
However, acute infection could not be completely ruled out.
Neurosurgery recommended getting a CRP and a tagged WBC scan, which showed no evidence of acute osteomyelitis, discitis or focal infection.
# Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia: ddx includes medication induced (although no major medications which are likely culprits) vs. sepsis (although time course seems unusual).
- will trend values and watch for clinical improvement.
# History of Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism - The patient was taken off of Coumadin in the past due to interactions with antibiotics and her history of frequent hospitalizations with antibiotic treatment.
# Pain control- pt has had chronic back pain and has been taking oxycodone and dilaudid in addition to having a fentanyl patch.
Pt continued to do well from a pain standpoint and was feeling relatively pain-free and using less dilaudid on [**6-7**].
However, on the night of the 14th, pt reported increased back pain that did not respond go 5mg oxycodone.
Oxycodone was increased to 10mg PRN on [**6-8**] and  pt reported increased relief with this dose.
