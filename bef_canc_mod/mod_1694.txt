Admission Date:  [**2154-6-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-7-5**]   Service:  MED-BLUMGA  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 -year-old male admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] with complaints of loose bowel movements, tea colored urine, and increasing lethargy and dehydration.
On addition to the Emergency [**Doctor First Name **], the patient was lethargic with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, dry mucous membranes, bradycardic on admission with a heart rate of 30 to 40, potassium of 6.2.
The patient was treated with one amp of D50, 5 units insulin, one amp of calcium gluconate, given Lasix for congestive heart failure verified by chest x-ray with poor response.
Atrial fibrillation, treated with Digoxin and on admission the level was 2.3.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the urine.
A massive left sided cerebrovascular accident on [**2154-4-30**], leaving the patient with left sided neglect and left hemiparesis.
The respiratory examination showed coarse breath sounds with rales in both bases.
The patient also had occasional wheezes noted bilaterally.
He continues with frequent periods of apnea, lasting 15 to 25 seconds, [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing pattern, and a question of a left lower lobe pneumonia on examination.
The heart rate was stable in the mid 70s, occasional bradycardic episodes with rates down to the 30s, occasional premature ventricular contractions rhythm, consistent also with atrial fibrillation.
The skin integrity showed an ulceration on the left lateral malleolus, the size of a nickel and with wet-to-dry dressings applied.
Numerous small broken areas were noted on the coccyx and Aloe Vesta Perineal cream was applied to that.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of acute renal failure with creatinine going from 0.5 to 3.6 with minimal urine output.
It should also be noted that on physical examination, the patient had bilateral hydroceles in the scrotum.
The patient was managed in the Intensive Care Unit on admission with intravenous fluid hydration and ciprofloxacin treatment from [**6-14**] through [**2154-6-23**], for a urinary tract infection.
His hospital course was significant for an increase in creatinine to a maximum of 7.3.
The differential diagnoses were thought to be acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis, possibly with minimal [**Last Name (un) **] disease.
Prednisone was begun at 60 mg q day on [**6-22**], to empirically treat possible acute interstitial nephritis.
The ciprofloxacin was discontinued secondary to the possible contribution of the acute interstitial nephritis.
The decision was made to initiate hemodialysis due to the worsening problems with the volume overload and electrolyte abnormalities in the patient.
A CT scan of the abdomen obtained to assess for hematoma showed a right thigh hematoma, apparently from the venous source.
There was no retroperitoneal bleed seen.
Arrangements were made for the transfer of the patient to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring of the bleed and respiratory status.
After being transferred to the Medical floor, the patient remained stable, except for a continued drop in hematocrit, such that the patient received a total of six units of packed red blood cells over the course of [**6-25**] through [**6-29**].
In addition, the patient responded well to hemodialysis, such that his mental status improved and a decrease in his global body edema was noted on physical examination.
The patient's condition continued to improve with hemodialysis as stated before, and the ulcer noted on admission on the left lateral malleolus continued to heal with appropriate granulation and no other bed sores were noted on the patient, thanks to appropriate nursing care.
The patient was also noted to have yeast in his urine on [**6-22**] and on [**6-28**], for which he was treated with Diflucan and he had no other infections.
In summary of his diagnostic procedures done during the course of his hospital stay, the patient's initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 65.
There was no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Second, there were small bilateral pleural effusions.
The ultrasound of the patient's scrotum on [**6-25**] showed bilateral hydroceles.
Chest x-ray done on [**6-26**] showed right sided hemodialysis catheter tip in the distal SVC as a Quinton catheter was placed in the anterior thorax and there was no pneumothorax after the procedure.
There was also decreased pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure compared with the admission x-ray and there was persistent left lower lobe collapse / consolidation.
And there was an unchanged level of bilateral pleural effusions.
A Doppler study of the right thigh to discover the extent of venous flow within the right leg, although grossly limited study as described in its longer report, there was no definite evidence of a deep vein thrombosis.
Right common femoral artery, superficial femoral popliteal veins were of a small caliber throughout, which they have been related to venous compression from adjacent soft tissue swelling or the hypovolemic state.
The microbiological studies for the patient in summary: the stool studies never showed any Clostridium difficile and the urine culture was positive for yeast.
Blood cultures have been consistently negative with the exception of a presumed contaminant of Staphylococcus epidermitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Urinary tract infections.
