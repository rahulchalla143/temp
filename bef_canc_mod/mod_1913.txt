He states he had been feeling ill for about one week with increasing difficulty breathing while at home.
Past Medical History: Stage III chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.1) Cystinuria with a history of heavy stone burden (on longstanding penicillamine until 3 yrs ago) Cutis laxa secondary to penicillamine [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (thought to be secondary to penicillamine) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF) Pulmonary hypertension Atrial flutter s/p AV node ablation (with postprocedure complete heart block requiring pacemaker placement) Pancreatic low grade, benign mucinous cystic neoplasm (LGBMC) Large bilateral renal cysts Small AAA Popliteal aneurysm hyperuricosuria restless leg syndrome GERD  Social History: Works as a software engineer.
Is married with no children.
CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g Lungs - Decreased BS bilat w/ mild rales throughout lung fields  Abd - soft, NT/ND.
Ext - no LE edema b/l  Pertinent Results: CXR - [**2198-1-7**]: There is a new airspace consolidation involving the left lung (mostly upper) consistent with pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR - [**2198-1-9**]:  A new airspace opacity has developed in the right lower lobe since the prior day.
However, there has been considerable improvement in left upper and medial left lower lobe opacities.
There are no effusions or pneumothorax.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Multiple cysts are seen within bilateral kidneys, the largest of which is located on the right and measures greater than 16 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for a h/o HTN, diastolic CHF, pulm HTN who initially presented from [**Hospital3 3765**] in respiratory distress w/ evidence of pneumonia on CXR along w/ pulm edema.
# Resp distress/pneumonia: The patient was originally admitted to the intensive care unit given his level of respiratory distress.
On admission, it was felt his shortness of breath was most likely due to pneumonia seen on CXR along w/ component of CHF especially given response to nitro gtt and Lasix while at [**Hospital3 **].
The patient also had AFib with RVR while in the intensive care unit, which was treated with IVF resuscitation.
The patient was also treated with CTX/azithro for a community acquired pneumonia.
He did not require intubation for his breathing, but initially did need a non-rebreather while in the unit.
He was maintained on nasal cannula while on the floor, with his oxygen requirement lessening each day, until he did not require oxygen while at rest.
He was discharged to complete a course of oral antibiotics to treat his community acquired pneumonia.
Pump: The patient has a h/o diastolic CHF.
He appeared to have component of failure contributing to resp status above given response to treatment of CHF which was likely contributed to by AFib w/ RVR.
His captopril was held throughout this admission given his acute on chronic renal failture.
Rhythm: Pt w/ h/o paroxysmal AFib and is not on coumadin due to problems w/ epistaxis.
He did have a slight troponin leak which was felt to be consistent with demand ischemia.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient had an elevated Cr to 3.4 from baseline 2.1 which was likely due to infection.
He appeared euvolemic with mild pulmonary edema.
# Restless leg: The patient was continued on his outpatient doses of Neurontin, Requip and oxycontin.
