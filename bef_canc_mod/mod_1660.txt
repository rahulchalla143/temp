Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
No ascites and no portal vein thrombus identified.
No focal liver lesion and no biliary dilatation seen.
Mild splenomegaly.
Splenic vein thrombosis with pancreatic pseudocyst is compatible with sequela of previous pancreatitis.
Extensive splenic and gastric varices without esophageal varices are likely secondary to splenic vein thrombosis.
No radiographic evidence of cirrhosis or acute pancreatitis.
Bilateral posterior lower lobe peribronchovascular nodules, compatible with small airway disease or aspiration.
Prostate nodule protruding into bladder may represent isolated hypertrophy of the middle lobe of the prostate.
Reduced filling of the gastric varices post-embolization.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2118-11-6**] 05:35AM BLOOD WBC-18.2* RBC-3.97* Hgb-11.3* Hct-34.0* MCV-86 MCH-28.6 MCHC-33.3 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-462* [**2118-11-4**] 05:06AM BLOOD PT-15.6* PTT-25.8 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2118-11-6**] 11:18AM BLOOD Na-130* K-4.2 Cl-95* [**2118-11-6**] 11:27AM URINE Hours-RANDOM Creat-154 Na-88 K-72 Cl-140  Brief Hospital Course: 62yo male w/ h/o HCV and EtOH abuse, recent dx of gastric varices with UGIB (10 weeks PTA), transferred from [**Hospital1 5979**] to our MICU with an upper GI bleed s/p 11 units, ultimately found to have a splenic vein thrombosis and received a splenic artery embolization on [**2118-11-4**] with a post-procedure course complicated by pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and low grade fevers.
# GI bleed: Secondary to splenic vein thrombosis, causing gastic varices.
Had a large BM with red blood and melena and was transfered back to the MICU where endoscopy was difficult secondary to his anatomy but did not reveal active bleeding.
# Splenic Vein Thrombosis - pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst c/b splenic vein thrombosis leading to gastric varices.
Surgery consulted but recommended embolization given pseudocyst and chronic pancreatitis.
Developed low grade temperatures on discharge.
He contracted for safety, to return if sick or febrile.
# Hyponatremia: Na 119 on admission, likely due to D5W and vasopressin at OSH.
Recurred post-procedure with NA at 129 then 130 with natriuresis confirming pain induced SIADH.
# HCV and etoh: Patient does not have cirrhosis by labs (platelet, bilirubin, INR), histology ([**2114**]) or radiology.
Patient is motivated to treat HCV despite lack of fibrosis and arrangements were made for liver center consultation.
# chronic pain: from laryngeal cancer and pancreatitis.
Discharged on home dose of opiates in accordance with his pain contract at Spaudling Center for Intractable Pain.
He was encouraged to discuss this diagnosis with his PCP.
# Hypothyroidism: home liothyronine and levothyroxine were continued  # Prostate nodule: Seen on CT abd/pelvis, likely hypertrophy.
Post splenectomy care - patient NEEDs vaccines for encapsulated organisms around [**11-19**] and an active prescription for augmentin at all times.
Etoh - patient received resources from social work and may join a group.
Seizure disorder - perhaps this diagnosis ought to be reconsidered, albeit by a physician more familiar with his course when the diagnosis was made before changing management.
