Possible superimposed right lower lobe pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
Increase in mediastinal width and tracheal deviation compared to [**2152-5-2**] is probably due to AP technique but suggests increased aortic caliber.
A full PA and lateral series is suggested when the patient may tolerate this.
Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound with no focal liver lesions.
No evidence of ascites.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.3 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2149-12-4**], mild aortic stenosis is now present.
Pa/L CXR: Mild pulmonary edema and congestion of pulmonary and mediastinal vessels have resolved since [**1-2**], small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
There is a roughly 3-cm wide opacity at the base of the right lung, which projects over the thoracic spine on lateral view and could be a mass.
The configuration of the trachea suggests chronic lung disease.
There is a severe degenerative change in the right shoulder.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
There is more focal airspace disease at the right lower lobe, which may represent pneumonia, clinical correlation is recommended.
Suggestion of thoracic outlet syndrome, correlation with history and symptoms is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 80yoM with h/o COPD & CHF presents with hypoxemia and R lower lobe pneumonia.
# Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Etiology was thought to be multifactorial, due to decompensated CHF, complicated by RLL PNA and COPD.
D-dimer was elevated so CTA chest was performed and negative for PE.
Two small nodules were noted in the R upper lobe (5mm and 4mm) and need to be followed as an outpatient.
It was felt that he is likely chronically hypoxic as he has chronically elevated bicarbonate and hematocrit.
# CAD: The patient denied chest pain, and there were no acute ECG changes.
Cardiac enzymes showed flat CK and trops, slightly elevated to 0.03 in setting of hypoxia.
Stress test was deferred to outpatient as pt with acute CHF exacerbation.
# HTN- he was hypertensive on admission and not on any anti-hypertensives.
Addition of a b-blocker for CHF/CAD was considered but deferred to his primary care provider.
This may be due to hypoxia or orthostasis.
His dizziness resolved with treatment of his CHF and hypoxia.
# FEN: cardiac diet .
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation prn as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Community acquired pneumonia 2.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation 3.
COPD   Discharge Condition: Stable, comfortable.
Discharge Instructions: You have a right lung pneumonia as well as volume overload from heart failure.
Two small nodules were discovered on your CT scan.
Some new medications were started for you: Lisinopril for your blood pressure, Levofloxacin (an antibiotic) for pneumonia (to be taken for 6 additional days), and Furosemide (a diuretic) to be taken every day for heart failure.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have shorntess of breath while using your oxygen, chest pain, dizziness, or any other concerning symptom.
