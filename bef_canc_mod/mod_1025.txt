Admission Date:  [**2159-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-8-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath and cellulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy tracheostomy hickman catheter placement cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: HPI-53 yo male with a hx of DMII, HTN, Pos ppd with calcified lung nodules, laryngeal CA s/p total laryengectomy and XRT with recurrence now presenting with productive cough and SOB and bilateral arm cellulitis.
He has initially completed initial XRT in [**11-13**] with recurrence of laryngeal CA in [**2-14**] requiring total laryngectomy on [**2159-3-13**] followed by XRT which he is currently undergoing 5 weeks of with 10 treamentments left and last treatment 1 week PTA.
He also reported dysphagia often regurgitating food.
He also noted increasing pain, erythema nd swelling of bilateral hands, with no known trauma or injury that he is aware of.
* Durimg his MICU course, the patient remained ventilated via tracheostomy, treated with vanc/levo/flagyl for pna and anticoagulated and beta-blocked for NSTEMI in setting of tachycardia during presentation.
In this setting pt developed hemoptysis which was evaluated by ENT and was attributed to anticoagulation and friable mucose after recent trach placement and with hx of treatment for laryngeal ca.
Eventually had urgent flexible bronch and trach by pulmonary with no fistula, active bleeding, only friable mucosa.
He had no further bleeding and CT head/neck confirmed that there was no tracheo-inominate artery fistula present.
He has been extubated since [**6-3**] without complication.
He had been on pca while his oxycontin for his chornic throat pain was being held which has been slowly weaned off.
On admission he was also noted to have bilateral arm cellulitis for which he is being continued on vanc and followed by plastics.
Flagyl was also d/c'd as not felt to be an aspiration pna.
He was also evaluated by Speech/Swallow who reccommended pureed foods and liquids as he does have changes in is esophagus secondary to his radiation therapy.
He still has pain of his wrists, but notes that the erythema is improving with treatment as his flexibility and movement are improving as well.
Past Medical History: diabetes for 19 years hypertension history of positive PPD, and recent diagnosis of chest nodules likely stated to be granulations SCCA of the left vocal cord(T2N0M0) extending into the subglottic area, s/p radiotherapy ending [**11-13**] with recurrence in [**2-14**] with total laryngectomy on [**2159-3-13**]   Social History: born in [**Country 532**] with >50pack yr smoking hx  Family History: father died of stomach ca @56 and mother died of lung ca at 60  Physical Exam: VS: T98.7  BP 138/80  P96  R20  SAt 99%on 35% TM  FS 213 GEN aao, nad, able to speak with device w/o dyspnea HEENT PERRL, MMM, +trach stoma with mild surrounding erosions CHEST CTAB occasional end exp wheezes bilaterally, coarse BS bilaterally, decreased at bases bilaterally CV RRR no murmurs ABD soft NT/ND, +BS EXT +erythema and swelling bilateral hands with swelling and decreased ROM at wrist L>R, no LE edema  Pertinent Results: [**2159-6-1**] 10:50PM   TYPE-ART PEEP-5 O2-50 PO2-81* PCO2-34* PH-7.45 TOTAL CO2-24 BASE XS-0 INTUBATED-INTUBATED VENT-SPONTANEOU [**2159-6-1**] 05:52PM   ALT(SGPT)-20 AST(SGOT)-21 CK(CPK)-118 ALK PHOS-84 AMYLASE-10 TOT BILI-0.9 [**2159-6-1**] 05:52PM   CK-MB-13* MB INDX-11.0* cTropnT-0.30* [**2159-6-1**] 05:52PM   PT-14.8* PTT-31.0 INR(PT)-1.4 [**2159-6-1**] 04:20PM   GLUCOSE-368* UREA N-32* CREAT-1.2 SODIUM-130* POTASSIUM-5.0 CHLORIDE-90* TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-24* [**2159-6-1**] 04:20PM   WBC-22.8*# RBC-5.14# HGB-14.0# HCT-41.8# MCV-81* MCH-27.1 MCHC-33.4 RDW-13.8 [**2159-6-1**] 04:20PM   NEUTS-78* BANDS-4 LYMPHS-5* MONOS-10 EOS-1 BASOS-2 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 * CT CHEST/NECK: 1) No tracheoinnominate fistula.
2) Bilateral, multifocal airspace opacities.
Anterior, distal septal, apical, distal lateral and distal inferior hypokinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Septic physiology * RUE Ultrasound: 1.3 cm superficial amorphous soft tissue density overlying the right antecubital fossa, which given its acute onset and apparent bruising from direct visualization, is most likely consistent with an organizing hematoma.
This lesion is distinct from the underlying venous structures, and there is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
*   Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo male with a hx of DM, HTN, laryngeal CA s/p XRT with recurrence now presenting with productive cough and SOB, cellulitis bilateral hands and NSTEMI.
1) PNA - initially ventilated for 1 day for likely CAP, but covered broadly with levo, vanc and flagyl, but as less risk and concern for aspiration flagyl was discharged.
As sputum polymicrobial, but with MSSA, vanc was changed to oxacillin.
He did have some hemoptysis which was attributed to friable mucosa as the rest of the work up was negative and continued supportive suctioning and trach stoma care.
He did not have any further hemoptysis although unlikely off anticoagulation and with negative work up for fistula.
2)Cellulitis: unclear source of cellulitis of bilateral hands, with no history of trauma or injury, but was covered with vanc innitially and with no growth on blood cultures and only MSSA on sputum culture he was transitioned to oxacillin on which his erythema improved dramatically.
Plain films of hand were negative except for soft tissue swelling as expected.
3)CHF: new diagnosis of heart failure after NSTEMI likley on setting of sepsis and with elevated right heart pressures on cardiac cath and EF down to 35% with almost global hypokinesis.
He was started on beta-blockers, ace inhibitor, with some mild diuresis with lasix periodically, but as is very volume overloaded he will require continued diuresis at rehab.
4)NSTEMI: in setting of demand from possible sepsis and infection.
He came in with mildly elevated troponins, but flat CKs, and significant evolving anterior EKG changes.
He was initially started on heparin for ACS, but started bleeding as above, that resolved off anticoagulation.
Cardiology followed along and eventually reccommended cardiac catheterization which showed clean coronaries and no blockages.
5)Pain control: patient has had chronic pain from laryngeal ca which is followed by pain clinic, previously on oxycontin and prn dilaudid and was managed with PCA while in MICU.
Then changed to methadone which can be dissolved or in liquid form as he has had difficulty swallowing and bridges with dilaudid PCA and then transitioned to prn morphine leixer which helped his pain and can eventually be weaned off as his cellulitis resolves.
He did have some dysphagia from radiation burn injury on his esophagus, for which he was transitioned to pureed diet and thin liquids per nutrition.
He was also started on an ace this stay which should help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
8)FEN: diabetic pureed diet with thin liquids, repleted lytes as needed, at times was hyponatremic which initially was from hypovolemia and by the last few days of his stay was though to be secondary to fluid overload and should improve with diuresis.
