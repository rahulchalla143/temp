Allowing for the technical limitations of the study, no wall edema is appreciated.
[**2-26**]: KUB: Films are not specifically labeled as upright or supine.
No air-filled dilated loops of large or small bowel are identified.
Possible small scattered fluid levels, but no findings to suggest obstruction.
No obvious intraperitoneal air, although subtle abnormalities would be difficult to exclude on these films, due to patient body habitus and technical factors.
There is scattered vascular calcification, with a stent in the lower aorta and proximal common iliac vessels.
There is osteopenia and degenerative change of the lumbar spine.
Apparent non-acute rib fracture involving the left tenth rib.
No evidence of obstruction.
[**2-27**]: CT ABD/PELVIS: There are ill-defined, focal opacities in the visualized portion of the right middle lobe, with a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
There is mild left base atelectasis.
No pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is a nasogastric tube in place.
There is a 5.5 x 2.7 cm duodenal diverticulum at the third portion of the duodenum (sequence 2, image #35), as seen on prior studies.
There is stranding adjacent to the fourth portion of the duodenum near the junction with proximal (sequence 2, image #34).
An ill-defined heterogeneous hypoattenuating structure in the duodenal lumen most likely represents intestinal contents.
No abrupt narrowing is seen to explain the gastric distension.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There are multiple bilateral renal cysts, the largest in the left kidney.
Otherwise, the kidneys are unremarkable, without hydronephrosis.
No abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed and contains a Foley catheter.
There are prostatic calcifications.
No suspicious osseous lesions.
Gastric distention without features to suggest a distal obstruction.
Mild stranding involving the fourth portion of the duodenum of uncertain significance.
3. focal right middle lobe lung opacities consistent with infectious or inflammatory process.
Extensive vascular calcifications  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] was admitted to the Vascular service complaining of nausea and vomiting one day prior to a scheduled repair of his Type 1 endoleak.
Overnight HD1, he had a few episodes of emesis, and a large emesis on HD2.
A nasogastric tube was placed and over the following 16 hours, 5600 cc of gastric contents were evacuated.
Gastroenterology was consulted, and a plan was formulated to perform an upper endoscopy on HD4 in the ICU, as he had prior complications with endoscopy.
On HD4, he was intubated, and his heart rhythm converted to rapid atrial fibrillation.
The upper endoscopy was performed, and demonstrated no lesions.
On the morning of HD5, his amiodarone drip completed, and per his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], his amiodarone drip was stopped, and there was no need for a taper.
