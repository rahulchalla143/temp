Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with CVID, [**Doctor First Name **] on chronic abx, h/o lymphoma s/p RCHOP in [**2198**] who presented with increased constitutional symptoms to [**Hospital **] clinic and was found to have a bacteremia.
Her hospital course is described below and was complicated by a MICU stay for GI bleeding after colonoscopy and multiple biopsies.
Her hospital course is described below by problem:  # bacteremia: GNR and GPR growing in anaerobic bottles of two different sets of cultures which turned out to be bacteroides and clostridium.
Given her PMH and her murmur which may have been louder recently, she had an TTE which did not show any vegitations- it was unlikely anyway given the GNR and GPR (done before speciation).
She continued to have nightsweats and fatigue but remained afebrile.
# night sweats/constitutional symptoms: could be related to this bacteremia and will treat as such.
Differential diagnosis also included her h/o lymphoma (monitor in heme/onc clinic and no recent relapse on scans), liver disease of unknown origin (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], [**Doctor First Name **] recurrence, CMV recurrence (less likely given negative CMV titer two days ago).
She had a leukocytosis but this is actually her baseline per OMR.
The main concern was for reactivation on her [**Doctor First Name **] affecting the bowel causing a colitis.
She had noted a change to her bowels with stool that had mucous and sometimes blood streaked mucous.
# acute blood loss anemia: The colonoscopy showed several abnormal areas including rectal colitis and thickened folds throughout.
She had a history of bleeding after colonic biopsy but had not required tranfusions in the past.
# [**Doctor First Name **]: on levofloxacin and clarithromycin at home for maintance therapy.
As above, there is some concern for reactivation.
# h/o CMV: continued on valgancyclovir  # Long QT: on telemetry she was noted to have a long QT around 490msec.
# hepatomegaly: hepatitis of unknown origin.
She had elevated LFTs and Alk phos but at her baseline; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
# LE edema: chronic but increased currently per patient.
No signs of PE (no tachycardia, hypoxia, tachypnea).
No need for LENI at this time given well documented edema in the past OMR notes.
# lymphoma: [**2198**] s/p RCHOP.
monitored in heme/onc clinic without recurrence.
Found incidentally with splenectomy for ITP  # depression: continued on fluoxetine and ritalin  # code: full  Medications on Admission: valgancyclvir 450mg [**Hospital1 **] prozac 80mg daily ritalin 10mg qAM and qnoon trazadone 50mg-100mg qhs prn fluticasone nasal spray prilosec claritin D levofloxacin clarithromycin IVIG 35mg every three weeks- due this Saturday [**2202-2-20**]   Discharge Medications: 1.
