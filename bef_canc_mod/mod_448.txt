Mr. [**Known lastname 26254**] was taken to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department on [**2121-10-9**] after being found her toilet unable to stand secondary to left leg pain.
She denies any falls but complains of severe left leg pain and worsening edema.
The patient's visiting nurse contact[**Name (NI) **] her primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] two days prior to admission due to worsening erythema and lower extremity edema, and she given a prescription for dicloxacillin; although, it was unclear if the medication was started.
Ms. [**Known lastname 26254**] was hemodynamically stable and afebrile upon arriving to the Emergency Department.
She was noted to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.2 and a complete blood count with a left shift.
Her leg was evaluated by Vascular Surgery who thought it was consistent with previous lymphedema and recommended conservative measures.
She was given oxacillin for possible cellulitis and transferred to the ACOVE Medicine Service.
She was hypotensive at 70/30 on arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] and was placed on to intravenous fluid boluses.
Arterial blood gas performed for metabolic acidosis revealed values of 7.2, a PCO2 of 44, PO2 of 67, with a lactate of 4.8.
The team was unable to gets laboratories in the a.m. and lost intravenous access.
She was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring in the setting of acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and possible sepsis.
Acute cholecystitis and cholelithiasis; status post pigtail catheter via IR on [**2121-8-5**]; treated with Unasyn.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma with bulky abdominal adenopathy and splenomegaly.
No chemotherapy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 0.86.
Atrial fibrillation.
Sacral fracture.
3, subcutaneous heparin, and Synthroid.
Right internal jugular in place.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed right leg erythema and thickened skin extending to the knee.
Pitting edema of 3+.
Pitting edema of 3+, ecchymosis, and purpura from the knee to the inguinal ligament.
Urinalysis revealed specific gravity of 1.02, moderate blood, 100 protein, and negative leukocyte esterase.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 75.
A chest x-ray revealed no evidence of acute pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient developed lactic acidosis and likely septic shock.
The underlying cause of her sepsis was thought to be a soft tissue infection of her left lower leg.
LEFT LOWER LEG SOFT TISSUE INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient was followed by Vascular Surgery, and Dermatology was consulted for a skin biopsy.
The skin biopsy showed purpura fulminans.
Septic shock.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
