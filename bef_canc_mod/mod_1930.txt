DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2151-3-7**]):       POSITIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
TTE ([**3-12**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis, akinesis of the mid and distal anterior wall and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-3-12**] 9:30 AM There has been marked improvement in pulmonary edema, still there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis has decreased.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable as are enlarged central pulmonary arteries very suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
There is also a small right pleural effusion, lesser in amount than in the left side.
TTE ([**3-8**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %) (basal lateral wall has preserved systolic function).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2151-3-8**] 11:18 AM BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed which demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Survey demonstrates dirty shadowing from numerous loops of small bowel within the lower abdomen and pelvis.
No mass lesions were identified.
IMPRESSION: Limited ultrasound demonstrates no superficial mass lesions identified within the abdomen or pelvis.
Findings may be confirmed with non- emergent CT of the abdomen and pelvis if clinically warranted.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo woman with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) **] sinus s/p PPM, afib (off anticoagulation [**1-16**] epistaxis), pumonary HTN, diastolic CHF, CAD, severe AS, COPD who presents with shortness of [**Month/Day (2) 1440**], DFA positive for Flu B. .
The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypotension and need for vasopressors.
# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxemia Likely multifactorial, including Influenza and acute heart failure (systolic).
Initially was on antibiotics for possible pneumonia, however there was no evidence of a bacterial pneumonia, so these were stopped.
# Influenza DFA for Influenza B was positive.
# Acute Systolic CHF with h/o Chronic Diastolic CHF This was likely in setting of acute viral illness (?-viral myocarditis).
The patient had significant pulmonary edema.
Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated (likely in setting of demand), however did not meet criteria for an NSTEMI.
# Severe Aortic Stenosis Confirmed on both echocardiograms.
# Hypotension: normal WBC, no left shift in differential.
In the setting of fevers concerning for sepsis.
# Rhythm - Atrial Fibrillation/SSS s/p PPM Rate was well controlled.
She had an episode in which she had an 80-beat run of what appeared to be a wide complex tachycardia.
# hypothyroidism Was continued on her home meds.
# depression: continued on outpatient regimen  Medications on Admission: tylenol Advair1 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] Albuterol sulfate 90 mcg 2 puff q4-6h as needed Aspirin 81 Atorvastatin 80 mg once a day Atrovent HFA Calcium 500 Celexa 60 mg qd Colace [**Hospital1 **] 100 mg\ Iron 325 Lasix 40 qd Levoxyl 100 qd Metoprolol xl 37 qd Lisinopril 10 mg qd prilosec 20 qd senna Vitamin C Vitamin D   Discharge Medications: 1.
