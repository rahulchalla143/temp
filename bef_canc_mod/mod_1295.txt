HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 96805**] is a 77 year old female with metastatic ovarian cancer and multiple complications stemming from this, who presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest.
Brief summary of her most recent history includes a diagnosis of inoperable, non-chemotherapy amenable small bowel obstruction.
On [**2106-2-16**], she was noted by her family to be unresponsive at the rehabilitation facility except to painful stimuli, hypoxic and febrile to 104.6 F., tachycardic and tachypneic.
She had several brief episodes of supraventricular tachycardia which were self limited.
She was found to have renal failure as well, attributed to obstructive uropathy from her intra-abdominal tumor burden, along with a small prerenal component to the renal failure.
On [**2106-2-19**], her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ceftazidine and on [**2106-2-21**], the antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia - antibiotics directed per sensitivities.
She also received hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
On [**2106-2-24**], she was found to have dark drainage from her NG tube and was thought to be possibly blood from a potential perforation.
On [**2106-2-25**], she was found tachypneic and hypoxic, and she was also noted to be febrile at that point.
A concern for aspiration event was raised.
She had a small amount of ostomy output as well as an occult blood positive NG tube drainage.
Her mental status worsened as well, with no further response to pain or voice, and roaming eye movements.
She was also transfused for a falling hematocrit on [**2106-2-27**], with an appropriate response.
She then experienced transient worsening of her respiratory status over the next several days.
On the afternoon of [**3-1**], the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress by her family.
After approximately five minutes of additional CPR (15 to 20 minutes total), the monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation.
Following this, the patient was noted to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s and a palpable carotid pulse.
Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**], status post debulking surgery, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, status post omentectomy, status post sigmoid resection and end colostomy.
Status post bleeding ulcer and duodenal mass, status post oversewing of ulcer and pyloroplasty.
History of VRE and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (sepsis).
History of malignant pleural effusion, status post pleurodesis on two occasions.
Breast cancer status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**] and irradiation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
High cholesterol.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic ( ejection fraction of greater than 75% ).
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was no significant aortic valve stenosis.
Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion noted.
Extremities warm, right upper extremity with two plus pitting edema; left upper extremity with trace edema; bilateral lower extremities with two plus pitting edema.
No axis change, T wave inversions V3 through V6, appeared old.
Next study [**2106-3-2**], abdominal ultrasound demonstrated no interhepatic bile duct dilatation.
There was extensive metastatic disease noted throughout the peritoneum, unchanged bilateral hydronephrosis.
CT scan on [**2106-2-16**]:  There was no central pulmonary embolism.
There was a right lower lobe pneumonia noted.
There was an inflammatory posterior pleural mass on the right, likely related to pleurodesis.
Large loculated peritoneal fluid collections with layering internal debris, possibly blood.
No evidence of interperitoneal abscess.
Numerous dilated small bowel loops with contrast in the lower abdomen from the study three weeks prior which is consistent with obstruction.
CT scan of the head on [**2106-2-16**], demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening present in the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells; otherwise there was no acute processes noted.
On [**2106-2-19**], right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of cholecystitis.
There were septated fluid regions representing metastatic spread into the liver.
On [**2106-2-24**], upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated an occlusive thrombus within the right cephalic vein.
Sputum from [**2-18**] was significant for Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus.
IMPRESSION:  Miss [**Known lastname 96805**] is a 77 year old female with end stage metastatic ovarian cancer complicated by obstructive uropathy, small bowel obstruction and liver and lung metastases, re-admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with likely hypoxic cardiac arrest and possible sepsis.
Most likely sources for sepsis included aspiration pneumonia but other sources cannot be excluded including intra-abdominal processes, Clostridium difficile or mucous plugging.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  She presented to the Intensive Care Unit from the Medical Floor after several days of increasing hypoxia requiring increased supplemental oxygen.
She had a witnessed aspiration event versus mucous plugging.
However, after extubation, she became acutely hypoxic, tachypneic, hypertensive and tachycardic.
She had experienced another aspiration event and she was re-intubated.
Secondary to her significant risk of aspiration with extubation, she remained intubated, requiring little ventilatory support until she was able to receive a tracheostomy.
The procedure was delayed secondary to her thrombocytopenia.
She tolerated the procedure well with only a small amount of bleeding around the tracheostomy site.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypotension; the patient was hypotensive status post P/A arrest on [**2106-3-1**].
She was volume resuscitated with six liters of normal saline as she was likely septic considering her fever prior to the code.
The patient's examination and vital signs were consistent with a distributive shock physiology.
Flagyl was added as a likely source for her potential sepsis was her intra-abdominal tumor invading her intestines.
Despite these antibiotics, she continued to have hypotensive episodes and fevers.
Secondary to her history of adrenal insufficiency during her first Medical Intensive Care Unit course, it was felt that she was likely adrenally insufficient.
After initiation of hydrocortisone, the patient remained normotensive to moderately hypertensive from [**2106-3-5**] through [**2106-3-15**].
Her steroids were increased to previous levels and she did not tolerate the weaning with the increase in her temperature as well.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Fever - the patient was cultured upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2106-3-1**], including blood cultures with fungal isolators, chest x-ray, urine cultures, sputum cultures with Gram stain.
Sputum was positive for Gram positive cocci, likely Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
With the absence of positive cultures, it was felt that the fevers were either drug related or secondary to adrenal insufficiency.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**3-2**], to explore an intra-abdominal source for her fevers.
She remained afebrile from [**3-7**] through [**3-16**] when she developed a temperature to 101.3 F., as her steroids had been weaned.
Sputum was positive for multiple organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, three types of Gram negative rods and yeast.
Chest x-ray performed on [**3-18**], demonstrated no infiltrates or evidence of pneumonia.
She had been administered one dose of Vancomycin for presumed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia but without evidence for this, the decision was made to not empirically treat these sputum results.
She will be monitored for infection signs.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Small bowel obstruction - the patient had significant tumor burden in her abdomen and this was complicated by a small bowel obstruction.
Colostomy was noted to have no output several days prior to admission to the Intensive Care Unit and continued to have output of only minimally clear secretions.
Her NG tube was to constant suction initially but it was changed to intermittent suction when she had minimal amounts of bloody particle suction.
She was maintained on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day secondary to her blood positive NG output.
Elevated liver function tests:  The patient's liver function tests steadily rose and was consistent with an obstructive picture versus metastatic disease.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**3-2**], demonstrated multiple fluid collections surrounding the porta hepatis and medial aspect of her liver consistent with her known metastatic disease.
There was no inter-hepatic ductal dilatation although.
Her synthetic function remained intact as she corrected an elevated INR with the administration of Vitamin K.  5.
HEMATOLOGY:  Coagulopathy; The patient was noted to have decreasing platelets upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit.
The etiology of this was unclear, but it was felt to be a low grade DIC versus liver disease versus sepsis.
Anemia:  The patient had a history of anemia and had persistently diminished hematocrits while admitted requiring transfusion with eight units of packed red blood cells total during her admission.
The blood loss was likely secondary to GI losses, known occult blood positive NG tube suction contents, and decreased production from chronic disease.
ONCOLOGY:  Metastatic ovarian cancer - Hematology/Oncology had been consulted while the patient was on the medical floor and noted that she had no further chemotherapy options based on the refractory nature of her tumor to her prior regimens and poor performance status.
Her diminishing mental status was felt secondary to her metabolic encephalopathy prior to her cardiac arrest.
She had evidence of poor cortical reflexes, sporadically, which were retained in the upper extremities and had a positive bilateral Babinski's reflex.
RENAL:  Renal failure - On admission [**2106-2-16**], her creatinine was elevated above baseline at 1.8 (baseline of 1.0).
The etiology was felt to be an obstructive uropathy as CT scan on [**2-16**] demonstrated hydronephrosis in both kidneys.
Urology had been consulted during her Intensive Care Unit admission for the possibility of ureteral stents when her creatinine was 2.2, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96806**] in consultation with the attending doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**], felt that her decreased renal function was also possibly secondary to hypovolemia or nephrotoxicity of the Neo-synephrine.
Hydronephrosis was confirmed on [**2106-3-2**], but abdominal ultrasound.
She was aggressively volume resuscitated after her P/A arrest as she was potentially septic, but the etiology of her depressed renal function and subsequent improvement remained unclear.
She had a hypernatremia upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit which was corrected with free water administered per the TPN.
She requires continued volume and free water replacement secondary to her significant losses through her ostomy and NG tube.
The final recommendation of the Ethics Service was that "if at any time the attending physician believes that the addition of chest compressions (or any other component of ACLS) to the current regimen would not reasonably be expected to reverse a cardiopulmonary arrest, then a CPR not indicated order directing that chest compressions (or those other components), not be instituted and would be appropriate."
PROPHYLAXIS:  While hospitalized, the patient remained on GI prophylaxis including Protonix ( twice a day for bleeding concerns) and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with pneumatic compression boots.
Metastatic ovarian cancer to the lungs and liver.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Altered mental status.
Acute renal failure, likely obstructive uropathy.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and VRE sepsis.
Contact precautions for a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and pan resistant Klebsiella.
