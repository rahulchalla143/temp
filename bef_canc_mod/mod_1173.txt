Hypodense appearance of the left insular cortex in some locations is of uncertain significance given the rotated position; however, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] can be considered to evaluate for ischemia/infarction and seizure focus.
[**6-19**] CXR IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe airspace opacity could represent aspiration or pneumonia.
Left lower lobe aspiration or pneumonia.
Left internal jugular venous catheter tip touching outer wall of the upper SVC.
The liver is diffusely echogenic with coarse echotexture consistent with known cirrhosis.
There is no focal liver lesion.
There is no detectable flow in the main portal vein consistent with portal vein thrombosis.
There is inreased hepatic arterial flow.
There is splenomegaly as well as large perisplenic varices.
There is no intra or extra hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There are bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
There is also moderate ascites.
No detectable portal flow, in this technically difficult study, consistent with thrombotic occlusion vs. extremely low velocity flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo male with a history of Hep B cirrhosis presents s/p seizure with ascites likely secondary to portal vein thrombosis.
Seizure: Likely secondary to hypoglycemia due to taking NPH and Lantus both mistakenly.
Neurology was consulted, and they felt that this was possible given that CSF glucose lags behind plasma glucose.
Neurology felt that anti-epileptic medications were not necessary given etiology of seizures was likely due to hypoglycemia.
Altered mental status: Likely post ictal.
Hypotension not felt to be due to sepsis, but likely secondary to ativan.
Mild hypothermia.
No leukocytosis.
Cirrhosis: Grade III varices on EGD [**8-4**].
New complete portal vein thrombosis on abdominal U/S with ascites.
EKG changes: ruled out for myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes.
No leukocytosis or fever.
Disp:*qs one month* Refills:*2*   [**Month/Year (2) **] Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Homecare  [**Hospital **] Diagnosis: Primary: Seizure [**1-29**] hypoglycemia Aspiration pneumonitis  Secondary: Hepatitis B Cirrhosis complicated by portal vein thrombosis Diabetes   [**Month/Day (2) **] Condition: stable, blood sugars controlled   [**Month/Day (2) **] Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a seizure.
We felt that this was due to a dangerously low blood sugar, most likely from taking too much insulin.
You were monitored closely in the ICU and you had no further seizures.
You also had a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis and this was negative.
If you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, chest pain, difficulty breathing or a seizure, please contact your doctor or go to the emergency room.
