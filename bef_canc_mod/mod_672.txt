He continued to have shortness of breath and was started on Bipap, then sent to the ED for further evaluation.
He was continued on Bipap, had a CXR which was essentially unchanged from previous, EKG without ischemic changes.
Labs showed elevated Cr to 2.0, Hct up to 31, Trop of 0.08, and BNP of 23,000.
On the floor the patient is unable to answer questions or follow commands secondary to severe dementia.

Sclera anicteric.
PERRL, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
HEENT: mucous membs dry, no lymphadenopathy, JVP at 16 cm CHEST: CTABL anterior, no wheezes, no rales, no rhonchi CV: S1 S2 Normal in quality and intensity, slightly irregular, no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: firm, mildly tender to palpation.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
No acute ischemia.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-9-7**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased.
CXR: FINDINGS: There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is a similar mild interstitial abnormality with prominence of central pulmonary vascularity, suggesting mild vascular congestion.
In addition, patchy streaky opacities in the right mid and lower lung suggest a background of minor scarring or atelectasis.
Although evaluation is limited, there is no definite pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is demonstrated, although it is noted that the left lung apex is obscured by a flexed chin.
IMPRESSION: Essentially stable findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF- Patient appeared mildly clinically volume overloaded on admission, with crackles, mildly elevated JVP (although does have TR), mild hip edema.
CXR showed mild pulmonary congestion, and BNP elevated supporting congestive etiology.
Also considered aspiration pneumonitis (although no new x-ray findings), PE (although was on heparin until Wednesday per report, not tachycardic, and responded to BiPAP), and ACS (although negative EKG and enzymes).
# CAD: stable and without signs of ACS on EKG/enzymes.
Patient is not on Plavix, it seems that this is [**3-16**] GI bleeds in the past.
# DM: continued glargine and sliding scale per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab recs.
# Severe dementia: aspiration and fall precautions.
