IMAGING: -[**5-8**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
Moderate degenerative changes of the cervical spine with resultant moderate neural foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M w/ hx alchol abuse and HCV who was found unresponsive by EMS on the street who was then intubated given low respirations for inability to protect his airway and found to have polysubstance intoxication with ethanol and benzos.
He was subsequently intubated due to minimal respirations at 2x/min for airway protection given his intoxication as evidenced by his highly positive ethanol level.
# Unresponsiveness - Most likely due to polysubstance abuse with ethanol and benzodiazepines.
He has had multiple presentations in the ED for alcohol abuse and was seen in the ED on the day prior to this admission, because he was found altered v. intoxicated.
A CT scan of his head and neck was done at that time because he had a laceration above his left eyebrow, that was repaired with glue and were negative for bleed or fracture.
Pt had no stigmata of active infection.
# Anion-gap acidosis - Most likely due to elevated ethanol and lactate levels.
# Hypernatremia - Pt w/ mild hypernatremia of 147 that was likely due to lack of free water as it is unclear what his diet may truly be like.
# Hx mild transaminitis - Likely due to combination of chronic alcohol abuse and HCV.
# Hx Hypertension - initially held home Amlodipine (unclear if was really taking this at home) given SBP in the low 100s upon admission.
Pt likely needs assistance in cessation of alcohol and related social issues, as he has had recurrent admissions for intoxication or being found down.
