Pt initially treated as COPD exacerbation with the administration of steroids.
Initiation of these modalities resulted in improvement of symptoms.
Additionally, Pt described worsening SOB over the past 12-24 hours with no clear precipitant.
Colonic adenocarcinoma; status post right colectomy.
History of myocardial infarction.
Severe Aortic stenosis (0.8)  5.
Congestive heart failure (LVEF 60%).
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
There is increased hilar and perivascular haziness, consistent with interstitial edema.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There is left retrocardiac atelectasis versus consolidation.
Osseous structures are unchanged, again with evidence of old left proximal humerus fracture.
IMPRESSION: 1) Congestive heart failure 2) Bilateral pleural effusions 3) Left retrocardiac atelectasis versus consolidation pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] is an 87 year old female with known 3VD non-surgical and PCI candidate in the past, diastolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis who was admitted to CCU with NSTEMI and CHF.
She was called out to the floor as soon as her cardiac issues stabilized.
On presentation to the ED, Ms.[**Known lastname 110790**] had a NSTEMI given positive cardiac enzymes.
The patient did well with nitroglycerin, however given her severe AS it was minimized and stopped upon arrival to the CCU.
The patient also started on heparin gtt and continued overnight until it was stopped in light of being pain free and CE trending down.
Overnight BB was held given severe CHF and restarted in AM as Pt improved steadily.
2) Pump: Pt with diastolic dysfunction with LVEF 60% on recent echo, however limited forward flow given AS/MR.
The patient was clearly volume overloaded in heart failure, some of which may have been secondary to dietary indiscretion.
The patient also not on an ACEi as outpt given preserved systolic function and not started on one initially on admission given [**Doctor First Name 48**].
She [**Doctor First Name 8337**] gentle diuresis well without hypotension.
A new echo  was obtained which showed an EF > 55% and she was started on an ACE I to prevent remodeling.
3) Valves:  Pt with severe AS (area 0.8 cm2) and moderate MR on recent echo.
Pt was minimally afterload reduced and gently diuresised.
4) Rhythm: NSR without active issue during hospitalization.
5) Resp: Pt in respiratory distress on presentation.
Initially treated as COPD exacerbation in ED with little improvement.
CXR consistent with CHF.
At discharge, she had no oxygen requirement.
Pt most likely suffering from [**Doctor First Name 48**] secondary to decreased perfusion in the acute setting.
