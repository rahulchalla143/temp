CXR [**2191-2-18**]: increased pulmonary markings c/w CHF .
CT head [**2191-2-18**]: no acute ICH, no mass effect .
Hip films [**2191-2-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture.
RUQ U/S [**2191-2-20**]: IMPRESSION: Status post cholecystectomy without evidence for intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral air space opacities at the lung bases representing atelectasis versus consolidation.
Small pericardial effusion.
Persistent congestive heart failure with interstitial edema.
New retrocardiac opacities, which may relate to dependent edema.
Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered.
Small left pleural effusion.
KUB [**2191-2-20**]: There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern visualized, with air and stool within nondistended colon and air within nondistended loops of small bowel.
If there is clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air, dedicated upright or left lateral decubitus view would be recommended.
CXR [**2191-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: Improving mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis/hypokinesis and inferolateral hypokinesis and mild to moderate global hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 78 year old man with Parkinson's disease, Atrial Fibrillation on anticoagulation (coumadin), with recent worsening in Parkinson's symptoms suspected due to improper administration of his own meds, and recent dyspnea on exersion.
His presentation included worsening rigidity and gait difficulties resulting in falls.
They felt his gait difficulties were likely multifactorial, with Parkinson's disease, cervical myelopathy, and possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia contributing, as well as improper administration of his parkinson's medications.
He has a history of significant worsening of his symptoms with nonadherence to medications and his cervical collar.
# Cholangitis:  Patient was noted to have abdominal pain and fever on [**2191-2-20**], work up included LFTs which were noted to be elevated in a hepatitis/obstructive pattern.
Blood cultures were sent which ended up growing 4/4 bottles pan sensitive e. coli and Klebsiella.
RUQ U/S demonstrated no dilation of the common bile duct, but given clinical picture, there was suspicion of obstruction.
Therefore patient underwent ERCP on [**2191-2-21**] that noted partial obstruction of common bile duct with 3 stones, stones unable to be removed, but stent placed for pus drainage noticed.
Immediately following ERCP, patient went to the ICU for closer monitering, but came back to the regular floor the following day without complication.
His diet was advanced to regular without complication.
# DOE: He presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion over the last month, most notably on the day of admission when he was trying to put on his compression stockings.
While his pulmonary exam was initially without rales, he had CHF on CXR, LE edema greater than baseline, and he had a markedly elevated BNP.
He had no infiltrates or clinical history for pneumonia.
He then had some tenuos respiratory issues around the same time as his noted cholangitis, requiring nasal cannula oxygen for a short time period.
This was thought secondary to trans-abdominal fluid movement from his abdominal process.
As the cholangitis was treated as above, his respiratory issues and Oxygen requirement resolved and the patient no longer required supplemental oxygen.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone and Coumadin as an outpatient.
Coumadin remained held following the ERCP and discussions ensued regarding risk vs benefit of this patient being on coumadin for his atrial fibrillation given his fall risk.
He otherwise had his amiodarone held during his acute LFT elevation, but this was restarted upon resolution of his cholangitis.
Therefore patient discharged with oxycodone PRN, with thoughts that shoulder pain will improve with time and physical therapy.
# Prostate ca: Patient is status-post radiation therapy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis Parkinson's disease Cervical myelopathy Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] Atrial fibrillation Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
If you experience falls, worsening instability, worsening abdominal pain, fevers/chills, or other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the ER.
