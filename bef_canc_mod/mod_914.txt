Admission Date:  [**2170-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-2-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Ancef  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: urosepsis, Cdiff  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotrachial intubation left internal jugular central line placement PICC placement x 2   History of Present Illness: 40 y/o man with h/o C5-quadriplegia, multiple admissions for urosepsis, who presented originally to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from rehab 3 days ago with hypotension.
He had been found to have ESBL UTI and C. diff colitis.
His infections were initially responding to IV fluids and antibiotics but on [**3-29**] he developed increasing abdominal pain and distention.
A CT abdomen was done that showed a fluid collection in his right lower abdomen.
Review of systems is difficult to obtain from patient given that he has altered mental status and is a poor historian.

[**2170-4-1**] Urine culture: KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.
Consider Infectious Disease consultation for serious infections caused by ESBL-producing species.
[**2170-4-4**] Cerebrospinal fluid:    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2170-4-4**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2170-4-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, could reflect mild CHF.
Diffuse colitis with intra-abdominal fat stranding has slightly progressed.
Contrast passes throughout the large bowel with no extravasation.
Slight decrease in size of the simple fluid collection in the right iliac fossa which is most likely a locule of free fluid and not typical for an abscess.
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
4.5-mm hyperdense lesion in the midline, at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**], likely a colloid cyst, unchanged over the series of previous CTs dating back to [**2162**].
Venous ultrasound, left upper extremity [**2170-4-9**]: Occlusive thrombus in a small segment of the more superficial anterior basilic vein with no flow and no compressibility.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 y/o man h/o C5-quadriplegia, recurrent UTIs and past admissions for urosepsis, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with C. diff colitis, ESBL UTI, and concern of intra-abdominal abscess.
# ESBL urinary tract infection/sepsis:  Patient was initially septic with hypotension and required pressors in the ICU.
The patient will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] discharge to evaluate the etiology of his recurrent urinary tract infections.
# Healthcare-associated pneumonia: On [**2170-4-3**], the patient developed fever to 100.2.
CXR was concerning for pneumonia.
He was evaluated by the surgical consult service, who felt that the fluid collection did not need to be drained.
# Delirium: At baseline, the patient is completely alert and oriented.
The patient developed confusion hallucinations following extubation on [**2170-4-2**].
Theh patient's altered mental status was felt to be related to delirium in the setting of infection and medications.
The was no evidence of seizures.
# Dysphagia: As the patient's mental status improved, he was evaluated by video fluoroscopy.
This showed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized primarily by intermittent premature spillover and swallow delay resulting in silent aspiration of thin liquids before and during the swallow.
Cued cough was weak/breathy and ineffective in clearing aspirated material from the trachea.
However when patient was noted to aspirate thin liquids when attempting to self-feed straw sips of thin liquid [**12-26**] reduced coordination resulting in poor chin tuck position.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine peaked at 2.5.
# Pancytopenia.
He has a known history of myelodysplastic syndrome.
Review of records shows that he has developed similar pancytopenia in the setting of acute illnesses (previously during admissions in [**Last Name (LF) 547**], [**First Name3 (LF) 404**], and [**Month (only) **]).
The patient needs urinary catheterization times daily through his appendicovesicostomy (6a/12p/6p/12a), using 8FR straight catheter (at umbilicus, patient left side).
# Hypertension: Metoprolol was started due to hypertension after extubation.
On review of past medical records, it became apparent that the patient had had problems with bradycardia and long pauses during a recent admission.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: CPAP at night.
# Communication.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -ESBL Klebsiella UTI, complicated by sepsis -clostridium difficile -delirium -health-care associated pneumonia -acute on chornic kidney injury -dysphagia .
Secondary: -C5 quadriplegia -s/p ACE-[**Location (un) **] -s/p appendicovesicostomy -seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with a urinary tract infection, colitis from clostridium difficile, and a fluid collection in your abdomen.
The surgical consult service was consulted due to the fluid collection in your abdomen, and they felt that no invasive intervention was required.
You also developed confusion, which was felt to be related to infection and had resolved by the time of discharge.
You had a high-normal potassium level and a mildly low white blood cell count at the time of discharge.
