Admission Date:  [**2165-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7567**] Chief Complaint: Status Epilepticus   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: LTM EEG monitoring VP shunt tap  History of Present Illness:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] is a 20 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury in [**7-28**], now admitted for status epilepticus.
Initial injury during roll-over MVA in [**7-28**], ejected from car, sustaining subdural hematoma, skull fracture, SAH, with midline shift requiring emergency hemicraniectomy for increased ICPs.
Given severity of injury, he was on prophylactic levetiracetam, although no record of clinical seizures and continuous EEG monitoring for total of 6 days showed no electrographic seizures, but occasional right hemisphere and left frontal spikes.
Was being tapered off Keppra because of sedation (to 250mg TID).
On [**1-19**] AM, was found to be unresponsive with posturing; given Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 1121**], where he continued to have recurrent generalized seizures despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g, Keppra 2g.
Past Medical History: Right subdural hematoma multiple brain contusions TBI s/p VP shunt L1 burst fracture s/p PEG, G-tube feeds only s/p Trach, now decanulated   Social History: Has been at [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**].
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Initial exam:  Gen: Lying in bed, intubated/sedated CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: +BS soft, nontender Ext: warm, well perfused, no edema Skin: G-tube site okay, old trach scars  Mental status: Intubated, sedated, does not open eyes, does not follow commands.
CN: head appeared initially deviated toward right with facial twitching and eye twitching vertically.
Motor exam: Initially with right hand twitching with stopped with increased propofol.
Unable to elicit in UE due to tone/extensor posture.
Current exam:  Mental status: No spontaneous eye opening or eye opening to command.
Unable to see palate secondary to increased tone in jaw.
Motor: extensor posturing bilateral arms with contractures, increased extensor posturing to pain in UEs, triple flexion in LEs to pain.
Pertinent Results: Initial Labs:  10.4>11.8/34.2<346; 85 PMNs, 6 Bands, 5 Lymphs Na 140, K 4, CL 105, CO2 24, BUN 16, Cr 0.4, Gluc 128 ALT 31, AST 19, CK 357 Alk phos 144 T bili 0.8 Alb 3.6 Ca 8.6, Phos 3.7, Mg 1.6 PT 14.2, PTT 24.2, INR 1.2 Phenytoin 10.6  REPORTS:  EEG ([**2165-1-20**]): EEG gives evidence for a severe diffuse encephalopathy with the presence of persistent epileptiform activity (PLEDs)over the left central-temporal region.
EEG ([**2165-1-31**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of left frontal delta slowing which represents focal cerebral pathology.
It is also abnormal due to the appearance of very rare left frontal broad-based sharp waves which may represent epileptogenic cortex.
There were two pushbutton activations, neither of which showed any clinical or electrical changes concerning for seizure.
There were no electrographic seizures seen.
IMAGING:  LE Dopplers: Extensive deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending from common femoral to popliteal veins.
CTA chest: Acute segmental pulmonary emboli involving the right upper lobe anterior and apical segments and segmental and subsegmental emboli involving the posterior basal right lower lobe pulmonary arteries; Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with marked endobronchial secretions within the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, consistent with partial drowned lung.
Additional foci of patchy airspace consolidation in the remainder of the right lower lobe is suspicious for superimposed aspiration or infection   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] is a 20 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury in [**7-28**], now admitted for status epilepticus.
1) Status Epilepticus/Seizures: On [**1-19**] AM, was found to be unresponsive with posturing; given Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 12914**], where he continued to have recurrent generalized seizures despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g, and Keppra 2g.
While in the Neuro ICU, he was initially monitored on cEEG, which showed left central-temporal PLEDs.
Please contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding any adjustments of seizure medications.
3) ID: He was initially spiking fevers, which was believed to be due to his autonomic dysregulation, but cultures were sent and he did have blood cultures (both centrally and peripherally) positive for coag negative Staph.
Repeat blood cx have been negative and a repeat sputum cx only showed sparse growth of Pseudomonas and Coag + Staph; this is likely colonization and as per ID, there is no need to continue antibiotics longer for this as long as there is no further fevers or respiratory distress.
To ensure the bactermia was not related to a CSF infection given his VP shunt; Neurosurgery was asked to tap the VP shunt; there was no evidence of infection in the CSF.
Wound cultures were also performed of his areas of folliculitis on his torso to ensure that this was not a portal of entry of his bacteremia; there were no microorganisms seen on the wound cultures.
4) Heme: Left lower extremity swelling was noted, so LE Dopplers were performed ands showed Extensive deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending from common femoral to popliteal veins.
A CTA was subsequently performed and despite his IVC filter, there were acute segmental pulmonary emboli involving the right upper lobe anterior and apical segments and segmental and subsegmental emboli involving the posterior basal right lower lobe pulmonary arteries.
Other contributing factors could be pain induced tachycardia and now, from his PE as well.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**] ([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)  Discharge Diagnosis: status epilepticus DVT PE bacteremia pneumonia   Discharge Condition: nonverbal and does not does not respond to commands currently bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital in status epilepticus.
On [**1-19**] AM, you were found unresponsive with posturing; given Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 1121**], where you continued to have recurrent generalized seizures despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g, and Keppra 2g.
EEG the next morning showed epileptic activity but no electrographic seizures.
On the last day of EEG monitoring, there was still diffuse slowing indicating an encephalopathy, but there were only very rare sharp waves in the left frontal region; this was an improvement from the initial EEGs.
Despite the overall improved EEG, there was still diffuse encephalopathy with no significant improval in your level of arousal.
While in the hospital, you were spiking fevers and were found to have blood cultures positive for coag negative Staph and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed while you were intubated and it grew Pseudomonas.
This showed that you had a DVT in your left leg; you were subsequently noted to have a pulmonary embolus, which is a clot in your lung that probably dislodged from the clot in your leg.
While at rehab, please call her at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 32465**] regarding any questions with adjustment of seizure medications.
