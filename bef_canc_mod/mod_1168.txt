pulmonary a  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary abnormalities are present, including smoothly thickened septal lines, areas of reticulation, and multifocal ground-glass opacities.
These findings involve multiple lobes of both lungs but are asymmetrically distributed.
Additionally, there are multiple areas of patchy consolidation, most pronounced in the right upper lobe.
Within the left lower lobe, there is a focal area of confluent opacity with associated volume loss, favoring atelectasis over consolidation.
Similarly, a confluent area of opacity in the right lower lobe, immediately adjacent to pleural fluid is probably due to focal atelectasis.
Asymmetric soft tissue density in right supraclavicular region could be due to asymmetrical musculature but is difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Subcarinal nodes measure up to 1.3 cm in short axis dimension.
Pulmonary hila are difficult to assess in the setting of enlarged pulmonary arteries and absence of intravenous contrast, but there is likely at least mild hilar lymphadenopathy present.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions are present, right slightly greater than left.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is diffuse nonspecific soft tissue stranding within the mesentery.
No suspicious abnormalities are identified within the liver on this unenhanced study.
There is a rounded low attenuation lesion within the spleen measuring about 1.8 cm in diameter, and a second smaller central lesion measuring about 8 mm in diameter.
Superficial surgical clips are present in the left posterior upper abdominal wall, and there is nonspecific soft tissue stranding near the clips.
Comparison CT abdomen [**2162-11-30**] demonstrates a similar appearance in this region.
The pleural effusions have slightly increased in size bilaterally since the prior abdominal CT, and the left basilar opacity has worsened.
Right lower lobe is slightly better aerated posteriorly compared to the prior abdominal CT. With regard to the splenic lesions, the two lesions appear unchanged from the recent abdominal CT.
Multifocal ground glass opacities and septal thickening, most likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
Asymmetrical consolidation predominantly involving the right upper lobe is concerning for infectious pneumonia given the history of elevated white blood cell count.
Asymmetrical edema is within the differential diagnosis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, slightly increased from recent abdominal CT.  4.
Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and questionable right supraclavicular nodes.
If nephrectomy was performed for renal cell carcinoma, followup CT with intravenous contrast would be recommended to exclude the possibility of metastatic lymphadenopathy.
Differential diagnosis includes reactive/hyperplastic lymph nodes.
Status post left nephrectomy and right renal artery stenting.
Splenic lesions without change from recent abdominal CT  [**2162-12-1**] 3:00 PM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
A small rounded area of low attenuation is seen in the head of the caudate nucleus on the right side, representing an old lacunar infarct.
A similar area of low attenuation is visualized in the right medial temporal lobe, also representing lacunar infarct, chronic in age.
There is evidence of a probable left maxillary medial wall antrostomy- please confirm and correlate with prior history.
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage RADIOLOGY  Final Report  [**2162-11-28**] 11:18 AM  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
This appearance could be due to the retained CT contrast given intravenously, due to the associated renal failure.

In acute kidney failure, the kidneys suddenly lose much of their ability to filter blood, often because of an injury, serious damage to the kidneys or other organs, or exposure to a toxin (poison).
Some of the illnesses that can lead to acute kidney failure include a severe blood loss, severe dehydration, severe drops in blood pressure, heatstroke, severe muscle damage and heart or liver failure.
In addition, anything that blocks the organs' blood supply or the outflow of urine -- including tumors or an enlarged prostate -- can lead to kidney shutdown.
The toxins that can trigger acute kidney failure include such medications such as antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain anesthetics.
Occasionally, procedures done in a hospital can also lead to acute kidney failure.
The death rate from acute renal failure can be high, depending on the cause of the kidney failure and other complications that the patient may have.
This means most patients who survive acute kidney failure can enjoy a complete recovery within one to two months.
While acute kidney failure can happen in days, chronic kidney failure is a slow decline that often spans several years and often leads to irreversible damage.
Diabetes and high blood pressure can slowly damage the kidneys and trigger a long-term decline in function.
Other conditions associated with chronic kidney failure include polycystic kidney disease and use of the drug lithium.
The buildup of fluids and waste products can set off a cascade of complications, including weakened bones, hypertension, stomach ulcers, anemia, miscarriages, changes in skin color, congestive heart failure, and lapses in concentration and memory.
(Not all kidney failure patients -- acute or chronic -- have a decrease in urine.
While these people don't suffer from fluid buildup, imbalances from excess waste products remain a problem.)
When the symptoms of advanced renal failure are present, a person is said to have end-stage renal disease, often called ESRD.
At this point, the patient will need treatment -- either dialysis or a kidney transplant -- to stay alive.
