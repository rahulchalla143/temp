He has been severe pain in the area of his wound.
The inferior ribs that are exposed in his wound end up rubbing against each other with each exhalation causing severe pain.

CXR: Chronic interstitial lung disease with interval improvement and left upper lobe opacity.
No mediastinal fluid collection.
However, given the background of severe emphysema, bronchogenic carcinoma is also considered.
Tiny faint centrilobular nodules more pronounced in the dependent portion of the right lung base may be secondary to infection or aspiration.
Renal U/S: Severe left hydronephrosis with cortical thinning is unchanged compared to [**2174-11-3**].
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 yo M with w/ CAD s/p PCI, s/p CABG c/b wound dehiscence x2 and wound infection requiring ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and tobramycin, h/o rib osteomyelitis, tracheal bronchitis/PNA with pseudomonas, CHF, COPD, HTN who is being transferred from NESH for plastic surgery evaluation of his wound dehiscence.
# Wound Dehiscence: Pt admitted with wound pain.
Plastics was consulted and changed his wound vac several times.
His pain was initally controlled with MS Contin with prn morphine but when his pain could not be controlled, he was started on a morphine PCA.
This controlled the pain and the pt appeared much more comfortable.
The PCA was stopped one day prior to discharge and pt did not require prn pain meds.
# Wound Infection: During the prior admission, cultures from the wound grew pseudomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro, acinetobacter [**Last Name (un) 36**] to gent/tobra and MRSA.
On further evaluation, ID believed that pt had completed a sufficient course of antibiotics for his wound infection.
An MRI was done of the chest which confirmed no evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue collections.
# Fever: Pt spiked a fever on HD#2 associated with resp distress, possibly due to an aspiration event.
Pt was started on ciprofloxacin to cover hx of pseudomonas in his sputum and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter.
# Acute on CRF: Creatinine 2.3 on admission, above baseline of 1.5 but improved from peak of 2.9.
# Respiratory Failure/COPD: Pt is vent dependent but he tolerated trach mask trials well.
His lung mechanics are also complicated by his severe COPD and hx of a lobectomy.
He had no signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
# Lung Nodule: Pt found to have 13mm lung nodule on chest CT.
Aspiration Pneumonia s/p 7 days of antibiotics 3.
Acute on chronic Renal Failure  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
