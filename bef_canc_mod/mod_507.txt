When the pain failed to subside with rest, he went to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He was given full dose aspirin and EKG showedhyperacute t-waves, questionable ST changes.
Repeat EKG showed ST elevations V3-V5, and the patient was taken to cath lab.
In the cath lab, Mr. [**Known lastname 24214**] was found to have 90% lesion of LAD with thrombus at D1, and a 70% lesion with filling defect after D2.
Subsequently, he did have marked oozing around femoral sheath; the sheath was upsized and integrilin was stopped with good effect.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Does note slightly increased DOE over the past few weeks.
HTN 3.

Physical Exam: Exam in CCU Vital signs  Gen: Lying flat, appears well, NAD, resp or otherwise.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple, unable to assess JVP secondary to positioning CV: PMI non-displaced, normal s1/s2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: soft, NTND, no tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.

CATH [**2111-10-16**]: 90% lesion of LAD with thrombus at D1, 70% lesion with filling defect after D2.
60% stenosis of RCA.
TTE [**2111-10-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
There is mild  symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior, distal LV/apical akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left  ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the  sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary  artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2111-10-16**] Left costophrenic sulcus is excluded from the radiograph, precluding assessment of small left pleural effusion.
Right cardiophrenic angle is clear.
The heart is mildly enlarged and there is mild CHF with vascular engorgement and minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.
Lower extremity ultrasound [**2111-10-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT on the left or right legs.
No evidence of CHF.
Small focal patchy opacity in the anterior aspect of one of the lower lobes seen only on lateral view.
This may be due to atelectasis or early focus of infection.
Fever - Mr. [**Known lastname 24214**] developed a fever to 102 with chest film showing question of retrocardiac infiltrate.
Although he had minimal symptoms, given his immunosuppression his team felt that he should receive empiric treatment for pneumonia.
He did also have lower extremity ultrasound studies to assess for DVT as the cause of his fevers; this study showed no evidence of DVT.
Microcytic anemia - The patient had iron studies suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia.
Myocardial infarction 2.
Iron deficiency anemia 3.
Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after developing chest discomfort.
While in the hospital, you had some fevers and sweats that may have been due to pneumonia.
You have an iron-deficiency anemia.
