She describes this pressure as a squeezing sensation, different and worse than her usual anginal symptoms for which she takes nitro.
Usually her pain occurs with exertion or at night when she's not wearing her oxygen and is limited to her arm, but today it was also in her chest as well.
She described the pain as [**2155-9-26**] initially, and nitro at home did not help, nor did increasing her O2 from 2-> 3L.
Initially, the patient was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam.
Cardiology was consulted for the STD seen in the lateral leads, but they felt this was likely c/w demand ischemia given her significant anemia and severe coronary disease.

There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %) with regional variation.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2-3**]:Findings suggesting mild congestive heart failure.
CT head, CTA head/neck, CTP [**2155-2-7**] NON-CONTRAST CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial or parenchymal hemorrhage.
There is mild bihemispheric hypoattenuation of the periventricular and subcortical white matter consistent with sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
The bilateral basal ganglia show small hypoattenuations consistent with old lacunar infarcts.
There is calcification of the intracranial carotid artery.
Also noted is a left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
This represents a thrombus within the right MCA .
Also noted is calcification of the bilateral carotid bulbs.
The vertebral and carotid ostia are unremarkable.
Also noted are sternotomy wires, bibasilar atelectatic changes in the visualized lung apices and a hypoplastic or absent thyroid gland.
There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which is precarinal and measures 14.3 mm.
CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in a large right MCA territory distribution in the right frontoparietal region.
This is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow but normal cerebral blood volume.
This likely represents an acute large infarct with some mismatch possibly representing an area of penumbra.
IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA vascular territory infarct as described above.
CT head [**2155-2-8**] IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
HbA1c 5.5 LDL 33   Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, COPD, HTN, afib who presents with hematochezia, anemia, and angina, sent to MICU initally where she was transfused with HCT back up to 31, c/b NSTEMI with CHF.
# Stroke: has h/o Afib but her anticoagulation was held in the setting of acute GIB complicated by NSTEMI.
The pt was intact neurologically throughout admission until [**2-7**] when she was found to have acute onset dysarthria, L facial droop, L hemiparesis.
Code stroke was called and pt was found to have R MCA embolic infarct on CT head.
She was sent emergently to neuro IR for IA TPA and MERCI clot retrieval.
# Hematochezia: likely due to angiodysplasia vs diverticulosis as pt had colonoscopy in [**2152**] with only polyps.
While on the floor she was transfused 1 more unit of blood and her HCT was maintained around 30 without any evidence of GI bleeding (stools were without blood).
Given her other comorbidities and stable hematocrit it was decided to defer this procedure at this immediate time.
# NSTEMI: Patient has known bad coronary disease with diseased grafts as well taking up to 3 NTG daily for anginal pain.
patient's initial ECG with afib with RVR and lateral STD and TWI; most likely due to demand ischemia.
Pt had CP and 1st set CE was neg, but then subsequent had Trp peak up to 1.8 (CK 556, CKMB 10.4) c/w NSTEMI in setting of acute lower GI bleed.
Her chest pain improved with transfusions, nitro, and morphine, and now pt has been CP free while on the floor.
her lisinopril and imdur were held to avoid hypotension in the setting of GIB.
# Dyspnea/tachypnea: Patient has COPD at baseline, and uses O2 (2L) at night for comfort and angina with exertion.
During the day, she should be using her O2 but she has not been using it due to difficulty with portability.
Given her above h/o GIB complicated by NSTEMI, cardiology/GI consults recommended that due to her CHADS2 score of 3 she should be restarted on ASA 325mg once her GIB was stabilized.
Despite these efforts the pt suffered from an embolic stroke entailed above and therefore will be continued on coumadin with goal INR [**2-19**].
# Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine .
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
L facial droop.
Discharge Instructions: You were initially admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed and chest pain.
During your hospital course you had a stroke which was treated with intraarterial TPA and MERCI clot retrieval.
