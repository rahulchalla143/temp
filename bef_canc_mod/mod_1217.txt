HISTORY: Right proximal humeral fracture.
CT UPPER EXTREMITY WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The preliminary wet read report by the resident issued in the PACS requisition is as follow: "Impacted comminuted fracture of the neck of the right humerus with bone fragments as seen on prior plain film and CT study, with large surrounding hematoma."
There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal humerus, with components involving the surgical neck and both greater and lesser tuberosities.
There is nearly half shaft width anterior displacement of the humeral shaft with respect to the humeral head (series 103B, image 27).
The glenohumeral joint is grossly congruent, but slightly diastatic.
Of note, fracture lines are seen extending into the articular surface of the humeral head, both at its superior margin (series 104B, image 45 and series 3, image 31) and in the mid portion of the articular surface (series 104B, image 38).
There is fluid and edema and probable hemorrhage about the shoulder joint and fluid within the joint space.
Deformity of several upper right thoracic ribs suggests fractures, likely old.
IMPRESSION:  Comminuted fracture of the proximal right humerus, with intra-articular extension.

FINDINGS: The previously identified rounded high density within the right frontal lobe, representing hemorrhage versus hemorrhagic contusion appears stable.
The small amount of blood within bilateral posterior parietal sulci appears slightly more conspicuous compared to prior CT head obtained on [**2113-11-28**].
Small amount of blood is seen layering in the dependent region of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricle slightly increased compared to prior study.
No shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus is identified.
Again seen are high-density air-fluid levels within bilateral maxillary sinus and sphenoid sinus, likely representing evolving blood products.
There is opacification of the right frontal sinus as well as air-fluid level within the left frontal sinus and mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, largely unchanged from prior study.
The right mastoid air cells remain normally aerated while the left is partially fluid filled.
There is soft tissue swelling overlying the region lateral to the right orbit, likely representing slowly resolving hematoma.
Direct comparison with prior study obtained on [**2113-11-28**] is difficult given patient's different positioning, however, t right frontal lobe hemorrhage/contusion, and small bilateral parietal subarachnoid blood is unchanged in distribution and likely unchanged in size.
Small amount of intraventricular blood layering in the dependent region of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles slightly increased compared to prior study, however, direct comparison is difficult secondary to different patient positioning.
Multiple facial bone fractures, and high-density air-fluid level within multiple sinuses largely unchanged from prior exam.
There may be a previous anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are noted.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
His right zygomatic facial fracture was repaired in the operating room on [**12-6**].
On [**11-28**] he was taken to the operating room by Orthopedics for ORIF of his right tib/fib fracture and again on [**12-13**] for ORIF of his right shoulder fracture.
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was also [**Last Name (un) 4221**], he reportedly has a history of diabetes and it was unclear if this was under control prior to his trauma.
He was placed on a First Step mattress for pressure relief.
