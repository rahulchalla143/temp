Briefly, this is a 40M with h/o HTN, aortic dissection in [**2156**] s/p [**Hospital3 9642**] valve on coumadin, who presented to OSH approx 1 week ago with fatigue and R flank pain, found to have right RP perinephric bleed.
Subsequently developed ATN with Cr 6.0 and progressive volume overload requiring intubation and CVVH.
He develop a R pleural effusion, which is not tappable per IR.
Per urology there is right sided renal mass which does not require inpatient work-up at this time.
For hypertension the patient had been treated with labetalol, with SPB 120-160s).
Patient currently feel well, no chest pains or shortness of breath, minimal ([**12-31**]) pain in his right flank.
He can 'feel water on my lungs' but doesnt feel short of breath or have a cough.

Abdominal aortic dissection, extending into the proximal superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis.
Slow flow in the narrowed right renal artery, supplied by retrograde flow in the small aortic false lumen.
Right kidney has been embolized.
Widely patent left renal artery.
Large right renal upper pole mass.
Though no intravenous contrast could be administered, appearances are suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.
Slight intravoxel fat may suggest clear cell etiology though large size without regions of necrosis also suggests chromophobe.
Extensive retroperitoneal and subcapsular hemorrhage extending from the right kidney.
Large 13-cm mass arising from the right renal upper pole.
Increased heterogeneity suggests interval central necrosis possibly due to prior embolization procedure or hypoperfussion in the setting of prior hypovolemia and renal bleed.
The differential diagnosis includes a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma or an oncocytoma.
A papillary renal cell carcinoma is considered less likely.
No renal vein invasion or lymphadenopathy.
Hemorrhagic 4 cm cortical lesion arising from the right renal lower pole.
Given the distribution of the retroperitoneal hemorrhage, this lesion is the likely source.
The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic cyst, renal cell carcinoma, and cortical infarct.
Two hemorrhagic left renal cysts.
Several additional tiny left renal cysts containing proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material.
Aortic dissection extending into the superior mesenteric artery and both common iliac arteries.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Small splenic lesion, likely a hemangioma.
However given aggressive fluid rescucitation and acute renal failure he developed fluid overload and respiratory distress, requiring intubation and CVVH.
This occurred over the course of 2 days, with resolution of hyperkalemia and decrease of creatinine.
The patient was also noted to have a right pleural effusion, but on ultrasound did not appear large enough to tap.
Once extubated, hemodynamically stable and no longer requiring CVVH, he was transferred to the medicine service on heparin drip for further anticoagulation and management.
# Coagulopathy: On arrival to the medicine service, the patient was on a heparin drip only, yet his INR was elevated to 2.7.
The cause of this remained unclear but it was thought to be secondary to acute liver injury, given his elevated enzymes on admission that were slowly resolving.
Coumadin was initially held for thoracentesis and potential for other procedures but was eventually started with heparin bridge.
# Acute renal failure: The patient had some underlying renal insufficiency (Cr 1.6-1.7 at baseline) before the acute hemorrhagic insult.
# Anemia: This was felt to be due to both his hemorrhagic insult as well as anemia of chronic disease given his chronic renal failure.
He maintained a stable hematocrit of 22 for some time.
His iron studies were normal (except for ferritin which was elevated in the setting of acute illness).
# Hypertension: On transfer to the medicine service, the patient's blood pressure ran 160-200/40-60s.
Lisinopril was added on last but caused an acute jump in his creatinine from 1.9 to 3.0.
# Respiratory failure/pleural effusion: The right pleural effusion was noted on CXR during his ICU stay.
Initially afebrile, the patient had several fever spikes (max 102.3) which prompted a thoracentesis and addition of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired and vent-acquired pneumonia.
His thoracentesis was consistant with an exudative effusion, however it was not felt this was an empyema.
He remained afebrile and did not require supplemental oxygen for the remaineder of his stay.
He should have a repeat chest xray done within several weeks after [**Month/Year (2) **] to ensure resolution of pleural effusion.
# Renal mass: The patient had multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the mass, however it is still unclear as to the etiology.
There is concern for multiple etiologies such as renal cell carinoma, hemorrhagic cysts, lymphoma, etc.
# Gout: During his admission the patient had recurrent episodes of polyarticular gout, which was confirmed by arthrocentesis of the left knee.
Given his renal status, it was felt that a one-time dose of prednisone may be the best way to treat his symptoms.
[**Hospital1 **] Disposition: Home  [**Hospital1 **] Diagnosis: perinephric, retroperitoneal bleed acute renal failure hyperbilirubinemia anemia hypertension   [**Hospital1 **] Condition: hemodynamically stable and afebrile   [**Hospital1 **] Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with flank and abdominal pain and found to have a bleed in your abdomen.
You were treated by interventional radiology and had embolization of actively bleeding arteries.
You were also treated for acute kidney failure, fluid overload with hemodialysis and intubation while you were having trouble breathing.
Please make sure to follow-up with your physicans (appointments scheduled below) and have your coumadin level followed each week in coumadin clinic.
When you see your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], make sure you have a repeat chest xray done to ensure resolution of the pleural effusion.
If you experience abdominal or back pain, nausea/vomiting, fevers, chills, blood in the stool or urine, dizziness or lightheadedness, or any other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
