He became hypotensive after that and went to MICU.
Then the patient began having chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from 45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis.
Cath showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA.
RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix given last night and this morning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg IV lasix and metolazone and lasix gtt.
Team is concerned for poor forward flow given LFTs have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, INR >2, and only 600mL UOP with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears somewhat lethargic and uncomfortable but is conversant.

STUDIES: [**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process [**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or malalignment [**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again noted.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with probable basilar atelectasis.
No overt pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis.
Nonspecific mesenteric stranding and small amount of fluid in the abdomen could be secondary to generalized third spacing.
Chronic loculated left sided pleural fluid collection/chronic empyema is stable.
[**2120-7-8**] EEG- This is an abnormal waking EEG because of diffuse polymorphic arrhythmic theta and delta activity.
These findings are suggestive of moderate encephalopathy but of nonspecific cause.
There are no epileptiform discharges or focal abnormalities seen.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
No pathologic focus of enhancement or anatomic substrate for seizure.
Chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses; correlate clinically.
[**2120-7-11**] Portable TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex; the rest of the left ventricle appears hypokinetic with regional variation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was unchanged from prior.
The LAD had diffuse severe disease proximally and occludes at the mid vessel after a tiny diagonal branch.
The Cx had diffuse disease throughout with serial focal 50% stenoses.
The RCA had an ostial 80% stenosis which was heavily calcified.
There was also an 80% heavily calcified 80% stenosis in the mid RCA.
Diffuse mild to moderate disease was seen throughout the rest of the RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 24 mmHg and an LVEDP of 26 mmHg.
There was pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 73/35 mmHg.
Upon careful pullback of a pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta no pressure gradient was seen.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA which supplied a diffusely diseased LAD.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a 3.5x26mm INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated proximally to 4.0mm.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.5x12mm INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated to 3.5mm.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Moderate to severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a BMS.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a BMS.
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with an Angioseal device.
[**2120-7-15**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to a low voltage slow background throughout.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are the most common causes.
Ischemia or hypoxia are other possibilities.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hematoma detected.
Persistent bilateral nephrograms, compatible with severe renal failure, as the last contrast-enhanced study was performed on [**2120-7-10**].
Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior, and inferolateral walls and distal anterior, lateral and apical walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive regional systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD (including proximal RCA).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-11**], global left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
[**2120-7-20**] KUB: 1) No dilated loops of large or small bowel to suggest obstruction or ileus.
No obvious free air identified.
2) Multiple clustered locules of air in the right mid abdomen may represent stool within the colon in an area of prior surgery and are similar to the appearance on the [**2120-7-7**] abdominal CT.
However, the differential diagnosis for this appearance includes air within an abscess.
If there is significant clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal infection, then this area could be further assessed with a CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II, hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**] with weight gain at home and altered mental status.
He had what appeared to be a possible seizure in the ED, resulting in dilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transfer to the MICU.
Then on [**2120-7-11**], he began having chest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from 45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis.
Cath the following day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA, and RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg.
He was intitially transferred back to the cardiology service for management, however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organ dysfunction (renal and liver failure) suggestive of cardiogenic shock, necessitating transfer to the CCU under the heart failure service.
CCU Course:  On arrival patient was started on inotropes, pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloon pump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.
On [**2120-7-17**], he self-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapid decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to the cath lab for IABP re-placement.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down from 40-45%).
Cath on [**7-12**] showed 80% ostial stenosis of the RCA, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.
He appeared to be in decompensated CHF by renal status, crackles on exam, and mild peripheral edema.
He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA, his LVEDP was elevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service.
Despite aggresive diuresis, patient continued to [**Last Name (un) 22977**] clinically, with high filling pressures, low CI, low UOP and was transfered to CCU.
The patient was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted.
Howver he conintued to have high pressor requirements.
Concern was for shock liver vs med effect, Hepatology was consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd to hold atorvastatin, obtain RUQ U/S which showed possibly fatty liver with patent vasculature.
The following day, he developed encephalopathy and lactulose was started.
#.Fall at Home- His initial insult was a well-described mechanical fall from slipping on mineral oil, and he did not endorse symptoms consistent with vasovagal syncope.
We also considered orthostasis given history of same vs. arrhythmia vs. seizure given possible seizure in CT scan.
Neurology consulted and had a low suspicion of seizure.
