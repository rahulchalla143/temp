Admission Date:  [**2178-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-4-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Zofran  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: transfer from OSH for acute renal failure, nephrolithiasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation placement of left nephrostomy tube cystoscopy  History of Present Illness: 70 y/o M with a PMHx of nephrolithiasis, COPD, UC, HTN who was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hosp on [**10-2**] for 3d of worsening L flank pain.
Today, c/o dull discomfort in abd, not severe.
Shortly after admission, transferred to the ICU with the following admit note: 70M PMH nephrolithiasis, COPD (FEV1 of 1.17 on continuous 2-2.5L O2 at home, UC, CRF (baseline creatinine 1.5) who was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hosp on [**2178-10-2**] for three-day history of worsening L flank pain and hematuria.
He was found to have an 11mm calculus in mid-portion of L kidney and 8mm in lower pole with mild-mod hydronephrosis.
The patient was not believed to be a candidate for a surgical procedure given the requirement of general anesthesia and intubation.
The first was for AF with RVR responding to lopressor and diltiazem with conversion to NSR.
The second and third were for anxiety, hypoxia, and SVT, again responding to lopressor and diltiazem.
On transfer, the patient complains of left-sided flank pain.
Neck: supple, no LAD CV: RRR, nml s1,s2, no m/r/g Resp: Distant breath sounds.
Prolonged expiration, sparse wheezes Abd: soft, nontender Back: left nephrostomy tube with clear yellow urine drainage Ext: 2+ edema bilateral LE to knee Neuro: AAOx2.
Imaging: RENAL U.S.  [**2178-10-5**] 12:56 PM IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized left inter-to-lower pole collecting system calculi with mild left-sided hydronephrosis.
No distal ureteral/bladder calculi could be identified, however, exam is limited due to bladder decompression from decompressed Foley.
Left proximal ureter obstructing stone with moderate hydronephrosis and proximal ureter dilation.
Severe emphysema.
Bladder stone .
1-cm left renal stone with 5-mm obstructing left ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis; perinephric fat stranding likely due to recent intervention.
No perinephric fluid collection or bowel perforation.
Persistent mildly dilated large bowel proximally with gas and liquid stool.
Air bubbles along the dependent cecal and ascending colon wall are most likely luminal but the possibility of a component of pneumatosis cannot be completely excluded in this patient with mechanical ventilation and sepsis.
Large urinary bladder stone.
Bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis and severe bullous and centrilobular emphysema.
Increased opacity in the left lower lobe could be superimposed pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumatosis.
Interval placement of percutaneous nephrostomy catheter, with a left renal stone and two left ureteral stones.
Large bladder stone.
Diffuse anasarca.
Bilateral effusion and atelectasis with consolidation in the right lung base, unchanged.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricle with mild resting outflow gradient.
Due to poor echo windows, a wall motion abnormality cannot be ruled out.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70M PMH nephrolithiasis, COPD (FEV1 of 1.17 on continuous 2-2.5L O2 at home, UC, HTN presenting with obstructing ureteral stone, acute on [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU for peri-procedure hypotension.
# Urosepsis: Admitted with urosepsis in the setting of obstructing nephrolithiasis.
# Respiratory failure/COPD exacerbation (acute on chronic bronchitis): He has significant underlying lung disease with COPD on 2L home O2 (FEV1 1.17L (35% pred).
He was intubated [**12-26**] respiratory failure and remained ventilated for roughly 6 days.
Respiratory distress likely represented a COPD exacerbation in the setting of UTI and urosepsis.
One episode of hypoxia on [**10-13**] thought to be from autopeeping, improved with increased PEEP.
He remained mildly short of breath though with good O2 sats throughout the rest of his MICU stay, and subsequently returned to baseline on the floor.
# delerium: Likely component of multiple meds, acute illness and ICU stay resulting in delirium.
# Pneumatosis intestinalis: abd CT on [**10-8**] showed pneumatosis intestinalis.
He was deemed to be a poor surgical candidate.
# Leukocytosis: He had persistently high WBC and low grade fever.
# Hypertension: He became more consistently hypertensive and tachycardic toward the end of his stay.
# Hypernatremia: Mild, likely secondary to relatively free water output from kidney - post-obstructive diuresis.
# Hydronephrosis/nephrolithiasis: Left proximal ureter obstructing stone with moderate hydronephrosis and proximal ureter dilation noted on CT as above.
Treatment for urosepsis as above.
Cystoscopy showed large papillary bladder tumor obstructing trigone.
He has follow up scheduled with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**] to discuss long term options for both stones and tumor .
# PAF: He was transiently in atrial fibrillation, likely caused by his sepsis and hypotension.
He was begun on heparin briefly for anticoagulation, but he developed a urological bleed, so the heparin was stopped.
No anticoagulation recommended in this setting because of the propensity of bleeding from bladder tumor.
# Hematuria: likely [**12-26**] heparin and large bladder stone/tumor.
# Acute on CRF: Improved to 1.1 then jump to 1.4 o/n in setting of lasix and ketorolac.
# acute on chronic diastolic heart failure -- mildly hypervolemic on discharge, probably contributing to hypoxia during exertion.
# UC:  No active issues.
- sulfasalazine d/c'd as there is tentative evidence that it may exacerbate lung disease and already on steroids for COPD - can consider restarting sulfasalazine when respiratorily stable .
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
E. coli bacteremia with septic shock and respiratory failure 2. urinary obstruction from nephrolithiasis s/p stent placement 3. bladder mass, awaiting biopsy for pathology 4.
COPD exacerbation on home oxygen 5. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, now resolved 6. delerium 7. acute on chronic diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Stable, continues to have mild delerium especially in early AM hours, but improving.
Additionally, he has desaturation during ambulation and requires higher amount of oxygen for exertion.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for kidney stones, but had a long hospitalization secondary to severe infection from the stones, renal failure, respiratory failure.
Call your primary doctor with questions or return to the emergency department with fever, chest pain, decreased urination, worsening mental status or other concerns.
