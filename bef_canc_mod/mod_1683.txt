In brief, 77 year old female with COPD on home O2, h/o T3 lung Ca s/p R pneumonectomy presented to ED with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and admitted to ICU on [**4-5**] for shortness of breath thought secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Patient N/V/D started day prior to ED presentation with 4 episodes of non-bloody emesis and 4 episodes of diarrhea and RUQ pain, sharp without radiation.
RUQ U/S was negative, and CT abd showed a peri-duodenal fluid collection.
No sick contacts, no recent travel, and no recent antibiotics.
She was observed overnight in ED, and was about to be discharged when she had a nebulizer treatment and then developed acute shortness of breath.
She was admitted to MICU and had an additional episode of acute shortness of breath associated with duoneb treatment.
It was felt that perhaps the nebulaizer itself was causing her acute anxiety, or the albuterol was making her tachycardic and more short of breath, although patient states that she has used nebulaizers at home without difficulty.
No nightsweats.
She was started on solumedrol in ICU and plan to transition to prednisone taper on [**4-7**] and also started on azithro for COPD flare.
