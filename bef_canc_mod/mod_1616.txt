There is a newly appeared plate-like atelectasis at the level of the left lung hilus.
Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus suggests a minimal left-sided pleural effusion.
In the right lung, there is minimal atelectasis at the bases of the right upper lobe.
Newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia are not seen.
No evidence of overhydration, no pneumothorax.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Severe mitral annular calcification.
Severe thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.

Results were Conclusions PREBYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is severe thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
A tissue valve is seen in the aortic position, no perivalvular leaks are seen, max gradient 26, mean gradient 12.
A tissue valve is seen in the mitral position, no perivalvular leaks are seen, max gradient 8, mean gradient 2.
LV EF is somewhat reduced after bypass, the infrolateral, lateral and anterolateral walls are hypokinetic in addition to being intravascular volume dehydrated.
She was noted to have periods of intermittant atrial fibrillation for which was treated with Beta blockers and Amiodarone following which she converted to sinus rhythm.
