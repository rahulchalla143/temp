Admission Date:  [**2153-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**] Chief Complaint: Increasing shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2153-10-11**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal mammary to diagonal artery, vein grafts to left anterior descending and obtuse marginal) and Mitral Valve Repair utilizing a 27mm Duran AnCore Band   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] is a 57 year old female with congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram at that time revealed severe three vessel disease, severe mitral regurgitation, an LVEF of [**10-14**]%, and left ventricular thrombus.
Workup was also notable for a right upper lobe slightly spiculated 10-mm lung overlying the 6th intercostal space, worrisome for lung cancer.
Past Medical History: Congestive Heart Failure, Coronary artery disease, Mitral regurgitation, History of Left Ventricular thrombus, Recent NSTEMI, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia, History of tobacco abuse, History of pneumonia, Lung Nodule  Social History: Tobacco abuse: 2ppd for approximately 40 years.
No history of premature cardiac disesase.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 109/66, HR 70, RR 14, SAT  99% on room air General: thin female in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, Neck: supple, no JVD, bilateral carotid bruits noted Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2153-10-9**] CT Scan: 1.
Spiculated 11-mm right upper lobe lung nodule concerning for neoplasm.
There is also associated precarinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of metastases.
Mild centrilobular emphysema.
Mild tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification in the right lower lobe is nonspecific and may be due to superimposed infection, inflammation, or atelectasis.
[**2153-10-11**] TEE: 1 - PRE-BYPASS:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with an estimated EF of 15-20 %.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of inferior and inferoseptal walls.
There is an apical left ventricular  aneurysm  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild MAC.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No paravalvular leak.
[**2153-10-13**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified on these limited views.
[**2153-10-16**] 05:55AM BLOOD WBC-7.3 RBC-4.07* Hgb-12.1 Hct-35.6* MCV-88 MCH-29.8 MCHC-34.0 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-247# [**2153-10-16**] 05:55AM BLOOD Glucose-78 UreaN-5* Creat-0.5 Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-102 HCO3-28 AnGap-13  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] was admitted and underwent further evaluation which included dental consultation, CT scan for pulmonary nodule and carotid ultrasound for bilateral carotid bruits.
Dental consultation found evidence of several tooth fractures and recommended several tooth extractions.
Full body CT scan was notable for a spiculated 11-mm right upper lobe lung nodule concerning for neoplasm with associated precarinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
There was no evidence of metastases.
CT scan also revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and diverticulosis.
Carotid ultrasound showed a 60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
The carotid ultrasound also found evidence of right-sided subclavian steal.
Given the above results, tooth extractions will be arranged postoperatively, and she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**](Thoracic Surgery) as an outpatient after she recovers from her upcoming cardiac surgery.
Given only moderate carotid disease, no intervention was indicated.
There were no complications and she transferred to the CSRU in stable condition.
Late on postoperative day two, she experienced altered mental status, aphasia, nausea and vomiting, along with decreased left sided movements.
She was started on intravenous Dopamine and emergently underwent head CT scan which found no obvious evolving large territorial infarction.
She was seen by neurology who felt that it was due to hypetension and that her symptoms were related to hypoperfusion in the setting of known carotid disease and subclavian steal.
Her aphasia and left sided weakness completely resolved.
