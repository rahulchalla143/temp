CK 140, cre 1.2, INR 1.4, BNP 2081. pt noted to have troponin 1.24 (0-0.1 range nl), ?pulmonary edema on CXR.
Plan had been to cath pt at OSH, however initially deferred because of rising crt with diuresis.
TTE showed global hypokinesis.
Stress test on [**11-17**] also showed depressed EF.
ischemic CM (per report) CHF (EF 15-20%) ?DM (pt denies) COPD (dx ~6 mo ago) HTN (50+ yrs) seizure disorder ([**3-6**] head trauma)  Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name2 (NI) **].
Family History: no premature CAD or SCD, mother "big heart", died in 80s, father died of leukemia.
Physical Exam: VS: 97.2 110/72 68 30 99%2L 70kg GEN: NAD HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear, MMM, no LAD, no carotid bruits.
CV: distant, regular, nl s1, s2, no m/r/g.
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS, no HSM.
Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Moderately elevated right sided filling pressures.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
Moderately severe depression of cardiac output.
Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
2+ mitral regurgitation.
The mid RCA lesion was predilated with 1.5 and 2.0 mm balloons, stented with two 2.25 mm bare metal stents and post dilated with the stent balloon.
The proxmal RCA lesion was direcly stented with a 2.25 mm balloon and post dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon.
(see PTCA comments) The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.
[**2127-11-26**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion have increased.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Hyperinflation indicates severe COPD and diaphragmatic calcification probably due to asbestos exposure.
[**2127-11-17**] CXR (OSH): mild congestive changes cannot be excluded, no definte infiltrates, no pleural effusions.
[**2127-11-14**] TTE - limited study, LV dilated, normal thikcness, globally hypokinetic, EF 15-20%, no segmental WMA.
[**2127-11-17**] - persantine myoview nuclear study (OSH): large inferior wall infarct, reversible ischemia affecting the anterior wall, marked LV dilation with global hypokinesia.
[**2127-7-24**] ([**Hospital1 **]) MyoView stress test - dilated LV at rest & stress.
large inferior wall infarct without ischemia.
significant inferior wall hypokinesis with diffuse global hypokinesis of the remaining walls.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] medicine service in hemodynamically stable condition, without chest pain, with ongoing shortness of breath.
# CAD - pt reports no known prior h/o CAD.
Stress test from [**7-8**] showed depressed EF (15-30%).
TTE on [**11-17**] showed EF 15-20% with global hypokinesis.
Etiology of cardiomyopathy initially unclear: most likely ischemic though alcohol-related also possible given alcohol history.
He and his family ultimately declined CABG given the high risk of the procedure.
# CHF: Pt initially presented with florid CHF to OSH.
He was diuresed with significant symptomatic improvement.
As above, echocardiogram showed an EF 15-20%, bilateral ventricle dilation & hypokinesis, but no significant valvular disease.
# anemia - pt noted to have hct 38-41 @ OSH, dropped to 34 after heparin started.
iron studies suggest some component of iron deficiency.
## htn: pt has long h/o htn, apparently controlled previously with lisinopril only.
# NEURO - ?right carotid pulse absent on admission, however carotid doppler shows patent vessel, <40% stenosis.
No neurological deficits previously, or on current exam [**11-22**] (5/5 strength triceps, biceps, delts, wrists, dorsoflexion, plantarflexion, toes downgoing.
no new meds.
Transient confusion thought to be most likely [**3-6**] sundowning as is worse in PM, and subsequently stabilized.
# COPD - unclear if pt has underlying COPD.
Pt had long h/o smoking.
CXR The lungs showed lungs hyperexpanded bilaterally.
Pt started on combivent/albuterol inhalers as he was thought to likely have some COPD.
# seizure disorder - apparently [**3-6**] head trauma from heavy machinery incident ~20 years ago, with seizures occuring after second fall ~1 yr later.
# gerd - pt on zantac as outpatient, which was continued here.
