[**2191-9-13**] Shoudler xray: A single axillary view again demonstrates the comminuted displaced fracture of the left humeral surgical neck.
[**2191-9-13**] CXR: No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process on these frontal views.
No acute intracranial process.
[**2191-9-13**] CT c-spine w/o contrast: The apparent increased/new Grade 1 anterolistheses, above, may relate to positioning in greater degree of flexion than on the prior study, in a hard cervical collar.
There is a displaced oblique-transverse fracture of the left humeral neck, visible on the scout topogram.
No acute intra-abdominal injury.
Slight irregularity of the pancreatic duct and heterogeneity of the pancreatic head, similar to prior CTA abdomen on [**2190-1-29**].
Multiple hypodensities in the kidneys likely cysts, compatible with polycystic kidney disease.
Scattered liver cysts are unchanged.
[**2191-9-19**] EDG: Erythema and friability in the middle third and lower third of the esophagus compatible with severe esophagitis (biopsy) Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis Erythema in the whole examined duodenum compatible with duodenitis  Brief Hospital Course: 46F with history of heavy alcohol usage and reported history of alcohol withdrawal seizures (last 5-6yrs ago)presents with humeral fracture and numerous falls recently, more concerning for GIB than seizures at this time.
# Hypotension: Patient was monitored in the ICU and initially resuscitated with PRBCs given concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
With stablization of her hematocrit, patient was then rescusitated with IVFs for hypotension thought to be related to hypovolemia in part from possible GIB vs dehydration from ETOH-induced diuresis and poor PO intake.
# Hyponatremia: Upon admission, patient was thought to have hypovolemic hyponatremia, given her dehydration from ETOH abuse and lack of recent PO intake.
# Macrocytic Anemia/Concern for gastrointestinal bleeding: Outpatient work-up has been consistent with anemia [**12-30**] alcohol use given macrocytosis not explained with folate, b12, nor pernicious anemia (IF antibody negative).
This admission her hct was below baseline (though baseline is somewhat unclear), and patient was having guaiac positive dark stools, concerning for a gastrointestinal bleed.
She reported an episode of melena prior to discharge which let the team to consult GI.
GI performed an [**Month/Day (2) **] and did not find any source of active gastrointestinal bleeding and was consistent with gastritis and duodenitis.
# Humeral fracture: Humerus fracture s/p a fall.
No role for surgical intervention.
Pain was managed with PO hydromorphone.
# Falls/Question of seizures: Her history was consistent with traumatic falls.
Patient reports recent drinking, and was admitted with serum ETOH 243, making withdrawal seizures less likely.
Falls were attributed to inebriation vs. hypotension [**12-30**] hypovolemia (blood loss and dehydration).
Hematocrit was monitored and patient was transfused 1 unit on admission to the ICU and 2 units the following day for low hematocrit, as above.
There was no evidence of seizures or arrythmias on telemetry during her admission.
She had 1 episode of tremors in the setting of anxiety that lasted about 7 minutes.
There was no LOC, tongue biting, confusion, or incontinence.
The event was not consistent with a true seizure and was believed to be related to anxiety.
# UTI: Patient denies fevers, chills, dysuria or increased urinary frequency.
She was treated briefly with Levofloxacin due to positive culture however this treatment was discontinued because patient was asymptomatic and all U/As were negative.
Per records and patient, she has history of withdrawal seizures.

You came in with very low blood pressure, low sodium, and a broken arm.
You were treated in the intensive care unit for several days due to these abnormalities.
Your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] you and decide if you should have further evaluation for these events with a neurologist.
There was also concern for a bleed in your GI tract.
The GI doctors did [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] which showed gastritis and esophagitis .
We started you on a medicine to help with these symptoms but stopping all alcohol intake is the best treatment.
Social work also evaluated you in the hospital and provided you with resources to seek help with your alcohol use.
