Additional Imaging: INDICATION: Altered mental status, history of transplant, patient on tacrolimus, hypertension, question PRES cause for altered mental status.
FINDINGS:  MR OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  On the axial FLAIR sequence, a somewhat unusual appearance of the cerebral cortex is noted with slightly increased signal intensity, along with slightly increased signal intensity of the cerebral white matter.
In addition, there are periventricular FLAIR hyperintense areas in the frontal and the parietal lobes and partly extending into the occipital lobes.
There is no focus of decreased diffusion to suggest acute infarction.
Again visualized is a prominent cavum velum interpositum , measuring approximately 3.1 cm; an associated arachnoid cyst cannot be completely excluded.
There is displacement of the internal cerebral veins and the pineal gland by the cyst with thinning of the pineal gland.
There is no mass effect on the tectum or the aqueduct.
There is also mild thinning of the superior-posterior aspect of the body of the corpus callosum.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells and fluid in the nasopharynx and the sphenoid sinus, likely related to intubation.
2D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: Study is limited due to technical reasons.
Somewhat unusual appearance of the brain, with increased conspicuity of the cortex diffusely with slightly increased signal intensity and also in parts of the cerebral white matter on the FLAIR sequence.
IV contrast could not been administered due to low EGFR.
Periventricular hyperintense areas are likely nonspecific in appearance and may relate to small vessel ischemic or inflammatory changes.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 56-year-old man with history of acute mental status change, rule out PRES, evaluate for interval change.
TECHNIQUE: Axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained, axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility, and axial diffusion-weighted sequences, 2D time-of-flight arteriography of the neck vessels was also obtained, and multiple rotational images and axial source images were provided.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior examination, no significant changes are identified, again the ventricles and sulci are prominent for the patient's age, on FLAIR and T2, multiple scattered areas of high signal intensity are demonstrated in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
A focal area of low signal intensity is noted in the ventral aspect of the left basal ganglia, below the head of the caudate nucleus (image 14, series #12), with heterogeneous signal on the corresponding FLAIR sequence, possibly consistent with residual blood products from an old ischemic or hemorrhagic event, this area is identified on the prior head CT dated [**2185-3-1**] (image 13, series #2).
The ventricular system appears unchanged with a prominent septum cavum interpositum.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute or subacute ischemic changes.
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening at the ethmoidal air cells and right sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: In comparison with the prior examinations, no significant changes are identified, persistent periventricular areas of high signal intensity demonstrated on T2 and FLAIR, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
A focal area of magnetic susceptibility and heterogeneous signal is noted on the ventral aspect of the basal ganglia on the left, below the head of the caudate nucleus, possibly representing residual blood products in this region.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes or PRES.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted at the ethmoidal air cells and right sphenoid sinus, bilateral patchy mucosal thickening noted at the mastoid air cells.
EEG: [**Date range (1) 80477**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG, due the presence of an unreactive, mixed [**3-29**] Hz theta frequency and [**1-27**] Hz delta frequency background, with significant voltage suppression.
This pattern is consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy, commonly caused by medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection.
Occasionally, there were periods of semirhythmic 1 Hz generalized delta slowing seen.
However, there were no electrographic seizures or epileptiform features noted .
Brief Hospital Course: 56 M with cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p OLTx on [**9-/2184**] p/w altered mental status with a clinical diagnosis of PRES, who is status post intubatation for airway protection who was discharged home in stable condition.
Examination by Neurology was notable for "Confusion (A&Ox1, to self), left facial droop, and a rightward eye deviation (no nystagmus) and left-sided visual neglect with otherwise intact CN testing.
Also, left arm and leg weakness but normal tone (hard to assess strength with lack of cooperation with exam [**1-26**] confusion/L-neglect), hypertonicity of the Right-UE (flexed and tremulous) and hypertonicity of the Right-LE (extended and still).
Somewhat unusual appearance of the brain, with increased conspicuity of the cortex diffusely with slightly increased signal intensity and also in parts of the cerebral white matter on the FLAIR sequence.
IV contrast could not been administered due to low EGFR.
Periventricular hyperintense areas are likely nonspecific in appearance and may relate to small vessel ischemic or inflammatory changes.
Small prominent focus at the confluence of right A1 and A2 segments, correlation with MRA head can be helpful.
An EEG was also performed and was interpretted by Neurology as "negative for seizure, positive for encephalopathy", which likely indicated PRES as an etiology.
His hypertension was managed with addidition of amlodipine.
Upon transfer to the Hepatology team: 56 M with cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p OLTx on [**9-/2184**] p/w altered mental status with a clinical diagnosis of PRES, who is status post intubatation for airway protection who was discharged home in stable condition.
# Encephalopathy: He presented with hyperglycemia, hypertension and AMS and was given a diganosis of PRES.
There was concern for a potential seizure but no evidence of seizure activity on EEG and he was started on Keppra.
# Hypertension: He presented with high blood pressure and Amlodipine was added to his medication regiment to meet his BP goal of <140 given his diagnosis of PRES.
# Sinus tachycardia: He had an elevated HR that was thought to be secondary to decreased volume and delayed administration of beta blocker.
He had no elevation of inflammatory markers and no fevers to suggest infection.
# Cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p OLT: It was thought that Tacrolimus induced PRES and he was transitioned to Sirolimus as part of his immunosuppresive regiment.
# Chronic anemia: His labs suggest anemia of chronic disease.
He was monitored for any accute blood loss.
You were though to have a condition called PRES which was due to one of your medications.
