HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old male with a history of bipolar disorder complaining of intermittent substernal chest pain starting on [**2145-6-20**].
The chest pain became constant and markedly increased on the morning of presentation and included shortness of breath, nausea, and radiation to both shoulders.
Electrocardiogram there showed ST elevations, V1 through V6, one in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in 2, 3 and AVF, Q waves in V1 through V3, 3 and AVF.
After catheterization ST segments remained elevated in V2 through V6 and an [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions persisted in leads 2, 3 and AVF and Q waves were present in V1 through V4.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal left main left anterior descending with total proximal occlusion just after a high first septal.
Severe disease was also noted diagonal 2 which was not treated.
TIMI 3 flow was noted and atrial stenosis was achieved.
The left circumflex showed serial 30% lesions and a large obtuse marginal 2 had an 80% stenosis.
Right coronary artery showed two serial 90% lesions and a large right marginal.
Dopamine was required transorally for perfusion hypotension.
Persistent anterior chest pain after catheterization.
Left ventriculogram showed anteroapical akinesis with hyperdynamic basis and a 40% ejection fraction.
Bipolar disorder.
History of basal cell carcinoma.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, no jugulovenous distension distention.
No peripheral edema.
Because of the anteroapical akinesis noted on left ventriculogram the patient was started on an heparin drip as well as Coumadin when the Integrilin drip finished.
Given that the patient had bilateral basilar crackles as well as a subjective stent of inability to get a complete breath, he was diuresed on several successive days with 20 to 40 mg of intravenous Lasix to maintain a negative fluid balance.
Outpatient medication regimen for bipolar disease was continued.
On hospital day #3 the patient did have recurrent chest pain in the morning which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine as well as Ativan.
There were no electrocardiogram changes and cycle of enzymes continued to decrease with no bump.
