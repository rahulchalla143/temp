Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, or syncope.
Positive for ankle edema as above.
A CXR revealed mild volume overload and a left lower lobe small opacity, which could reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, with possible superimposed pneumonia.

Biatrial enlargement is present with particularly prominent left atrial enlargement.
Contrast-enhanced images demonstrate normal opacification of the central and segmental and large subsegmental pulmonary vessels without evidence of pulmonary embolism, however, there is significant motion from respiratory movement, limiting evaluation in the subsegmental branches.
No definite PE is seen within these limitations.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is ground-glass posterior opacity in bilateral lung bases.
There are more confluent consolidative opacities in the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which could reflect pneumonia or aspiration.
Additional areas of left lower lobe nodular opacities are present (2:19, 2:25, 28), these could reflect an underlying infectious process.
There is mild septal thickening, predominantly at the bases suggesting underlying heart failure.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is diffuse demineralization with extensive multilevel degenerative disease and a dextroconvex upper thoracic curvature.
No focal lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are present.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 28564**] Reason: please evaluate for PNA, CHF    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    83 year old woman with new onset shortness of breath in setting of NSTEMI and a    fib with RVR.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    please evaluate for PNA, CHF    Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: New onset of shortness of breath in setting of non-ST elevation MI and atrial fibrillations.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2179-6-2**] obtained at 4:44 p.m.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, but there is increased bibasal consolidation accompanied by pleural effusion, findings that might be consistent with aspiration.
There is no evidence of failure.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or appreciable increase in pleural effusion which is currently present, small to moderate, bilateral.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 83yo female with a fib, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the CCU on [**2179-6-2**] s/p mechanical fall at home with acute onset SOB in setting of CHF, possible pneumonia, a fib with RVR, and elevated cardiac enzymes.
Shortness of Breath: Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure and Pneumonia CXR on admission revealed mild volume overload with left lower lobe small opacity, thought to reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, with superimposed pneumonia a possibility.
A CTA of the chest did not demonstrate a PE, but did reveal scattered groundglass and nodular lung consolidation, most apparent in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and compatible with pneumonia, as well as cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions and mild fluid overload.
The patient's SOB was thought to be secondary to CHF exacerbation in the setting of AF with RVR and possible NSTEMI, as cardiac enzymes were elevated on admission (on admission TnT 0.36 and max 0.63 with max CK-MB 47).
Metoprolol tartrate was added on [**2179-6-3**] for rate control, as the patient's heart rate remained elevated in the 90s-100s.
A TTE on [**2179-6-3**] demonstrated regional left ventricular systolic dysfunciton consistent with coronary artery disease, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was also treated empirically with levofloxacin for CAP, as CXR and chest CT findings on admission suggested possible focal consolidation, and the patient had an elevated WBC of 20.9 on admission.
Her oxygen was weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula, and her symptoms were much improved.
She remained afebrile and her antibiotics were stopped due to diarrhea (C diff negative x2) but her WBC continued to fall - WBC 13.4 on discharge.
Elevated cardiac enzymes Enzymes elevated on admission, and peaked at 0.63.
It was thought the elevation was secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of a fib with RVR and the stress of the mechanical fall, and less likely to be due to ACS.
The patient was initially started on Aspirin 325mg, Plavix, and high-dose statin while the diagnosis of NSTEMI was considered.
She had a TTE on [**2179-6-3**] that revealed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunciton consistent with coronary artery disease.
The patient remained CP free throughout her hospitalization.
Chronic atrial fibrillation The patient's heart rhythm was a fib with RVR on admission.
On the night of [**2179-6-4**], her HR jumped to the 110s, and the patient became mildly symptomatic with a slight drop in BP.
Telemetry review revealed the patient was having a fib with aberrancy.
4. s/p Fall Patient's story most consistent with mechanical fall, without LOC.
Non-contrast CT head did not reveal any acute intracranial pathology.
Hyponatremia - Na was stable at 130 throughout admission, likely patient's baseline.
Hypercholesterolemia - The patient's atorvastatin dose was increased to 80mg daily.
Diarrhea -Patient developed diarrhea for 1 day.
Diazepam 2mg PO BID prn anxiety 7.
Diazepam 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three times a day as needed for diarrhea.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR and Chem 7 on [**2179-6-9**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Woodbriar - [**Location (un) 4444**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute coronary Syndrome with Demand Ischemia S/P Fall with Myositis Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Hypertension Pneumonia Acute on Chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a fall and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid heart rate.
You also had some fluid overload and some heart strain because of the heart rate.
You also may have had a pneumonia that was seen on the CT scan.
You had some diarrhea that resolved after the antibiotics were discontinued.
There was no sign of infection in your stool.
Decrease Lisinopril to 20 mg daily because of low blood pressures 4.
