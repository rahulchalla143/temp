Admission Date:  [**2142-7-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-7-25**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction thirty years ago who presented with increasing angina over the past year associated with nocturnal orthopnea.
The patient suffers from anginal symptoms two to three times per week.
Dobutamine stress test done [**2142-2-1**], showed progressive anginal symptoms at low workload without significant electrocardiographic changes.
However, echocardiogram showed evidence of prior myocardial infarction with inducible ischemia at achieved workload and persistent apical hypokinesis.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial     infarction thirty years ago.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with retinopathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he is an engaging older gentleman in no apparent distress.
Skin no rashes, scars or lesions.
Anicteric sclera.
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally, no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Heart regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities are warm and well perfused, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No varicosities noted.
Pulses 2+ femoral bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis and radial bilaterally.
No carotid bruits.
Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process, no pleural effusions, elevated left hemidiaphragm with associated gastric distention, tortuous aorta, normal heart size.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 on postoperative day number one for continued cardiopulmonary recovery, however, on postoperative day number two, the patient went into sinus tachycardia with heart rate to the 160s.
On postoperative day number three, he went into rapid atrial fibrillation with rate in the 130s while ambulating.
The patient spontaneously converted but continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation and was therefore started on Amiodarone p.o.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for close neurologic monitoring.
On further investigation, it was found that the patient had a history of over one year of having a sella turcica mass which was completely compressing his internal carotid artery on the left per magnetic resonance scan., The patient's neurologic status continued to improve to baseline at which he was alert and oriented times four with sensation grossly intact, cranial nerves grossly intact except for mild right ptosis and motor strength intact bilaterally.
No effusions, no vegetations.
Bilateral carotid duplex showed 100% left internal carotid artery occlusion, no pathology on the right internal carotid artery with normal antegrade flow, right to left, of his vertebral arteries.
Neurologically, he remained oriented, however, had difficulty ambulating and it was felt that an acute rehabilitation facility would best serve his needs for cardiopulmonary recovery.
On discharge, with suspected patient mental status change, it was felt to possibly be multifactorial taking into effect his history of an intracranial mass which is chronic with no acute changes found on CT, possibly metabolic with tighter glucose control sought, his postoperative atrial fibrillation controlled on Lopressor and Amiodarone.
The patient also scheduled for outpatient electroencephalogram on [**2142-7-28**], to evaluate for possible seizure activity.
