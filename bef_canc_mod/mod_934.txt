She is status post left pneumonectomy for stage 3A lung cancer who was recently discharged against medical advise to attend a [**Hospital1 **] funeral for her recently deceased son.
She had been having poor oxygen saturations and hypotension prior to her discharge.
She also had been having periodic runs of atrial fibrillation and had been treated with a beta-blocker for that also prior to her discharge.
She had returned to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in the interim and began gradually having increased shortness of breath.
At that time she complained of shortness of breath, fatigue, chills and fevers.
She denies chest pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She appeared in moderate distress with absent breath sounds on the left and crackles on the right half way up.
She had no extremity edema.
Her chest x-ray showed status post left pneumonectomy and atelectasis at the right base.
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION:  The patient is admitted for moderate respiratory distress with failure to thrive with decreased po intake.
There was a question of an episode of aspiration early that morning.
A KUB demonstrated retained contrast in the stomach and tube feeds through the feeding J tube were held at that moment.
On [**2150-4-1**] the patient was found to be in increasing respiratory distress with a PCO2 of 63 and a PAO2 of 155 on 4 liters of nasal cannula.
She did become confused and nearly unresponsive with an increase in PCO2 and decreased saturations.
On the morning of [**2150-4-2**] secondary to her preceding change in mental status a CT scan of her head was obtained, which failed to reveal any neurological event.
She is also started on Levaquin for the question of aspiration on the prior day.
The patient on [**2150-4-4**] did have an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
It was felt that this could be secondary to edema around the Witzel tube region or question of an anatomic obstruction.
The patient's obstructive symptoms did remit and a repeat KUB revealed that she had moved contrast into her large bowel.
The patient continued to make evidence of improvement.
Her Zosyn was discontinued and she was continued on Levaquin for a one week course for a question of an aspiration event.
She had no more events of atrial fibrillation from the [**3-9**] on.
Of note when the patient is taking po please make sure the cuff is down and the Passy Muir valve is on to better monitor for overt signs or symptoms of aspiration such as a change in voice or cough and so the patient can cough any potentially aspirated material in her oral cavity.
Also the recommendations is that if the patient is to become more cooperative in her acceptance of po, a video swallow study to rule out aspiration given her history of a paralyzed left true vocal fold would be indicated.
However, it was felt that at the time of discharge she would not be cooperative for a video swallow.
