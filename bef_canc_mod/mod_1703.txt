Admission Date:  [**2137-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14062**] Chief Complaint: ascities, lower extremity edema, weight gain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 87M with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%), atrial fib/flutter, DM2, extensive EtOH Hx (last drink 6 mo ago) who was seen in [**Hospital 191**] clinic for progressive weight gain (baseline 175-180 lbs), ascites, leg edema with SOB beginning ~1 wk ago.
Pt was most recently in the hospital in [**3-31**] for CHF exacerbation.
However, he presented to the ED on [**2137-5-1**] with hematuria and was found to have INR of 9 so coumadin was stopped by his PCP.
Pt had a single episode of emesis of clear fluid in the ED, another episode of reportedly blood-tinged vomitus, and then ~200cc maroon-colored emesis on the floor.
Pt reports epigastic "burning" since the last episode of emesis, non-radiating.
RUQ ultrasound showed moderate ascites, enlarged spleen (15.6cm), splenorenal shunt, consistent with portal hypertension; no ultrasonographic evidence of cirrosis.
EGD was performed which showed a Dieulafoy lesion in the fundus which was cauterized, blood in stomach, esophagitis.
Pt was given Vit K for elevated INR.
Admission CXR without evidence of CHF.
Echocardiogram on [**6-21**] showed EF 45-50%, pulmonary hypertension, [**1-6**]+ MR, 3+ TR, dilated RV with systolic/diastolic dysfunction c/w RV overload.
Past Medical History: -CHF: EF 30% global HK, biatrial enlargement, LVH 1.3cm, 1+MR, 2+TR -CAD: large reversable mod severe inferior wall defect by pMIBI [**4-9**]; refused PCI [**4-9**] admission but was considering outpt cath  -essential thrombocytosis, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], on hydroxyurea  -Atrial fibrillation: was on coumadin but d/ced by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-9**] due to elevated INR -HTN -DM2, on insulin   Social History: Denies tobacco use.

Radiology: -CXR: decreased right pleural effusion, no clear evidence of CHF, no PTX or infiltrate.
The liver is slightly heterogeneous in echotexture, without definite ultrasonographic evidence of cirrhosis.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils.
Brief Hospital Course: 87M with ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted w/periph edema and ascites secondary to right heart failure.
On admission pt developed bloody emesis and found to have Dieulofoy lesion; monitored in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and transferred to the floor.
# Hematemesis: Etiology secondary to Dieulafoy lesion seen on EGD [**2137-6-21**].
Etiology was most likely secondary to emesis.
Epigastric pain resolved.
# Elevated INR: Unclear etiology.
Based on Abd U/S does not appear to have cirrhosis.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to nutritional deficiency.
# Ascites/abnormal abd U/S: Most likely related to CHF and fluid overload.
# CHF: Pt was in decompensated right heart failure at admission by exam & labs.
Unclear etiology of acute episode, but possible dietary indiscretion.
Doubt ischemia-related or rhythm-related given flat card enzymes and stable ECG/tele.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 45-50% (likely less than this, given severe valvular abnl).
# CAD: Pt has a P-MIBI in [**2-9**] w/large, predominantly reversible, moderately severe defect but pt has deferred cath x2 while in hospital for CHF in [**2-9**] & [**4-9**] (but apparently would consider as outpt).
Coumadin was previously stopped by PCP for bleeding complications.
# Essential thrombocytosis: Increasing over last several months.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed Gastric Dieulafoy's Lesion Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Ascites Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
