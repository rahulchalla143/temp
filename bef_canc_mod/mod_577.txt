Neuro She underwent code stroke evaluation with CT scan of head as well as CTA of head and neck which showed  hypodense areas within the right cerebellum and complete occlusion of right vertebral artery.
This suggested possible embolic source either from heart or from the veins in legs travelling as paradoxical emboli through a PFO or emboli from large vessels.
This was addressed by MRI with contrast to look for any underlying mass , given h/o vaginal cancer.
The MRI showed "multiple infarcts in bilateral posterior circulation territory in the setting of a very irregular distal right vertebral artery with a short segment of high-grade stenosis versus a short dissection.
There appears to have been interval partial recanalization of the right vertebral artery compared to the CTA."
The possibility of neuro intervention such as clot retrieval was discussed but it was felt that this may carry high risk and she did not have significant deficits on exam, hence it was held off.
Heparin was stopped and she was discharged on coumadin with an INR  Cards She was frequently monitored on telemetry for any arrthymia such as fibrillation.
She underwent ECHO which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal biventricular systolic function; mild mitral regurgitation.
Endo RISS with gluocose checks.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right cerebellar stroke and complete occlusion of right vertebral artery.
Discharge Condition: She has mild dyslexia.
