His HCT was reportedly slow trending down, so he was given 1 unit of PRBC yesterday for HCT 27.9, and today developed respiratory distress.
His vitals signs there were T 98, BP 106/66, HR 85, RR 20 and no recorded oxygen sat at that time.
He had an EKG and a CXR which showed fluid overload.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 2.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 55% 4.
Hypertension 5.
Ventricular fibrillation w/ AICD 6.
Macular degeneration 9.
Valvular heart disease (severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]) 11.
Osteoarthritis w/ decreased mobility from pain 12.
Recent UGIB [**2-5**] gastritis 15.
Recurrent pleural effusion- unclear etiology, cytology negative in the past.
Asbestosis exposure.
Family History: Notable for a father who had macular degeneration.
There is no family history of any memory disorders.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.8, BP 98/62, HR 81, RR 18, O2sat 94% on 3L NC General: NAD lying in bed.
Then CTAB at the apices Abdomen: +BS, soft NTND Rectal in the ED per notes: guiac negative Extremities: venous statis changes bilaterally.

# Respiratory failure: Likely from fluid overload after transfusion.
He also has significant pleural effusions bilaterally which are chronic.
Of note, his Ddimer is elevated, but he has h/o of PE and currently unclear what etiology.
# Recurrent pleural effusion: Unclear etiology but pt has asbestosis exposure concerning for malignancy.
# Hypotension: Resolved, currently normotensive with volume repletion following diuresis.
# Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 1.5 from baseline 1.1.-1.2.
Curently at 1.4 with volume repletion.
Likely due to volume depletion following diuresis.
# HTN: Initially held BP meds; restarted and tolerated well on day of discharge.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diet controlled .
# Cardiomyopathy: significant dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular disease.
# Paroxysmal AFib: currently rate controlled in the 70s.
Not on anticoagulation more than ASA given history of severe GI bleeding .
# demenita: continued donepezil .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Clinical VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1) Shortness of Breath from volume overload 2) Hypotension due to iatrogenic overdiuresis 3) Pleural Effusion s/p thoracentesis .
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation now given GIB 2.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 60% per ECHO [**9-9**] 4.
Hypertension 5.
Ventricular fibrillation w/ AICD/PM but AICD fxn off per OMR notes 6.
Macular degeneration 9.
Valvular heart disease (mild MR and severe TR per ECHO [**9-9**])  11.
Osteoarthritis w/ decreased mobility from pain 12.
Asbestosis exposure 17.
You were admitted with shortness of breath due to volume overload following a blood transfusion.
