Admission Date:  [**2172-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-9-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 287**] Chief Complaint: Right tibia-fibula fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Hemodialysis PICC line placement ORIF  History of Present Illness: 83 yo WF w/PMHx sx for ESRD on HD, CAD w/3V dz and stents to RCA, LMCA, LAD, LCx, CHF with EF40%, HTN, HL, DM2, TIA, and PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass who presents with tibia-fibula fracture today after a fall.
She was walking down the stairs at 3 pm this afternoon, when she fell down, with twisting out of her right leg while falling.
Per her daughters, she also has a UTI, with dysuria, but has not had fever or chills.
Episodes of hypotension with dialysis.
Coronary artery disease, status post right coronary artery stent in [**8-5**] with thrombus, in-stent restenosis in [**10-5**] elevation MI.
The mid LAd had a 50% focal stenosis.
There was a 30% focal restenosis within the distal prtion of the previous stent.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, +1 mitral regurgitation.
LVEF 40-45% with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Type 2 diabetes complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy status post laser photocoagulation.
History of transient ischemic attack 15 years ago with slurred speech and unsteady gait per the patient.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral femoral-popliteal and left femoral-tibial bypass.
Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy status post anterior cervical diskectomies infusion C3-6 complicated by postoperative dysphagia.
H/o rectal CA in [**2163**] s/p poly removal.
HEENT: Anisocoria [**2-5**] eye surgery.
No conjunctival injection.
No oral ulcers or exudate.
Bilateral carotid bruits.
AV fistula in left arm with bruit.
No fluctuance or erythema at site.
There are multiple surgical clips in the medial aspect of the leg from prior vein harvesting.
There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal tibia with an oblique component in the shaft which is minimally displaced.
There is also a fracture of the fibular neck with lateral displacement of the head of the fibula.
IMPRESSION: Fractures of the tibia and fibula.
[**9-26**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are moderate-sized, bilateral pleural effusions with reactive collapse/atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are mild increased septal lines and scattered ground-glass opacities consistent with fluid overload.
The aorta is of normal caliber throughout the chest without evidence of aneurysm or dissection.
There are marked coronary artery calcifications and wall calcifications within the aorta.
There are scattered, non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
BONE WINDOWS: No rib fractures are seen.
Her pain was controlled with morphine 2 mg IV q6h prn.
CXR showed low inspired lung volumes but no clear [**Month/Year (2) **] edema.
Because of her hypotension and hypoxia she was transferred to the MICU at this point.
During HD she became tachycardic to 150-170 with a drop in BP to 82/40.
Her rhythm was determined to be atrial tachycardia and she came out of it on her own.
EKG post hemodialysis showed ST depression in V3-V6?
During hemodialysis pt went into atrial fibrillation, hr to 150s and sbp to 47.
* Pt was transferred to the CCU on [**7-28**] b/c of hemodynamic instability during HD and continued hypotension possibly secondary to cardiogenic shock.
She was found to have severely elevated LFTs but this was thought to be secondary to shock liver from hypotensive episode.
A GB u/s showed no evidence cholecystitis and no ductal dilitation but showed a dilated GB.
This may have been due to fluid shifts during surgery and exacerbated by HD but sepsis was also thought to be contributing since she was hypothermic, her SVR was reduced, and she developed a cellulitis over her wound on POD 7.
However, during HD she frequently became hypotensive and levophed was again started for a few hours to maintain her SBP over 100.
Two days prior to d/c, both pressors were stopped and the pt was started on midodrine (her outpt med to prevent hypotension during HD) and she tolerated HD w/out problem.
RLE tibial fracture/cellulitis:  She became febrile on [**7-25**] in the MICU and was on vanc, flagyl and cipro on admission to CCU on [**7-28**] with continued fevers.
The cipro and flagyl were stopped quickly in the CCU b/c there was no source for fevers.
On [**7-31**] was found to have cellulitis over incisions from ORIF.
The pt was then hypothermic over the next 24 hours and her systemic vascular resistance dropped.
Ortho contemplated taking her to OR to clean out wound but the wound improved w/ abx therapy and the swelling slowly decreased.
Neuro was consulted and thought that this may be a neuropathy secondary to the fracture and subsequent swelling.
In the few days prior to her admission her mental status cleared and she began complaining of increased RLE pain.
Her pain was better controlled using this medicine w/out sedation.
ESRD: Pt has been on HD since [**2167**] and, during this admission, had episodes of afib and hypotension during HD requiring pressor support.
Her HD was changed from 3x/wk to daily during her CCU admission because of her respiratory problems and the thought that this was secondary to fluid overload.
Tachyarrhythmia: Pt had episodes of afib during HD requiring cardioconversion during her MICU course.
Her CXR showed CHF vs possible pneumonia which was treated with vanco/zosyn.
Pulmonary was consulted and they felt that her respiratory difficulties were mainly due to lack of a respiratory drive w/ her narcotics along w/ CHF.
CHF: The pt has an EF of 25% and global hypokinesis.
She had significant SOB and CXR evidence of CHF along with b/l pleural effusions.
She also began having grossly bloody stools accompanied by a Hct drop requiring transfusion.
GI was consulted and thought that diverticular bleed vs ischemic colitis were the most likely causes.
Her mild coagulopathy was corrected with vitamin K and her GI bleed slowed.
THe patient had an additional GI bleed in the week prior to d/c.
Stigmata of bleeding was noted but no focus of bleeding was identified.
CAD: The pt was maintained on her aspirin and statin were continued throughout her admission but her BP meds were held secondary to hypotension.
She had an enzyme leak that was probably due to demand ischemia during her recurrent hypotensive episodes.
Her plavix was eventually d/c secondary to bleeding concerns.
However, when orthopedics took out the staples on her leg wound, the wound dehisced and the internal hardware was open to the environment.
None of these strategies worked very well and the patient continued to have episodes of hypotension nearly everyday.
Her LV and RV function were improved since her last echo but she had severe MR and AS on ECHO.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that a proportion of her hypotension may have been due to this severe AS and proposed a valvuloplasty.
HD - Just as the patient had problems w/ hypotension during her time on the floor, her HD treatment were also limited by this factor.
The patient frequently became hypotensive to a sbp in the 60s while in the HD suite and required fluid boluses and albumin.
experienced an unwitnessed PEA arrest on the floor.
She had a CT of the chest to look for PE/mucous plugging that may have accounted for the PEA arrest.
She was hypotensive following the arrest and had increasing pressor requirements in the unit; it was unclear whether this was [**2-5**] to a septic etiology vs. heart failure.
She remained hypotensive on 3 pressors despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.
