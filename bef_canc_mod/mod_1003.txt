He denied chest pain or shortness of breath at that time.
He reports some shortness of breath with walking up stairs since that time - relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2197-5-30**] revealed a right- dominant system, left main coronary artery patent with mild diffuse disease, left anterior descending 70 to 80 percent, left circumflex 60 to 70 percent, right coronary artery occluded with integrated flow, right-to-left collaterals, and moderately elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
Cardiac echocardiogram on [**2197-5-30**] revealed right atrium mildly dilated, ejection fraction of 20 to 25 percent, aortic root moderately dilated, mild 1 plus aortic insufficiency, 1 to 2 plus mitral regurgitation, 1 plus tricuspid regurgitation, and left ventricle severely depressed with global hypokinesis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction in [**2197-5-16**]), gastrointestinal bleed in [**2197-5-16**] (status post endoscopy which revealed severe duodenal ulcerations), congestive heart failure without rheumatic fever in [**2152**], diabetic neuropathy, with chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine of 2.6), non- insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, history of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis, right eye blindness, and a History of transurethral resection of the prostate on [**2197-5-26**].
In general,  the patient was in no acute distress.
No rashes, eczema, or psoriasis.

Extremities revealed no calf tenderness.

No varicosities.
No motor deficits.
No pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient then proceeded with coronary artery bypass grafting times two by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
He continued to be A-paced throughout the night after surgery with an underlying sinus bradycardia.
On postoperative day three, he began having episodes of atrial fibrillation that continued throughout his hospital stay with an Electrophysiology evaluation.
He was not started on Coumadin secondary to preoperative melena with duodenal ulceration disease by scope.
When it was removed, he had no trouble passing urine and returning to his baseline continence.
A further issue included a baseline diagnosis of diabetes with increased fingerstick blood sugars postoperatively, for which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation was obtained.
He continued with decreased cadence, a wide-based gait, and decreased trunk stay; however, he was able to walk a total distance of 300 feet and go up and down 15 steps independently.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery    bypass grafting times two.
Urinary retention.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
