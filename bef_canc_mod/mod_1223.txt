Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with     retroperitoneal approach using the bifurcated     aortobifemoral graft.
PATIENT IDENTIFICATION:  This is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation with recent CVA while subtherapeutic on Coumadin, now with demonstrated progression of previously-identified abdominal aortic aneurysm from 5 cm in [**2121**] to 6.5 cm on most recent assessment.
The patient was consented for open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with retroperitoneal approach.
After administration of both vancomycin and gentamicin IV and application of sequential compression stockings induction of general anesthesia was performed.
The patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus position with the pelvis left as flat as reasonably possible and was then shaved, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Significant calcification was noted at the left superficial femoral artery consistent with known SFA occlusion with remaining patent left profunda femoris artery, also heavily calcified.
Dissection was performed utilizing electrocautery through the soft tissues down to the level of the peritoneum which was then carefully retracted utilizing blunt dissection in a medial-to-lateral and both inferior and superior fashion with careful retraction of the intraperitoneal contents anteriorly.
A small rent in the peritoneum was identified and primarily repaired.
The tissues overlying the abdominal aortic aneurysm were carefully dissected away with visualization of both the infrarenal abdominal aorta and bifurcation and branch vessels.
The infrarenal and pararenal arotic neck were dissected and both were soft.
The left renal artery was controlled with a silastic loop.
Following this removal there was no significant bleeding evident from lumbar vessels.
Upon completion of the proximal anastomosis, the distal portion of the graft was grasped with subsequent removal of the suprarenal clamp restoring flow to the renal vessels.
Left distal anastomosis was then performed in running fashion utilizing a running 5-0 Prolene in end-to-side fashion.
The right common femoral, profunda femoris and superficial femoral arteries were crossclamped using atraumatic vascular clamps and a longitudinal arteriotomy was performed in the right common femoral artery down onto the proximal SFA.
Assessment performed utilizing continuous Doppler demonstrated adequate flow at the right common femoral, profunda femoris and superficial femoral arteries.
Assessment of the left groin, however, demonstrated minmal antegrade flow at the left profunda femoris artery.
It was, therefore, felt that the anastomosis should be taken down and re-done.
The anastomosis was completed and after both antegrade and retrograde flushing of the vessels with subsequent removal of the replaced vascular clamps.
Attention was then turned back to the retroperitoneal abdominal aorta where meticulous hemostasis was obtained.
The flank incision was then closed utilizing a #1 PDS looped suture closing the fascial layers at the transversus abdominis and internal oblique.
The patient given significant volume resuscitation required during the open aortic procedure, remained intubated and was transferred stable and in good condition to the intensive care unit postoperatively.

In the native common femoral artery a peak systolic velocity of 152 cm/sec was noticed with monophasic Doppler waveforms.
The flow was not visualized in the left superficial femoral artery due to known occlusion.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement with increased ventilation of the retrocardiac lung areas and near total resolution of the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.

Patient with abdominal pain.
Per son[**Name (NI) 930**] discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], patient is here to assess for evidence of main portal vein thrombosis.
Allowing for this, the liver appears normal in echotexture and architecture, with no focal liver lesion seen.
No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation is seen, with the common duct measuring 5 mm.
The gallbladder appears normal, without evidence of stones.
Visualization of the pancreas is limited due to bowel gas; however, the visualized portions of the pancreatic head and neck show no focal abnormality.
No ascites is seen in the visualized four quadrants of the abdomen.
A single image shows a small area of central color flow (with diameter measuring approximately 1.5 cm), with no flow seen in the periphery of the mid abdominal aorta.
This is compatible with flow within the AAA graft and thrombosis in the aneurysm sac, but imaging is extremely limited.
There is limited visualization of the left kidney, however, 6-mm nonobstructing calculi in the interpolar and lower pole of the left kidney are unchanged from [**2122-8-17**].
3.6-cm partially exophytic upper pole left renal cyst is as previously seen.
No hydronephrosis is seen in the kidneys.
Left renal calculi (nonobstructing) and cyst, unchanged.
On POD #1 on physical exam the left calf was noted to be tight and there was concern of compartment syndrome.
Orthopedic consult for possible compartment syndrome, continued to monitor for changes hourly in ICU.
Pain under adequate management.
CXR did show bilateral basilar atelectasis with pleural effusions.
Patient continues to have some mild confusion, working with PT daily.
