Images: CXR: Mild central congestion.
Subtle opacity in the left lower lung which could represent an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: 47yo male with asthma, dCHF, complex sleep disorder, OSA, hypoventilation syndrome requiring 3-4L daily and BiPAP nightly presenting with increase work of breathing and SOB.
HYPERCAPNEIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient with repeat admissions for hypercapnic respiratory failure most likely due to his obesity hypoventilation syndrome and complex sleep disorder.
Additional work-up notable for negative Ddimer and BNP elevated but roughly at baseline.
He developed severe somnolence overnight with minimal responsiveness to sternal rub accompanied by hypotension to the 70s-80s sytolic.
His underlying obesity hypoventilation seems likely.
We stopped metolazone due to fears that a mounting alkalosis was driving [**Month/Day/Year 103306**] and triggering his respiratory failure.
Additional labs c/w hemoconcentration making pre-renal azotemia most likely cause to acute bump.
Atrial Dysarrhytmia with h/o afib/aflutter.
His diuretics were briefly held due to concern for hypovolemia.

[**Hospital1 **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon on the Parkway - [**Location 1268**]  [**Location **] Diagnosis: hypercarbic respiratory failure due to obesity/hypventilation syndrome and OSA   [**Location **] Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
[**Location **] Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 732**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue.
After numerous blood tests and xrays, we did not find any evidence of pneumonia, asthma, or heart failure to explain your decompensation.
These symptoms were likely related to your obstructive sleep apena and complex sleep disorder.
You remained on your breathing machine and felt better with a little intravenous fluid.
