The patient was discharged from the hospital on [**2111-4-4**] and represented with respiratory distress and hypoglycemia.
Her baseline mental status since her subdural hematoma is non-verbal, not following commands, sometimes opens eyes, therefore history is obtained through records.
A fingerstick glucose revealed hypoglycemia at 25.
She was given an amp of D50 and was more arousable, however she continued to be in respiratory distress with O2sats in the 60s.
CXR revealed no new infiltrate.
She was admitted to the intensive care unit initially, where she was treated supportively with IVF and Pain Control.
Her oxygen requirement abated upon admission to the MICU and she was weaned easily off of her nasal canula.

DIFF [**2111-4-6**] 12:38 pm STOOL      POSITIVE  CXR [**2111-4-5**]: Patchy density in the left lower lobe may represent linear atelectasis or infection.
Healed rib fractures are seen in the left side.
No frank consolidation or failure.
There is no supine evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
No dilated loops of small or large bowel are detected to suggest obstruction.
Air and stool is identified within the colon without evidence of pneumatosis or wall thickening.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine are not well evaluated on this study.
HEAD CT [**2111-4-3**]: Bifrontal areas of encephalomalacia and contusion are identified which have further evolved since the previous CT and MRI examination.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
No mass effect or midline shift seen.
There is moderate brain atrophy seen including dilatation of the fourth ventricle and prominence of temporal horns, which could be due to mild communicating hydrocephalus.
There is no midline shift seen.
There is no new area of hemorrhage identified.
Interictal discharges were seen independently in the left temporal region, right temporal region, or more broadly over the right hemisphere.
The background was slow and disorganized with frequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy.
Infections, medication effects, and metabolic disturbances are among the most frequent causes of encephalopathy.
Delta frequency slowing was also seen independently in the left and right temporal regions suggestive of subcortical dysfunction.

Given that her CXR was essentially without changes (new liner atelectasis vs infection) and more importantly that her oxygen requirement abated upon initial admission to the MICU, this was likely a mucous plug or aspiration pneumonitis that quickly resolved.
This was felt to be mucous plugging vs aspiration pneumonitis.
HOB was elevated at 30 degrees.
She had one additional desaturation episode that was likely aspiration pneumonitis that improved without antibiotics.
2 APHASIA/INTRACRANIAL BLEED Extensive workup including CT head, EEG, MRI, large volume LP recently for MS changes, were unrevealing except for large hematoma of the right frontal lobe with bifrontal gliosis and small SDH.
She was previously started on amantadine, as the drug can be used for some frontal lobe disorders; however, with no significant improvement seen, this was discontinued.
She was continued on Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.
This showed no epileptiform activity.
C. DIFFICILE The patient had leukocytosis and frequent loose stools, and tested newly positive for the C. diff A toxin.
Her stool became more formed, but she developed a worsening WBC and higher stool output; she was transitioned to PO vancomycin to run from [**Date range (1) 14233**].
4 SINUS TACHYCARDIA Persistent chronic tachycardia without apparent etiology.
REACTIVE THROMBOCYTOSIS stable, elevated  6.
7 DIABETES MELLITUS: Patient was hypoglycemic on admission being transferred without tube feeds running.
While you were here you had diarrhea and were diagnosed with an infection called C. difficile.
If you develop worsening breathing or worsening respiratory symptoms, please return to the hospital.
