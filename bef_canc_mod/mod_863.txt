The Pt was found unresponsive in chair in front of the TV snoring loudly.
There was a Klonipin bottle close by the patient.
Pt was responsive to only sternal from.
During the week prior to [**Holiday 1451**] the patient was found outside of [**Location (un) 8985**] mall in hypoglycemic coma (his 4th episode in the last year) after taking insulin and hospitalized in [**Hospital3 **].
He represented days later to [**Hospital3 2568**] with a PNA and UTI.
Family reporst chills worsening over the last few days but no fever.
No focal weakness.
Received Vanco 1gm, ceftriaxone 2g IV, hydral 10 IV   Past Medical History: PMHx: Chronic renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy s/p Kidney transplant [**4-/2180**] Brittle DM on insulin w/ multiple episodes of hypoglycemia CAD s/p CABG [**2173**] - stress [**2184-12-29**] without evidence of ischemia by report PUD htn hyperlipidemia B aortoilliac bybass ex lap and AKA amputation during [**Country 3992**] after gunshot with phantom limb pain osteomylitis of L hip h/o kidney stone MVA s/p splenectomy [**6-/2181**] diabetic retinopathy bilateral carotid stenosis s/p cervical fusion anxiety with PTSD h/o colitis in [**2183**] s/p colonoscopy w/ ileitis/colitis, ?
Able to do ADLS without dificulty.
Physical Exam: PE: T:94.2 BP:120/59 HR:59 RR:17 O2 100% on CMV 40%/600/12/5 Gen: intubated and sedated, withdrawing to painful stimuli (R > L) HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
2/6 SEM, no rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Large scar over left hip 2+ DP on R SKIN: fungal rash in left groin genital: tight but distentable R inguinal hernia.
GRAM STAIN:       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE:    NO GROWTH.
[**1-25**] Echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small focus of abnoraml diffusion signal intensity in the subcortical white matter of the left cerebral hemisphere lateral to the body of the corpus callosum without corresponding signal abnormality in the ADC map.
These findings may represent a subacute or late ischemic vent.
Two-third stenosis involving the proximal right internal carotid artery.
The severity of the stenosis is not constant and was measured using the best plane possible, however, it may be underestimated.
If clinically indicated, a CTA may be helpful for further characterization.
Small air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus.
Large hypoattenuating liver mass and two smaller hypoattenuating liver lesions are incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
Soft tissue mass seen anterior to the calcified splenic artery is continuous with the pancreatic tail and the gastric wall.
Findings are concerning for either a gastric mass or a pancreatic mass with extension into the stomach wall.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
Vascular stent in the right external iliac artery, the patency of which cannot be evaluated on this non-enhanced study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.
US abd: : Multiple nonspecific hypoechoic liver lesions concerning for malignant process.
Pancreatic lesion not imaged due to overlying bowel gas.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 y/o with multiple prior episodes of altered MS due to hypoglycemia, CAD, ESRD s/p transplant who presents with unexplained, acute change in mental status.
# Altered Mental Status: Etiology unclear, pt found at home unresponsive.
Broad workup undertaken.
There was no clear evidence for infection: CXR was clear, neg UA, blood cultures were without growth.
Toxic-metabolic evaluation notable for tox screen positive for opiates and tylenol (level in 40s).
However, he denied suicidal thoughts and feelings of depression.
Neurologic evaluation for his mental status changes included an MRI/ MRA, which showed no obvious CVA, though there was a small focus of abnormal diffusion signal intensity in the subcortical white matter.
Imaging also showed ICA & verterbral stenosis, both of which were thought to be unlikely related to his presentation.
There was a question of the patient having seizure activity at the OSH, and thus he was dilantin loaded there.
EEG at [**Hospital1 18**] showed encephalopathy but no seizure activity.
No clear cause for his MS changes was ever found.
# Fever: New onset [**1-26**] CXR showed possible retrocardiac opacity and now on vent for > 48 hrs.
# Liver masses: The patient was found to have 3 masses in the liver and one contiguous w/ panc tail and gastric wall on an abdominal CT done as part of evaluation of mental status changes.
Concern for lymphoma given LDH and renal transplant on immunosuppressive.
#DM: history of 4 hypoglycemic episodes leading to "coma" according to family.
Possible having prolonged MS change in setting of hypoglycemia.
No documented hypoglycemia.
Statin held due in setting of possible Tylenol OD/slightly elevated LFTs.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered Mental Status - unknown etiology Liver biopsy Diabetes End-stage renal disease s/p transplant CAD   Discharge Condition: Good, ambulating, stable vitals.
You had a CT abdomen which demonstrated liver masses which will be biopsed on Wednesday [**2-2**].
4) Decreased your Novolog sliding scale - follow the sliding scale on your medication list print out.
Return to the ER or call your doctor if you experience fever, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting or any other concerning symptoms.
