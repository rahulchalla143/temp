Patient was first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2164-3-26**], was felt to be in Class II to III heart failure, and felt to be fluid overloaded, so Lasix was increased from 40 [**Hospital1 **] to 80 [**Hospital1 **], and he was started on hydralazine 10 mg po tid for hypertension, given elevated creatinine at 2.0 and previous worsening renal failure with ACE inhibitor.
He was again seen on [**2164-3-30**] for worsening shortness of breath and weight gain 10 pounds since previous visit.
He was then hospitalized [**4-2**] to [**4-5**] at [**Hospital 620**] [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital, where exacerbation was felt secondary to hydralazine.
He was apparently seen again in clinic today when the decision was made to admit him under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for diuresis, nisseratide drip.
He complains of severe shortness of breath, orthopnea.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no chest pain.
He complains of increased peripheral edema and increased abdominal girth.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2137**].
pressure at 31/14, wedge 12, ejection fraction of 30%, proximal right coronary artery 100%, OM-1 diffuse disease to right coronary artery, both saphenous vein graft occluded.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Chronic bronchitis.
Recurrent urinary tract infection.
Shellfish, plus or minus codeine, aldactone causes hyperkalemia, ACE inhibitor causes worsening renal failure.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever or chills.
No nausea or vomiting.
No bright red blood per rectum recently.
No melena, no urinary problems since TURP one month ago.
Moderate tachypnea, but not unstable.
Jugular venous distention 18 cm, no lymphadenopathy.
Minimal basilar crackles scattered and few poor air movement, occasional expiratory wheezes.
Regular, rate, and rhythm, distant heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Soft and distended abdomen, nontender, and normoactive bowel sounds.
3+ left lower extremity edema with 2+ right lower extremity edema, 2+ radial pulses bilaterally, 2+ carotids bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
CHEST X-RAY:  Small right pleural effusion, no definite congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
Cardiovascular system: A:  Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation:  The patient was started on a nisseratide drip, continued on Bumex, his spironolactone was held secondary to low blood pressures and his beta blocker was held secondary to low blood pressures.
Poor diuresis was felt secondary to poor renal perfusion from hypotension, so dopamine drip was increased from 2.5 to 7.5.
Had increased weight on [**2164-4-28**], so Bumex was increased to 4 mg po bid x2 doses, then decreased to 3 mg po bid with good net diuresis.
His edema was markedly decreased.
Genitourinary:  On admission, the patient was noted to have hematuria given his recent TURP.
They left a note on [**2164-4-19**] stating that hematuria is most likely secondary to TURP.
Patient had continuous small amount of hematuria until [**2164-4-24**] when Foley was reinserted due to the patient's discomfort and severe amount of bleeding occurred.
Cystoscopy was pursued showing false passage of bulbar urethra open, prostatic fossa, but contracted bladder neck.
The patient remains with hematuria and multiple clots.
Bladder ultrasound revealed multiple clots.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was continued on outpatient Advair discus [**Hospital1 **] prn.
Acute blood loss anemia:  Patient's hematocrit dropped significantly secondary to severe hematuria, and he required 4 units of packed red blood cells transfusion.
He was not started on ACE inhibitor secondary to renal failure.
Right foot pain:  Patient with right arch foot pain on admission.
This is felt secondary to plantar fasciitis.
He was treated with Tylenol prn consistent with therapy.
Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Acute renal failure on chronic renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Blood loss anemia.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
