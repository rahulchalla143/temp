History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known firstname 4317**] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 84 year-old woman with chronic renal failure, colon cancer s/p resection, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction with shortness of breath.
She reports one week of SOB and worsening DOE.
Her daughter notes that she has not been the same as far as her exercise tolerance since breaking her left ankle 3 months ago though her PT over the past months has not been limited by pain until now.
She had a CXR which showed pulmonary edema and multiple opacifications.

In the medical floor she was started on treatment for healthcare acquired pneumonia with Vanc/levofloxacin (day 1 [**3-27**]).

She has continued to have a mild AG metabolic acidosis.
CXR showed worsening edema.

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The morphology of the abnormality is not uniform: ground-glass opacification dominates the lung apices, traversed by mild, smooth thickening of interlobular septae.
The septal thickening and intralobular lines are more irregular and thicker in the dependent areas where there is relatively more peribronchial infiltration with intervening ground glass opacity.
Mild dilation of segmental and more peripheral bronchi is seen in all areas, most striking in the lingula.
The simplest explanation for all these findings is cardiogenic edema, but the absence of any appreciable pleural effusion or progression of pre-existing moderate cardiomegaly argue against that (as does the recent clinical history of worsening respiratory failure despite diuresis).
There is some heterogeneity in the background density of the lungs on the [**2188**] torso CT, but this could be due to simple air trapping.
But, the conventional chest radiograph performed [**2191-1-18**] which showed unequivocal right lower lobe pneumonia also showed a large ground-glass abnormality in the perihilar left lung and right apex medially which could have been the early stages of the current process.
If on the other hand, the findings in [**Month (only) 956**] were not a precursor to the current condition, one can add to the list any cause of non-cardiogenic edema (ARDS) including acute intersitial pneumonia.
Mild central adenopathy is new since [**2188**]: in the prevascular mediastinal station for example, 1 characteristic node is 8 mm, another 7 mm, previously 5 and 7 mm respectively, and in the right lower paratracheal station a node grew from 8 mm to 11.5 mm.
There are no enlarged axillary nodes.
New layering non-hemorrhagic left pleural effusion is minimal and there is no right pleural or pericardial effusion.
Relative low density of cardiac contents is explained by anemia.
IMPRESSION: See detailed discussion of differential diagnosis: drug toxicity, non-cardiac edema (ARDS)including acute interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and cryptogenic organizing pneumponia.
No pneumothorax is currently identified.
CXR [**4-17**]: Compared to the study from the prior day, there has been no significant interval change.
LE ultrasound [**4-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
CXR [**4-18**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-17**]: Endotracheal tube ends between 3 and 4 cm above the carina, a right PIC line tip projects over the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, and a dual-channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the upper and mid right atrium, all in standard placements.
No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality could be either severe edema, the residual of rapidly migratory pulmonary abnormalities solid radiographically over the past month.
Contribution of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage or organizing interstitial pneumonitis should not be discounted.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads I, aVL and V6.
Poor R wave progression.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname 4317**] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 84 year-old woman with chronic renal failure, colon cancer s/p resection, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction with shortness of breath.
Hypoxic respiratory failure - Patient came to the hospital with progressive SOB over the last week, orthopnea, weight loss, no fever or cough.
Initial WBC 11.4, 86.3% PMNs and no bands and a lactate of 2.4.
She had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia that improved with oxygen.
It was unclear if she was having an exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure (mostly diastolic dysfunction) versus a healthcare acquired pneumonia ([**Known lastname 10540**]).
Bronchoscopy showed normal lungs; BAL showed PMNs, but no bacteria.
CT scan showed non-cardiac ARDS that could be compatible with drug toxicity, non-cardiac edema (ARDS)including acute interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and cryptogenic organizing pneumponia.
Once cultures negative and with no clear picture it was decided to give a 3-day burst of methylprednisolone 125 mg QID and then go down to slowly to 40 mg, which if she survives she should continue for 2-3 months with a very slow [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] for pneumonitis/AIP.
Her outpatient nephrologist thought there could be a small contribution of fluid and that diuresis could help with hypoxia, so recommended CVVH.
It did not improve hypoxia at all.
Patient developed progressive hypoxia that responded to increase in PEEP up to 15.
Pressures dropped and she developed a R pneumothorax.
Her vent was weaned to [**3-30**] for several days.
She developed increased sputum and was restarted on a 7 day course of cefepime/linezolid for possible VAP.
On [**4-17**], she was reintubated for hypoxia and unresponsiveness while her HD line was replaced by IR.
CXR showed no new processes.
She likely mucous plugged as she had some thickened secretions though the ET tube while she was intubated.
She remained stable still with occasionally desaturations but was satting well on 2L O2 on the day of discharge.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure - She has chronic heart failure and reports losing weight.
Initial diuresis with 160 mg of IV lasix TID and metolazone 5 mg daily was started and -6 L of fluid were removed without improvement in the hypoxic respiratory failure.
Her echocardiogram showed preserved EF with diastolic dysfunction and no WMA.
Her CE were negative and there were no ECG changes.
Healthcare acquired pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia - Initially it was unclear if patient had [**Name (NI) 10540**] or CHF exacerbation.
She completed an 8-day course of Vanc/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin (Day 1 [**3-29**]) without improvement.
Her CXR did never show clear alveolar infiltrates and she was too unstable and with too high oxygen requirements to be taken to the CT scanner.
As above, she developed thickened secretions on [**4-13**] and was treated with another 8 days of cefepime and linezolid (linezolid to also cover her VRE as below).
Hypertension - Initially continued her home diltiazem, but patient then developed hypotension.
Chronic kidney disease - eGFR of 18 ml/min with Stage IV CKD according to MDRD formula at baseline.
Anemia - Pt with HCT of 24.3 with borderline normocytic (MCV 99) microcytic anemia with RDW of 25.1.
Iron 122, ferritin 249, TIBC 424, TRF 326 anemia of chronic kidney disease.
Repeat iron studies showed iron 81, TIBC 228, and Ferritin 723, though this was in the setting of previous blood transfusions.
She had guaiac positive brown stools and may require outpatient colonoscopy or EGD if they continue.
Hypothyroidism - Last TSH in [**10-4**] 0.36.
thrombocytopenia - her plts dropped from 140s to 105 after starting cefepime and linezolid.
Diarrhea - Pt developed diarrhea upon the first 2 days in the ICU.
After many meetings it was decided in a short intubation for diagnostic procedures and tailor therapy.
She was extubated and reintubated once several days later for likely mucous plugging as above, then reextubated.

Full assist to chair with poor pulmonary reserve.
You were admitted with shortness of breath that required mechanical ventilation.
This is likely due to a variety of causes including heart failure, volume overload, kidney failure, infection and lung inflammation.
You still need extra oxygen and have poor lung reserve.
Your hospitalization was also complicated by blood infection (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus) and kidney failure requiring initiation of dialysis.
