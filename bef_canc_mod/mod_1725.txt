Admission Date:  [**2157-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Intubation s/p IP procedure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchial stent removal bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 63 year old woman with h/o stage I lung cancer, GERD, HTN, thromboembolic disease, ex-smoker, tracheobronchomalacia with recent discharge from MICU on [**7-14**] s/p Y-stent removal and replacement by IP, now being transferred from the PACU after new Y stent removal.
The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after placement of endobronchial Y stent on [**2157-6-13**], discharged to rehab, then transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-4**] for worsening dyspnea and audible stridorous respirations.
She remained stridorous and wheezy, making her a poor candidate for surgical intervention as the cause of these paroxysms are less likely to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia in the absence of improvement with stent placement.
In addition, she had an episode of significant respiratory distress requiring bedside bronchoscopy, revealing significant mucous plugging along the length of the stent and at carina.
She was started on mucomyst therapy, continued albuterol, ipratropium, mucinex, hypertonic saline nebulizer treatments, and BiPAP, and was able subsequently to tolerate the stent with no subsequent episodes concerning for mucous plugging.
They did, however, note a Left true / false vocal fold mass, likely granulation but given h/o smoking could not rule out neoplastic process.
She had significant vocal cord swelling.
She developed significant laryngospasm during bronch, so she was intubated in the OR by anaesthesia.

MICRO: [**2157-7-21**] Urine culture: E. coli >100,000 organisms/ml .
Pleural scarring with mild atelectatic changes is again seen at the left base.
[**2157-7-22**] CXR: There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis are stable.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with stage I lung cancer s/p wedge resection, cervicomalacia s/p Y stent removal, intuabted for significant airway and laryngeal swelling after procedure requiring ICU stay for respiratory stabilization.
Active Issues:  # Cervicomalacia and laryngeal swelling: S/p Y stent removal complicated by laryngeal swelling and granulation tissue seen on bronch, requiring intubation.
She was taken back to the OR on [**7-22**] for a repeat bronch which showed some supraglottic edema and was successfully extubated.
Patient will also follow-up with ENT for vocal cord lesion.
#Oral ulcer: the patient noted a painful oral ulcer on her left posterior gum.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole and ranitidine.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
# Depression: Continued citalopram.
Transitional Issues:  Patient will need to follow-up with IP for cervicomalacia and ENT for vocal cord lesion.
