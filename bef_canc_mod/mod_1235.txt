No evidence of active bleeding seen throughout the stomach.
Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the whole stomach.
Impression: Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with gastritis   Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o with ischemic CHF EF 35%, CAD s/p CABG, afib on coumadin, DM, CKD s/p nephrectomy here with coffee ground emesis- UGI bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR 8.4.
An EGD done in the MICU showed old blood in the stomach with signs of gastritis and no active bleeding.
It was felt that her bleed came from the gastritis exacerbated by the supratherapeutic INR.
She was placed on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI in addition to sucralfate and maalox/lidocaine for GERD symptom relief.
She remained asymptomatic and was felt safe to return home.
CAD s/p CABG.
Ms. [**Known lastname 73770**] did have an isolated troponin elevation, peaking at 0.36,  in the setting of her GIB.
However, her CK was not elevated, she showed no EKG changes, and remained asymptomatic.
Thus this was felt not to be an NSTEMI but only a demand ischemia not requiring any non-medical intervention.
TIA-While in hospital Ms. [**Known lastname 73770**] experienced one episode of blank staring lasting approximately 60 seconds, witnessed, that she states is consistent with her prior TIAs.
She was on her aspirin and Plavix at the time and there were no focal or persistent neurologic abnormalities noted on exam.
A carotid ultrasound showed only 60-69% stenosis on the left and no stenosis on the right.
She was also continued on her gabapentin for her peripheral neuropathy with no new symptoms noted.
Systolic congestive heart failure EF 35%- Upon stabilization of her GIB, she was restarted on her regimen of metoprolol, lisinopril, and Torsemide with good effect and proper diuresis after volume loading with blood products.
Decreased PO Intake-The patient stated that her appetite has been decreased over the last 6 months with an involuntary weight loss of [**11-9**] lbs.
Depression may have contributed to her anorexia as well.
Depression - Continued on Fluoxetine.
Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed Gastritis Supratherapeutic INR   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable.
Your bleeding has stopped but you may have some old blood passing through your system that may show up in your stool.
You also had an elevation of the blood tests that show there was some minor damage to your heart during the bleeding.
You also had one episode of symptoms similar to your previous TIAs.
An ultrasound of your carotid arteries showed mild narrowing of 60-69% on the L, requiring no surgery but you should be followed by a vascular surgeon for possible carotid surgery in the future.
However, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you feel dizzy, feint, have chest pain, shortness of breath, vomitting of blood or vomit that looks like coffee-grounds, or any other symptoms that concern you.
