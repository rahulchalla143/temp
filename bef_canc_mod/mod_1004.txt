NCHCT at OSH showed new hemorrhage involving left parasagital posterior frontal lobe.
ROS was significant for recent fall on [**1-3**] when patient slipped on the ice while walking dog.
Denies LOC from that fall, but did require staples for occipital laceraction.
No URI symptoms, no SOB, no CP.
CXR showed bilateral LL opacities and patient received Lasix for pulm edema.

Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy [**6-18**].
Family History: Father died of hemorrhagic [**Month/Day/Year **] and mother died of MI.

Pertinent Results: WBC-12.3, HCT-35.2, PLT COUNT-214 PT-14.8* PTT-29.6 INR(PT)-1.4 GLUCOSE-254* UREA N-43* CREAT-2.2* SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-3.7 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-24 CK(CPK)-134 CK-MB-7 cTropnT-0.02*  Repeat NCHCT - [**1-7**] Stable appearance of right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
LENIs - No DVT in bilateral LE.
Neuro: Patient was initially brought to the ICU for management of intracranial bleed and right sided weakness.
Since his bleed was stable and since he will need continued long-term anticoagulation given his risk for ischemic [**Month/Year (2) **], it was decided not to give vitamin K, but rather to follow his INR and correct with FFP as needed.
He was maintained on Dilantin 100mg PO TID for seizure prophylaxis given initial presentaion with possible right-sided shaking, and the cortical location of teh bleed.
Etiology of bleed unclear, most likely amyloid angiopathy vs hypertension.
He will need repeat CT with contrast in [**5-23**] weeks to evaluate for any underlying mass or lesion.
ID: He was started on 14 day course of Levofloxacin 250 mg PO QD for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Cardiac: He has remained on cardiac telemetry and has had persistent atrial fibrillation with occasional sustained tachycardia to 117, exacerbated by dehydration, and requiring NS fluid boluses.
Patient has not received maintanence fluids given concern for fluid overload due to his baseline CHF.
His home dose of lasix for his CHF was held as he had elevated creatinine and was dehydrated.
Renal/GU: In the ICU, he was noted to have decreased urinary output and a creatinine of 2.2.
They diagnosed him with bladder neck contraction.
Serial neurological exams show patient to be oriented to place and time but with abulic affect and poor attention and recall.
He continues to have spastic hypertonicity in bilateral LEs, symmetric face, full strength on left and improving strength on right.
Additionally, patient expressed some desire for DNR status.
It is currently unclear if this is a long-standing desire or if this is due to his acute grief over her death.
