SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..     Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2133-11-18**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2133-11-18**]):       Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA       amplification assay.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2133-11-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
RADIOLOGY: CXR [**2133-11-17**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No pneumothorax.
Possible septal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
TRACING #1  Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature contractions.
Diffuse non-specific  ST-T wave changes may be due to ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Underlying rhythm appears to be sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Poor R wave progression, likely a normal variant.
Compared to tracing #2 previously seen  ST segment elevation in leads I and aVL along with diffuse ST segment depressions have resolved.
TRACING #3  LABS ON DISCHARGE:  [**2133-11-20**] 07:30AM BLOOD WBC-3.9* RBC-2.91* Hgb-7.8* Hct-24.9* MCV-86 MCH-26.6* MCHC-31.1 RDW-15.2 Plt Ct-355 [**2133-11-20**] 07:30AM BLOOD Glucose-51* UreaN-25* Creat-1.8* Na-138 K-4.9 Cl-116* HCO3-17* AnGap-10 [**2133-11-20**] 07:30AM BLOOD Calcium-8.0* Phos-3.4 Mg-2.2  Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo male with history of IDDM and history of DKA, erosive esophagitis and chronic kidney disease presented with DKA.
# Hypotension/Shock: This is likely secondary to hypovolemic shock in setting of DKA and osmotic diuresis as well as multiple days of nausea and vomiting.
Infection unlikely, but septic shock possible given history of [**2-9**] loose stools.
# DKA: Patient has a history of poorly controlled type I DM since age 20, with most recent A1c of 11.3% in [**2133-2-8**] and a history of multiple episodes of DKA in the past, with a recent admission for DKA in [**2133-10-10**].
He presented to the ED with FSBG in the 400s and evidence of severe volume depletion and hypovolemic shock form osmotic diuresis (above) in the setting of multiple days of nausea and vomiting.
Possible etiology could be due esophagitis leading to difficulty swallowing with decreased po intake vs noncompliance to insulin medication.
Patient was hypoglycemic and given dextrose.
More likely that this represents a contaminant as pt afebrile and no leukocytosis and no localizing signs of infection.
# Esophagitis/Anemia: Patient has a history of erosive esophagitis with recent admission in [**2133-10-10**] for DKA and coffee ground emesis found to have erosive gastritis.
Stool was found to be guaiac positive in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and pt's hematocrit is stable in the 20s (baseline hct in the high 20s), likely due to iron deficiency and acute blood loss given recent admission for erosive esophagitis with coffee ground emesis.
No evidence of bleeding currently.
This is likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of osmotic diuresis from DKA (above).
# Hyperkalemia: Due to K+ shift into the cells in the setting of metabolic acidosis due to DKA.
# Elevated troponin: Troponin elevated to 0.57 in the ED, though patient has multiple elevated troponins in the past to as high as 1.38.
He also has a history of ST elevations in the setting of DKA, with electrolyte shifts, on his previous admission.
He was evaluated by cardiology on his last admission and was started on aspirin, atorvastatin, and low dose metoprolol, which he has reportedly been taking.
Pt denies chest pain, his ECG was reassuring without signs of ischemia, and troponins have trended down (though still elevated to 0.4).
# Hypertension: Pt's home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension and was restarted [**11-18**] after hypotension resolved.
# Asymmetric LLE edema: Pt reports bilateral pedal edema since last admission, which has been getting worse during this admission.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: greater [**Hospital **] home health care  Discharge Diagnosis: Diabetic Ketoacidosis Esophagitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had come in because of nausea, vomiting and poor oral intake of fluids and food.
