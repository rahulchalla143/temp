Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, still small, more marked on the right.
There is no other change.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 F with cirrhosis, ESRD s/p thoracentesis who presents with hypoxia and hypotension in setting likely re-expansion pulmonary edema .
Suspect she had some desaturation in setting of re- expansion edema which has stabilized.
No evidence of pneumothorax on multiple CXR, there is re-accumulation of fluid in the right lung.
She should have future thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary in order to follow trans pulmonary pressures to avoid re-expansion pulmonary edema.
