RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-3-13**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Elevation of the right lung base laterally could be due to a small subpulmonic pleural effusion.
There is no left pleural effusion, heart size is normal and there is no indication of central adenopathy.
Overall, findings are consistent with pneumonia, including nonbacterial causes such as viral infection or even pneumocystis.
Extensive multifocal parenchymal consolidations, ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities predominantly in a peribronchial distribution, most severe within the right lower lobe.
These findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is likely reactive in nature.
Mild left hydronephrosis, new compared to prior study of [**2138-11-19**].
Post-surgical changes within the upper abdomen status post splenectomy and liver [**Year (4 digits) **].
No evidence of osteomyelitis, discitis or other spinal infection.
Chronic post-operative changes at L4-L5 with underlying degenerative disease and congenital stenosis.
Diffusely T1- and T2-hypointense vertebral bone marrow signal may relate to the immunosuppressive medications for hepatic [**Month/Day/Year **] patient's and/or chronic hematologic abnormality (history of ITP, s/p splenectomy); correlate with clinical and laboratory data.
Mild paraortic lymphadenopathy and urinary bladder distention with diverticulum, unchanged from [**2138-11-19**] CT. .
Progression of multifocal opacities suggesting pneumonia with consolidative opacities within the right upper, lower, and left lower lobes.
New left pleural effusion and progressed right pleural effusion.
Smooth septal thickening suggesting fluid overload or pulmonary vascular congestion.
TTE ([**3-20**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe posteriorly directed (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation is due to centripetal remodelling of the inferior posterior walls with consequent functional tethering of the posterior mitral leaflet.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-2-24**], intercurrent inferoposterolateral infarct is evident with consequent severe mitral regurgitation.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed two vessel disease.
The LAD has minimal disease.
The LCx had tubular mid disease to 95%.
The RCA is dominant but very small vessel with mid disease to 90%.
Severe LCX lesion probably culprit for new lateral wall motion abnormality and increased MR - stented successfully.
Severe RCA disease suboptimal for PCI in view of long lesion and small caliber - would consider PCI if producing ischemia.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Improved pulmonary edema which is now mild, including decreased pleural effusions.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
Retention of IV contrast in the renal cortices, likely from cardiac catheterization two days prior, compatible with renal dysfunction.
Persistent multifocal right-sided patchy airspace consolidations, compatible with persistent multifocal pneumonia.
Near-complete resolution of left-sided pneumonia with only small patchy focal airspace consolidations in the left base.
No cavitary lesion.
The constellation of findings is compatible with continued improvement without acute complication.
Duodenal bezoar Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Final diagnosis: small punctate lesions in rectum, without active bleeding, consistent with proctitis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 57 yo male with h/o HCV cirrhosis c/b HCC s/p distant OLT, ITP s/p splenectomy and myelofibrosis admitted with H. flu PNA.
His hospital course was complicated by Klebsiella pneumonia, worsening mitral regurgitation s/p cardiac catheterization with BMS x2 to the LCx, lower GI bleed and recurrent epistaxis, now clinically stable.
Community Acquired Pneumonia:  The patient presented with productive cough and fever on [**2139-2-18**].
He continued to have a leukocytosis and productive cough and was found to have Klebsiella PNA on [**2139-3-11**].
He had a repeat Chest CT on [**3-22**], which demonstrated improvement of the multifocal pneumonia and he had a bronchoscopy on [**2139-3-27**], from which the cultures were negative.
His CXR prior to discharge remained consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
He should have a repeat CT Chest performed in [**2-1**] weeks to assess for radiographic improvement.
Gatrointestinal Bleeding: The patient developed a lower GI bleed on [**2139-3-27**].
He had an EGD, which demonstrated grade I varcies and AVM and flexible sigmoidoscopy showed fresh blood in colon without source of bleeding.
He received 5 [**Location **] during his hospital stay, and he remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of bleeding for one week prior to discharge.
# Mitral regurgiation:  The patient developed worsening shortness of breath and chest pain on [**2139-3-20**].
He had a TTE performed, which demonstrated worsening mitral regurgitation, and there was concern for inferolateral hypokinesis, thought to be secondary to ischemia.
He was not started on a statin given his history of HCC.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**State 792**]Hospital on [**5-6**] for management of his MR.  # Epistaxis:  The patient developed a nose bleed on [**2139-3-30**].
# Myelofibrosis, ITP w/ residual splenule: He was seen by hematology who confirmed that he had myelofibrosis.
His peripheral smear was notable for eosinophils and hematology was concerned that he could have chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
He did not receive any platelets during his hospital course, but he was given 5 [**Location **] for his lower GI bleed.
# HCC s/p OLT:  The patient was continued on Tacrolimus and his levels were checked daily with a goal of [**5-6**].
# Chronic LBP:  The patient has a history of low back pain, for which he takes Tylenol at home.
During this hospital stay, his pain was controlled with Oxycodone, Morphine, Tylenol, Gabapentin, and a Lidocaine patch.
# BPH: No active issues.
The wet read of his renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stone.
Hepatitis C: He had a history of HCC with RFA in [**4-5**] for lesions in segment V and VIII.
His Hep C viral load was high during this admission and his CT scan in [**Month (only) 359**] showed no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease.
His CT of the chest did reveal multiple perigarstric varices.
h.o DVT: He had a DVT in [**2129**] but given his low platelet count he remained on pneumoboots during his hospitalization.

You were treated with antibiotics for this pneumonia, but when your clinical picture did not improve, you were found to have another bacteria causing an infection in your lungs.
During the course of this treatment, you had worsening shortness of breath, and a cardiac ultrasound demonstrated that your mitral valve was no longer functioning as well as it once had.
After this procedure, you had an episode of bleeding from your GI tract, for which you underwent a sigmoidoscopy and EGD.
Finally, you had a nose bleed while you were here, for which our ENT doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
We STARTED you on a Lidocaine patch, Neurontin and Oyxcodone for pain 6.
