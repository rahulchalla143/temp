On [**2160-6-22**] she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with rigors and fever and was found to have 5 cm abscess under the diaphragm on the CT scan.
Several days after discharge, her antibiotics were switched to Augmentin, as she reported nausea to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via the phone.
The CT scan showed the intraabdominal abscess still present, however decreased in size.
Patient had been experiencing nausea, decreased apetite and chills without fever or emesis.

Persistent small gallstones.
Mild interval decrease in fluid content but increase in fecal content.
No intra-abdominal free air beyond the collection.
No new intra-abdominal abscess.
Slightly increased small left pleural effusion compared to [**7-10**], but decreased compared to [**6-26**].
Simple cholelithiasis without CT evidence of acute cholecystitis  [**2160-7-20**] CT Scan Abdomen/Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Left upper quadrant abdominal fluid collection measuring 6.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm with rim enhancement, is consistent with an abscess.
No new intra-abdominal abscesses/fluid collections are detected.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with near complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
Moderate amount of simple ascitic fluid layering along the paracolic gutters, pericholecystic and perihepatic regions and pelvis.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease with significant narrowing of the left external iliac and celiac arteries.
Cortical hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region is noted.
No significant mass effect or volume loss is present.
This appears to represent a subacute infarction.
Encephalomalacic changes in the right occipital lobe.
No intracranial hemorrhage or brain herniation.
This fluid collection is not grossly changed since [**7-25**] but is amenable for percutaneous drainage/drain placement as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4 p.m. 2.
Midline inferior open wound and left lateral open wounds had been debrided since study on [**7-25**].
Stable-appearing right greater than left pleural effusions with right lower lobe collapse and left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
Persistent atherosclerotic disease  [**2160-8-7**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.

Interval decrease of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
[**2160-8-8**] Carotid Series Apparent left ICA occlusion.
Of note, ultrasound is not 100% accurate in differentiating a very high-grade stenosis from an occlusion.
No previous ultrasounds are available for comparison.
[**2160-8-8**] IR PICC line Placement  [**2160-8-8**] MRA/MRI Brain MRA IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the left internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous as well as supraclinoid portions indicate occlusion in the neck.
There is collateral flow to the left middle cerebral artery through the anterior communicating artery from the right side.
MRI Impression: Diffusion abnormalities are predominantly isointense on ADC map with several small areas of low signal indicating late acute or early subacute infarcts.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
[**2160-8-11**] Chest Xray The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid lower SVC, with no evidence of looping seen on the current study as opposite to the prior radiograph.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.
Prominence of the aortopulmonic window is consistent with lymph nodes seen on the recent CT torso.
The patient is after left upper abdomen surgery.
No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is currently demonstrated.
Within the limitations of this study, no clear evidence of rib fractures is present but repeated evaluation with dedicated rib views might be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo F with splenectomy, on chronic steroids who presented with unresolved subdiaphragmatic abscess despite adequate drain placement and antibiotics.
In the OR she was found to have a persistent colon perforation that was draining into the contained abscess site.
She became hypotensive in the OR and was transferred to the ICU post-op where she remained intubated.
She required aggressive fluid resuscitation for low urine output and lactic acidosis and she was given stress-dose steroids.
Her heart rate was controlled with metoprolol IV and hypertension was controlled with increased diuresis.
Also near post-operative day 4 the patient was noted to have some decreased movement on right side while intubated and a CT of the head was obtained which showed: cortical hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region, no significant mass effect or volume loss which appeared to represent a subacute infarction, no encephalomalacic changes in the right occipital lobe, and no intracranial hemorrhage or brain herniation.
It was decided at this watchful waiting would be the best and appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] of action with frequent neurologic assessment.
On post-op day 9 the inferior portion of the midline incision was probed and was also noted to drain purulent fluid.
On post-op day 10 she became febrile and a CT abdomen showed LUQ abscess which was drained by CT-guided technique the following day.
Also on postop day 21 the patient was noted to have unilateral edema of the right arm.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was obtained which showed a superficial clot in the basilic vein around the PICC line.
Peripheral access was obtained however after consideration of the duration of the antibiotic and antifungal therapy needed, a PICC line was placed in the left upper extremity by interventional radiology.
On post op day 22 a CT abdomen was obtained to evaluate for improvements of the abdominal collections.
Which appeared to show no new focal collection within the abdomen or pelvis, interval decrease in size of left upper quadrant and right lower quadrant fluid collections, with pigtail percutaneous drainage catheters in place, low attenuation pelvic fluid collection appears similar as before, Improved appearance of lower midline and left hemi abdominal wall wounds as compared to [**2160-7-31**], and interval decrease of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
The patient was evaluated by the surgical team and a thorough history of the patients baseline weakness after CEA was evaluated.
Although there was no increasing weakness a neurology consult was obtained.
MRI/MRA showed diffusion abnormalities with several small areas of low signal indicating late acute or early subacute infarcts, mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy as well as non-visualization of the left internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous as well as supraclinoid portions indicating occlusion in the neck.
There is collateral flow to the left middle cerebral artery through the anterior communicating artery from the right side.
Carotid duplex showed apparent left ICA occlusion.
Of note, ultrasound is not 100% accurate in differentiating a very high-grade stenosis from an occlusion.
Her blood glucose levels have been elevated at lunch and covered with sliding scale insulin however, it would be in the patients best interest to have an endocrine consult at the rehabilitation facility for continued monitoring.
The patients abdominal collection and wounds will be evaluated by the attending surgeon at her follow-up appointment.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 8957**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Perforated diverticulitis, Intra-abdominal abscesses, Occlusion of Left ICA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive at home after your hospitalization for an abcess in your abdomen related to diverticulitis.
You were taken to the operating room were you had a Laparoscopic converted to Open extended left colectomy with colorectal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy for perforated diverticulitis and subdiaphragmatic and left upper quadrant abscesses.
You had a very serious systemic infection which we discussed the treatment of this with the infectious disease doctors here at [**Name5 (PTitle) 18**].
Your current antibiotic/antifungal regimen is prescribed exactly for the microorganisms that have caused your infection and these should continue while you have the drain in your left side and at least 7 days after it has been removed.
While you were in the ICU, you had some new right sided weakness.
You have also had some waxing and waining confusion since the breathing tube was removed from your throat.
Some slight confusion after a very serious illness such as what you have gone through is somewhat expected and should improve over time, however many of the teams taking care of you were concerned and neurolgy was consulted for advice.
You have had several tests to examine your brain and it was determined that you had some small strokes on the left side of the brain, your carotid arteries have some buildup which has worsened since your prior vascular surgery.
Please monitor yourself and if you notice any new weakness, worsening confusion, inability to move your arms or legs, difficulty swallowing, or difficulty speaking please seek medical advice immediately.
You have a new ileostomy and it is important that you learn how to care for this on your own.
The biggest risk for a new illeostomy is dehydration, please keep yourself well hydrated and monitor yourself for signs of dehyrdation including: dizziness, increased thirst, weakness, low blood pressure.
Please continue to eat small frequent meals high in protien and drink supplemental drinks such as boost or ensure.
If you develop any of the following abdominal symptoms please call the office or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe: nausea, vomitning, increased abdominal pain, increasing abdominal distension, inability to tolerat food or liquids, or decrease or increase in stool output from your ostomy.
