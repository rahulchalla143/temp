Admission Date:  [**2114-11-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-11-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-2-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mitral valve replacement and atrial valve replacement with mechanical valves, hypertension, atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**11-5**] for right lateral lower lobe pneumonia complicated by hypotension.
He complained of cough with green sputum times three weeks and received amoxicillin from [**10-19**] to [**10-29**], prescribed by his primary care physician without improvement, but did complain of occasional chest discomfort, loose bowel movements, and occasional shortness of breath.
At the Emergency Room of [**Hospital1 190**] he was found to have bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, was tachypneic with rates of 22 to 26 respirations per minute, and required supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
He suffered from systolic hypotension in the 90s and was fluid resuscitated with 3 liters of normal saline and required dopamine.
Dopamine was discontinued because of resulting tachycardia and he was changed to Neo-Synephrine via peripheral IV.
Pneumonia was treated with levofloxacin in the Emergency Room and changed to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin.
He showed some evidence of mild prerenal azotemia which was treated with volume resuscitation.
The patient then became normotensive and again was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
There, he was noted to feel improved but still suffered from cough and mild hemoptysis.
He also noted chest discomfort while coughing along with mild shortness of breath.
He showed no peripheral edema.
No resting chest pain was noted.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Atrial valve and mitral replacements with mechanical valves.
Atrial fibrillation, status post conversion, on amiodarone.
History of pneumonia five years ago.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was an obese older male in mild distress who was diaphoretic, spoke in full sentences, and no visible rashes.
There was no sinus tenderness.
First heart sound and second heart sound were punctuated by a mechanical click.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs were notable for wheezes throughout, bibasilar rales reaching one-quarter up the lung fields, left greater than right.
Extremities were warm with 2+ peripheral edema bilaterally.
Urinary Legionella antigen was negative.
Blood cultures had no growth.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed bilateral bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, with evidence of small pleural effusions.
No change between the chest x-ray of [**11-6**] and [**11-5**]; consistent with congestive heart failure with dependent pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, atrial valve and mitral replacements, presenting with hypotension and bibasilar pneumonia, as well as evidence of mild congestive heart failure.
PNEUMONIA:  The patient presented with bibasilar consolidations consistent with bibasilar pneumonia.
The patient initially presented with an elevated white blood cell count, but by [**11-8**] the patient's white blood cell count had dropped to 11,000.
He reported symptomatic improvement over the course of his stay and was able to walk freely on the medical floor without shortness of breath or desaturation by the day of discharge.
He was in atrial fibrillation throughout his stay.
ANEMIA:  The patient appeared to have a longstanding borderline microcytic anemia.
The anemia shows a borderline increased RDW.
Evaluation was begun during this admission including a workup for iron deficiency anemia with total iron binding capacity, iron, and reticulocyte counts pending, as well as an evaluation of potential dietary deficiency including B12 and folate levels.
Additionally, a haptoglobin was sent and was pending at the time of discharge for some concern of hemolysis given the patient's mechanical heart valves.
These values and the further workup of the patient's anemia should be pursued in the context of his outpatient care.
AZOTEMIA:  The patient showed evidence of a prerenal azotemia throughout his stay which improved with fluid resuscitation.
Modifications in the patient's regimen for hypertension should be considered when the patient presents in two weeks to his primary care physician.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post atrial valve and mitral valve replacements.
Congestive heart failure.
