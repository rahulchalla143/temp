Admission Date:  [**2142-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: I&D of R anterior leg hematoma Transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, complaining of increasing fatigue over the last 10 days.
She was noted to have increasing pedal edema at this week's dialysis, and an additional 3# of fluid was removed the day prior to admission.
She recently had Imdur 30mg PO qD added to her regimen for CP control during a recent admission for chest pain/SOB in context of two missed HD appointments, during which she was ruled out, noted to have no ECG changes, and did not have further CAD w/u done due to clean coronaries on [**2137**] cath.
Ms. [**Known lastname 14204**] saw her cardiologist on the day of admission with her complaints of fatigue.
Per report, she appeared somewhat lethargic and weak.
She was reported to have little evidence of volume overload.
ECG demonstrated new AFib with rate 120, with evidence of LVH with extensive ST-T changes c/w left heart strain.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 14204**] also has been experiencing diffuse abdominal pain over the last 2-3 months.
She denies fever, chills, nausea, hematemesis, melena or hematochezia.
She has experienced a significant weight loss, from 141lb to 106lb over the last year.
Apparently had ARF from acyclovir given for Shingles, along with possible contrast nephropathy.
3) HTN 4) DMII (diet controlled)   Social History: No h/o tobacco or EtOH.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T: [**Age over 90 **]F  BP: 123/80  HR: 110  RR: 16  SaO2: 98% RA Gen: Lying flat in bed comfortably, NAD HEENT: PERRL, MMM Neck: Supple, brisk carotid upstroke, no LAD, no thyromegaly CV: Irregularly irregular, II/VI harsh SEM radiating to carotids.
There is bilateral mild to moderate pleural effusions as well as bilateral pulmonary edema.
The right hemithorax pacemaker is inserted with the leads in right atrium and right ventricle.
Area of linear calcification is demonstrated, the location of which could indicate mitral ring deposits.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderate-to-severely thickened and myxomatous.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Thrombus with associated low emptying velocities in the left atrial appendage.
CT RLE: FINDINGS: There is a large hematoma involving the anterior and lateral aspect of the right lower extremity.
There is no evidence of acute fracture IMPRESSION: Very large hematoma involving the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity extending from below the level of the knee towards the distal tibia.
[**5-7**] TTE: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is at least moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-12-22**], the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation and global left ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
Wound in the right calf drained large amounts of bright red blood.
Monophasic waveform was demonstrated symmetrically in the bilateral tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.
These findings could be due to arterial insufficiency, therefore compartment syndrome cannot be diagnosed or excluded by this test.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent consistent with age-related involutional change.
There is a periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel infarction.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear apart from a small calcification in the left frontal air cell.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

90% non-dominant ostial RCA lesion on previous cath, by report.
2) Pump: Evidence of some volume overload on initial exam and CXR, most likely [**1-4**] diastolic dysfunction in context of new AF, tachycardia, and loss of atrial kick.
Switched BB to Toprol XL, and continued diltiazem SR for HOCM and diastolic dysfunction while in-house.
Imdur held, so as to minimize unnecessary lowering of BP in this setting.
Course complicated by spontaneous R anterior compartment lower leg bleed while on heparin.
Plastic surgery performed I&D, and evacuated large hematoma, which had intermittent bleeding while bridging to coumadin.
4) Abdominal pain: Concerning for malignancy, given significant weight loss.
Denies F/C/NS or bowel symptoms, but will be very important to have colonoscopy as outpatient to r/o colon CA.
5) ESRD: Unclear etiology, possibly hypertensive nephropathy, exacerbated by episode of iatrogenic ARF during previous hospital admission.
A head CT was obtained, which demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage.
She had no neurological findings, and had no adverse sequelae from the event.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]- Parkview  Discharge Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation R lower extremity hematoma which developed in the setting of anticoagulation ESRD HOCM aortic stenosis DM II   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You are being transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further care.
