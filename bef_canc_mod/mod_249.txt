Admission Date:  [**2113-11-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-11-9**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male status post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation postoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation, history of loculated right-sided effusion (status post decortication), history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, history of right diaphragmatic history and history of colon cancer and history of prostate cancer who re-presents from [**Hospital 1319**] Hospital with worsening shortness of breath, which has been nonresponsive to Lasix and nebulizers.
As per his daughter, the patient was doing fairly well until a few days prior to admission when he developed somnolence around the time of his elective bronchoscopy.
A BAL culture from [**10-31**] was positive for moderate normal flora with moderate growth Serratia marcescens of two species, both sensitive to bactrim.
The patient was subsequently started on Bactrim, however, continued to develop increased somnolence and occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting.
He subsequently developed worsening shortness of breath and increased 02 requirement.
The patient was given additional Lasix and nebulizers without improvement of dyspnea.
The patient complained of increasing orthopnea, shortness of breath, cough productive of yellow sputum and an inability to clear his secretions.
The patient denies fevers, chills, no chest pain, no abdominal pain, no rashes, no pruritus.
He does not why there is a difference.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored, restarted on digoxin and Lopressor for rapid atrial fibrillation and given frequent chest Physical Therapy, incentive spirometry and suctioning.
The patient was also volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids and given no steroids as there was no evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
His past hospitalization from [**2113-7-13**] to [**2113-9-6**], the patient was admitted for the elected TVR and MVR with a prolonged postoperative course including rapid atrial fibrillation, volume overload, right-sided loculated effusion, possible Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and an inability to wean from the vent.
The patient had trachea and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed.
A VATS procedure was done for right-sided effusion and atelectasis as per operative note, which showed blood clot, which was removed.
A decortication was done and re-expansion of right lower lobe was observed.
From [**2113-9-10**] to [**2113-9-14**], the patient was re-admitted from [**Hospital1 1319**] to [**Hospital6 1760**] due to increased sputum productive, low grade fever, increasing vent support.
Sputum grew out Serratia and the patient was given Levaquin and Ceftazidime.
On admission, the patient was noted to have a cuff leak which was repaired and bronchoscopy revealed minimal secretions.
Serratia was thought at that time to have some element of seizure after he was diuresed, however, an echocardiogram done showed a normal ejection fraction.
The patient was started on Captopril, Lasix and digoxin with improvement of bilateral effusions.
The patient continued progressive vent wean and went back to [**Hospital1 1319**].
From [**10-3**] to [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 1319**], the patient continued the vent wean and on [**10-2**], the patient felt rapid atrial fibrillation.
His Captopril was decreased and beta-blocker was added with minimal response.
An electrocardiogram was concerning for ST depressions in the anterior lateral leads and the patient was transferred back to [**Hospital6 256**].
The patient was given intravenous Lopressor which decreased the rate in the Emergency Department, but resulted in low blood pressure, which responded to intravenous fluid boluses.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed new right upper lobe infiltrate.
The patient's heart rate was controlled with beta-blockers, however, the patient continued to have intermittent hypertension, in which he was given IV fluid.
The patient completed a course of vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia with suspected Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or other resistant organisms.
Psychiatric was consulted for anxiety at that time and the patient was started on Zyprexa which decreased his vent dependence.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also notable for worsening drainage of wound from his VAT site and the patient was evaluated by Plastic Surgery who recommended conservative treatment.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2097**] with left main disease.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Pancytopenia thought to be due to MDS, however, bone marrow biopsy in [**2113-7-13**] was nondiagnostic.
Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Echocardiogram in [**2113-9-12**], ejection fraction 50-55%, positive TR, moderate PA systolic hypertension, prosthetic mitral valve seen.
Catheterization on [**2113-7-11**]:  100% occlusion of the left main coronary artery, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to left circumflex, patent right coronary artery stent, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (pressure 45/26).
Ocean nasal spray.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with myocardial infarction at age 59, mother with breast cancer.
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit barely stable at 30, no pandemia on discharge.
Chest x-ray showed progressive loss of right lung volume which may represent a combination collapse and increasing pleural effusion.
In general, the patient is an elderly male, awake and alert in no acute distress, but is very hard of hearing.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No gag reflex elicited.
Heart:  Irregularly irregular, positive systolic murmur at the apex, normal S1, S2, no gallops heard.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2113-11-6**] and his hypoxia resolved rather quickly with nebulizers, chest Physical Therapy and incentive spirometry and some gentle diuresis.
There was a question as to whether the shortness of breath was a combination of mucous plugging plus right hemidiaphragmatic injury, as well as a question of mild congestive heart failure.
It was elected not to start Solu-Medrol as the patient had no evidence of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
For his atrial fibrillation, the patient was continued on Lopressor and digoxin, as well as Coumadin.
The patient's hematocrit of 25 at the outside hospital, did not seem to be an acute decline.
The patient will need further Physical Therapy, as well as to complete six more days of a Ceftriaxone course and his Coumadin will also have to be more therapeutic in light of his atrial fibrillation, as well as his MVR and TVR.
