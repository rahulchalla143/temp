Admission Date:  [**2122-9-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2122-9-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2051-9-18**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, monoclonal gamma globulin of undetermined significance, and gout who presented to the Emergency Room on [**9-17**] with a complaint of several days of nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and cough.
The patient was in his usual state of health until four days prior to admission when he developed nausea and vomiting and was unable to tolerate anything p.o.
Apparently one day prior to admission the patient developed a nonproductive cough associated with shortness of breath.
The patient felt progressively weak and presented to the Emergency Room.
Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe pneumonia.
Laboratories showed leukocytosis and a creatinine of 6.6.
The patient's urine had muddy brown casts and epithelial cells.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Transthoracic echocardiograms in [**2116**] showed enlarge left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
History of pneumonia requiring intubation in [**2115**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was alert, in no acute distress.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs revealed coarse dry scattered crackles bilaterally, left greater than right.
No murmurs appreciated.
Extremities had no edema.
Urinalysis revealed large blood, positive nitrites, greater than 30 protein, large bilirubin, moderate bacteria, muddy brown casts.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia [**Company 109175**] wave inversion in lead III, right bundle-branch block (new from [**2118**] electrocardiogram with exercised-induced on stress test in [**2122-1-26**]).
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%, left ventricular size was normal, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was started on intravenous Levaquin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin given previous history of pneumonia requiring intubation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient became hypotensive, likely the result of significant hypovolemia from decreased p.o.
Given the patient's acute renal failure the patient was started on Levophed in order to insure renal perfusion in the setting of acute renal failure.
Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, the patient was sent for an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%.
Left ventricular cavity size was normal with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There was mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient did not show any signs of congestive heart failure during this admission.
RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine of 6.6.
Acute renal failure was likely a combination of prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis.
The patient's FENa on presentation was 0.3 with urinalysis showing muddy brown casts.
The patient also presented with metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate of 15 on admission.
Metabolic acidosis resolved with intravenous fluids with bicarbonate of 23 at the time of discharge.
The patient went for abdominal ultrasound to evaluate elevated bilirubin.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a mass in the kidney.
The patient subsequently went for a CT scan of the abdomen which did not show any renal mass.
Hemolysis and DIC panels were sent and were negative.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with a direct hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin peaking at 10.
In addition, the patient had a slight transaminitis with ALT peaking at 107 and AST at 177.
Elevated liver function tests were likely the result of decreased perfusion to the liver at the time of presentation.
On admission, the patient's alkaline phosphatase remained elevated at 156.
In reviewing the patient's records, the patient has had elevated alkaline phosphatase in the past.
The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which showed gallstones but no cholecystitis.
Acute renal failure.
Coronary artery disease.
