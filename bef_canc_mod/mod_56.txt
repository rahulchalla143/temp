Results follow:  ORAL PHASE: The oral phase was noted for overall mild deficits with regards to decreased bolus control and formation, prolonged mastication, decreased ap tongue movement with pumping behavior, mildly prolonged oral transit with solids & liquids, and mild oral residue remaining on the tongue.
There was also intermittent trace premature spillover of thin liquids to the laryngeal vestibule with thin liquids.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: The pharyngeal phase [**Month/Day/Year 3780**] significant improvment from the prior exam, as the pt is now demonstrating mild pharyngeal deficits overall.
Bolus propulsion was mildly weakened with mild pyriform sinus residue noted, mainly with liquids.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Mild penetration occurred during the swallow with thin liquids due to decreased laryngeal valve closure and also at times premature spillover.
No aspiration occurred during the study.
TREATMENT TECHNIQUES: While the pt was not sensate to either presence of resiude in his throat or to penetration that was occurring, the use of repeat swallows, alternating bites/sips and throat clearing removed pharyngeal residue and penetration.
However, he still continues to present with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with the main issues being slowed mastication, the presence of pharyngeal residue and penetration with thin liquids.
As such, at this time, I would recommend that the pt begin a po diet consitency of ground consistency solids and thin liquids.
Po diet consistency of ground solids, thin liquids.
