No bladder/bowel incontinence.
Past Medical History: CHF- ECHO in '[**96**] showed EF 55% Afib ventral hernia neuropathy on L side s/p "neck" tumor surgery Diverticulitis .
PSHX: -LAR complicated by CHF post-op.
Echo at that time EF >55%, mild LVH, mild MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 12753**] of cervical spinal tumor c/b L sided neuropathy and weakness   Social History: Lives in FL during winter.
No rhinorrhea.
No dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
IMAGING: NCHCT [**3-26**] - FINDINGS:  High-density material is seen tracking along the left hemisphere consistent with acute subdural hematoma.
High-density material also seen tracking along the falx and left tentorium, also consistent with subdural hematoma.
Hematoma measures approximately 1 cm in greatest width and demonstrates mass effect, with subfalcine herniation, with rightward shift of approximately 6 mm.
Mass effect is seen on the left lateral ventricle.
Evidence of previous right MCA territory infarct again seen.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
Mass effect also seen on the left lateral ventricle.
No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
Stable appearance to extensive degenerative disease and vertebral body/ right facet fusion from C5-C7.
Reidentification of extensive subdural hematoma.
Shoulder x-ray [**3-26**] - No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
NCHCT [**3-27**] - Large left-sided acute subdural hemorrhage which appears to be unaltered in extent compared to the prior study of [**3-26**] .
Persistent retrocardiac opacity is concerning for ongoing pneumonia.
Superior mediastinal prominence is consistent with goiter seen on prior chest CT. .
There is no significant change seen in the mass effect, or right temporal hyperdensity.
No new hemorrhage identified.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or thoracic aortic dissection.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities, concerning for pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
Mild CHF.
She had repeat head CTs which showed no evidence of new hemorrhage.
A repeat CT showed no change or evidence of new stroke, however she was noticed to have some expressive aphasia which continued into [**3-28**], otherwise her exam was fairly intact.
An MRI was ordered to eval for new stroke but on transport, patient became hypotensive and was returned to the floor and evaluated by MICU team for transfer.
S/p MICU transfer: # Respiratory distress: Thought to be secondary pneumonia seen on CT.
Given fever, tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, was treated for pneumonia.
[**Month (only) 116**] be community-acquired (as had been going on since prior to admission) vs aspiration (with altered mental status) vs hospital acquired.
Was treated as aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and flagyl.
No evidence of CHF on exam or xray, and had actually been getting double her usual lasix dose on the medical floor and appeared dry on exam.
CTA chest negative for pulmonary embolus.
Upon transfer back to the medical floor, the pt's oxygen requirement was weaned down to 2L NC and she was sating in the upper 90s by the time of discharge.
# SDH: Was maintained on dilantin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Per neurosurgery, she will need to finish a 7 day course of dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Possibilities included medication effect (dilantin) vs. sepsis and pneumonia, vs expanding SDH.
Treated pneumonia as above.
Upon transfer to the floor, the pt was alert and oriented X 3 without any deficits noted on neuro exam, including aphasia and dysarthria.
# Neuropathic pain: Continued home regimen of neurontin.
Cepacol 2 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane every eight (8) hours as needed for sore throat.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Left sided subdural hematoma Aspiration Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with subdural hematoma (bleeding in your brain) after having a fall while on coumadin.
You also developed a pneumonia during your ICU stay.
If you develop worsening headache, dizziness, visual problems, gait difficulties, or any other concerning symptom, please call your doctor or report to the nearest ER.
