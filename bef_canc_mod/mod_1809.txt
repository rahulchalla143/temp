Admission Date: [**2169-3-13**]        Discharge Date: [**2169-3-19**]   Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of multiple medical problems as listed below including recurrent pancreatitis attributed to microlithiasis, who was in her usual state of health until today when she developed abdominal pain radiating to her back and side, and had some nausea.
She was brought to the emergency department where she was found to have laboratory values consistent with pancreatitis.
In the emergency department, the patient received Lopressor for initially elevated SBP of 187, but subsequently became hypotensive.
Upon initial evaluation, the patient also was describing substernal chest discomfort as a complaint in association with her back pain.
CT of her torso was performed, which ruled out dissection, but did show distended gallbladder with common bile duct, increase in diameter as well.
CT scan also showed some stranding of the colon.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI in [**2167**].
Her last echocardiogram showed systolic congestive heart failure with an LV ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent, apical left ventricular aneurysm and diffuse wall motion abnormalities.
The left ventricle showed 1 plus aortic insufficiency.
Mild Alzheimer's disease  for which she receives Aricept and Seroquel for sleep.
Symptomatic bradycardia necessitating DDD cardiac pacemaker placement.
Colon cancer at the age of 78 status post surgical resection.
No radiation or chemotherapy was performed.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Normal with slight crackles heard at the bases.
No rebound or guarding.
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
No focal abnormalities.
Urinalysis, positive for leukocyte esterase and blood, negative nitrites, greater than 50 white blood cells, moderate bacteria noted, 0 to 2 epithelial.
IMPRESSION:  A [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female presenting with recurrent pancreatitis and hypertension, question of bowel ischemia, most likely secondary to low flow state.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient developed acute congestive heart failure from flash pulmonary edema.
Lungs exam were notable for diffuse expiratory wheezes and chest x-ray showed evidence of pulmonary edema.
The patient was sent to the NICU for respiratory monitoring and BiPAP.
EKG showed pseudonormalization of T waves in the lateral precordial leads, otherwise it was stable from prior studies.
It was thought that this patient may have suffered from a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the setting of having flash pulmonary edema.
Repeat echocardiogram was performed on the 14th, which showed an EF of 30 percent, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, moderate MR, worse from prior study, most likely in the setting of having decompensated congestive heart failure.
She is clinically stable without any evidence of chest discomfort or cough.
The patient was also initiated on statin therapy in the setting of having had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
However, the patient does have a history of cancer as well as coronary artery disease and diabetes, all of which are chronic conditions, which could be contributing to her chronic anemia.
Pancreatitis:  The patient is status post aggressive IV fluid hydration, normalization of her LFTs and resolution of her abdominal pain.
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest discomfort.
