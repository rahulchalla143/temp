She was dialyzed and given back 1.6L of fluid with improvement in her BP and other sx.
Pt was then transferred from dialysis to the [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation of her constitutional symptoms.
Enroute she was complaining of chest pain that was sharp and pleuritic - resolved with dilaudid.
Patient endorsed dizzyness/lightheadedness and nausea during episode of hypotension.
Also pleuritic chest pain as above.
No fevers, SOB, no diaphoresis, no vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.

CXR: IMPRESSION: Central vascular congestion with marked improvement in volume balance from prior study.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2179-3-17**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process with residual encephalomalacia with dystrophic mineralization, presumably sequelae of old parenchymal hemorrhage with superimposed renal insufficiency.
[**2179-3-18**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; however, this is a significantly limited study due to streak artifact from EEG leads.
The background activity was intermixed with slow waves suggestive of widespread encephalopathy.
In addition, there was intermittent focal slowing in the left parasagittal area with occasional sharp waves in the same region.
These last two abnormalities suggest a cortical and subcortical dysfunction in the left parasagittal area.
STAT head CT revealed changes consistent with known pathology, but no new lesions identified.
31F with SLE and h/o endocarditis presenting with weakness, hypotension, dizziness and nausea.
Initial cause was most likely hypovolemia.
Endocrine was curbsided about adrenal insufficiency but state it would not be a primary cause - if she were stressed, it could account for the hypotension, but not in and of itself.
Patient has been afebrile and most often assymptomatic so sepsis is much less likely.
# Chronic pain: Patient is usually on 100 fent patch and PO dilaudid, all of which were held in the setting of hypotension and unresponsive episode.
Chronic pain saw her and feel narcotics likely aren't contributing to these 2 etiologies and her oral dilaudid was started with good effect.
# Unwitnessed fall on [**2179-3-18**]: Patient states she was so uncomfortable that she had to get up.
CT head without big bleed, but unable to fully assess due to EEG leads.
Head CT without acute process after episodes.
Neuro was consulted and Video EEG was without seizures.
No change in antiepileptics.
Seizures DO: Neurology following and Video EEG without seizure.
Right elbow wound: no purulence drainage.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypovolemic hypotension .
Secondary: Seizure disorder End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Adrenal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Fair, at baseline, on room air, Blood pressures 88-117/palp-70s which is at baseline for her.
You came to the hospital for hypotension with dizzyness/nausea.
A head CT showed no new changes.
While in the hospital you also had an episode of unresponsiveness requiring a MICU transfer even though your blood pressure was stable.
A video EEG showed no evidence of seizures.
The Endocrinology team felt your hypotension was not due to adrenal insufficiency.
Your transplant and ID doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] not feel you have an infection and so stopped antibiotics.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Call your doctor or return to the ED if you feel dizzy/lightheaded, have headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other concerns.
