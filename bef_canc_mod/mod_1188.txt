MRI showed ongoing discitis and osteo.
Per ID recommendation, discitis/osteomyelitis is presumed to be [**1-17**] Enterococcus at this time and patient is to complete 6 week course of Daptomycin for Enterococcus bactermia and osteomyelitis.
Echo was negative for valvular vegetations concerning for endocarditis.
Main concern is for recurrence of epidural abscess.
CXR done on arrival to ICU showed increasing RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA vs Aspiration Pneumonitis.
Patient was initially treated with Vancomycin and Aztreonam for a 2 week course given recent history of enterococcal bacteremia.
-Pati ID recommended Daptomycin for an additional 2 weeks for enterococcal bacteremia/osteomyelitis (last day being [**11-14**]).
