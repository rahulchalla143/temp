There is persistent pneumocephalus, decreased in comparison to prior study from [**2194-1-16**].
Additionally, there is now a small amount of mixed attenuation fluid in the left frontal region, consistent with post-surgical changes and non-hemorrhagic.
Hyperdense material is again noted in the region of the sella (2:8), either representative of residual blood or volume averaging.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Additionally, a hypodensity is noted in the left inferior frontal lobe (2:10), likely representative of either another evolving infarction or post-surgical edema and partly seen on the axial FLAIR sequence of prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] study.
Post-surgical changes again noted with left frontal craniotomy and expected postoperative changes with a small amount of non-hemorrhagic fluid and resolving pneumocephalus.
Subacute left globus pallidus infarct is again noted.
Additionally, again noted is the hypodensity in the left frontal lobe near the midline (2:10) suggestive of either another evolving ischemic change or edema, partly seen earlier.
MRI  BRAIN AND MRA HEAD/NECK W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-1-20**] 3:46 PM FINDINGS:  MRI HEAD:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy for resection of recurrent tuberculum sellae meningioma.
There is expected resolution of postoperative pneumocephalus with persistent, yet less prominent left frontal subdural fluid collection (reduction from previous 9 to current 6 mm in maximal thickness).
There is an unchanged 4-mm enhancing soft tissue focus in the planum sphenoidale which may be postoperative in nature or represent residual meningioma.
There is evolution of scattered infarcts involving the left basal ganglia (globus pallidus), the inferior and left lateral frontal, and anterior left temporal lobe.
None of these infarcted areas demonstrates interval mass effect or hemorrhagic transformation.
The cerebral sulci, ventricles, and extra-axial CSF containing spaces are otherwise normal in appearance, and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
MRA HEAD: There is a significant short segment stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment with small caliber of the more distal portions.
There is bilateral fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery.
No aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations are identified.
There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.
Evolution of scattered infarcts involving the left basal ganglia, inferior and lateral frontal, and left temporal lobe.
High-grade stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment with small caliber of the more distal branches, correlation with CTA is advised.
Unchanged focus of enhancement in the planum sphenoidale which may be postoperative in nature or represent a small amount of residual tumor.
There is fluid in the left frontal region consistent with post-surgical changes.
Previously seen hyperdense material in the region of the sella is less apparent and likely represents evolving blood products.
The hypodensities are again noted in the left globus pallidus, left inferior and lateral frontal lobe, and left temporal lobe.
There are no new hypodensities.
There are no new areas of edema or hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
CTA OF THE HEAD: There is high-grade stenosis in the proximal left M1 segment.
The vessels distal to the stenosis are still opacified however the overall vessel caliber in the left MCA distribution are decreased.
The visualized portions of the carotid and vertebral arteries are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
The posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries are patent without evidence of stenosis.
Previously seen hypodensities in the left basal ganglia, inferior and lateral left frontal lobe, and left temporal lobe are unchanged.
No new hypodensities.
High-grade stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment is again seen with overall decreased caliber of more distal vessels of the left middle cerebral artery.
Status post left frontal craniotomy with some residual left subdural fluid collection, unchanged.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-1-22**] 6:17 AM FINDINGS: Post-left frontal craniotomy changes are again seen with a small subdural collection and trace pneumocephalus as well as overlying skin staples.
Allowing for streak artifact in the left temporoparietal region, there is no new hemorrhage.
There is trace polypoid mucosal disease involving a single right posterior ethmoidal air cell.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change since [**2194-1-20**].
Allowing for such, there is no significant interval change in the caliber of the lateral ventricles as compared to most recent preceding exam to indicate increased mass effect.
A sliver of left frontal subdural collection is again seen but not well assessed.
Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with trace operative pneumocephalus and overlying anterior scalp surgical staples.
IMPRESSION:  Likely no increased mass effect since most recent preceding exam.
There are low lung volumes.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Neurophysiology: EEG Study Date of [**2194-1-21**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There are intermittent few second runs of blunted sharp waves in the left temporal area phase reversing at F7/T3.
In addition, there are brief runs of independent left frontal sharp waves lasting one second or less with narrower base and lower amplitude as compared to the left temporal sharp discharges.
Left-sided slowing is more prominently present over the temporal region.
There are no epileptic discharges or electrographic seizures.
HYPERVENTILATION: Hyperventilation could not be performed due to history of intracranial mass.
SLEEP: The patient progresses to drowsiness and stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG, because of background asymmetry with slowing over the left hemisphere more prominently the left temporal region.
This finding is indicative of diffuse cortical and subcortical dysfunction over the left hemisphere particularly the left temporal area.
In addition, there are intermittent independent left temporal and left frontal epileptic discharges indicative of epileptogenic foci in these regions.
No electrographic seizures are present.
There is continuous polymorphic delta slowing over the left frontotemporal regions.
In addition, there are intermittent broad-based blunted sharp waves over the anterior left hemisphere phase reversing at F3/C3 and F7/T3.
No electrographic seizures are present in the recording.
There are no epileptiform discharges in the automated file.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are no automated seizure detections.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations.
SLEEP: The patient progresses to drowsiness and stage II sleep with well-formed sleep potentials over the right hemisphere.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with significant slowing over the left hemisphere.
This finding is indicative of diffuse left hemispheric cortical and subcortical dysfunction.
In addition, there are frequent low voltage wide-based epileptiform discharges over the left frontotemporal region as well as polymorphic slowing in the same region.
These findings are indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in left frontotemporal region with underlying structural abnormality.
No electrographic seizures are present in the recording.
There are no significant changes compared to prior day's study.
There is continuous left frontal temporal polymorphic delta slowing.
In addition, there are intermittent blunted wide-based sharp discharges at T3 and F3.
No electrographic seizures are present.
There are no epileptiform discharges.
There are no electrographic seizures.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations.
SLEEP: The patient progresses from wakefulness to stage II, then slow wave sleep at appropriate times with sleep morphologies better developed over the right hemisphere.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with slowing over the left side indicative of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in these regions.
In addition, there are low amplitude blunted epileptic discharges over the left fronotemporal regions with polymorphic delta slowing of background consistent with potential epileptogenic foci with underlying subcortical dysfunction.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there are no significant changes.
Neurology: Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Report [**2194-1-23**] Impression: Abnormal TCD evaluation.
In the distal left MCA, there were blunted waveforms with lower velocities suggesting that there is significant stenosis in the proximal left MCA.
Higher velocities in the left ACA and left P2 segment of the PCA suggested that there is hemodynamically significant diversion of flow from the left MCA to the left ACA and left P2 segment of the PCA.
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Report [**2194-1-23**] TCD Results: Transcranial doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed with insonation of the left middle cerebral artery at a depth of 67mm and at 56mm.
No abnormal waveforms were seen.
Impression: Abnormal TCD evaluation.
Results did not show any microembolic signals.
No abnormal waveforms were seen.
Impression: Abnormal TCD evaluation.
No microembolic signals were seen, representing an improvement from the TCD study on [**2194-1-23**].
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo RHW with HTN and recently s/p re-resection of large tuberculum sellae meningioma [**1-16**], with silent L basal ganglia infarct noted on post-op MRI, and presented on [**2194-1-20**] with a 2 hr episode of R weakness and speech difficulties [**1-19**] that resolved after 2 hours and was taken to hospital the following morning.
MRI showed scattered recent left frontal craniotomy with interval reduction of left frontal subdural fluid collection, evolution of scattered infarcts involving the left basal ganglia, inferior and lateral frontal, and left temporal lobes with an increase in the size of the left frontal lobe and most significantly a high-grade stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment with small caliber of the more distal branches on MRA.
EEG LTM was performed which was asymmetric and demonstrated right [**7-10**] Hz and left sided theta and delta slowing.
Patient developed sudden onset mild right arm weakness at 0600 on [**2194-1-22**] with persistent aphasia which was predominantly expressive with some paraphasic errors and initial difficulty following commands.
Concern was for hypoperfusion given her very significant left MCA stenosis and stat CT-head showed no new infarct and EEG bedside monitoring showed pronounced left hemisphere slowing but no seizures which could be compatible with hypoperfusion.
Echo with bubble on [**1-22**] showed no cardiac source of embolism and EF 60-65% with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
She was initially trialled on the floor and latterly stepdown unit with aggressive IVF resuscitation but her SBP was only maintained in 120s and deemed not sufficient to maintain perfusion, with persistence albeit with some improvement of her symptoms she was transferred to the ICU on [**2194-1-22**] for initiation of pressors.
Her EEG was stopped when in the ICU as there had been no seizure activity seen.
Patient was having microemboli felt due to her likely MCA dissection noted on TCD on [**2194-1-23**] but this had settled by [**2194-1-24**].
On the floor, to further assess her hypotension, she had a morning cortisol taken which was low at 0.5.
Pituitary hormone panel with FSH, LH, TSH and prolactin were all entirely normal.
Therefore, her left MCA high-grade stenosis was felt likely secondary to a dissection at the time of surgery which would also account for her prior infarcts in this region.
She was started on fludrocortisone as above due to relative hypotension to aid in left MCA perfusion.
Due to continued mild aphasia persistent at the time of discharge and only obvious on probing (poor ability to name animals as described) she was discharged home on [**2194-1-26**] with outpatient speech therapy and neurology stroke follow-up in addition to her planned neuro-oncology follow-up.
Given her persistent language deficits, the need for formal neuropsychological evaluation regarding aphasia will be addressed at time of follow-up and possible functional language necessary for return to work given her job as an editor.
Medications on Admission: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every  6 hours) as needed for Pain or fever > 101.4.
Outpatient Speech/Swallowing Therapy Patient requires outpatient speech therapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Likely left middle cerebral artery dissection likely traumatic at the time of surgery with resultant high-grade stenosis and prior left MCA distribution embolic infarcts Relative hypotension and started on fludrocortisone to aid in left MCA perfusion  Secondary diagnosis: Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent but still word-finding difficulties which are relatively mild Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Neurologic: A+Ox3 but mild aphasia with poor naming (only 6 animals and 3 words beginning with F) and difficulty with the finer details in conversation.
Full power all 4 limbs and mild right-sided weaknes appears to have resolved.
No sensory or coordination abnormalities.
You presented with transient right sided weakness and word-finding difficulty.
MRI showed strokes on the left side of your brain which had also been present post-operatively.
You were also noted to have a very tight blood vessel supplying blood to the left side of the brain.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU and treated with IV medications to maintain higher blood pressures after a further episode of word-finding difficulty and this improved and we were then able to be transfer you back to the floor.
We also monitored you on EEG and as there was no evidence of seizures, we have tapered and now stopped the keppra medication you were taking.
If you have a cut or other area of bleeding, it will therefore take longer for this to stop.
In addition, if you have a head injury, you are at risk of bleeding and should always present to the ED for evaluation if this were to happen.
You also had evidence of a urinary tract infection which was treated with 3 days of IV antibiotics.
You still have some word-finding difficulties and we have referred you for out-patient speech therapy.
You should see your PCP as soon as possible for follow-up.
