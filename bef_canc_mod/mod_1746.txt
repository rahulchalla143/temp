HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was an 82-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, history of splenectomy and history of colon cancer status post [**2-3**] with a five-day history of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate but chronic linear densities at the left lung base and fine reticular pattern at days with improvement, but five days prior to admission, she developed cough productive of yellow sputum and fevers to 101??????
She also noted some postural light-headedness and nausea.
CLL which developed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2094**] status post course of Melphalan and Prednisone in [**2097**], status post CHOP in [**2097**] and status post [**Hospital1 **] in [**2098**] when lymphoma recurred in jaw and orbit.
Hypogammaglobinemia receiving monthly IVIG up until one year ago with normal immunoglobins since then.
Colonoscopy in [**2103-3-1**] with hyperplastic rectal polyp.
Last pneumovax within the past five years.
History of hemophilus influenzae bronchitis.
History of SVC clot in [**2104-3-28**] likely related to Port-A-Cath at that time, status post six months of anticoagulation, finished in [**2104-10-28**] (Coumadin).
Cervical spinal stenosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of meningioma of the brain, no resection.
ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE WHICH CAUSES NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  She had an elevated temperature of 100.6?????
Scattered wheezes of the anterior chest.
Chest x-ray was notable for multiple patchy opacities of the right lower lobe and left lower lobe consistent with focal consolidation.
Pulmonary:  Over the course of the next three days, the patient was maintained on mask ventilation but persisted in having elevated carbon dioxide levels.
Over the course of the next three days, the patient continued to become more and more hypercapnic, and her mental status decreased.
Chest x-ray demonstrated no change with numerous patchy infiltrates and diffuse linear pattern consistent with infiltrate versus interstitial fibrosis.
Past chest x-rays demonstrated small amounts of interstitial fibrosis consistent with underlying lung disease.
CT scan demonstrated ground-glass opacification mostly in the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia.
Cystic changes were noted at her lung bases bilaterally and small bilateral effusions.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were noted, the largest of which were 14 x 15 mm and 12 x 19 mm.
On [**2-9**], in the morning, the patient was noted to have decreased mental status with unresponsiveness to sternal rub and pCO2 in the high 70s.
She met all criteria for ARDS including bilateral patchy opacities, pO2/FIo2  ratio of less than 200, and was not fluid overloaded.
All sputum cultures have also been negative to date, as well as legionella, influenzae and other viral cultures.
At this point, the patient is recovering from her ARDS but has not had any further increases in her temperature or demonstration of sepsis.
Infectious disease:  The patient is with pneumonia status post 14-day course of antibiotics as above.
In addition, the urine culture that grew gram positive cocci, was likely treated by the above antibiotics.
Cardiac:  The patient has been noted to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but this is a rare and short-lived event.
She remains total body fluid overloaded but intravascularly depleted up until 2-3 days ago when her blood pressure stabilized.
A lumbar puncture was performed which was negative for any bacteria or white blood cells.
She did have somewhat of an elevated filling opening pressure and closing pressure, but this was felt to be secondary to coughing during the lumbar puncture.
Endocrine:  The patient with relative adrenal insufficiency by corticotropin stimulation test and has been on hydrocortisone since [**2-14**] which has been tapered as tolerated.
OB/GYN:  The patient was noted have vaginal bleed with loss of significant amounts of blood at certain points.
Pelvic exam actually demonstrated that bleeding was not from her vagina but from her urethra.
OB/GYN was consulted and felt this was secondary to urethral prolapse.
Also lower abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a leiomyoma which OB/GYN said is not a huge issue and that they would like her to follow-up with them as an outpatient.
She remains total body fluid overloaded but occasional intravascularly dry.
We spoke to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who stated that the patient's CLL has been in remission, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been in remission.
The family is extremely supportive of their mother and extremely cooperative with the staff.
