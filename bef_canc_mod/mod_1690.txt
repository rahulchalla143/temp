Admission Date:  [**2113-7-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-7-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-8-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year-old male with a history of ethanol use, history of remote intravenous drug abuse approximately six months ago with no known liver problems who presents with hematemesis and fall.
He was in his usual state of health until the day prior to admission when he states that he had decreased ethanol intake due to not buying enough for his trip back from [**Hospital3 **].
He presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department for evaluation of fall with normal head CT when the patient had witnessed hematemesis of approximately 700 cc.
He denies any history of colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
He has no history of blood transfusions and no abdominal pain, but he does have some back pain and shoulder pain since recent motor vehicle accident.
He denies cough or changes in bowel habits.
He denies melena, black tarry stools or bright red blood per rectum.
Head CT was conducted, which was within normal limits with no acute changes or intracranial hemorrhages, however, subsequently  patient had bright red hematemesis of approximately 700 cc and nasogastric tube was attempted, but not tolerated.
Given the patient's gross hematemesis on presentation the patient was transferred to the MICU and admitted for treatment and evaluation.
Ethanol abuse, history of delirium tremens per patient.
Right shoulder injury status post motor vehicle accident in [**Month (only) 116**] with fracture to the humeral head.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He denies any history of seizures, although he has had delirium tremens in the past.
Generally, the patient was a white middle aged male with rhinophyma and smelling of ethanol.
No murmurs appreciated.
Back examination no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities decreased range of motion and some tenderness on the right shoulder and he has positive for palmar erythema.
He had no clubbing in his extremities.
His head CT showed no hemorrhage and small soft tissue attenuation, but most likely status post trauma, but no acute changes.
His CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse low attenuation with fatty uptake.
There was some attenuation densities in the right hepatic area measuring 2.4 by 2.1 cm, tiny stones were also elucidated and the left kidney with soft tissue attenuation on the right paralumbar region and S7, osteal units.
His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute and normal axis and intraventricular rhythm conduction delay and no ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 42 year-old male with a history of alcohol and intravenous drug abuse and no known history of liver disease who presents with coagulopathy and hematemesis with abdominal CT revealing fatty liver and question of hepatomas.
Hematemesis/coagulopathy:  Initial evaluation suggested the cause to be liver failure causing a decrease in vitamin K and coagulation factors.
Therefore he was given platelets and fresh frozen platelets for coagulopathy and vitamin K as well.
He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed varices, however, he started having alcohol withdraw at the time so the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was halted and the patient was intubated and treated for alcohol withdraw.
He was on SBP prophylaxis, which was then discontinued secondary to no evidence of ascites.
He was transferred to the floor from the MICU on [**2113-7-13**] to the [**Hospital1 139**] Service for further management of his hematemesis and gastrointestinal bleed.
He was continued on Octreotide to prevent further bleeding and the patient denied any further reports of gross hematemesis during the hospital course.
and he continued to show no signs of ascites and no evidence indicating SBP, therefore he was not started on Fluoroquinolone.
Acute blood loss:  Decrease in hematocrit and acute blood loss was thought to be secondary to esophageal varices, which on esophagogastroduodenoscopy was grade three.
Coagulopathy:  This was likely secondary to liver failure.
The platelets were at 41 on presentation and with acute gastrointestinal bleed status post 1 unit of platelets and fresh frozen platelets as needed on the MICU.
for withdrawal.
No Diazepam was given, given his liver failure and addiction consult was consulted to help the patient deal with his alcohol abuse.
FEN:  The patient had hypokalemia on admission and given his chronic ethanol abuse the patient's calcium, magnesium and phosphate and other electrolytes were repleted prn.
Liver mass:  An MRA was scheduled to further evaluate the mass that was seen in the CT for a possible hepatocellular carcinoma mass.
The MRI revealed two focal hepatic lesions with imaging characteristics most consistent with hemangiomas concerning the presence of cirrhosis were quite evident in the MRI and dilatations and sequences;  follow imaging in approximately four months is to be considered.
His follow up plan was to have a repeat banding of his esophageal varices on [**8-3**] at 1:00 p.m. at the GI Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
