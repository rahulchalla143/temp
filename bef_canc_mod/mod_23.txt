Went directly to cath lab from ED due to new STE anteriorly, ?
AIVR, hypotension, evidence of cardiogenic shock.
Found to have chronically occluded RCA 90% pLAD lesion and add'l diffuse disease and diseased LCx.
Pt with acute volume o/l couple months ago treated with increased PD per renal attg.
Anemia of CD 4.
GIB, guaiac + stools   Social History: + tobacco hx, no EtOH.
EKG#1: new Qs in v2-v4, 2mm STE v2-v4; ST depressions I, avL .
Lung volumes remain low with persistent atelectasis at the right base, but insufficient abnormality in the lungs to explain respiratory failure.
Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally large and tortuous thoracic aorta are unchanged in appearance.
There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**6-19**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage .
No evidence of intra-abdominal collection or large hematoma.
Small amount of fluid and air and moderate amount of air in the abdomen likely related to the peritoneal dialysis.
Multicystic kidneys.
There is a new area of calcification in the left kidney.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
Selective coronary angiography showed a left dominant system.
LMCA had a 20% origin stenosis.
The LAD had a 90% origin stenosis involving also a D1 (90%).
LCX had mild itraluminal irregularities with 50% OM and 60% distal LCX disease.
Aortic root aortography showed markedly dilated aortic root.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, 6.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca and IABP.
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD lesion with a bare metal stent.
Successful placement of a 40cc intra aortic balloon pump.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis.
The basal inferior and inferolateral walls contract best with the more distal left ventricular segments near akinetic.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
No intraventricular thrombus is identified.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now present.
There are small ovoid-shaped collections of free intra- abdominal air layering above the liver and stomach.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
IMPRESSION: Small collections of free intra-abdominal air above the liver and stomach which is expected given presence of peritoneal dialysis catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 68yo M with ESRD on PD, prostate Ca p/w ACS and severe 2VD presented with CP and taken to cath lab and found to have 2VD with stent to LAD and subsequent mental status changes that have steadily improved.
Patient was s/p ACS with unclear culprit lesion, developed cardiogenic shock and was intubated in CCU for several days.
Per CT [**Doctor First Name **], was determined not to be a CABG candidate due to poor touchdowns and severe R sided lesions.
Due to known residual coronary lesions, Isordil 10mg TID was initially added for better CP control, but was ultimately d/c'ed due to low BPs, with the addition of SL NTG prn for chest pain.
Was initially on Lisinopril 30 mg PO DAILY, which was also ultimately decreased to 10mg PO QD due to low BP.
He had significant volume o/l and LV dysfunction.
Several liters of fluid were removed by PD and was maintained at relatively even volume exchanges for several days prior to discharge.
ESRD on PD x several years -- volume o/l by elev PCWP on admission, s/p fluid removal by PD for several days, now euvolemic on exam with even volume exchanges.
He was reintubated in setting of pain when he was uncontrollable and thrashing in bed.
Hematoma was tamponaded with a pressure dressing and external fixture and was controlled by the following day.
This has now resolved, with persistent ecchymosis, but stable HCT x 5 days.
S/p intubation- done for agitation purposes at first in the cath lab.
He was successfully weaned by HD #3 but reintubated the next day s/p groin bleed and uncontrolled behavior, including trying to get out of bed and resisting pressure on his bleeding groin.
CT head [**6-19**] ruled out bleed/new process but did show old lacunar infarct.
There were initial concerns for peritoneal fluid infection in setting of ongoing PD, and dialysate was pink-tinged.
Pain may have been due to hematoma from subcutaneous heparin, which was d/c'ed prior to d/c, as patient was ambulating well CT Abdomen ruled out bleed, or other pathology that could explain his symptoms.
Peritoneal fluid analysis from [**6-22**] showed gram positive cocci in pairs, not yet speciated.
A plain film of the abdomen on [**6-24**] demonstrates a small amount of intra-abdominal free air, which is likely secondary to a PD cath that was uncapped for too long.
Abdominal pain had significantly improved on day of discharge.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction Congestive heart failure End-stage renal disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, cardiac medication regimen optimized.
Discharge Instructions: You had a blockage in your coronary artery with evidence of damage to your heart; the blockage was stented.
You also had a bleed from the cateterization site, as well as some post-operative confusion that has been improving.
* Call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop cehst pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomting, you are unable to continue with your peritoneal dialysis or you develop any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
