CXR: prelim negative CT ABD: prelim: Relative transition with dilated fecal loaded sigmoid colon proximal to the point of the sigmoid-rectal reanastomosis most compatible with a component of anastomatic narrowing.
No evidence of small bowel obstruction though the ileoileo reanastomosis has a tethered appearance to the anterior abdominal wall.
No evidence of abcess.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.8 cm2).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite vegetations seen Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-9-28**], the findings are similar.
IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen but best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography  [**8-14**] KUB: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of free air.
Echogenic cirrhotic liver without discrete lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: - Abdominal Pain: Mr. [**Known lastname 32126**] was initially admitted to the medical service for work-up of abdominal pain and fevers.
He had an admission CT that revealed fecal loading with an associated dilated proximal colon.
There was no evidence of obstruction, ascites, or colitis per report.
Pt underwent colonoscopy with dilation of anastamotic stricture on [**2110-8-11**] which he tolerated well, however, afterwards became apneic requiring transfer to ICU.
A metal stent was placed on [**8-13**] which he tolerated and f/u KUB showed decreased bowel distension.
He went to the OR on [**8-19**] for end colostomy and mucous fistula.
He ambulated to chair and his pain was controlled on oral pain medication.
He complained of abdominal pain around his ostomy site but that was controlled on narcotics and he ambulated within his room.
- GPC bacteremia: Admission blood cultures grew GPC in pairs and chains.
Speciation revealed Strep viridans so abx coverage was narrowed to ceftriaxone.
Flagyl was also on for GI coverage.
TTE was neg for vegetations and f/u cultures were neg.
Because of the concern for over sedation, it was decided to treat the patient empirically for endocarditis with 4 weeks of ceftriaxone.
- Apnea: After the colonoscopy with dilation of anastatamotic stricture, pt became apneic on the floor and a code was called.
Pt required high doses of sedatives/narcotics to be comfortable.
Given high doses of fentanyl/versed in the setting of liver disease, patient was monitored after the procedure for an hour.
When he was brought up to the medicine floor he became unresponsive and apneic.
After receving narcan, patient became responsive and respiratory rate normalized.
- Pancytopenia: Patient had a pancytopenia on admission, which is his baseline.
There were no signs of overt GI bleeding and no hemodynamic instability that would suggest a hematologic catastrophe.
Most likely, pancytopenia is secondary to history of chronic alcohol abuse.
- Cirrhosis: There was no evidence of an acute decompensation, although varices and splenomegaly were noted on CT abdomen.
6. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
16. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted initially to the medicine service with several days of fever and abdominal pain and found to have bacteria in your blood.
You underwent a colonoscopy which showed a stricture at the anastomosis.
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you experience any fevers, chills, high output blood in your ostomy bag, difficulty tolerating solids or liquids, increasing pain, or redness around the wound site.
