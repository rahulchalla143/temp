There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells, as well as abnormal density in the left middle ear, which may represent fluid or soft tissue.
There are no other fractures identified.
There is increased density in the left external auditory canal, likely representing cerumen.
There is extensive mucosal sinus disease involving the bilateral maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid air cells, and frontal sinuses.
This causes obstruction of bilateral ostiomeatal complexes.
There is no osseous destruction or erosion.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is no evidence for intra- or pleural inflammation or hematoma.
There are dense calcifications of the cavernous carotid arteries noted.
Subtle nondisplaced fracture of the left occipital bone extending into the left temporal bone, associated partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells and minimum intensity, possibly soft tissue versus fluid, in the left middle ear.
There are no other fractures identified.
Diffuse mucosal sinus disease, hypoplasia of the right maxillary sinus.
CT C-spine [**6-13**]: FINDINGS: There is no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.
There is mild straightening of the normal cervical lordosis, likely related to positioning.
No acute fracture is identified.
There are multilevel degenerative changes, which are most severe at the levels of C5-6 and C6-7.
The epidural canal appears grossly unremarkable, without evidence of epidural hematoma.
Visualized lung apices reveal scarring.
There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the vertebral arteries, and right carotid artery.
A left occipital bone non-displaced fracture extends into the left temporal bone with opacification of the left mastoid air cells and left middle ear are better assessed on concurrent head CT. Mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary sinuses are only partially imaged.
No evidence of cervical spine fracture.
His respiratory status was labile and there concern that due to poor neurologic status and poor respiratory function he would need to be re-intubated.
