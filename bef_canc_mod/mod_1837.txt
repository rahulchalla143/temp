Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 year old woman with PMHx of Hep C & ETOH Cirrhosis, Gastritis/Duodenitis, HTN & CKD who presents with fall 2 days ago after tripping on a rug at home.
She was able to ambulate after the fall but as the hip pain persisted she came to the ED for evaluation.
Right hip films were negative for fracture.
Laboratory results were most notable for signficant anion-gap acidosis, and pancytopenia (worsened from baseline low Hct and Plt).
She denied cough, pain other than hip pain.
She had no abd pain.
no neck stiffness.
She denies anti-freeze ingestion.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ALSO POSITIVE FOR GRAM POSITIVE COCCI [**2175-7-3**].
Limited assessment without IV or oral contrast.
There is a suggestion of wall thickening involving the hepatic flexure of the colon ( c/w colitis), as well as in recto-sigmoid.
No free air or pneumatosis.
Diffusely fatty liver.
Pancreatic parenchymal calcifications, likely sequela from chronic pancreatitis.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation in the visualized lungs, with tiny adjacent pleural effusions.
[**2175-7-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**2175-7-3**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature depolarizations and diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-6-21**] the heart rate is increased, now with ventricular ectopic activity .
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with medical history notable for HepC/EtOH cirrhosis, DM2, hypertension and CKD presenting after a fall c/b hip pain found to have significant anion-gap metabolic acidosis.
# Anion-gap metabolic acidosis with notable lactic acidosis: The etiology of her acidosis remained unclear, though was ultimately felt more likely due to an overwhelming septic picture, supported by rapid growth of gram negative and gram positive bacteremia.
Initial delta-delta suggested co-incident non-anion gap acidosis as well, and initial pCO2 of 30 suggested inadequate respiratory compensation.
As above, the source of her profound lactic acidosis remained unclear given lack of clear causitive medication; additionally she initially appeared to have adequate organ perfusion (global and mesentery) given benign abdominal exam, lack of abdominal complaints, and relative normotension.
Metabolic derangements could have been related to severe thiamine deficiency, though uncommon, this was treated.
Toxicology consult was obtained, without clear etiology, though cyanide poisoning was entertained, and the antidone was administered given lack of alternate explanations and the patients rapid clinical decline.
Surgical consult and CT abdomen were obtained to further evaluate for an abdominal source, and preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] revealed no clear abcess or evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Over the course of her first 12 hours in hospital, her acidemia progressed, her arterial PCO2 rose (to 47) and her mental status declined prompting intubation.
She also developed worsening hypotension, prompting placement of a central venous catheter, and iniation of levophed and vasopressin.
OGT revealed coffee grounds, though her HCT (baseline 30) declined slightly (27), her labs ultimately revealed a DIC picture over the course of 12 hours, (INR >21, platlets 11), GIB was felt unlikely to contribute to such a profound acidemia, despite her known liver history.
Given lack of alternate explanations for her acidemia and clinical decline, the renal service was consulted regarding initiation of CVVH for removal of possible toxic ingestions and to optimize management of the acidemia.
Her CK rose to >10,000 (no evidence of rhabdo on UA), her acidemia progressed, with venous PH=6.81/24/80 at 8PM, her potassium rose to 7 despite CVVH.
Her acidemia improved slightly however lactate continued to rise.
Microbiology data revealed rapid growth of gram negative rods (2/2 bottles), and gram positive cocci (1/2 bottles), supporting an overwhelming septic picture of unclear etiology, but possibly enteric translocation from GIB.
# Pancytopenia: most likely [**2-27**] septic picture as above.
#  Fall c/b hip pain: initial hip films were unremarkable for fracture.
# Hep C cirrhosis: LFTs within her baseline range.
her altered mental status was felt more likely related to acidosis as opposed to hepatic encephalopathy .
# CKD - initially near her baseline Cr of 2.6.  she rapidly became anuric, likely [**2-27**] hypotension, and was started on CVVH as above, primarily given concern for toxic ingestion.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2 uncontrolled: no clear evidence of DKA.
