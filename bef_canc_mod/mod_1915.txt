CT Angiography was negative for pulmonary embolus, but showed a multifocal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for increased oxygen requirement.
He was started on 3% saline and NaCl tabs PO for hyponatremia correction.
He also developed ileus from [**Date range (1) 99392**] and now has watery green stool.
ROS: Denies abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Able to walk more then 2 blocks or more then 2 flights without symptoms at baseline.
No hematochezia or melena.
Ulcerative colitis s/p total proctocolectomy with a J-pouch in [**2160-8-24**], status post an ileostomy takedown in [**2160-10-24**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of partial small-bowel obstruction (4/[**2160**]).
Obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP (16 mm Hg) but uses CPAP very rarely.
Lumbar spinal stenosis s/p laminectomy on [**2165-1-11**] 7.
Osteoporosis on Fosomax 70 mg once per week 8.
Pancreatic cancer in grandmother.
No scleral icterus.
Dry mucus membranes.
No lymphadenopathy CV: S1 S2 normal.
No wheezing appreciated.
ABD: Mildly distended.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
[**3-28**] plantar flextion and extension bilaterally.
Exam revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles on right.
CXR revealed diffuse blateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of pneumonitis vs. pulmonary edema, as well as dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of small bowel obstruction vs. ileus.
EKG changes were not specific compared to previous and showed a questionable new Q wave in lead III with a possible T wave in version in one lead.
CT-angiography showed no pulmonary embolism, a multifocal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural effusions and nonspecific thickening of the esophageal wall.
Patient was started on levoquin and flagyl for probably aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis and was transferred to the surgical ICU for pulmonary support.
Hyponatremia- Laboratory findings at that times showed a hyponatremia with a plasma sodium of 114 with a potassium of 4.
Studies were suggestive of SIADH vs. hypotonic fluid overload (or both).
Repeat electrolyte studies showed a hyponatremia to 127 that improved with fluid restriction (to 130).
Iron studies were not possible as patient received a recent transfusion.
Ileus- patient complained from ileus from [**Date range (1) 21656**], with dilated small loops of bowel on KUB.
The illeus resolved spontanously and was followed by mild diahrrea characterized by increased frequency and loose character of stool.
Stool remained guiac negative.
CAD- given shortness of breath, and possible EKG change, patient's cardiac enzymes were negative for acute coronary syndrome.
In light of possible edema, transthoracic echo was obtained to evaluate cardiac function and showed no left ventricular aneurysm with a normal overall left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 60%).
No masses or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.
Trace aortic regurgitation was seen and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.
There was borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension without pericardial effusion.
Ulcerative colitis- patinent had no complaints and required not intervention.
Anemia- patient's anemia was followed.
He was asymptomatic and required no further transfusion after the initial 2 units of PRBCs.
He was discharged to rehab once his hct and hyponatremia was stable.
