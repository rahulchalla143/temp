Patient had a recent h/o left PICA infarct in [**2193-4-8**] after which he was started on anticoagulation.
He then presented in [**2193-5-9**] with SOB and was found to have PE based on a high probability VQ scan w/ DVT within superficial femoral vein extending to common femoral origin.
Patient then developed vomiting with nausea and continued intermittent diarrhea with cramping abdominal pain.

There was no change in his frequency of diarrhea.
He denied any chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, palpitations.
He did have generalized weakness which he has had for several months now.
He has a chronic history of diarrhea (likely some kind of protein losing enteropathy) with persistent hypoalbuminemia.
Also he has small bowel enteroscopy which showed ersions in stomach/duodenum with ulcerations in jejunum and a mass in the distal bulb.
Biopsy of the mass showed extensive gastric foveolar mucous cell metaplasia in duodenum but no evidence of lymphoma anywhere in the GI tract.
In the ED, the patient was found to have a pulmonary embolism in the superior branch of the right main pulmonary artery.
He also had trop elevation without significant EKG changes.

Air can be seen within the stomach and colon, and scattered loops of small bowel, without any evidence of dilatation.
The study is limited secondary to large body habitus; however, no definite free intraperitoneal air is identified.
IMPRESSION: Air is seen within the stomach and colon, without definite evidence for small bowel obstruction.
[**7-1**] Abd/Pelvis CT: TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Moderate-size bilateral pleural effusion, increased on the right, new on the left, is accompanied by a small pericardial effusion.
A filling defect in the anterior branch of the right main pulmonary artery is a new, likely acute pulmonary embolus.

Mild thickening of the sigmoid colon is stable.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Acute right upper lobe pulmonary embolus.
No bowel obstruction.
Increasing small to moderate pleural and small pericardial effusions probably due to cirrhosis and large volume of ascites.
Stable sigmoid colon wall edema or inflammation.
[**7-1**] CXR: Moderate sized pleural effusion with elevated hemidiaphragm and associated atelectasis.
[**7-2**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and left popliteal vein was performed.
There is occlusive thrombus, which is hypoechoic and expanding the right common femoral and superficial femoral vein throughout its course.
On the left side, there is echogenic nonocclusive thrombus at the origin of the greater saphenous vein at this at the saphenofemoral junction.
Occlusive thrombus, which appears acute, within the right common femoral and superficial femoral veins.
Nonocclusive thrombus at the origin of the left greater saphenous vein, at the saphenofemoral junction.
New right upper and right middle lobe consolidations, most probably aspiration and/or pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary edema, new.
[**7-19**] CT Chest 1) Necrotizing pneumonia in right upper lobe posteriorly with foci of gas and probable evolving abscess formation.
2) Moderate right pleural effusion, decreased in size from prior CT. 3) Marked ascites.
4) Resolution of left pleural effusion.
5) Persistent pericardial effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
[**7-23**] IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-17**] through 13: Lung volumes remain low marked due to the markedly elevated diaphragm.
Longstanding consolidation or atelectasis at the right lung apex and atelectasis at the right lung base are unchanged.
Mild pulmonary edema has recurred.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o Male with PMHx sig for Chronic diarrhea w/ hypoalbuminemia, recent h/o CVA, Hep B, Lymphoma, IDDM, HTN, recent hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] for pulmonary embolism w/ DVT who presented with 2 days of nausea and vomiting, found to have Pulmonary Embolism in Right main PA and troponin elevation likely in setting of PE.
Pulmonary Embolism: Mr. [**Known lastname 15558**] was at high risk for pulmonary embolism given his history of malignancy, prolonged immobilization, and recent PE w/ DVT.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound showed DVT in right lower extremity.
IVC filter was placed as pt had PE on anticoagulation.
E coli bacteremia: The patient developed an elevated white count and fevers and blood cultures from [**7-3**] grew Escherichia coli.
Possible sources include either spontaneous bacterial peritonitis vs a pulmonary source given an infiltrate seen in the RUL/RML (see below).
Aspiration pneumonia was also considered.
IV flagyl was also added for concern for aspiration as above.
Patient also has ascites, thought possibly to have predisposed to SBP and subsequent E. Coli sepsis.
Surveilance cutures since initial bacteremia have been negative for bacteria.
A TTE was performed to r/o endocarditis and showed no vegtations.
Ophthalmology was consulted and found no evidence of fungal infection in the eyes.
Nosocomial PNA: A CXR revealed a necrotizing pneumonia with air fluid level in RUL confirmed by chest CT on [**7-19**].
He did complain for some chest pain and SOB through the Russian interpreter and he was tachypeneic with ABG 7.51/23/71.
He recieved 1 liter NS and appeared more comfortable, was mentating and BPs came up to 80's/50s and then denied CP or SOB.
He was afebrile and satting 95-98% on 4.5 L NC.
The etiology for the patient's hypotension was likely multifactorial including intrasvascular volume depletion given persistent hypoalbunemia and potential sepsis.
The patient was noted to have a persistenly elevated white count despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
The patient's Hct decreased from 29.6 to 24 in the setting of volume resuscitation without evidence of acute bleeding.
The patient was transfused 2U PRBCs to help oncotic pressure given decreased albumin.
# CVS: ** CAD: The patient has high risk for CAD, now with elevated Troponins and Ck-MB fraction.
No EKG changes.
The elevated troponin was likely in the setting of acute PE, due to demand.
** Pump: ECHO from [**2-11**] shows EF of 55%, mild sym LVH, no WMA.
# GI Bleed: The patient's MICU course was complicated by a GI bleed in the setting of Heparin gtt.
The GI bleed resolved, although patient continues to be guaiac positive.
likely chronic from stomach/duodenal erosion w/ jejunal ulceration, especially in the setting of anticoagulation.
Grossly positive stools early in his hospitalization, but now guaiac positive brown stools.
GI was consulted, but given the risks of EGD/colonoscopy in the setting of ulcerations and anticoagulation the decision was made to hold off on this for now.
There was a thought to give him IVIg for the ulcerative jejunoileitis but was not given due to lack of enough evidence that it would benefit.
Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease worsened by GIB.
Stool negative for C.Diff toxin.
Recent h/o line sepsis: Staph epi from [**6-15**] in [**12-10**] sets at [**Hospital1 **].
E. Coli bacteremia as above, but no further cultures growing staph.
ARF: Patient with Creatinine elevated to 1.1 over baseline.
He was evaluated by speech and swallow who felt that the patient was able to take soft solids with thickened liquids.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abdominal cramps.

You have a fungus in your blood and a pneumonia which needs to be treated with antibiotics.
