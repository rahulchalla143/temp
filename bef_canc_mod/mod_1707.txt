Her recent past medical history inculdes an admission [**11-3**] for a history of worsening DOE with AS with valve area of 0.56cm2.
Low-grade T2N0M0 well or moderately differentiatedadenocarcinoma.
Her hospital course ([**2195-12-7**]- [**2195-12-16**]) was complicated by hypercarbia requiring intubation and fluid overload requiring diuresis.
Subsequent to this she developed C. difficile colitis, for which she has been on PO vancomycin since; she continued to complain of abdominal pain, with fevers post op and had a CT in [**2195-12-28**], that revealed slight increased fat stranding in the region of the sigmoid colon at sites of diverticula, representing a mild case of uncomplicated diverticulitis.
The patient was admitted on [**1-26**] to Neurology service after tonic clonic seizure activity which resolved spontaneously.
No further seizures in the ED.
LP was not pursued given elevated INR on coumadin.
She had no further seizure activity.

The ventricles and sulci are again prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy.
Note is made of extensive [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] calcifications in the bilateral cavernous carotid, vertebral, and leptomeningeal arteries.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
Severe atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal right vertebral artery and moderate-to-severe narrowing of both cavernous internal carotid arteries.
Small focus of calcification in the Basilar A. close to ithe tip.
Given the extent of disease in the dominant right vertebral artery, associated vertebrobasilar insufficiency cannot be excluded.
Moderate microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease  CXR [**1-26**] - IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
Opacity in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis or infection.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Focal area with high signal intensity is demonstrated at the right superior parietal lobule, with no significant mass effect and may represent a chronic hemorrhagic area.
Subcortical areas with high signal intensity are identified on T2 and FLAIR sequences, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Tortuosity of the basilar artery, consistent with dolichoectasia, previously described by CTA on [**2196-1-26**].
No acute intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Small ovoid hypodensity in right parietal lobe corresponds to area demonstrating old blood products seen on [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] of [**2196-1-28**].
New opacification of left anterior ethmoid air cells and increased opacification of left mastoid air cells.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is no mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-6**], the [**Date Range **] across the aortic valve has increased and the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
The estimated PA systolic pressure and severity of mitral regurgitation are similar.
Severe tortuosity of the vertebrobasilar system without evidence of pontine infarction.
No evidence of large hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
Unchanged small area of subacute blood products in the right parietal lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 1st NEURO ICU COURSE: 86 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, R retinal vein occlusion and recently dx.
colon cancer, s/p colectomy c/b C.Diff coilitis who now presented from NH with two episodes of GTC seizures.
At [**Hospital1 18**] upon evaluation in the ED, she was found to be "obtunded" s/p Keppra load and given multiple hospitalizations, WBC and seizure, she was felt to be at risk for meningitis, thus was treated with Vancomycin IV, Bactrim IV and Acyclovir IV for possible meningitis.
There was also concern for top of the basilar syndrome, thus she underwent a CTA of the neck, showing severe atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal right vertebral artery and moderate-to-severe narrowing of both cavernous internal carotid arteries along w/ a small calcification in the basilar artery.
On HD#1 patient was noted to be arousable to voice, oriented to hospital and following simple appendicular and axial commands.
The detailed neuro exam after she came back to Neuro floor showed subtle weakness on the left side and absent reflexes.
The Non contrast [**Date Range 4338**] showed a lesion in right parietal area, possibly infarct with hemorrhagic conversion, although mass or AVM could not be ruled out due to lack of contrast administration.
Initially there was concern for endocarditis, TTE was performed and showed no vegetations.
Patient was noted to have episodes of hypotension in setting of her home BB dose, this was decreased to 1/2 dose and her lasix was held x 1 day in this setting.
TTE revealed EF of > 60%, LVH, mild LVOT and  aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed as well as "significant aortic stenosis."
We held lasix after transfer to floor as there was concerns about lowering her blood pressure in setting of possible ischemic stroke.
Mild oxygen requirement in setting of b/l pleural effusions and mild volume overload, likely due to diastolic dysfunction.
In setting of hypotension, the lasix was temporarily held but shortly resumed after concern for her tenuous fluid balance.
Per discussion w/ NH, it appears that the loose stools have been declining and the plan was to d/c Flagyl/Vanco on day of transfer.
She has not had any more loose stools while in the SICU and last C.diff was [**1-13**] at NH and was neg.
1st CCU COURSE: Pt was found to be in Afib with RVR on admission secondary to missing several doses of metoprolol on the floor.
She was also found to be in acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to combination of afib with RVR and missing lasix doses.
CXR also showed RLL lung collapse.
She was initially kept NP[**MD Number(3) **] her depressed mental status and her Afib with RVR was rate controlled with IV metoprolol.
On ICU day 3 she spiked to 102 and was pancultured with urine analysis showing pyuria and positive leuk esterase.
She was noted to have some new anisocoria on exam on hospital day three felt likely [**12-29**] nebulizer treatment, given that her was still overall improved but should be followed with serial exam.
Oral vancomycin suppression for c.diff infection has been discontinued following a negative c.diff and the fact that she has not had any further diarrhea.
Her EEG remained active with generalized sharp waves at a rate of approximately 2 Hz, and on [**2-7**] was found to be back in subclinical status.
She also had worsening renal function.
Her EEG has slowly become less active, currently consistent with encephalopathy and occasional GPEDs with less sharp activity.
ID; The patient completed a seven-day course of vancomycin and cefepime [**2-9**] for a presumed pneumonia.
She spiked a low grade fever [**2-7**] and urinalysis revealed a likely UTI, but culture grew yeast.
CV; The patient continued to have a tenuous fluid balance.
Renal; The patient has had worsening renal failure with minimal urine output.
This was presumed to be due to cardiorenal syndrome.
She is being followed by nephrology and is considered to be a poor dialysis candidate.
The patient's husband and son still wish for all aggressive measures at this time.
She was also grossly fluid overloaded and in renal failure.
Per neurology recommendations, the patient underwent [**Date Range 4338**] of his head, which did not reveal any acute changes from prior MRIs.
The patient was continued on EEG monitoring, which did not reveal any active seizure activity.
The prospect of dialysis was brought up; however, it was felt that the patient was not a candidate for dialysis at that time.
