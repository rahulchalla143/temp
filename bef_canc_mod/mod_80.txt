The small right pleural effusion has further decreased in size.
IMPRESSION: Decreasing small right pleural effusion.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND  INDICATION: Abnormal LFTs.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder is not distended and there are no gallstones present.
There is evidence of bilateral pleural effusions; the right is greater than the left side.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-22**] through 17:  Bilateral pleural effusion, moderate on the right and small on the left has decreased since [**9-23**].
Right basal consolidation has also cleared aside from residual bronchial wall thickening and minimal peribronchial infiltration appreciated best on the lateral view.

While this may relate to focal atelectasis it should be followed to resolution.
Reformatted images confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and likely a component of CHF/volume overload.
3) More focal ill-defined nodular opacity in the right middle lobe; while this may relate to focal atelectasis, it needs to be followed to resolution.
