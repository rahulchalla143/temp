She was given albuterol an she became hypoxic to the low 80s and she became tachycardic.
Upon arrival to the ED, she was noted to be in mild to moderate respiratory distress.
A CXR was performed which showed no pneumonia.
She had coarse breath sounds throughout and expiratory wheezes.
She was not given any nodal agents in the ED due to concern for early sepsis.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports shortness of breath.
She is unable to provide much history due to dementia.
She denies chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhe, constipation, or any other concerning symptoms.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized from [**8-15**] to [**8-18**] for pneumonia and COPD flare which was treated with azithromycin and nebs, and IV steroids.

No occupational or recreational exposures.
No pets in recent years.
No asbestos exposure.
Family History: No known lung disease, though reports mother died at 53 of "blood clot" unclear if PE.
Physical Exam: VS: HR 180, BP 110/63, RR 17, 96% on 2LNC Gen: coughing, purse lipped breathing HEENT: EOMI, o/p clear CV: tachycardic, no m/r/g Pulm: coarse breath sounds diffusely, no wheezes or rhonchi Abd: obese, soft, NT, ND, bowel sounds present Ext: trace pitting edema, cool extremities Neuro: AxOx3, but confused about details   Pertinent Results: Labs: .
Imaging: CXR - low lung volumes on the right, no pneumonia.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-3-18**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo female with COPD, HTN, HL, DM, who was discharged two weeks ago for COPD flare and discharged on a prednisone taper who was admitted for shortness of breath likely due to COPD flare and aspiration.
Shortness of breath.
Patient presents with COPD flare in setting of steroid taper.
Additionally, aspiration likely contributed to her shortness of breath.
She was sent home on an short steroid taper as this was not felt to be a severe flare and her oxygen requirements and tachypnea did not appear to be sigificantly worse than hre baseline.
Lastly, she was very tachycardic to 180s on arrival and her shortness of breath improved with improved rate control.
Renal failure.
Patient presented with pre-renal acute renal failure that resolved with intravenous fluids.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: COPD flare Aspiration Tachycardia .
Secondary: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Fair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath due to COPD, aspiration, and extreme tachycardia.
You were continued on your home medications with the exception of lisinopril which was held due to low blood pressures.
Please come to the hospital or call your primary care physician for chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other cocnerning symptoms.
