Admission Date:  [**2120-12-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-12-18**]   Service:  MICU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of bronchogenic adenocarcinoma, status post left lower lobe resection in [**2120-7-7**] complicated by pneumonia and failure to wean from the ventilator.
She is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center at  The patient's course status post her left lower lobe adenocarcinoma resection was notable for multiple episodes of respiratory failure which required re-intubation.
She also had multiple episodes of pneumonia.
From that point, the patient has had a prolonged course in which she  Her course at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center is notable for decreased hematocrit and guaiac positive stools.
Her Coumadin had been stopped, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unsuccessful and the barium swallow was deferred secondary to high aspiration risk.
The patient was on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation which had developed postoperatively but resolved after initiation of Amiodarone.
She had rapid re- accumulation of this effusion which was by report a transudate.
The patient did have sputum which grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient also had stool that was positive for C. difficile.
The patient also had recurrent urinary tract infection most recently with Klebsiella which was treated with a 5 day course of Zosyn just prior to admission here.
They have noted no recent changes in her mental status.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated by hypotension     during recent hospitalization to [**Hospital1 69328**].
Left lower lobe adenocarcinoma of the lung, status post     resection surgically by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] at [**Hospital1 29402**] in [**2120-7-7**].
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in sputum.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
Right sided pleural effusions.
Chest:  Coarse breath sounds anteriorly without rales or signs of consolidation.
Coarse 2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border towards the apex.
Well healed midline surgical scar.
She has diffuse rigidity with sustained ankle clonus bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  Shows slight cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
Question of a left lingular bronchus partially obstructing lesion.
Ground glass opacity changes mostly in the upper lobes, predominantly the right upper lobe.
There is interval increase in the right sided pleural effusion with interval decrease in her left sided pleural effusion.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2120-12-16**], which revealed a somewhat concerning appearance to a heaped up type lesion at the left lower lobe stump.
It is possible that some component of pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure may be impeding her ability to wean.
Bronchoscopy otherwise revealed areas of thick mucous plugs which were clear in appearance and not purulent.
Also, the Pulmonary Interventional Service will evaluate the patient on [**2120-12-17**] to change her trach collar to a different size so that there is no leak as a leak had been noted around the trach collar, however, the CT scan suggested her cuff is overinflated.
Cardiovascular:  There were no acute cardiovascular issues during this admission.
As noted we did try some mild extra diuresis and changed her Lasix to twice a day dose while here.
There was no recurrence of atrial fibrillation during this admission.
The patient had a transthoracic echo, which otherwise unchanged from previous echocardiograms at this institution as well as [**Hospital1 **], revealed question of a left atrial mass.
It was not entirely clear from the views on the TTE as to the nature of this mass, however, upon review with cardiology attending, the mass did not appear to be displaying paradoxical motion within the atrium.
She had no further hemodynamic instability following the procedure.
It is felt that the mass that was seen on the TTE is likely within the wall of the atrium rather than an attached thrombus or myxoma.
We suspect the 4+ gram positive rods are likely colonizer, especially upon review of prior sputum samples this has turned out to be corynebacterium.
The CT scan did raise some question of whether there is an atypical pneumonia with deep ground glass opacity findings in her right upper lobe.
Given the spike temperature and her multiple courses of antibiotics, we elected to start Ceftazidime.
This was started empirically to cover gram negative rods in her sputum as well as apparently gram negative rods in her urine which were growing.
There were no active issues otherwise.
The patient tolerated tube feeds well and no further changes were necessary.
The patient was had a peripheral intravenous during this admission, no central access was necessary.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Question lesion at left lower lobe stump site.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Left lower lobe adenocarcinoma, status post resection     [**2120-7-7**].
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in     sputum.
Recurrent urinary tract infection.
