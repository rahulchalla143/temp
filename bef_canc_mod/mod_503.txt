Admission Date:  [**2117-10-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**] MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history significant for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, with a history of bilateral pneumonia with chest tube placement, status post VATS without a diagnosis, and status post decortication and empyema, history of congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2117-8-4**] with an ejection fraction of approximately 40%, with positive wall motion abnormality, also a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and C. difficile, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department on [**10-16**] with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath, along with hypoxia and lower extremity swelling.
[**2117-8-2**]:  Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori positive, on Coumadin.
[**2117-8-8**]:  Bilateral pneumonia with empyema, status post VATS and decortication, complicated by pneumothorax secondary to thoracentesis, status post bilateral chest tubes.
[**2117-9-1**]:  Acute renal failure.
The patient reported that she had been short of breath since [**10-15**], with increase in lower extremity swelling and orthopnea.
She denied fevers, chills, chest pain or bright red blood per rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, C. difficile, history of gastrointestinal bleed, H. pylori positive, history of bilateral pneumonia with bilateral chest tube, VATS and decortication, history of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 40%, with wall motion abnormalities and 2+ mitral regurgitation, subtotal thyroidectomy, history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bilateral adrenal masses, cerebrovascular accident 11 years ago, emphysema, cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, and pneumothorax x 2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   While in the Emergency Department, the patient underwent thoracentesis for her pleural effusions.
The patient was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her volume overload/congestive heart failure.
Respiratory:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was stable and was not seeming to contribute to her hypoxia.
Pleural effusion:  The patient has a large left pleural effusion.
Laboratories on this effusion returned consistent with a transudative effusion.
Upon presentation to the general medical floor, the patient continued to have a pleural effusion on the left, approximately halfway up into the lung fields.
Left apical pneumothorax:  The patient also had an apical pneumothorax, very small.
To be noted also that, throughout the admission, there was no evidence for pneumonia, and no antibiotics were administered.
Pleural effusions, being transudative, were most likely secondary to congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
In order to evaluate cardiac ischemia, the cause of the patient's acute congestive heart failure decompensation, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction in the Medical Intensive Care Unit by cardiac enzymes.
Renal:  The patient had an apparent acute on chronic renal failure on presentation to the Emergency Department.
The patient was continued on her ACE inhibitor because it was felt that the patient's cause of acute on chronic renal failure was most likely secondary to poor cardiac output.
As the patient was diuresed and congestive heart failure was brought under control, the patient's creatinine did slowly return to levels consistent more with her baseline.
This revealed a known left atrophic kidney and bilateral suprarenal masses.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Adrenal masses:  No workup for these was undertaken while in the hospital.
Hematology:  The patient had a low hematocrit on admission.
These were most consistent with either hypothyroidism or anemia of chronic disease.
There was no indication for transfusion, and no indication for iron administration.
Other routine measures:  Daily weights should be followed in this patient in order to assess for possible fluid gains.
Please note that the patient's Glucotrol, which she had been taking as an outpatient, was discontinued during the hospitalization because of the patient's episode of hypoglycemia and the fact that Glucotrol is renally cleared and the patient was exhibiting acute on chronic renal failure.
The patient should undertake a workup of her adrenal masses as directed by her primary care physician.
