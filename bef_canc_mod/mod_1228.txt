History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 63469**] is a 75 yo WF with HTN, Type II DM, paroxysmal afib, who presents with elevated blood pressure.
She was recently discharged from a hospital stay for headaches and hypertensive urgency with BP in the 260's systolic.
Physical Exam: Gen: awake, alert, sitting in bed, NAD Neck: no JVD CV: reg rate, SEM LUSB Chest: CTA Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: distal pulses intact  Pertinent Results: [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD TSH-1.5 [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD Cortsol-21.0* [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD Metanephrines (Plasma)-PND .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is minimal resting LVOT gradient which increased with the Valsalva manuever.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CAROTID SERIES [**2166-7-4**] IMPRESSION:  On the right, there is no evidence of cervical internal carotid artery stenosis.
However, based on the waveforms and velocities, there is likely to be a proximal arch stenosis that is severe.
On the left, there is a 40-59% carotid stenosis.
MRI/MRA BRAIN [**2166-7-6**]: Chronic white matter ischemic disease.
No acute infarcts.
MRA RENAL ARTERIES [**2166-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1)  High-grade right-sided renal artery stenosis just beyond the ostium, and mild narrowing of the left renal artery at the ostium.
2)  Mild bilateral renal cortical thinning.
3)  Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta, including borderline aneurysmal change of the infrarenal aorta.
No evidence of acute infarction.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] marked decrease in signal intensity within the right internal carotid artery suggestive of proximal extracranial stenosis.
Flow-limiting stenosis in the proximal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with apparent distal filling from leptomeningeal collateral vessels.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2166-7-3**]:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There is a 3.6 x 2.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
There is severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta with several focal ulcerations seen.
At the level of the celiac axis on Series 4, Image 53 a linear irregularity within the aorta likely is secondary to focal ulceration, but a small dissection at this level cannot be excluded.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
The common bile duct is mildly dilated measuring 12 mm.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 63469**] is a 75 yo WF with HTN, Type II DM, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with hypertensive urgency.
Hypertensive urgency:  On admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 63469**] was found to have systolic blood pressure elevations in the 200's with, of note, large bp differential in her right and left arms.
This large differential is attributable to stenosis of her right brachiocephalic artery.
In the 24 hours following her admission to the CCU team, she continued to have labile BP readings ranging from systolic pressures in the 90's-170's, but was also noted to have good response to antihypertensive medications.
As an inpatient, she underwent a work-up for secondary causes of hypertension which included the following studies: TSH, 24 hour urine metanephrins, random cortisol, MRA of her renal arteries.
On MRA of her renal arteries, she was found to have high-grade right-sided renal artery stenosis just beyond the ostium, and mild narrowing of the left renal artery at the ostium.
Cardiovascular: (a) Coronary arteries: no active signs of ischemia.
(c) Valves: no evidence of valvular disease on recent TTE.
She was also found to have new brachiocephalic stenosis during the course of her hospitalization just a few days earlier.
Chronic renal insufficiency: Likely secondary to her Type II DM vs. low perfusion state of the kidneys secondary to RAS.
Her anemia is likely chronic with a known baseline hct of 33.7.
Hypertensive urgency.
Type II DM 3.
