He was treated for COPD exacerbation with frequent nebs, IV steroids and continuation of home advair.
It was an atrial tachycardia that was thought to be related to respiratory distress and medications (albuterol and theophyline).
He defervesced after admition and it was suspected that his fever was from his environment.
However given poor lung status, decision was made to treat with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a 7 day course.
# COPD - pt was on 4L home O2 at baseline.
Pt has poor lung function at baseline, but he was showing O2 sats in the 89-93 range.
# atrial tachycardia - pt came to the floor with a resting tachycardia of 110's.
This is likely related to his hypoxia secondary to his lung disease.
Pt was monitored, but he was never symptomatic from these acute rises in HR.
As it trended down to normal range pt was monitored, but ther were no signs of acute bleeding.
