Anaphylaxis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 65 yo woman with a questionable history of systemic mastocytosis and CAD s/p CABG who presented from the radiology suite where a code blue was called in the setting of iodine administration.
The patient had been in the radiology suite receiving IV contrast for a CT pancreas when she developed acute chest pain, shortness of breath and diffuse itching.
Patient's respriatory status waxed and waned over the course of the code, but no crowding of the oropharynx was observed and patient was intermittently stridirous, but also noted to be holding her breath for short periods of time followed by a series of rapid deep breaths with good airation.

Lungs are essentially clear except for minimal atelectasis at the left lower lung, unchanged since [**2157-8-3**].
No definitive evidence of aspiration demonstrated.
Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are seen.
[**8-19**] CT Scan: FINDINGS:  A 2-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule (2:3) is stable since [**2154-10-27**] and is benign.
Minimal scarring is seen in the lingula.
Mild coronary arterial calcification is present.
No focal liver lesions are seen.
Mild prominence of the intrahepatic biliary tree and CBD, relates to the post-cholecystectomy status.
Mild asymmetric urothelial enhancement is seen in the right renal pelvis/ureter, more pronounced in the proximal right ureter where a focal area of more marked mural enhancement is seen(3A:83).
There is no frank hydronephrosis though prominence of the renal pelvis is noted.
A 6-mm hypodense lesion in the proximal pancreatic body (3A:67) and a 6-mm lesion in the distal pancreas (3A:66), correspond to two of the cystic lesions seen in the prior MRI.
Additional smaller lesion seen on MRI are not visualized in the current study.
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement within or adjacent to these lesions, which are compatible with dilated side branches as in side branch IPMN.
Again seen are multiple non-enhancing hypodense lesions in the spleen, consistent with simple cysts.
The stomach and imaged portion of the small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
The abdominal aorta has moderate atherosclerotic calcification without aneurysmal dilation.
No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
No free fluid is seen.
Two 6-mm cystic lesions in the body of the pancreas, correspond to the lesions seen on previous MRI study.
No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified.
Asymmetric urothelial enhancement in the right kidney, more pronounced in the proximal right ureter, may relate to mild inflammatory change or pyelitis.
However, urothelial tumor can not be entirely excluded.
Recommended urinalysis including urine cytology for further assessment.
Severe allergic reaction to iodinated contrast media requiring code blue and admission to ICU for further evaluation and management.
panic attacks.
Anaphylaxis:  Patient was treated in a code blue setting for acute airway compromise after receiving ionodated CT contrast.
Was never hypoxic or hypotensive.
Patient had no further acute events, although requested IV benadryl, which was provided as a slow infusion prn.
Foul smelling urine with evidence of kidney inflammation on imaging: Patient wanted to leave the hospital today because she will be going to outpatient urology tomorrow.

Lorazepam 1 mg PO DAILY PRN nausea 15.
Discharge Condition: Stable Mental status wnl Fully ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a possible allergic raection to iodine during your CT scan.
