As stated in the previous dictations Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old woman with a congenital hemangioma who underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #19 [**Last Name (un) 8522**] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve on [**3-16**] who has had a protective recovery period.
She remained in the hospital after [**4-11**], because of recurrent pleural effusions and respiratory distress.
Chest x-ray done on [**4-11**] showed a persistent, but apparently stable left pleural effusion with no indication for drainage at that time.
She had no acute events over the next several days, however, remained in the hospital with close monitoring for her pulmonary status, which waxed and waned.
She tolerated that operation well, however, had to remain in the PACU overnight due to a requirement for neo-synephrine to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
This was followed by a video swallow, which she also demonstrated high propensity toward aspiration.
On [**4-15**] the patient's chest x-ray showed a new white out of her left side with a small posterior upper fluid collection.
On the 9th she was sent to interventional radiology for ultrasound guided pleurocentesis and catheter placement of the left superior loculated effusion.
There were no complications and the patient was transferred back to the floor for continuing care.
On the [**4-17**] the patient had pleurodesis through the pigtail and on [**4-19**] the chest x-ray looked considerably better with reexpansion of the lung and good drainage of the effusion.
A repeat video swallow done on [**4-19**] continued to show high risk for aspiration.
Over the next two days the patient was noted to have an increase in her creatinine.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfuse with bilateral pulses.
Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with a #19 [**Last Name (un) 8522**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congenital hemangioma.
