No apparent leaks and no wound erythema.
1+ - 2+ peripheral edema.
Free intraperitoneal air seen under the right hemidiaphragm, in the right paracolic gutter, as well as in the pelvis.
Multiple sigmoid diverticuli are seen, with mild diverticulitis.
[**2146-5-4**] Sigmoid pathology -   Segment of colon with diverticulitis and evidence of perforation with acute serositis.
The morphology is atypical counterclockwise however, the cycle length is long.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
There is mild volume overload.
Unchanged chronic right middle lobe consolidation and post-surgical changes in the left lower lobe.
Improved left lower lobe aeration with persistent moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
[**2146-5-7**] CXR Still present right middle lobe atelectasis has decreased in the short-term interval.
There is no significant change in left lower lobe areas of plate-like atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
No specific evidence of an organized abscess is seen.
Small pleural fluid is seen bilaterally.
Prominence of the endometrial stripe as noted above for which an ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation given the patient's age.
[**2146-5-12**] EKG Atrial fibrillation.
Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2146-5-11**] there is no significant change.
[**2146-5-13**] KUB IMPRESSION: Distended and dilated loops of bowel most consistent with ileus.
[**2146-5-16**] CXR IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis, without evidence of acute volume overload.
She was reintubated emergently in the PACU for acute respiratory distress.
CXR showed a right middle lobe collapse.
She had a bronchoscopy done with removal of her mucous plug and respiratory status was stabilized.
Troponins were negative and EKG done at time of acute respiratory distress showed no ST changes.
Cx from mucous plug was negative for pathologic organisms.
She was put on amiodarone drip for persistent atrial fibrillation and was on low dose neo temporarily to maintain MAP >60.
She had a slight bump in her creatinine to 1.7 and so her lasix was held.
On POD 3 she had afib/aflutter and was given lopressor x 3 as well as restarted on the amio gtt.
Her ostomy opened up with some stool on POD 6 and the lower portion of her wound was opened for drainage and mild cellulitis.
On POD 7 she was transferred to the floor but had afib with rapid ventricular response and was transferred back to the ICU.
Her EKG and enzymes were negative for ischemia.
She also became supertherapeutic on her coumadin and her coumadin was held.
On POD 8 her wound was opened entirely and cultures were sent.
Her blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits, she was tolerating a regular diet, out of bed walking with physical therapy and afebrile at discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Perforated Diverticulitis Right middle lobe collapse secondary to mucous plugs Atrial Fibrillation Wound Infection   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Call or come back if you have any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, increasing redness around your wound, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerns.
