He was seen by VNA with worsening cellulitis and referred to ED.
In ED, 97.9  136  128/72  18  96 had b/l LENIs which were negative for DVT, also received vanco, then unasyn.
In the ICU, he states, he's gained 70lbs over the past year, denies orthopnea, PND, no cough, fever/chills, cp/sob, does have lower extremity swelling over the past 3 years, and started on lasix, .
History of chronic LLE cellulitis last admitted on [**7-10**] for LLE cellulitis treated with vancomycin then bactrim.
Family History: -Cancer: Mother died at 48 from brain tumor and sister died at 42 from breast cancer.
-CAD -no history of Diabetes, HTN   Physical Exam: Admission: 99.2  135 116/41  23 96% 4L GEN: Obese, NAD, pleasant, comfortable HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP Clear, dry MM, JVD elevated to earlobe, No LAD no thyromegaly CV: RR tachy, no mrg Chest: poor insp effort, no w/r/r ABD: Obese, soft +BS, nt/nd Ext; No c/c 3+ pitting edema b/l to knees, warmth, erythematous, macular area on the ant/post calf to ankles, with c/w cellulitis.
Pertinent Results: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right and left common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins were performed and demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentability and respiratory variation and flow.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
There are no drainable fluid collections along the courses of the veins bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No DVT involving the right or left lower extremity.
Consider atrial flutter with predominant 2:1 block with some R-R variability.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: eval r heart border for mass  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with CP p/w b/l cellulitis and tachycardia and hypotension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval r heart border for mass HISTORY: Tachycardia and hypotension with suspicious poor definition of the right heart border.
There is no change in the appearance on the frontal view.
The heart size is unchanged but there is additional new lobulation at the right heart border partially obscuring it.
The bilateral perihilar haziness has increased in the meantime interval.
The overall lung volumes are slightly lower.
The above described findings may represent mild volume overload/pulmonary edema.
The right paracardiac new lobulation may be related to low lung volumes _____ namely representing atelectasis, although other differential diagnoses such as loculated effusion or new mass should be included.
Repeated PA and lateral radiographs after improvement of patient's volume status are highly recommended.
Deformation of the right clavicle most likely related to old fracture is again noted.
ECHO: Conclusions Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSIOn: Pulmonary hypertension with preserved biventricular systolic function.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension/tachycardia/Volume Overload - Initially, in the ED he had stable vital signs but then developed hypotension with SBP in 90's and HR 135 unresponsive to fluids.
An EKG showed aflutter with 2:1 block suggesting that his BP may be due to low CO due to arrythmia.
After adenosine with sinus pause and re-occurance of aflutter, he was diagnosed with aflutter.
He was given IV lopressor and started on Metoprolol PO with a decrease in HR and increase in BP.
He was subsequently transferred to the floor and had symptoms of shortness of breath associated with the tachycardia.
Given his h/o pulmonary emboli in the past, he was started on Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.
This showed evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Remained afebrile, without a white count and without progression of his cellulitis.
OUTSTANDING ISSUES: -Patient had elevated TSH and decreased Free T4.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need a repeat Chest CT to evaluate for mass (question of this was raised on portal film).

You were found to have a fast heart rhythm called Atrial Flutter.
Due to your high risk for a blood clot, you are also being given medications to thin your blood (coumadin/warfarin).
Physical therapy has evaluated you and as you know, because of your chronic conditions - you have a risk to fall.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, a fast heart rate, or increased swelling or pain in your legs.
Also thyroid tests should be checked in the next 4-6 weeks with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] as they were mildly abnormal available.
The results to be sent to Dr  [**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] M. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2393**] for further changes in dosing.
