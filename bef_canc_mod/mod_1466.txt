EXTREMITIES: Minimal lower extremity edema.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
2/6 systolic murmur at the LLSB.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at the bases, no crackles/rhales/wheezes.

There is interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema.
[**9-21**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with biventricular pacing.
Atrial tachycardia is not clearly seen on the current tracing, although there is some baseline artifact which makes interpretation difficult.

He is referred to the cath lab for placement of a pulmonary artery catheter to tailor inotrope therapy.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Congestive heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy.
PROCEDURE: Right heart catheterization via the right internal jugular vein with a 8F sheath.
Resting hemodynamics while on a milrinone drip showed elevated right-sided pressures.
The RA pressure was elevated at 13 mmHg and the RV pressure was eleated at 41/14.
The PA pressure was elevated at 43/22 with a mean PA pressure of 29.
The wedge pressure was elevated at 22 mmHg.
Measurements of oxygen saturations revealed a low SVC and PA oxygen saturation of 61 and 68% respectively.
There is improved ventilation of the lung parenchyma in both the retrocardiac lung areas and the right lung bases.
Unchanged evidence of mild pulmonary edema.
Left pectoral pacemaker, no pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
[**2196-9-25**] EKG: Atrial tachycardia and biventricular pacing, similar to that recorded  on [**2196-9-24**], without diagnostic interim change.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE RODS.
Blood Culture [**2196-9-23**]: No growth x 6 days  Urine culture [**2196-9-23**]: No growth  Catheter Tip culture [**2196-9-23**]: No growth  Labs on Discharge: [**2196-9-28**] 07:30AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-5.80 Hgb-16.6 Hct-53.6* MCV-92 MCH-28.7 MCHC-31.1 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-256 [**2196-9-28**] 07:30AM BLOOD Glucose-75 UreaN-52* Creat-1.6* Na-141 K-4.1 Cl-96 HCO3-35* AnGap-14 [**2196-9-28**] 07:30AM BLOOD Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 63M with systolic and diastolic CHF with dilated CMP and recent RHC consistent with cardiogenic shock who presents from home for inotrope initiation and diuresis.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF with dilated CMP (EF <20%)/PUMP:  No clear precipitant for his worsening heart failure, he did not report symptoms of ischemia, infection and denies dietary indiscretion or medication non-compliance.
Appeared volume overloaded on exam with crackles and ascites.
The patient was started on a lasix drip and milrinone infusion for inotropic support.
Once patient appeared euvolemic torsemide was decreased to daily and dose titrated to maintain euvolemia.
The patient's metoprolol was initially held secondary to acute decompensated HF and was restarted when patient compensated.
# Fever: The patient spiked a fever to 101 on [**9-23**].
Catheter tip was with no growh.
Urine culture was with no growth.
One bottle of blood culture revealed gram positive rods, later determined to resemble CORYNEFORM BACILLI.
Antibiotics were stopped at 48 hours when only culture data of gram positive rods (most likely contaminent).
The patient remained afebrile and without signs/symptoms of infection after d/c antibiotics.
# CKD: Cr at admission of 2.0 and appears to be close to recent baseline of 1.6-2.0.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Continue atorvastatin  # Hypothyroidism: contnue levothyroxine 125mcg daily  # GERD: Continue omeprazole and ranitidine PRN  # IBS: Still reporting intermittent diarrhea.
