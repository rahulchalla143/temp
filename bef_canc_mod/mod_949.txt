RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-5-10**] 2:48 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval for interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old woman with COPD, OSA, admitted with hypercarbic resp failure, COPD exacerbation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for interval change HISTORY: COPD, admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Bilateral pleural effusions persist, substantially more prominent on the right.
Retrocardiac opacification is again seen, consistent with atelectasis.
The possibility of supervening basilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1569**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11006**] Approved: TUE [**2168-5-10**] 8:48 AM  Brief Hospital Course: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to a combination of obesity hyperventilation syndrome, oversedation from seroquel/tylenol PM, and a possible COPD flare with possible retrocardiac infiltrates on imaging reflecting a PNA.
Despite these measures the patient continued to be hypercarbic and on HD #2 required intubation.
Upon discharge, her home dose of NPH was still unclear, though her daughter thought it was 40 U qAM and roughly 28 U qPM.
# Hypertension: The patient's metoprolol was discontinued out of concern for bronchospasm.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: hypercapneic respiratory failure .
Secondary: - Hypertension - Type 2 Diabetes - Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy several years ago and s/p XRT [**11-12**] (unclear where radiation was targeted to) - followed at [**Hospital1 2025**] - Glaucoma - Cataracts, baseline anisocoria (R pupil) - Anxiety   Discharge Condition: good, satting well.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure.
This was likely a result of your underlying lung disease and possibly exacerbated by sedating medications that you were taking.
You are also on antibiotics for a possible pneumonia and a tapering dose of steroids (see medication list and prescriptions).
You should call your primary care provider or return to the emergency department if you have worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, fever greater than 101.4 degrees F, confusion, excessive sleepiness, difficulty being awoken, blood sugar above 300, or any other symptoms that concern you.
Please call if you need to reschedule any of the above appointments.
