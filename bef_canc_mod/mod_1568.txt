LUE U/S: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT, in the limited study.
[**6-18**] New edema.
Left upper lung opacity is difficult to assess due to low lung volumes and may represent asymmetric edema, though a focus of infection cannot be excluded.
CT head [**2116-6-21**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66 year old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension.
Altered mental status: The patient initally had a dramatic response to Narcan, likely due to accumulation due to renal dysfunction and standing morphine.
His narcotics were initially held, however given his pain and decision to be CMO, he was placed on a morphine drip (see below).
His hypoglycemia was initially treated with D10 which was also discontinued.
The most likely scenario is that the patient has reduced insulin clearance without [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] and for this reason became hypoglycemic without continued glucose infusion.
Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO twice a day  Discharge Medications: NA  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: -Renal failure  Discharge Condition: NA  Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for hypoglycemia, altered mental status, and renal failure.
He was also found to have low blood sugar due to continued action of insulin.
