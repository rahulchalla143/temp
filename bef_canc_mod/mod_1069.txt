Admission Date:  [**2122-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-26**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Headache, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of IVC filter.
History of Present Illness: This is an 83 yo RH woman with history of DVTs on coumadin, breast cancer, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who was transferred from OSH with an intracerebral hemorrhage.
The history is per patient and her daughters.
The patient had sudden onset of a horrible headache 48 hrs ago prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], frontal and bitemporal, constant, aching, not associated with any fever, neck pain, weakness or numbness.
The following day the patient was very nauseated, with multiple bouts of bilious emesis.
BP at OSH was 176/64, and a head CT showed a 5x4cm hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe with two hypodensities in the left frontal lobe.
Patient denies any fever, chills, preceeding weakness, numbness, visual changes, prior history of stroke or seizures, recent illnesses.
No h/o fall or trauma.
HTN 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Breast cancer [**2114**] s/p lumpectomy, XRT and tamoxifen.
No chemotherapy.
No recurrence known.
Left hip replacement.
Recent history of elevated WBCs.
Language is fluent with good comprehension, repitition, naming of body parts, no dysarthria.
No apraxia (brushes hair), no neglect (names all in the room).
Able to calculate, no left/right mismatch.
Fundoscopic exam: discs flat, fundi clear, no hemorrhages or exudates.
+ nystagmus that fatigues (s/p dilantin load), no ptosis.
VII: symmetric face VIII: hearing NOT intact to finger rubs IX, X: Symmetric elevation of palate [**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM and trapezius [**4-9**] bilaterally XII: tongue midline without atrophy or fasciulations.
Motor: Some wasting of small hand muscles, mild increased tone in legs.
No fasciculations or drift.
No adventitious movements.
No Jaw jerk.
No axillary LAD CV: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS, no HSM EXTREM: edema 1+ bilaterlly, pitting, warm and well perfused.
NEURO: Mental status: Patient is drowsy, needs continues prompting, perseverating, answers most questions "yes, yes" Oriented to person, place (after orientation), time (only after re-orientation) [**Last Name (un) 64011**] attention: needs continues prompting; Language is fluent with good comprehension, repitition, naming of body parts (but calls L-arm the R-arm), no dysarthria.
Some neglect (not able to point/count all people in the room; might be related to poor attention.
V: facial sensation intact over V1/2/3 to light touch and cold VII: symmetric face VIII: hearing intact to finger rubs IX, X: Symmetric elevation of palate [**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM and trapezius [**4-9**] bilaterally XII: tongue midline without atrophy or fasciulations.
Sensory: Exam unreliable as she answers almost every question with yes: touch, vibration, pinprick normal.
Motor: Some wasting of small hand muscles, mild increased tone in legs.
No fasciculations or drift.
Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, which may represent mild pulmonary edema, atypical pneumonia, or less likely, bilateral lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage arising from right temporoparietal, occipital regions.
No definite evidence of intracranial metastasis on this non-contrast examination.
[**7-17**] NCHCT at 9pm: There has been no significant change in the extent of the large right temporoparietal and occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is again noted, as are small foci of blood along the falx.
No hydrocephalus or significant shift of midline structures is seen.
[**7-23**] NCHCT: There has been no appreciable change in size or surrounding edema of the large right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with extension into the right lateral ventricle.
Again seen are several tiny foci of hemorrhage adjacent to the falx, unchanged from prior studies.
There is subarachnoid blood and isolated sulcus at the extreme left vertex, new from the prior study.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
The area of hemorrhage is identified in the right posterior temporoparietal region as seen on the CT of [**2122-7-17**].
EEG: [**7-18**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of slow and disorganized background rhythm with generalized bursts of delta frequency slowing.
These findings suggest a mild encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 83 yo woman with history of breast cancer, HTN, and high cholesterol, and DVTs on Coumadin who presents with headache x 48 hours and emesis.
The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU with an intracranial hemorrhage.
Neurological: Intracranial hemorrhage: The neurological exam at admission was significant for a left homonomous hemianopsia and mild left leg weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern.
No papilledema was seen on fundi exam.
CT showed an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe with some surrounding edema.
There is a question of two other hyperdensities in bilateral frontal lobes as well.
Repeat head CT 6 hrs later is stable, without signs of enlargement, hydrocephalus, or shift.
There was a question of whether the intracranial bleed was into a mass lesion.
Given the breakthrough of the hemorrhage into the ventricular system, the patient was monitored closely for signs of hydrocephalus.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended no operative management.
They recommended beginning a mannitol drip, for a few days only, and to start the patient on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Patient was sub therapeutic in dilantin level and did not have any seizures during this time.
She also developed a rash to dilantin.
An EEG showed no epileptiform discharges but was remarkable for mild encephalopathy.
Cardiovascular: While in the ICU, patient's elevated blood pressure was managed with labetalol gtt (goal <140).
In the setting of history of hypercoagulability, and a new RLE DVT, an IVC filter was placed by vascular surgery, as Coumadin is contraindicated at this point.
Given a positive family history for DVT and PE, a hypercoagulable workup should be considered.
b) The patient was noted to have an increased WBC.
She was seen by Hematology/Oncology for rule out CLL.
Peripheral blood flow cytometry study revealed involvement by a CD5 positive, CD23 positive, CD20 (dim) B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immuonphenotypically consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
There was no recommendation for treatment at the present time, however, WBC count will be followed as an outpatient.
Pulmonary: Chest XR on admission demonstrated hilar fullness which was concerning for mass.
A CT-chest showed no evidence for pulmonary or hilar masses.
ID: The patient was febrile during the acute phase, and was found to have an elevated white count and a urinalysis suggesting a UTI.
Also, due to the possibility of line infection, her left subclavian central line which was placed at the time of admission, was removed and the tip was sent for culture.
Renal: The patient was noted to have a renal cyst on Chest-CT.
FEN: Patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow after the acute phase, and her diet was advanced accordingly.
Intracranial hemorrhage, right temporoparietal lobe 2. urinary tract infection 3. chronic lymphocytic leukemia 4. renal cyst 5. hypertension 6. deep venous thrombosis lower extremity   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Follow up MRI HEAD with gad in [**4-11**] weeks.
