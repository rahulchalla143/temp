Admission Date:  [**2169-7-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-8-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-12-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Vascular  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ischemic left leg  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old female with a complicated vascular history who now presents with increasing left lower extremity pain.
She does admit to rest pain over the last week which has increased in the last several days.
She denies any constitutional symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses - Coronary artery disease with a history of ventricular tachycardia, status post automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator in [**2163**], history of myocardial infarction times two in [**2151**] and [**2152**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular accident with residual right arm weakness, history of ischemic bowel syndrome, history of renal artery stenosis with chronic renal insufficiency, history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], history of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity in [**2155**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement, type not documented, history of cholecystectomy, history of right inguinal herniorrhaphy, history of appendectomy, status post cesarean section, status post nephrectomy on the right.
Vascular surgeries included aorto-bifemoral bypass graft with thrombectomy, anastomotic aneurysm repair in [**2168-6-14**], status post left femoral-popliteal, status post left superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial bypass with nonreverse saphenous vein graft, status post aorta to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6 mm Dacron.
Chest x-ray was acute cardiopulmonary disease.
The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with a normal axis with premature ventricular contractions and a right bundle branch block with probable inferior infarct of undetermined age.
There were lateral ST changes which offer additional evidence of ischemia.
There is no change in this electrocardiogram from the previous electrocardiogram of [**2169-6-8**].
She underwent an urgent arteriogram on [**2169-7-27**] which demonstrated a 95% right renal artery stenosis.
The below-knee popliteal reconstituted the graft distally, showed a patent anastomosis.
The posterior tibial artery was with severe narrowing with distal graft changes and marked stenosis.
Because of the urgency of the vascular procedure, the patient proceeded to surgery after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.5.
There were no bowel sounds.
Her pulse examination showed bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right and absent pedal pulse examination on the left.
Her chest x-ray was negative for pneumothorax.
The left leg showed some oozing at the lesser saphenous vein site.
The dorsalis pedis was dopplerable with a biphasic signal and the posterior tibial was monophasic.
She was given Dilaudid for analgesic control.
Her left leg showed a proximal incision staining with sanguinous fluid.
Wounds were without erythema and she had a triphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the left.
The patient required an additional 2 units of packed red blood cells for a drop in her hematocrit with additional Lasix.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient on [**2169-8-3**] after an episode of nausea and vomiting.
The patient denied any shortness of breath or chest discomfort.
Her electrocardiogram showed ST depressions in V leads 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Cardiology's final recommendation if the serial enzymes were within normal limits and there were no further events, the patient was resistant to any further diagnostic cardiac procedures.
There was concern that there may be progression in the mid left anterior lesion which was first noted in [**2169-2-14**] in catheterization.
Also there may be ischemia secondary to right coronary artery distribution, collateral ischemia.
They recommended P-[**Male First Name (un) **] evaluation and if anterior ischemia continued would strongly recommend a cardiac catheterization, but if just inferior changes were noted she could be managed medically.
The patient refused any further cardiac evaluation including a P-[**Male First Name (un) **].
The patient had no further electrocardiogram changes but continued to refuse any further cardiac workup.
There was a small hematoma in the groin area which was stable.
There was no erythema and the pulse examination was unchanged.
The patient should also be followed by Cardiology service or her own primary care physician one week after discharge for further cardiac evaluation and monitoring.
Renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery angioplasty with stent placement 3.
Coronary artery disease with episodes of angina, rule out myocardial infarction, negative                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2604**], M.D.
