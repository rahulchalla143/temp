Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Attempt stent placement to Left femoral artery  History of Present Illness: 57 M h/o CAD s/p CABG, PVD (s/p several bypasses),ho SVT and Sz disorder who presents with CP.
Pain recurred twice on wednesay; again at rest with similar Sx.
No SOB or diaphoresis.
Discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 16552**] who saw Pt as outpt where Pt made him aware of left foot pain times one month.
No change in BM or urinary patterns.
Concern for PE prompted CTA.
Ischemic neuropathy.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of thyroid carcinoma.
History of CVA in [**2116**] with left-sided weakness, which has resolved with occlusion of the right distal carotid.
Coronary artery bypasses in [**2111**] with saphenous vein.
Left femoral-peroneal bypass in [**2115**].
Redo right femoral-dorsalis pedis with vein graft to the peroneal artery bypass using left basilic and cephalic arm vein in 03/00.
Family History: No known history of diabetes.
Gen-comfortable, NAD heent- PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, OP wnl, mmm neck- supple, no lad, no JVD.
left CB cvs- rrr, s1/s2, no m/r/g chest- CTAB with rare bibasilar rale abd- soft, nt/nd, nabs rectal- guaiac negative per ed ext- LDP dopplerable; RDP 2+; decreased sensation/strength lft foot with distal erythema.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel disease.
The LAD had 70-80% stenosis after the D1.
The LCX had mild disease with moderate OM  disease.
The RCA was not enganged due to known total occlusion.
The vein graft to the RCA was not engaged due to known total occlusion.
Peripheral angiography through the sheath in the LCFA demonstrated diffuse disease in the LCIA and [**Female First Name (un) 7195**] with an 80% lesion in the [**Female First Name (un) 7195**].
Successful stenting of the [**Female First Name (un) 7195**] with a 9.0 x 38 mm Dynalink  self-expanding stent, post-dilated with a 8.0 mm balloon.
Severe peripheral arterial disease of the left lower extremity with total occlusion of the LSFA.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 year old gentleman with a history of CABG, PVD (s/p several bypass operations), h/o prior SVT and seizure originally admitted to our service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for chest pain and L foot pain.
As he had a degree of hypoxia on admission, he was ruled out for PE by chest CT with contrast.
On HD 2 he received cardiac catheterization with stent placed to mid-LAD ( to an non-flow limiting lesion) and also underwent stenting of L iliac and was noted to have restenosis of stent in L superficial artery.
In CCU pt course notable for one episode of hypotension accompanied by nausea--believed to be vagal in nature secondary to sheath.
CXR with question of R middle lobe infiltrate.
He continued to complain of L foot pain but by discharge this pain had lessened considerably.
The pt did continue to intermittently spike fevers, no source could be identified and it was believed that his ischemic L foot was the most likely cause of these fevers.
In summary, this is a 57 year-old gentleman with history of CABG, PVD s/p several bypass operations, smoking who presented with chest pain and L foot pain.
Underwent cardiac catheterization with stent to non-flow limiting lesion in mid LAD and stenting of L iliac.
Pt eventually had subjective improvement in chest pain by discharge.
Attempt to re-open L SFA in-stent stenosis by restenting and tPA were not successful; however patient did eventually experience some subjective relief of L ischemic foot.
57 yo M with extensive CAD history and chest pain syndrome concerning for UA, in addition to unstable PVD over last month.
S/p Cypher to LAD, and stent to EILA, 100% SFA in-stent restenosis s/p intervention [**9-18**].
ISCHEMIA: no evidence of ongoing ischemia -- Cont ASA, plavix, folate, B12, B6 for hyperhomocysteinemia -- Cont statin .
PVD: L foot pain improved from prior presentation, now stable.
Fever/tachycardia - Continues to have spiking low grade temp, no leukocytosis.
[**Month (only) 116**] be from L foot ischemic disease -- no antibiotics at this time .
Neurologic/history of seizure disorder: --Cont dilantin, neurontin, morphine IR and IV for peripheral neuropathy .
Combivent 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Left foot ischemic pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease.
Free of chest pain.
Left foot pain much improved, now able to ambulate independently.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath.
Please return to hospital if you start experiencing severe left foot pain.
