Admission Date:  [**2175-9-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2175-9-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU/MEDICAL ICU/C-MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for respiratory failure.
Two weeks prior to admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.
On [**2175-9-17**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which was new.
Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.
Transient ischemic attack.
Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary artery bypass graft.
His father also had coronary artery disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.
Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary examination - The patient had diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds on the right.
Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.
A Transesophageal echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and apical hypokinesis.
The patient was also noted to develop new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but remained hypotensive requiring pressors.
A CT angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.
On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.
The patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101 while urine culture grew E. coli.
Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture sites with some thick secretions.
The patient was then transferred to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery disease.
Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.
The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the 30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228, transferrin of 175.
These findings were consistent with anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung cancer.
On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have bilateral carotid bruits.
Carotid Doppler studies were performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis and mild plaquing bilaterally.
From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5 mg p.o.
on the day prior to his discharge in order to treat his urinary tract infection.
Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex.
Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right pneumonectomy.
Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm.
Diabetes mellitus.
