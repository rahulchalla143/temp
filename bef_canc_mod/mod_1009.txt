He underwent a CT head that was negative for a stroke and hemorrhage.
Shortly after his CT scan Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a witnessed seizure which stopped with ativan administration on the floor.
During his stay in the ICU patient had episodes of tachycardia and aggitation which were managed with lopressor and haldol.
Psychiatry recommended the use of haldol rather than ativan as benzodiazepines had a paradoxical effect on his aggitation.
No further seizures were witnessed or recorded.
The differential diagnosis of Mr. [**Known lastname **] seizures was steroid psychosis versus tacrolimus toxicity.
24-EEG revealed some bicentral seizure activity.
A sitter was arranged to monitor patient during the 24-hr EEG to determine if he became more confused or aggitated with his seizure activity.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.
On [**2166-1-1**], blood cultures taken [**2165-12-29**] returned positive for methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and patient's antibiotic coverage was changed from vancomycin to dicloxacillin for 10 days.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no further seizure events and was discharged home [**2166-1-4**] in good condition on levetriacetam for continued seizure prophylaxis and dicloxacillin to finish antibiotic treatment of the positive blood cultures.
