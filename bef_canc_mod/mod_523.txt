This is a 59 year-old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**5-/2137**] status post exploratory laparotomy, status post chemotherapy with Irinotecan and Gemcitabine followed by resection two months later of the left lobe of the liver in [**12/2137**] who is being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] without recurrence until recently.
She was found to have tumor in the dome of her liver and underwent radiofrequency ablation in [**2139-11-12**].
Afterward the lesion was transformed into a 5 by 5 .2 cm low attenuation area with some "air droplets."
She did well afterwards except for some nausea and vomiting and was not keeping up with her po intake.
Yesterday she came to the Emergency Room, the day prior to admission at an outside hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] with poor po intake and was found to have a blood pressure in the 90s and was given intravenous fluids.
She then had some coffee ground emesis in the Emergency Room and was found to have a hematocrit of 34 and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
There she went into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 170s and blood pressure of 80/60, which converted after more intravenous fluids were given.
This was followed by CT of the abdomen, which showed a 10 cm hepatic fluid air collection consistent with abscess.
She was also being treated for hypokalemia and was found to have platelets of 60.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management of hypertension and abscess.
Here the patient spent three days in the MICU where she received the esophagogastroduodenoscopy for workup of the coffee ground emesis that revealed severe gastritis, esophageal varices and no sign of recent or active bleeding.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy and BTO, depression on Paxil, gastric duodenal ulcer in [**1-27**] with massive gastrointestinal bleed and perforation.
Subsequent oversewing in gastric duodenal artery ligation, hepatic and subphrenic abscesses at this time.
Fungal infection of abdomen after liver resection.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, mild epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness, but no rebound or guarding.
No stigmata of chronic liver disease.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema bilaterally.
On [**2139-12-10**] the patient was taken to CT scan and per Interventional Radiology the patient's drains were placed with larger tubes and at that time there was instrumentation across the diaphragm and a chest tube was placed though the pneumothorax was very small.
Serial chest x-rays showed no further pneumothorax.
The patient remained afebrile on the floor with the cultures pending.
Infectious Disease was consulted for recommendations on length of antibiotic course as well as the possibility of changing to po medications for discharge.
The patient is now tolerating a full po diet and ambulating in the hallways and denies pain except for at drainage sites.
