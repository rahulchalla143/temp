Admission Date:  [**2108-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-6-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-11-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: ARF, Hyperkalemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
Spanish-speaking female c/ PMHx CHF (EF 20-25%), CAD, CRI who presented to the ED after routine labs revealed ARF w/ creat.
was restarted on Lisinopril, a medication which has been held in the past because of hypotension and acute renal failure.
Labs drawn after initiating a second trial of Lisinopril revealed the aforementioned renal compromise with associated hyperkalemia.
Persistently elevated creatinine and potassium were noted.
Patient was then triaged to the ICU for closer overnight monitoring while treating for ARF and hyperkalemia.
Patient's hypotension improved to systolic 90's in the MICU, which is thought to be her baseline.
She was tranferred to the service for continued treatment of renal failure and associated electrolyte changes in the setting of prior history of CHF.
On admission to the floor, patient denies poor PO intake or increased ostomy output, denies nausea/vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, SOB, CP, lightheadedness.
She does note decreased urine output over the last two weeks.
ROS negative for h/o stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING  [**2108-6-19**]: CXR No acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECG [**2108-1-9**]: Sinus rhythm Ventricular premature complex Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2108-1-2**], ventricular ectopy present and ST-T wave changes appear slightly less prominent   Stress: TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55  INTERPRETATION: 74 yo woman (severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~ 20%) was referred for a CAD evaluation.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure.
In the presence of baseline ST-T wave abnls, no additional ECG changes were noted during the procedure.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2107-7-1**] demonstrated: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo fem c/ PMH of HTN, CRI presenting with hyperkalemia and hypotension likely secondary to exacerbation of renal failure due to Lisinopril.
There is no clear h/o decreased PO intake or decreased volume, and Feena <1.
There is likewise no hx suggestive for post-renal obstruction.
Intrinsic causes include her recently started ACE-I or simple hypotension.
-Support BP with gentle NS boluses if SBP < 85 and symptomatic -QD potassium and creatinine -QD lytes in setting of metabolic acidosis -strict I/O's -Renal u/s --> renal consult -Avoid nephrotoxins (ie, contrast/NSAIDS)  .
-strict I/O's -If exacerbation of CHF, gentle diuresis with non-K sparing diuretic only.
Currently stable without evidence of evolving HTN s/p Ace-I d/c.
-small (250-500) NS bolus for low BP .
Likely represents metabolic acidosis secondary to ARF as above.
Other possibilities include diarrhea from Kayexalate, or dilutional effect from boluses of NS.
No IVF at present.

The patient's active issues quickly resolved as below and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for a final 36 hours of monitoring before discharge.
The patient's moderate metabolic metabolic acidosis was thought secondary to this failure.
It was noted that the patient had recently re-stated Lisinopril, which had previously been noted to induce hypotension and renal failure in this patient.
EKG showed no peaked T waves.
Potassium quickly improved to WNL without any arrhythmias as monitored on telemetry.
It was noted that the patient had recently re-stated Lisinopril, which had previously been noted to induce hypotension and renal failure in this patient.
There was no evidence of infection as a driver for septic hypotension.
No evidence of heart failure on exam.
Given concern for demand ischemia from hypotension, the patient's enzymes were cycled and she ruled out for MI.
