Admission Date:  [**2154-9-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-9-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2099-4-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 55 year old male with a history of end state renal disease who was admitted from [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2154-8-31**], with acute shortness of breath, chest pain and hypoxia.
The patient then went into cardiac and respiratory arrest with ventricular tachycardia.
Chest x-ray showed florid pulmonary edema.
His two past episodes of congestive heart failure have been secondary to dietary noncompliance and difficulty adhering to his fluid restriction.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had troponin peaking at 0.16, which was attributed to recent cardiac defibrillation.
The patient spiked a fever to 101.0 F., on [**9-2**], with a urinalysis with six to ten white blood cells and moderate bacteria.
A chest x-ray was questionable for aspiration pneumonia.
During his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was transiently on Dopamine which was attributed to sedation and hypotension with propofol.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
The patient has a left sided arteriovenous graft.
Diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy and retinopathy.
Congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization in [**2153**] negative for coronary artery disease.
Echocardiogram in [**2154-6-16**] showing an ejection fraction of 55%, mild atrial fibrillation.
Peripheral vascular disease status post right first toe amputation.
History of recurrent pneumonia.
[**Name (NI) **] tobacco, no alcohol.
In general, the patient was in no acute distress and appeared sleepy.
There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Extremities:  No edema.
Chest x-ray on [**9-2**] showing bilateral patchy opacities, diffuse peri-hilar haziness suggestive of congestive heart failure; question of superimposed pneumonia.
EKG on [**9-2**] showing sinus tachycardia with a normal axis, normal intervals, peaked T waves V1 to V3, T wave inversions in I, AVL, biphasic T waves in II, [**Street Address(2) 2915**] depressions in V4, V5, V6.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this is a 55 year old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes mellitus with congestive heart failure who was admitted secondary to dietary and fluid indiscretion with the most recent of several congestive heart failure type exacerbations in between dialysis sessions and also with hyperkalemia, again likely secondary to indiscretion leading to severe shortness of breath, cardiac arrest, intubation.
The patient had a troponin leak associated with his cardiac arrest and defibrillation.
On the day of discharge, he was no longer hypoxic.
He had decreased crackles on lung examination.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient intermittently was spiking fevers during his hospital stay.
He was initially started on Zosyn to cover for a possible aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection; however, towards the end of his hospitalization he was afebrile.
ENDOCRINE, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient was restarted on his NPH 7 units q. a.m. along with Regular insulin sliding scale and fingersticks four times a day.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a decreased hematocrit on hospital day number two.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES:  The patient was put on a cardiac healthy, diabetic diet, with 1.5 liters of fluid restriction.
