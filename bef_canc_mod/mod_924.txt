Admission Date:  [**2148-9-30**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2148-10-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-7-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / ciprofloxacin / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - removal of tunneled line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 58-year-old man with a history of AML s/p allogeneic transplant [**2142**] complicated by graft-versus-host disease, multiple vertebral fractures and ultimately development of paraplegia in the setting of a vertebral fracture during a code situation.
Admitted multiple times, most recently [**8-/2148**] for bacteremia and upper resp infection (cx: staph epi) and completed a course of vancomcyin, aztreonam.
Wife also states he was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission when she went to wake him he was more somnolent than usual and seemed to be having difficulty breathing taking rapid shallow breaths.
She reports that he had a cough starting over the weekend productive of yellow sputum.
No history of fevers, and outside of baseline pain, he had no complaints.
Given his somnolence, EMS was called and administereed narcan in the field without improvement so he was admitted to Study hospital on [**9-30**] for acute respiratory failure.
He was bolused more NS (unclear how much) and remained hypotensive so was started on norepinephrine 2mcg/min and given stress dose hydrocortisone.
He does have a triple lumen port, but given poor peripheral access, an intraosseous was placed.
Labs were notable for leukocytosis to 14.2, Trop-T: 0.18, Lactate:3.4, creatinine of 1.1 (baseline 0.6-0.8), and a grossly positive urinalysis with > 182 whites and moderate bacteria.
He was somnolent but arousable and oriented x 3, but slow to answer questions.
Complained of pain from the chest up, but otherwise no complaints.
His wife notes that he did a few episodes of loose stools.
Denies dark or bloody stools.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MODERATE GROWTH.
[**2148-9-30**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING   Studies: [**2148-10-6**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  [**2148-10-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE): Right pleural effusion has decreased in size with associated improvement in adjacent right basilar atelectasis.
Multifocal areas of heterogeneous consolidation involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right, have slightly improved.
A small hyperlucency is present in the periphery of the left upper lobe at the level of the second and third anterior ribs, but no discrete visceral pleural line is identified.
This may represent an area of spared lung parenchyma from the presumed multifocal pneumonia, but attention to this area on short-term followup radiograph may be helpful to exclude an atypical presentation of pneumothorax, given clinical suspicion for this entity.
[**2148-10-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right have progressed in the interval, particularly in the right lower lung where there is also an increasing pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation and/or atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion also appears increased from prior radiograph.
[**2148-10-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Status post removal of right subclavian vascular catheter.
Widespread heterogeneous combined alveolar and interstitial opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right, have progressed in the interval, and may represent a multifocal pneumonia with or without coexisting pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
No evidence of IVC or iliac vein thrombosis.
Stable lung base findings include, lingular pneumonia and bibasal peribronchovascular nodular opacities suggestive of aspiration.
Bilateral small effusions and right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.
Hepatic steatosis.
Right lower lobe lobar to subsegmental pulmonary acute embolism.
The most proximal portion of the filling defect is peripheral in the artery raising the question if this could be chronic but new since [**2148-6-16**].
There is no dilatation of main pulmonary artery or right heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Worsening of bilateral multifocal pneumonia.
Limited study due to motion artifact, within this limitation, no acute intracranial pathology.
Multifocal paranasal sinus and bilateral mastoid air cell opacification.
[**2148-10-2**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS No deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower extremity.
Bilateral calf edema.
[**2148-10-2**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-5-24**], the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis c/w an acute pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.).
[**2148-10-2**] ECG Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-6-27**].
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes are more prominent in the context of wandering baseline and much baseline artifact.
There appears to be more ST segment depression in leads V3-V6 without diagnostic interim change.
[**2148-10-2**] EEG This is an abnormal EEG due to disorganized and slow background mostly consisting of mixed delta and theta suggestive of moderate encephalopathy but non-specific etiologically.
There was no focal slowing or epileptiform discharges seen.
Recommend repeat study if clinical concern for seizures persists.
[**2148-10-1**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, but there is still very extensive consolidation in the left lung due to pneumonia, without improvement, possibly worsened.
Smaller region of consolidation in the right lower lung medially is either a second focus of pneumonia or atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
No pneumothorax.
[**2148-10-1**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Progressive heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung zone is most likely pneumonia worsening since [**9-30**].
There could be a second focus of right infrahilar pneumonia, also advancing.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially unchanged over several years.
Dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous set ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
Worsening opacification in the left lung base with associated bronchial wall thickening concerning for infection.
No definite pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 57-year-old man with AML s/p matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2142**], complicated by GVHD on chronic prednisone with multiple admission for infections now presents with somnolence in the setting if increased sedative medication use, hypercarbic respiratory distress, cough and CXR with LLL consolidation found to have segmental PE.
# PE: Patient with tachycardia, hypoxemia, hypotensive on admission and history of PE not anticoaguated, with IVC [**Date Range 7448**] in place.
TTE on [**10-2**] revealed large and hypokinetic RV and CTA showed segmental PE.
Unclear if acute vs. subacute given appearance of clot on CTA.
CTV showed no evidence of clot in IVC [**Month (only) 7448**].
Per discussion with inpatient heme attending and outpatient hematologist, it was decided that the pt's risk of hemorrhage was greater than his risk of clot given the negative LENIs and clean IVC [**Last Name (LF) 7448**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] heparin gtt was held.
# Pneumonia: Productive cough followed by somnolence in the setting of starting Ambien and Valium in addition to his home oxycontin.
Also question of possible pulmonary congestion, so pt was started on IV lasix.
On [**10-8**], the pt appeared to have worsening WBC and respiratory distress.
Ophtho consulted and did not see evidence of fungal retinitis.
CXR showed nodular areas, which was conserning for a mold pneumonia.
Pt was started on ambisone for presumed fungal pneumonia.
An MR head was performed which ruled out fungal brain extension.
Possible sepsis as patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia and leukocytosis with possible sources of infection including pulmonary given LLL opacity on CXR and productive cough.
Cardiogenic shock was considered given rising troponins, but they trended down and were likely elevated in the setting of tachycardia.
ECG was without evidence of ischemia.
Hypovolemic shock also possible given that his PO intake had been down prior to admission and his BP was fluid responsive on admission.
He was started emperically on vancomycin and meropenem (day 1 = [**9-30**]) for pneumonia to complete an 8 day total course (through [**10-7**]).
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/somnolence: Patient difficult to arouse at home on AM of admission, and may have worsened since arriving to ICU.
Likely multifactorial with hypercarbia from hypoventilation in the context of new sedating medications (ambien and valium, in addition to home narcotics), untreated OSA with likely CO2 retention at baseline, pneumonia, underlying GVHD of lung and PE.
His pneumonia and PE were treated as per above.
However, pt continued to complain of chest wall pain thought to be secondary to PNA and was continuously requesting more pain medication.
# Tachycardia: Continues to be in sinus tachycardia in the 130s.
Morphine drip was started to relieve any pain without any improvement in tachycardia.
Unclear etiology, but likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock (above) with hypotension and tachycardia.
Creatinine improved back to baseline with treatment of septic shock.
Has grown E. coli most recently, though did have a negative urine culture on [**9-26**].
# Troponinemia: Patient with elevated troponin at OSH, which has risen on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He denies chest pain and ECG with sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes.
Likely troponin leak in the setting of tachycardia to the 160s.
# AML s/p MUD SCT in [**2142**]: Daily CBCs were checked and there was no evidence of reoccurance.
# Chronic GVHD : In the past his chronic GVHC has primarily involved liver and lungs.
His LFT's were mildly elevated at OSH, but has trended down while at [**Hospital1 18**].
He was continued on prednisone 10 mg PO daily, and ppx with with acyclovir, bactrim, and azithromycin.
- IVIG monthly (last dose Thursday)  # Type 2 DM on insulin: Most recent A1c is 6.8 from [**2144**].
His NPh was decreased to 10 units (from 15) due to low sugars.
# Hypertension: metoprolol was held given hypotension  # Clot history: Prior PEs for which he was previously anticoagulated.
Now with segmental PE treated with heparin as per above.
# Right axillary mass: Noticed by oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was planning on working up as outpatient with CT scan.
Per Spine, lumbar and thoracic spine x-rays were ordered -- these showed no significant interval change.
# Transitional issues: deceased  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
