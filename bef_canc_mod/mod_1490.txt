Patient is a long term [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident, and was admitted to the MACU for treatment of pneumonia and urosepsis with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, and IVF.
In the MACU patient's labs revealed ARF with creatinine of 2.7, as well as an elevated WBC of 51 with 21% bands.

No tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.
No cervical LAD.
Thick yellowish secretions.
Mucous fistula pink, with no drainage or erythema.
CXR: Low lung volumes, without definite evidence of pneumonia .
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.

Other than rate, no diagnostic abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-10-7**] no significant change.
There are low lung volumes.
There is bibasilar volume loss.
No pneumothorax.
No definite effusion is seen.
There is marked right convex scoliosis of the thoracic spine, limiting the evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 104995**] is a 59 yo M w/multiple sclerosis and neurogenic bladder, with hx MRSA/VRE UTIs who presents with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate and a positive UA c/w sepsis.
# Urosepsis: Patient had fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate c/w sepsis, with potential sources on admission being urine, sacral decubitus ulcer, and lung, with his trach and copious secretions.
GNR rapidly grew from sputum and blood cultures, speciated as proteus and pseudomonas sensitive to cepholasporins.
# Respiratory status.
Patient with trach tube in place since [**2119-10-18**] for failure to wean off vent.
Patient with increased secretions from baseline, requiring frequent suctioning q1 hours.
We used aspiration precautions, continued with nebs, and used scopolamine patch for thick secretions.
Due to increased secretions, tachypnea, and tachycardia plus additional culture data of gram positives in sputum culture, vancomycin was added on [**2-16**] to complete a 7 day course for presumed MRSA tracheobronchitis.
# Acute renal failure.
Likely in the setting of hypovolemia from sepsis.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Patient has large Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.
We used oxycodone prn for pain per home regimen.
Likely from GI losses given persistent watery stools, fistula with possible contribution of early renal failure (although this has since resolved).
Patient with large amounts of liquid stool out from ostomy.
# Schizoaffective d/o, agitation, hx depression/anxiety:  We continued ativan at home doses.
No acute changes in management.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable.
