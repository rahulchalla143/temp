History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78M with PMH significant for gastric CA currently on palliative chemo (last dose 3 weeks ago) and s/p right nephrostomy tube who presented to the ED from rehab where is was found to be febrile to 101.2 and hypoxic to 77-83% on RA with SOB.
Pt had one episode of vomitting this AM loose stools over the past day or so.
While in the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be in a fib with episodes of RVR up to 140s-160s.
Pt recieved ample fuids but no rate control agents and rate ultimately came down to 110s.
UA from bladder and nephrostomy tube were both significant for many bacteria, moderate leuk, and >50 WBCs.
Worsened L pleural effusion on CXR.
He also got Tylenol and a dose of 30mg Troadol for fevers and CP.
He became hypotensive into the 70s/50s.
He was admitted to the ICU for further mangement of his hypoxemia and likely sepsis [**1-15**] UTI as well as his pleural effusion.
On arrival to the floor, pt has no complaints and is breathing comfortably on 5L NC.

No recreational drugs.
Family History: Father died of pneumonia at 64 years old; unknown other medical issues.
Mother died of pneumonia at 53 and had asthma.
Speech is slow with an occassional stutter.

No focal deficit noted.
A+0 X2-3 stable, no tachypnea HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, OP clear, no JVD, no cervical LAD RESP: bil coarse basilar crackles per precussion no reacumulation of pleural effusion after drainage today.
CV: [**Last Name (un) **], S1+2, no m/r/g ABD: soft, NTND, BS+, no HSM, no shifting dullness.
No CVA or bladder tenderness EXT: WWP, no c/c/e, no signs of DVT Lines/Tubes: port accessed; foley catheter; right nephrostomy tube; left pleurex all C/D/I.
Imaging Studies:  Electrocardiogram ([**2199-11-20**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Low limb lead voltage.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-9-11**] there is variation in precordial lead placement but the T wave abnormalities recorded in leads V4-V6 are not apparent.
The pre-existing right lung parenchymal opacities are stable.
There is no safe evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9147**] is a 78-year-old man with a PMH of gastric CA with known malignant effusions, obstructive uropathy of unclear etiology s/p right nephrostomy tube, and recent basilar stroke who presented from rehab with hypoxia and hypotension.
Workup revealed UTI and accumulation of left pleural effusion, and patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for need for pressors.
# UTI, hypotension: Patient had SIRS criteria given fever and tacycardia, with either urinary or pulmonary source.
In addition, report of loose stools at rehab, so C.diff also possible.
Patient was aggressively volume resuscitated with 4L IVF prior to arrival.
Urine culture taken from the nephrostomy tube later grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, so the vancomycin was stopped.
With regard to his recent recurrent urinary tract infections, review of the records shows that patient has had several such infections since his right nephrostomy tube was placed in late [**Month (only) 216**].
Given CXR demonstrating large loculated left sided pleural effusion that has previously been sampled with results consistent with metastatic pleural effusion, this hypoxemia is likely secondary to V/Q mismatch from restrictive physiology of moderate to large pleural effusion.
Given hypotension, however, can not rule out underlying consolidation.
However, serial chest x-rays and hematocrits showed stability and no evidence of bleeding post-procedure.
As above, cultures from the pleural fluid were negative for infection.
His respiratory status improved with drainage of the effusion and he was able to be weaned off oxygen.
# Gastric cancer: s/p 1 cycle of EOX [**2199-8-22**] to [**2199-9-11**] and 2 cycles of irinotecan, last dose [**2199-10-30**].
# CVA: s/p CVA in the setting of AF: Lovenox was held after the Pleurex was placed.
# AF: patient noted to have AF with a number episodes of RVR during this admission.
He received one unit of packed red cells on the third hospital day, due to slight drop in hematocrit.
# Hyperlipidemia: Statin continued.
# Obstructive Uropathy s/p right percutaneous nephrostomy: Management for his obstructive uropathy and recurrent urinary tract infections is described above.
4. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
Dulcolax 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Docusil 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location (un) 5165**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Gastric Cancer Malignant pleural effusions obstructive uropathy Urinary Tract Infection Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came in because of low blood pressure and low level of oxygen in your blood.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection which was treated with antibiotics.
You were also found to have liquid accumulation around your left lung which was causing you trouble with oxygenation.
You were also found to have irregular fast heart rate.
