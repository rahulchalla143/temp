Admission Date:  [**2202-9-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive/weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: GJ tube insertion   History of Present Illness: This is an 81 year old female with past medical history notable for right sided MCA stroke with residual left hemiparesis, COPD, Atrial flutter, and partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer who presented to the ED today with altered mental status as well as weakness this morning.
The patient's daughter reports she had been in her normal state of health two days ago but yesterday seemed more confused and was coughing with an increased O2 requirement.
This morning the patient was found in bed unresponsive and not speaking to her daughter.
Neurology consulted and was concerned this could be a new ischemic stroke but the patient also had findings consistent for pneumonia and some concerning ECG changes with elevated troponins.
Given multiple issues this was considered possible CVA versus return of previous deficits in the context of other acute illness.
Past Medical History: -History of right sided MCA ischemic stroke (residual mild left hemiparesis) -Severe aortic stenosis:  TTE [**2-1**] showed severe AS and diastolic heart failure.
-History of alcohol abuse -History of pyloric stenosis.

There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were frequent sharp waves, usually symmetric, indicating areas of cortical hypersynchrony.
This does not necessarily indicate the  presence of seizures at other times.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen (which may be underestimated).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CXR [**8-3**]: There is a small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is very similar.
There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
Multiple small acute infarcts, diffusely scattered in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, on both sides, in the ACA, MCA and the PCA territories, likely related to an embolic source.
Patent major intracranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram with bilateral fetal PCA variant and hypoplastic A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery.
ekg: sinus tachycardia at rate of 117, normal axis, normal intervals, pseudonormalization of t waves in V2 and V3.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 81 year old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe AS, COPD, and a previous right sided MCA stroke presenting with altered mental status and left sided deficits.
#Obtundation/Confusion: There was concern that the patient had AMS from seizures due to her recent embolic strokes.
Neurology evaluated the patient and did an EEG which showed encephalopathy likely due to metabolic causes.
Her underlying urinary tract infection and hypernatremia were treated and the patient slowly became more responsive, alert and oriented.
#Multiple embolic strokes: The patient has a history of a left sided middle cerebral artery stroke and presents with increased weakness bilaterally and altered mental status.
The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial flutter, so her embolisms are a likely resultant from this pathology.
Her strength is globally decreased (L>R) and she had sensory deficits on L>R.
#Diastolic heart function: The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and had episodes of flash pulmonary edema for unclear reasons.
An Echo showed worsening aortic insufficiency, RV hypokinesis a worsening of LVEF (50%).
She should continue to take Metoprolol and losartan for BP control.
Severe aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis with a value area of 0.8-1.0.
The patient is a poor surgical candidate, so she will be medically managed.
She was started on Lovenox for anticoagulation and should continue metoprolol for rate control.
#Nutrition: The patient failed multiple speech and swallow exams while in the ICU.
With clearing of her mental status, the patient was able to tolerate thick liquids, though had low PO intake.
She was on lisinopril, however, did not tolerate it due to cough.
#Non ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient was noted to have troponin leakage to ~0.87 in the absence of chest pain and EKG changes.
An echocardiogram showed increased aortic regurgitation, increased hypokinesis in the right ventricle and a worse left ventricular ejection fraction (50%).
#Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia: On presentation, the patient's daughter reported increased cough and respiratory distress at home and a new infiltrate appeared on CXR.
She was given a 5 day course of Levaquin and azithromycin and her symptoms improved.
She no longer had a productive cough or oxygen requirement.
#Leukocytosis: The patient had a persistent leukocytosis since admission.
On discharge, she had no signs of any infection, though still had a leukocytosis to 11.8.
#COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with respiratory distress.
She was diagnosed with pneumonia, but also had a possible component of COPD exacerbation.
#Hypernatremia: The patient developed hypernatremia during her stay in the ICU.
The patient was not intaking many fluids, so it was likely hypernatremia secondary to low PO intake.

You were found to have multiple strokes in your brain.
Your blood was thinned to prevent further strokes.
You also had a heart attack.
You went to the ICU because you had difficulty breathing due to water in your lungs.
You should come back to the hospital if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, or develop increased confusion.
