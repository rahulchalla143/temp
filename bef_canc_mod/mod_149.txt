The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, who presented for an outpatient pulmonary treadmill test and complained of severe chest pain across his chest, 8 out of 10, and numbness in his distal fingertips bilaterally and inner feet in both legs.
He denied any nausea or vomiting, sweating or diaphoresis.
He did have a headache after his Nitroglycerin.
The patient has been chest pain free prior to admission.
In [**2161**] after coronary artery bypass grafting, the patient suffered from an myocardial infarction and felt similar symptoms as he experienced on the day of admission and also before an admission in [**2167-2-15**] secondary to congestive heart failure.
He also denied dysuria and melena.
He reported increase in left lower extremity and right lower extremity swelling and also gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Coronary artery bypass grafting times four with catheterization as listed above.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  There was 1+ non-pitting edema on the left and no edema on the right lower extremity.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and minimal symptoms of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 60, wide QRS with ST depression in V2-V6 and in lead II.
The patient was taken to Catheterization where he was found to have three-vessel disease.
Coronary angiography of the native vessels revealed a right dominant system with three-vessel disease.
LMCA had mild 20% distal disease, proximal and mid left anterior descending with mild diffuse disease up to 60%.
D1 had severe diffuse disease up to 95% at its origin with subtotally occluded mid vessel.
Left circumflex was with severe disease in the proximal and mid segments and totally occluded distally.
Mid right coronary artery was with diffuse disease up to 40% and 80% tubular lesion.
Mid vessel 80% lesion seen at the ostium of the acute marginal.
Graft angiography showed a patent LIMA left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft posterior descending artery graft.
The saphenous vein graft/ramus/OM1 had a 60% lesion with nonlaminar flow suspicious for thrombus.
Rheolytic thrombectomy and stenting of the saphenous vein graft jump segment from R1 to OM was performed with no residual stenosis and improvement in the long laminar flow.
After catheterization, the patient did well and was started on Heparin and Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with intention to titrate up Coumadin; however, the patient developed large hematomas and ecchymosis at the elbow, thigh, and leg while on Heparin.
She also had an increased heart rate and a new complaint of left lower quadrant pain without rebound.
The patient was sent for abdominal CT which showed a retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient also intermittently complained of light-headedness, and on [**5-29**], the patient was with an increased heart rate early in the morning which was treated with 5 mg of Diltiazem IV and reinstitution of Verapamil.
The patient also experience hyponatremia which improved upon discharge.
It was felt to be secondary to diarrhea and/or Zaroxolyn.
On [**5-30**], the patient was without any complaints until 1 p.m. that day when he was walking with Physical Therapy and experienced shortness of breath and a tachycardiac atrial fibrillation rhythm to 106 with maintenance of good blood pressure.
The patient laid down and was resting, and symptoms resolved.
At 1:30 p.m., the patient complained of chest tightness, increasing shortness of breath, and denied nausea or vomiting.
He was found to have atrial fibrillation in the 130s with a blood pressure of 100/60, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 L oxygen nasal cannula.
Chest x-ray was negative for congestive heart failure.
He was sent down for an angiographic CT to rule out PE and was found to have multiple PEs on the left, more than the right, with a large clot to the left main.
The patient's Heparin had been discontinued on [**5-27**] due to his retroperitoneal bleed and had subsequent 3 U packed red blood cell transfusion.
The patient did extremely well following transfer back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] with the only complaints of right thigh increasing in size with mild pain.
Duplex venous ultrasounds were done of the patient's right leg which showed positive DVT in the right popliteal and femoral veins.
It was decided after discussion with the patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], that the patient would not be anticoagulated at the time of discharge due to recent history of retroperitoneal bleed requiring 3 U transfusion and recent IVC filter placement and the patient's present status of being hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.
It was decided that the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the risks of DVT with simultaneous filter at that time.
Otherwise, the patient was asymptomatic with no chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness.
Cardiovascular was regular, rate and rhythm, with a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Extremities with right greater than left leg size, with ecchymosis which is dissipating.
There was no difference in temperature, and no cords.
Negative [**Last Name (un) 5813**], but tender at dorsal inferior thigh.
There was trace bilateral edema.
TTE from [**6-1**] showed a moderately dilated left atrium and left ventricle, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Right ventricle was dilated with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, trace aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, systolic dysfunction consistent with diffuse processes, such as toxins, metabolic, etc.
ASSESSMENT:  This was a 71-year-old man with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, status post saphenous vein graft stent on [**5-22**], retroperitoneal bleed on anticoagulation, pulmonary emboli with transfer to MICU, with rapid atrial fibrillation, with subsequent IVC filter placement, and transfer back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], now stable on p.o.
Diltiazem, rate controlled less than 100, with no complaints of shortness of breath, and now with right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease is stable status post stent on [**5-22**], with no complaints of chest pain.
Congestive heart failure:  Ejection fraction is 23%.
Electricity atrial fibrillation with ectopy presently rate controlled with p.o.
Pulmonary:  Bilateral PEs with IVC filter.
No shortness of breath.
The patient is presently stable and is at high risk for anticoagulation bleed.
There has been no complaints of fever, cough, or urinary tract infection.
Duplex venous ultrasound as above.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation with ectopy.
Retroperitoneal bleed status post 3 U packed red blood cells transfusion.
Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician in one week to the next few days to consider restarting Coumadin secondary to deep venous thrombosis and retroperitoneal bleed.
