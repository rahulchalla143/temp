Family History: Notable for a father who had macular degeneration.
There is no family history of any memory disorders.
Physical Exam: EXAM on discharge: GENERAL: chronically ill appearing male in no distress.
GEN: NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, NECK: no JVP elevation CHEST: bilateral crackles L>R HEART: Irregular, [**2-9**] holosystolic murmur over most of precordium.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2112-9-28**] 3:43 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: Please eval for infiltrate/interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man with bilateral pleural effusions with new oxygen requirement.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval for infiltrate/interval change REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation for interval change in a patient with bilateral pleural effusions.
Overall gradual increase of bilateral pleural effusions .
The cardiac silhouette is markedly increased due to known right atrial enlargement and pericardial effusion.
Dilated coronary sinus (diameter >15mm).
Markedly dilated RV cavity.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic tricuspid valve supporting structures.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA  PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No longer anticoagulated because of GI bleeding.
CTA OF THE CHEST: There are no central or segmental pulmonary emboli.
Severe cardiomegaly with severely dilated right atrium is again noted.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted in the right coronary as well as the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Within the lungs, there is a large right-sided pleural effusion, similar in size to the prior study.
Patchy opacities in the right upper lobe, however, have resolved in the interim.
There is a moderate pleural effusion on the left with likely atelectasis of the lingula, and poor aeration of the remaining lung, thought marginally improved from prior.
In the visualized upper abdomen, no definite abnormalities are detected.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
Severe cardiomegaly unchanged.
Large right and moderate left pleural effusions which appear similar in comparison to the prior study, with stable left pleural enhancement.
Small pericardial effusion.
No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o male with resolving altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency most likely [**2-5**] CHF exacerbation and pleural effusion and renal failure with multiple admissions to the MICU for hypoxia, now resolved and called out.
Transferred to MICU for hypercarbia and hypoxia (mild worsening of CHF on CXR) placed on BiPAP and diuresed, and following morning more alert.
# Acute Renal Failure: Improved.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Diet controlled at home.
No ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] as mostly right sided dilated CMP.
No anticoagulation because of severe GI bleed history.
No thoracentesis at this time.
# H/O PE: Not anticoagulating because of GI bleed history.
# Psychiatric: Started OP medication, Seroquel 25 mg QHS with good response and less agitation.
Anemia: PO iron supplement: 325 mg Fe FEN: Monitor Electrolytes given arrhythmia history, Cardiac/Diabetic Diet Proph: SC heparin(DVT), Protonix for GERD(GI) Code: DNR, but intubation is acceptable per prior discussion s with family.
