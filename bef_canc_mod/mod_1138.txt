Admission Date:  [**2136-8-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-7-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Code Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and drainage of L foot X 2 L ankle/foot external fixation   History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 74 year old male with a history of Left foot Charcot neuroarthropathy and chronic ulcerations with multiple surgeries for debridement and bone removal for osteomyelitis.
The patient has been hospitalized 3 times in the last year, most recently [**2136-5-25**] to [**2136-5-29**] for correction of a loose left external fixator.
after being sent from the [**Hospital **] clinic with concern for an infected foot.
Per podiatry notes, patient's left foot was noted to be very swollen with purulent and sanguinous drainage.
Patient reports some nausea/vomiting one week prior and additionally endorses some chills this a.m. as well as increasing pain in his foot over the last three weeks.
Per report the patient had an episode of afib with RVR with normalization of HR with volume resuscitation of 2.5L prior to transfer without nodal agents.
Past Medical History: History of L foot osteo s/p bilateral cataracts s/p colonoscopy with benign polyp removal [**11-6**] History of PNA with afib & mild CHF in [**11-6**]   Social History: Lives with wife in [**Location (un) **] [**Name (NI) **] minimal   Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: T- 99.3 120/47 97(afib) 16 99% on 2L NC .
OP: MM dry  Neck: No JVD Chest: mod air movement, relatively CTA anterior and laterally.
NT, ND +BS Ext: +1 LE edema bilaterally, chronic venous stasis bilaterally L>R , left foot with dressing in place, not yet taken down.
The patient is status post charcot foot reconstruction with left fibular osteotomy, tibial calcaneal arthrodesis and left talectomy with femoral head allograft placement.
There has been continued interval remodeling at the site of the femoral allograft.
Circular lucencies seen on the prior film, which represented location of removal of prior hardware are not well seen on today's exam consistent with new bone formation in these locations.
The joint spaces in the mid foot are less well-defined on today's exam, which may be partly due to the differences in patient rotation of the foot but may also be due to continued bony destruction and remodeling in the mid foot.
Extensive resorption of the second through fifth metatarsal and proximal third phalanx degenerations are again noted and are consistent with prior infection or changes secondary to neuropathy.
Diffuse periosteal reaction along the medial aspect of the fibula is unchanged.
No acute fractures are seen.
There is extensive vascular calcification, unchanged.
No definite evidence of gas within the soft tissues.
Density irregularity at the dorsum of the foot may be due to skin folds.
Evaluation of osteomyelitis is severely limited by the extensive bony remodeling that is continuously taking place over the course of multiple prior radiographs.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No pulmonary edema, consolidations or pleural effusions are seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
Several moderately sized lymph nodes in the left groin, which could be related to the patient's cellulitis.
Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**8-8**] ECG Sinus rhythm Atrial premature complex Low limb lead QRs voltage - is nonspecific Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of [**2136-8-2**], narrow complex tachycardia absent and ST-T wave changes decreased .
SEVEN RADIOGRAPHS SHOWING THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT FOOT AND ANKLE: There is marked osseous disorganization and destruction of the left foot.
There is severe osteopenia throughout the foot.
There is no air tracking along the subcutaneous tissues.
IMPRESSION: Marked arthropathy with interval placement of external fixation device and antibiotic beads.
The bony changes are consistent with neuropathic arthropathy, though chronic infection can have a similar appearance.
