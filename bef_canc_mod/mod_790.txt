States that she had chills, no fever, a "weird feeling in my stomach" with cramps, and no cough.
Pt missed her dialysis session on Saturday because she was feeling unwell (3 days ago).
She the developed [**Female First Name (un) **] endophthalmitis and had her L eye enucleation.
Her last admission she was also noted to have coag negative staph bacteremia.
She has now had 4 sets bld cx + for coag negative staph and was started on vancomycin.
Diagnosed after she began to have swolen fingers, a rash and painful joints.
HTN - [**2137**].
Has had 1 hypertensive crisis that precipitated seizures in the past.
Vaginal bleeding [**2139-9-20**] 7.
Mulitple episodes of dialysis reactions 8.
Anemia 9.
Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-15**] 10.
Graduated [**Name2 (NI) **] School and then got sick so currently is not working or attending school.
No clotting disorders in family.
No history of autoimmune disease.
Sclera anicteric.
No M/R/G Lungs: CTA b/l with good air entry and flow Abd: Soft, NT, ND.
Back: No spinal, paraspinal, or CVA tenderness Ext: No edema.
No acute changes.
The lungs are clear and cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
Moderate resting LVOT gradient.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and dynamic systolic function (LVEF>80%).
There is a moderate (25mmHg peak) resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that increased (64mmHg) with the Valsalva manuever.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with dynamic systolic function and resting LVOT gradient that increased with Valsalva.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-4**], the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy has increased and trace aortic regurgitation is now identified.
Abrupt occlusion of the right internal jugular vein and its distal most aspect as it joins with the distal subclavian vein.
Recanalization of the left subclavian vein with some peripheral residual clot.
Recommend analysis of the SVC, central subclavians and internal jugular veins with dedicated magnetic resonance venography, which can be performed without intravenous contrast for a global assessment of the venous patency.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 22 yo female with SLE, ESRD on HD, amongst other problems who presented with symptoms likely [**2-12**] bacteremia.
Found to be in hypertensive urgency after missing a run of dialysis.
She was found to be bacteremic and was started on vancomycin.
Hypertensive urgency- Pt with long history of very difficult-to-control HTN.
She was initially on a labetalol gtt as above, was dialyzed with resolution of her HTN urgency.
She was then transitioned to her her outpatient medication regimen of valsartan, lisinopril, clonidine, labetalol, terazosin, and nicardipine at max doses, but because of persistent HTN to the 180's she was started on hydralazine 50mg po tid on discharge.
Had dialysis inhouse.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypertensive urgency Coagulase negative Staphylococcus Bacteremia  Secondary diagnosis: Lupus ESRD s/p L eye enucleation   Discharge Condition: Good.
Take all medications as prescribed; Other than giving you vancomycin we have added hydralazine (a blood pressure medicine), but otherwise we have not changed any of your medicines.
If you have fevers, chills, light-headedness, or other problems then you should contact your doctor because this may be a sign that your infection is not resolving.
