Admission Date:  [**2162-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-1-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion of left paracolic drain.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 27 year old male with past medical history significant for alcohol abuse, peptic ulcer, and a recent month long hospitalization in [**2162-4-27**] for necrotizing pancreatitis which was complicated by respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, probable pulmonary embolism (PE) for which he is now on coumadin, Clostridium difficile infection, and acalculous cholysystitis status post PCT drainage.
Following his discharge on [**2162-5-26**] he went to rehab on linezolid and reportedly developed a rash so this was stopped.
He was in his usual state of health at home until two prior to admission ([**6-19**]) when he developed fevers, nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake.
He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was found to have ARF (Cr 2.1), bandemia (15%), hypotension, tachycardia.
He was given Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Quinupristin/Dalfopristin for history of VRE and rash with Linezolid.
He had mild abdominal pain and surgery was consulted and did not think there was acute abdominal process.
His creatinine improved with hydration and he had CT abdomen which showed extensive abdominal and peripancreatic fluid collections but overall no change from prior CT abdomen in [**Month (only) **].
The patient persisted with sinus tachycardia, but did not develop other episodes of SVT.
During the course, the patient complained of LLQ abdominal pain that was muscular in nature.
Surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel his symptoms were related to intraabdominal process.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis and US of the abdomen revealed persistent but unchanged fluid collections.
Per ID, the patient underwent a tagged WBC scan on [**6-24**] that demonstrated strong uptake in the area of the abdominal fluid collection.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
He denied any symptoms on the floor.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers to approximately 100.5 initially but these subsided over several days.
Fluid cultures collected from the intra-abdominal fluid collection grew out Lactobacillus spp., and per ID recommendations, Zosyn was changed to PO Augmentin.
The patient was discharged on [**6-30**] in stable condition and had been afebrile for approximately 48 hours.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 27 YOM with history of etoh abuse and recent complicated hospitalization for necrotizing pancreatitis who presented with several days of nausea and fevers.
He was found to be severely hypotensive and required extensive intravenous fluid resuscitation and a brief course of pressors and a short stay in the medical ICU during which time he was on broad spectrum antibiotics.
After extensive evaluation for an infectious source, a tagged white blood cell scan revealed an intra-abdominal fluid collection as the source of his fevers.
He continued to have intermittent fevers after transfer from the MICU to the floor.
Fluid cultures from the abdominal collection eventually grew out Lactobacillus and the patient was started on Augmentin.
Potential sources infecitous included intraabdominal (pancreatic, biliary, C diff), bacteremia, with UTI and Pneumonia less likely given normal UA and CXR.
Shortly after admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have significant diarrhea with >20 BM daily.
The ID service was consulted and C.Diff was determined to be the most likely pathogen causing this septic shock presentation.
Until a source of infection could be identified, he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics: Daptomycin (for possible VRE recurrence), cefepime/flagyl (for possible enteric pathogen), and PO vanco (for possible persistent c diff).
Mr. [**Known lastname **] became hemodynamically stable off pressors on the day after admission and a tagged WBC scan was performed to attempt to localize the source of his left lower quadrant tenderness that seemed musculoskeletal in origin.
The tagged WBC scan showed uptake in a fluid collection in the left paracolic gutter and a drain was placed in the fluid collection which returned fluid with gram positive rods identified as lactobacillus.
# Sinus tachycardia: Likely related to pain or infection.
# Acute renal failure: Initially presented with a serum creatinine of 2.1.
His home dose of Lisinopril was held throughout the hospital course in order to prevent potential worsening of his renal failure.
Most likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia.
