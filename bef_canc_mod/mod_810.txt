HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old female with coronary artery disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, and chronic atrial flutter who presents with lightheadedness and was admitted on [**2120-7-27**].
On [**7-23**], the patient was evaluated at [**Hospital6 15291**] for dyspnea on exertion and atrial flutter.
Per the admission notes, the patient was unable to walk one block without experiencing shortness of breath.
On her initial admission, she denied chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, headaches, loss of consciousness, or vertigo.
She denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or claudication.
On [**7-28**], the patient experienced an episode of substernal chest pain which radiated to her arms bilaterally.
She was unable to sleep due to this discomfort and experienced a similar episode of chest pain with burning one week prior to admission.
The catheterization showed multiple lesions of the right coronary artery with 90% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery and a 70% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.
Aright heart catheterization showed a cardiac output of 2.3, a cardiac index of 1.4, and systemic vascular resistance of [**2134**], pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was elevated at 43 with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary artery pressure of 38%.
The patient was also noted to have elevated filling pressures.
Given the current presentation, the patient was noted to be in cardiogenic shock and was started on an intra-aortic balloon pump.
On angiography, the patient was seen to have a clot in the mid right coronary artery.
Upon completion of cardiac catheterization, the patient was noted to have a large left femoral hematoma.
On further note, an echocardiogram done on [**2120-7-23**] revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, with pulmonary artery hypertension, a pulmonary artery pressure of 49, and an akinetic apical septum.
Electrocardiogram on [**7-28**] revealed ST segment elevations in leads II and III, with reciprocal changes in the lateral leads, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.
On [**7-29**], status post catheterization, resolution of the ST changes in leads II and III were evident.
Electrocardiogram still demonstrated evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and the patient was in atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
Chronic atrial flutter (times 10 years).
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2107**] with residual facial droop.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  There is no history of alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:   There is no family history of coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with atrial flutter and 2:1 conduction.
First heart sound and second heart sound were present.
The lungs revealed bibasilar crackles.
There was a left-sided femoral hematoma and oozing at the right groin site.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature congestion, with a diffuse reticular pattern concerning for interstitial disease given the patient's long-term smoking history.
Again, upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was noted to have bleeding at her left femoral site.
There was a large hematoma which spread into the left labia and into the left groin.
However, a pressure dressing was placed to control the bleeding, and upon removal of the pressure dressing the patient was not noted to have a femoral bruit.
Concern for active bleeding was taken into account; however, her hematocrit levels remained stable for 48 hours.
The patient had evidence of bilateral groin ecchymosis, but no femoral bruits were appreciated on examination.
The patient's white blood cell count was noted to be elevated at 12.4; however, the patient did not demonstrate any clinical signs of infection.
Per telephone contact, the patient's physician would like her to remain on [**Hospital6 197**] for chronic atrial flutter.
Her physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**] was to follow her as an outpatient for her anticoagulation and atrial flutter.
Overall, the patient was a 71-year-old female with coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke in [**2107**], diabetes, and chronic atrial flutter now with inferior myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her proximal right coronary artery.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Ischemia:  Inferior myocardial infarction, status post stent to the proximal right coronary artery.
The patient denied any further chest pain.
(b)  Pump:  Ejection fraction of 55% with mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient remained in atrial flutter with 3:1 conduction.
A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was considered if frequent changes in hematocrit were evident.
Therefore, no evidence of bleeding.
The patient was noted to have decreased platelets upon placement of the intra-aortic balloon pump; however, she had appropriate correction of her platelets after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
Bilateral femoral ecchymoses were improving.
No evidence of femoral bruits.
Cardiogenic shock.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial flutter.
Maintenance on cardiac and diabetic diet.
