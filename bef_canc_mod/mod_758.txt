She reports feeling more SOB with increased productive cough for several days.
Has felt warm but no objective fevers.
She gets esophageal dilations approx every 6 weeks and was due for one tomorrow.
Has been having increased dysphagia and subsequent poor PO intake.
Also having 1 week of bilateral lower leg swelling as well as left leg pain.
She denies chest pain and abdominal pain.
She has had no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
She was noted to have a decrease in HCT and albumin this week, with ?of volume overload vs renal injury/CHF as BUN/cr also increased.
Trops slightly elevated at 0.09 elevated from negative prior.
No CP and EKG reassuring.
Possible demand ischemia.
In ED neurology was consulted due to her history of left leg pain.
On arrival to the MICU she appeared relatively comfortable on 5L NC and had no active complaints.

Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
Improved but persistent lower lung opacities.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy, unclear if this could be reactive or malignant given history; review of clinical history is suggested and if the cause of lymphadenopathy is uncertain, then PET-CT or continued follow-up imaging could be considered.
Multifocal ground-glass and peribronchovascular opacities.
This is nonspecific and could represent inflammation, infection, or increased pulmonary edema.
MRI L SPINE: Degenerative disc disease at multiple levels with no findings to  suggest epidural abscess.
A preliminary report was issued that read "no evidence of spinal epidural abscess or mass.
Multilevel degenerative changes with small disc bulges at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 without high degree of stenosis.
Heterogeneous marrow with T1 hyperintense lesions in T11-L1 consistent with hemangiomas.
Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis at L3-4 and L4-5 is stable since prior.
Round T1 hypointense non-enhancing lesion in S1 is stable since [**2169**].
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation.
XRAY HIP: Severe degenerative changes in left hip.
Currently, no x-ray evidence of septic arthritis.
Brief Hospital Course: 73F with h/o medullary and papillary thyroid CA s/p radiation c/b esophageal strictures requiring monthly dilations and h/o aspiration pneumonias p/w SOB, [**Last Name (un) **] and SOB.
Respiratory disress: Patient was noted to have moderate pulmonary edema on CXR and a BNP 2500, ECHO showed prserved ejection fraction (LVEF 55%).
CTA ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
She was treated with vanco/pip/tazo and respiratory status continued to decline, levofloxacin was added for atypical coverage.
With bilateral non cadrgiogenic pulmonary edema her picture was concerning for ARDS.
Urine culture returned with enterococcus suggesting bacteremia was from a urinary source.
MRI L spine did not show any signs of epidural abscess.
Esophageal strictures: secondary to radiation with esophageal balloon dilatations approx one a month, next due on Tuesday.
Given her acute illness, she was not a candidate for re-dilation.
