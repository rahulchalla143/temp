She noted that she became significantly more short of breath right prior to admission with dyspnea on exertion and positive paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She had no chest pain or pressure at the time, no fever or chills or shakiness.
She denied any productive cough or any other recent congestive heart failure symptoms.
Her prior cardiac catheterization [**2138-12-11**], showed an ejection fraction of 69 percent, three plus mitral regurgitation, diffuse disease in her mid right coronary artery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Neuropathy requiring bilateral lower extremity braces.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
She had no history of alcohol or recreational drug use.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was seen immediately on consultation by the renal service for evaluation of her hyponatremia.
Magnetic resonance imaging performed on [**2138-12-27**], preoperatively showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 24 percent, right ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent with severe mitral regurgitation.
On examination, she had no issues neurologically in terms of her mental status.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm, with a systolic ejection murmur.
Her lungs were clear bilaterally without any rales or rhonchi.
She had two plus peripheral edema with cellulitis of her right second toe.
She had biphasic dorsalis pedis pulse on the left and one plus on the right and monophasic posterior tibial pulse on the left and one plus on the right.
The patient was admitted for evaluation and treatment of her congestive heart failure as well as monitoring of her cellulitis of her foot.
The patient was somewhat unsteady on her feet due to her neuropathy and old right ankle fracture and as previously noted uses braces to ambulate.
The patient was also monitored for the issue of cellulitis in her toe anticipating mitral valve replacement at this admission.
She was volume overloaded with lower extremity edema.
The patient had fluid restriction and the plan was to time surgery when the issues had resolved.
The patient was also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the neurology attending on consultation at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for concern of her hyponatremia and the risks it presented during cardiopulmonary bypass.
The patient was evaluated for her risk of central pontine myelinolysis although this was reported to be rare and was evaluated for this risk by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Approximately two hours after the operation, the patient continued to have significant hemorrhage and was returned to the operating room for resternotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
An exploration of bleeding and ligation of bleeding vessels.
She remained on low dose Precedex overnight for her history of anxiety but the patient was alert and oriented, following commands and moving all extremities.
On postoperative day number one, after her mitral valve replacement and take back for bleeding, she had received two intravenous Lasix doses for low urine output.
She had only trace edema in her extremities.
She was also seen by case management after her operation to help prepare for her discharge.
She was switched over to Dilaudid for pain relief.
She had her baseline discomfort in her feet secondary to her diabetic neuropathy.
She had some scattered crackles and decreased breath sounds at the bases but was in sinus rhythm in the 90s.
On postoperative day number three, she was tachycardic at 113 with a stable blood pressure of 124/64, saturating 95 percent in room air.
She had no peripheral edema.
On postoperative day number four, the patient continued to improve and was afebrile with a heart rate in the 80s and blood pressure 110/40.
She continued to have significant insulin requirement as her blood sugars were elevated.
Her examination was unremarkable though she did start to have some lower extremity edema again.
The patient continued to have sliding scale insulin coverage.
She did not have any significant edema on postoperative day number five in her lower extremities.
She was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] approximately two weeks and to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her heart failure physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] approximately two weeks.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post mitral valve replacement with pericardial tissue valve.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
