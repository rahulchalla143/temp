Recent admissions for perforated diverticulitis c/b blood stream infection (PORPHYROMONAS SPECIES) from [**Date range (1) **].
Patient reports thin, nonbloody stools since discharge.
Past Medical History: (1) Splenectomy in [**2151-11-24**] when he had resection of a benign pancreatic mass at [**Hospital1 2025**].
No clotting or bleeding.
bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-3-1**] consistent with myeloproliferative disorder (polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **])...as well as an abnormal karyotype with deletion 20q in 3 out of 20 metaphases increasing his risk of hypercoagulability.
(3) Immune-mediated granulomatous disease.
(5) Chronic renal insufficiency of unclear etiology.
(6) High-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy on [**2151-5-31**], with no evidence of disease recurrence since that time.
(7) Diabetes mellitus (no recent A1C).
(9) In [**5-31**], he developed a perianal abscess with bacteremia.
(10) h/o thrombophlebitis in left leg (11) uveitis (12) C4-C5 radiculopathy (13) HLD (14) HTN (15) recurrent autoimmune pericarditis (16) h/o benign pancreatic cyst s/p resection   Social History: Lives with wife, has grown children.
Minimal TTP throughout.
No focal tenderness.
No rebound, no guarding.
Increased large bowel dilation from the cecum to the junction of the descending and sigmoid colon, with transition point noted in the left lower quadrant at the junction of the sigmoid colon with the descending colon, in a region which has been chronically inflammed by diverticulitis as noted on prior studies.
Additionally, at the transition point, there is an intramural sinus tract/abscess containing air and fluid, measuring up to 2-cm.
Findings are compatible with an inflammatory colonic stricture from prior diverticulitis resulting in upstream large bowel obstruction.
Please note that an underlying colonic mass is considered unlikely given recent negative colonoscopy in 6/[**2156**].
No free air or pneumatosis.
Status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, with left upper quadrant splenosis.
Status post prostatectomy with unchanged left pelvic side wall soft tissue nodule which remains suspicious for recurrence.
Unchanged 4-mm left lower lobe nodule.

[**8-27**] ECHO: EF 40%, ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
AV leaflets mildly thickened  [**8-29**] CT A/P: Moderate volume ascites, more dense fluid pelvis.
Tiny focus of extraluminal density is noted near anastomosis - leak.

Bilateral lower lobe, left greater than right atelectasis and given heterogeneity, likely superimposed small amount of aspiration or infection.
Segmental bronchiolar secretion/mucus plugging in the right lower lobe.
New pneumatosis in dilated loops of bowel in the right upper quadrant without bowel wall thickening at these sites, mesenteric or portal venous gas.
This may be benign pneumatosis in thisopatient on steroids and ventilated, but correlation and follow up to exclude ischemix injury is recommended.
Similar overall appearance of non-loculated ascites, slight decrease in  the left lower quadrant fluid despite left mid abdominal pigtail catheter being partially withdrawn  [**9-7**] RUQ US: gallstones inside contracted GB, no evidence of cholecystitis  [**9-8**] Echo: LVEF>55%, AV and MV leaflets are mildly thickened.

Bilateral lower lobe pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis and bronchial plugging.
Right lower lobe heterogeneity of enhancement in regions of atelectasis may result from regions of superimposed infection or infarction.
Segmental PE in the right upper and middle lobes remains unchanged in comparison to prior study.
Left-sided peritoneal enhancement along the retroperitoneal lining which may be representative of infection or inflammation, without loculated abscess.
Vague heterogeneity in hepatic density - some of which may relate to sequellae from previously described microabscesses, suggest attention on followup or further characterization by MRI if indicated.
Dobbhoff tube unlikely to have passed pylorus.
No evidence of organized abscess.
Hypodense nodule along the left obturator internus adjacent to the site of surgical clips from prior prostatectomy.

New heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung is concerning for bronchopneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2157-8-22**]: sigmoid colectomy + diverting ileostomy [**2157-9-6**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and therapeutic aspiration [**2157-9-12**]: ex-lap, removal of mesh from previous hernia repair, abdominal washout [**2157-9-13**]: emergent exlap, hematoma evacuation, abdominal packing, temporary closure [**2157-9-14**]: exlap, removal of packing, closure fascia [**2157-9-15**]: perc trach [**2157-9-19**]: exlap, hematoma evacuation, closure of leak site at anastamosis [**2157-9-22**]: left index finger amputation [**2157-9-26**]: pigtail catheter placement for L pleural effusion [**2157-9-29**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging [**2157-9-30**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging [**2157-10-17**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging  The pt was admitted on [**2157-8-21**] with a large bowel obstruction.
He was taken to the OR on [**2157-8-22**] for an exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid colectomy and diverting ileostomy for diverticular stricture.
His postop course was complicated by retroperitoneal bleed, pulmonary embolism, RUE DVT, pseudomonal pneumonia, need for tracheostomy, recurrent mucous plugging, as well as significant pain and musculoskeletal spasm issues.
Neuro: Pt had post-operative pain which was treated with various pain medications throughout his complicated course.
He has experienced significant deconditioning and will require aggressive physical therapy in order to regain his previous functional status.
He also experienced issues with pain and muscle spasms issues and was seen by the Chronic Pain Service.
CV: The patient had episodes of hypertension treated with beta blockers and hydralazine but also tachycardia and hypotension related to his bleeding episodes.
Prior to his discharge, he had been stable from a respiratory perspective.
On one of his takebacks, a small area of leak was noted on the back side of his anastamosis, which was sutured.
However, due to the patient's chronic steroid use for his sarcoidosis, he experienced a relative steroid deficiency (specifically aldosterone with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) requiring treatment with fludrocortisone.
Heme: Earlier in his hospital course, there was concern for HIT, which ultimately came back negative.
He was found to have a RUE DVT complicated by pulmonary embolism and he was ultimately transitioned to warfarin (which he was also on preoperatively for his polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]).
He also required two takebacks to the OR for intraperitoneal hemorrhage with clot evacuation.
ID: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by VRE sepsis, as well as a pseudomonal ventilator associated pneumonia, requiring treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics.
He also had the issue with aldosterone deficiency as noted above.
Wound: The patient's wound is currently being treated with a V.A.C.
