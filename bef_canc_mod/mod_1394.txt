Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 69year old male, known very well to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], s/p a Whipple in [**12-28**] with postoperative complications of anastamotic leaks and failure to thrive, as well as a known EC fistula.
He was recently discharged from the hospital after a long course of treatment for Klebsiella bacteremia from hepatic abscesses and obstructive cholangitis and issues with enteral feedings.
He says that he still has poor PO appetite, but is tolerating tube feeds at 90cc/hr overnight.
Past Medical History: PMHx: Adenocarcinoma (duodenum), HTN, peptic ulcer disease .
PSHx: s/p gastric resection [**2134**] for PUD s/p revision with Roux-en-Y and partial gastrectomy in [**2143**] s/p whipple [**2173-1-20**] s/p .
Drainage of intra-abdominal abscess through reopening of recent laparotomy; Repair of pancreaticojejunostomy through a bridge stent technique; Mass closure of the abdominal wall [**1-29**] for pancreatic and biliary fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess s/p Tracheostomy [**3-1**] s/p GJ-tube placed on [**2173-8-27**].
Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: 97.5, HR 100, BP 120/80, RR 18, O2sat 99% Genl: NAD, gaunt CV: RRR Resp: CTA-B Abd: s/nt/nd; Jtube in place via EC fistula; bilious drainage in fistula bag Extr: no c/c/e .
HEENT: Mild scleral icterus.
Lower abdominal EC fistula through which J-Tube enters.
EC fistula/J-T complex covered with ostomy appliance with bilious drainage.
There are new ill-defined hypodense lesions within the lateral right hepatic lobe, which are suspicious for new foci of infection given the short interval time course.
There is a tiny new fluid collection in the right lateral abdominal wall in the area of prior drain, measuring approximately 1.8cm maximally.
Otherwise, no new fluid collections are identified.
[**2173-10-17**] Portable Abdominal X-Ray: Only a supine portable view of the abdomen is submitted for interpretation, precluding assessment for free intraperitoneal air.
[**2173-10-17**] CXR: Interval placement of right subclavian catheter terminating in the lower SVC with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Examination is otherwise unchanged since the recent study except for development of linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
Rhythm is probably sinus tachycardia but consider also possible atrial tachycardia given the markedly rapid rate.
Since the previous tracing of [**2173-10-15**] marked tachycardia is now present and modest ST-T wave changes are seen.
FINDINGS: Again noted are multiple peripherally enhancing hepatic fluid collections containing foci of gas consistent with abscesses.
Allowing for differences in technique, these are not significantly changed in size, and no new collections are identified.
There are two foci of enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the site of prior drainage catheter tracts.
There are no focal fluid collections within the abdominal wall.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
MRCP images are limited, but there is no obvious focal stricture.
The remaining pancreas is atrophic and the pancreatic duct is mildly prominent.
There are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts.
A cyst within the posterior left renal mid pole is bright on T1 pre-contrast images, consistent with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous fluid.
The left kidney is mildly atrophic compared to the right.
There is mild diffuse anasarca.
Susceptibility artifact is noted in the anterior abdominal wall from multiple surgical clips.
The visualed abdominal bowel loops are nondilated, and there is no ascites or new focal fluid collection.
Limited images of the lower chest demonstrate loculated right pleural fluid and atelectasis and minimal left pleural fluid.
Multiplanar reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
No new fluid collections are identified.
There is enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the region of prior drainage catheters, without focal fluid collection.
Stable post-surgical changes from Whipple, with no evidence of biliary dilatation.
Bilateral renal cysts.
[**Name (NI) **] was continued on a regular diet with supplements, cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube, which enters the duodenum via a EC fistual, on home medications and oral antibiotics, the latter consisting of Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, and Linezolid.
These antibiotics were prescribed during his last admission for abdominal abscesses, which grew out Pseudomonas, MRSA and beta Strep.
Upon admission, his HGB was 7.5 and HCT 22.7, for which he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs without adverse event.
He was given supplemental hydration with Lactated Ringer's via the J-Tube.
Early on [**2173-10-15**], the patient became hypotensive, acutely confused and briefly unresponsive.
The EKG was unremarkable, and the CXR showed moderate (R) pleural effusion increased, rightward mediastinal shift with opacification in (R) lower lobe most likely representing atelectasis.
A Abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast demonstrated interval improvement in the hepatic fluid collection and a few small new collection less than 1.8cm in size.
He experienced another episode of hypotension on [**10-17**], and was again bolused with a total of 725mL LR with good response.
No fever or leukocytosis.
On [**2173-10-22**], the patient underwent MRCP, which revealed multiple hepatic abscesses, but not significantly changed in size given differences in technique, and no new fluid collections.
Given these finding demonstrating overall improvement and potential risks of interventional biospy, it was ultimately determined in consultation with Infectious Disease to forego planned ultrasound-guided aspiration and biopsy of one or more of the liver abscesses.
He was also started on Viokase and Imodium PRN for loose stools with improvement.
At the time of discharge on [**2173-10-29**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, although with poor intake, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.

Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency  Department for any of the following:  *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.

*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
General Drain Care:  *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
Cut very small slit bilateral tube holder so that the feeding tube will slide thru.
