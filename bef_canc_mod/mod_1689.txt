Admission Date:  [**2198-5-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-5-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-4-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post an anterior wall myocardial infarction and LAD stent with restenosis and successful PTCA one year prior.
The patient had chest pain and nausea around 1:00 p.m. on the day of admission, which lasted less then ten minutes.
He complained of being short of breath and had chills with a fever at that point.
On the way to the hospital the patient had a V fibrillation arrest.
The patient was stable in the CCU for two or three hours and then had a sustained wide complex tachycardia at a rate of 120 to 300.
It was felt that the patient had an accelerated idioventricular rhythm.
He had an anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2188**] and his cardiac enzymes were positive in [**2197-4-15**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had prostate cancer.
His son died of malignant melanoma.
No history of coronary artery disease.
Bilateral breath sounds with crackles at bases.
2+ pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Chest x-ray ETT tube in place, bilateral pulmonary edema with small effusions.
Coronary artery disease.
The patient will follow up with cardiology and will have a outpatient elective cardiac catheterization with a possibility of brachy therapy to prevent further in stent thromboses.
Congestive heart failure.
Following this myocardial infarction his ejection fraction was only 20%.
The patient has minimal shortness of breath now on room air and is able to ambulate without difficulty.
Eventually the dopamine was weaned off without any problem.
However, on hospital day six the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a maximal rate of 130.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with good rate control between 90 and 100.
We elected not to cardiovert him, because he was stable and also because of his pulmonary issues.
He required noninvasive support BiPAP for about twelve hours at which time his tachypnea resolved and his respiratory distress improved.
His pulmonary course was also complicated by a pneumococcal pneumonia (see below) for which he was aggressively treated, which resolved.
No pulmonary problems.
[**Name (NI) **] will be discharged on a standing dose of Lasix to prevent further episodes of pulmonary edema.
Four out of four bottles were positive for pneumococcus.
The patient had already been started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl and was changed to high dose vancomycin one gram IV q 6 hours since he was allergic to Penicillins.
Sputum was also positive for strep pneumonia and we obtained a head CT to evaluate his sinuses, which showed no evidence of sinusitis.
Surgery consult was obtained as well as a CAT scan of his abdomen.
Both were negative for evidence of cholecystitis or appendicitis.
On hospital day three the patient had some upper GI bleeding.
The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease as well.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Anterior wall myocardial infarction, status post angioplasty of an LAD stent, pneumococcal, sepsis requiring intubation, atrial fibrillation for which he is on Amiodarone and Lovenox and Coumadin as well as Lopressor.
