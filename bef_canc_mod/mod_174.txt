No overt evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Thickened rectal wall with surrounding fat stranding and presacral fluid suggesting proctitis.
Epidural intrinsically T1 hyperintense collection anteriorly at L3 which likely represents a hematoma.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Burst fracture of L4 as seen on the prior abdominal CT with associated hematoma.
Severe multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as described above.
Marked hypointensity of the bone marrow is again seen on all sequences which may reflect sequela of chronic anemia, diffuse infiltrative process, or myeloproliferative disease with sclerosis.

Transfered to MICU, where she received another 3L NS, resulting in hemodynamic stability.
#Epidural hematoma: Given recent injection and worsening low back pain, other potential source of sepsis was epidural abscess.
MRI showed L4 epidural hematoma.
Initial concern for infection, but after discussion with ID/Neurosurgery/Neuroradiology, felt less likely an infection and antibiotics were stopped.
Also had burst fracture of indeterminate age at L4 that Nsurg recommended a TLSO brace when out of bed.
Hematoma alternatively could have been from burst fracture.
# L4 Burst fracture:  Discovered on MRI, not present on imaging from [**2144-2-13**], but is unclear whether it is acute or chronic.
Was seen by neurosurgery as well as pain service.
#AMS: Secondary to septic encephalopathy/hypotension, improved significantly back to baseline with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
#Tachycardia: History of SVT, developed narrow complex tachycardia while off home metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and verapamil 40mg daily, resolved after fluid and restarting home meds.
#Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient received stress dose steroids in the setting of her infection and chronic prednisone use at home.
INR will need to be monitored while at rehab in light of antibiotics for treatment of C. diff infection.
#HCT drop: HCT dropped from 32 on admission to 23, likely hemoconcentrated, baseline crits ~25 secondary to ACD, sideroblastic anemia, G6PD deficiency, and sickle cell trait.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Hematology consulted, and recommended against transfusion as patient has received many transfusions in the past and there is concern for iron overload.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  #RA/Pain: This is a chronic issue, but the patient has increased pain currently in her lower back and right leg, presumably [**1-16**] the epidural hematoma.
#Transitional issues: - Ortho Spine follow-up for hematoma/burst fracture on [**9-30**], [**2143**].

Albuterol Inhaler [**12-16**] PUFF IH Q6H:PRN shortness of breath 2.
Warfarin 6 mg PO DAILY16   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis from C difficile colitis Spinal epidural hematoma  Secondary: Rheumatoid arthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of fevers, low [**Hospital1 **] pressure, and altered mental status.
You were found to have an infection of your large intestine known as C difficile - this is being treated with antibiotics and is improving.
You were also found to have a hematoma (collection of [**Hospital1 **]) near your spine, likely from one of your epidural injections.
You also had a fracture of one of your vertebrae.
You  will need to have your coumadin level checked regularly while on this antibiotic; the rehab facility will do this for you.
