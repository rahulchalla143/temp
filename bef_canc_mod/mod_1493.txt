He has had multiple interventions to his LAD with Cypher stent to LAD in [**6-27**].
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: angina, prior CAD PROCEDURE: Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the left femoral artery, using a 5 French  right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter, advanced to the ascending aorta through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant patietn revealed single vessel CAD.
The LMCA had mild disease.
The LAD had 90% in stent restenosis with possible fracture of the stent.
There was moderate diffuse distal disease beyond the stent but the remainder of the LAD was a good sized vessel suitable for LIMA touchdown.
The LCX had diffuse distal disease in the left PDA.
Referral for surgery for LIMA-LAD given that stented area has had ISR twice and failed both Cypher and Taxus stents.

Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE - CARDIOLOGY HOSPITAL COURSE [**2145-12-26**] to [**2145-12-29**]: 71 year old diabetic male with h/o CAD s/p DES x2 to mid/proximal LAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and SOB.
Recent MIBI concerning for worsened anterior wall motion abnormalities.
Cath this admission which showed proximal LAD disease.
Pt was referred for CABG CT SURGERY HOSPITAL COURSE- Patient to operating room on [**2145-12-29**] at which time he had an off pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery.
He was hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-operative period but remained intubated on the day of surgery due to relative hypoxia.
Call for any fever, redness or drainage from wounds.
