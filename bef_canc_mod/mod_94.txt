History of Present Illness: This is an 84 year old female with known coronary artery disease which has been medically managed.
Given recent complaints of dyspnea and chest tightness, she saw her PCP the day prior to admission.
The office EKG was notable for Twave inversions in V1-V3 and she was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and treatment.
Past Medical History: Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension Type II Diabetes Osteoporosis s/p Left knee replacement s/p Partial hysterectomy s/p Tonsillectomy s/p Bladder suspension s/p Appy s/p Breast reduction   Social History: Lives alone, daughter visiting.
No history of smoking, no EtoH.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LAD was heavily calcified with a 40% ostial stenosis and diffuse disease proximally to at least 50% though the mid-LAD was smaller caliber so likely more severe stenosis.
There was a 70-80% stenosis at the origin of D1.
The Cx had moderately heavy calcifications and was tapered proximally.
There was a small AV groove Cx and a major OM with diffuse moderate disease proximally leading to a mid-vessel 75% stenosis.
The ramus was modest in [**Last Name (LF) 12099**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], with mild diffusing plaquing.
There was a distal 60% stenosis with a tortuous RPDA with a 50% stenosis at the origin with TIMI2 fast flow and septal collaterals to the LAD.
Severe systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 218mm Hg and DBP 96mm Hg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-10-5**], the left ventricle is mildly hypertrophied with moderate diastolic dysfunction and elevated estimated filling pressures.
[**2153-8-23**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Echocardiogram showed moderate diastolic dysfunction but otherwise no significant valvular disease.
Carotid ultrasound revealed no significant disease of both internal carotid arteries.
She remained pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
She was extubated on POD #1 and went into atrial fibrillation and treated with amiodarone and beta blockers as she is a fall risk and not a good candidate for coumadin.
She had some confusion which improved but is not completely resolved.
