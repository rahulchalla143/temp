HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with a long history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2138**], multiple catheterizations and interventions), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, past tobacco history, family history of coronary artery disease, who reports a long history of angina manifested as left elbow pain.
Then, two days prior to this admission the patient began noticing increasing elbow pain that waxed and waned over the next few days but never completely subsided.
The pain was limited to the left elbow, reached as high as [**4-13**] to [**5-14**], and was not accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
When pain persisted, he presented to the doctor today and was subsequently referred to the emergency department.
Coronary artery disease; status post 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2148**] (saphenous vein graft to D1, left anterior descending artery, first obtuse marginal, posterior descending artery); status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2152-4-3**] after an acute myocardial infarction with stenting of the saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal (95% occlusion); [**2152-11-3**] catheterization with 40% lesion in the saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and a 90% lesion in the saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal which was stented times two;  [**2154-11-4**] catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery;  [**2155-11-4**] catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left circumflex.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (4 cm in diameter; has been stable; followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
Renal cell carcinoma, status post nephrectomy in [**2156-2-2**]  7.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Degenerative joint disease, especially of the right hip and lower spine.
Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His sister died of heart disease at age 65.
Father died of heart disease at age 78.
Family history also positive for diabetes.
In general, the patient was pleasant, comfortable, in no apparent distress.
HEENT revealed arcus senilis bilaterally anicteric.
No oral lesions.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, soft, obese, nontender.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, borderline first-degree AV block, axis 93 degrees, 1-mm ST elevations in V4 through V6 (new compared with electrocardiogram from [**2156-6-24**]).
Right coronary artery totally occluded proximally.
Regarding the patient's grafts:  Saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery with no stenosis, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with 90% proximal, 50% in-stent stenosis, saphenous vein graft to left circumflex was patent with native obtuse marginal with 80% lesion.
In addition, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was done on the in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with less than 20% residual stenosis and TIMI-III flow.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiopulmonary process.
[**3-3**] ultrasound on right groin revealed a 2-cm to 2.5-cm round pseudoaneurysm at the common femoral artery.
A repeat ultrasound on [**2158-3-6**], with Duplex color Doppler revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, or AV fistula.
Echocardiogram revealed left atrial moderate dilatation, interatrial septum (consistent with right atrial pressure), mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of question 35%, hypokinetic anterolateral wall and akinetic inferoposterior wall with mild 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and multiple interventions, and smoking who presented with five hours of resting angina partially relieved by nitroglycerin.
Electrocardiogram with ST elevations in V4 through V6 and enzymes that ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction.
Catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with totally occluded right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, 90% proximal stenosis and 50% in-stent stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft, native obtuse marginal 80% lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion.
His saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery graft revealed no stenosis, and the saphenous vein graft to left circumflex graft was patent.
The patient also had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to dilate the in-stent stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery which lead to less than 20% residual stenosis and TIMI-III flow.
Catheterization also revealed mild ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
The patient's post catheterization course was complicated by a right femoral pseudoaneurysm measuring 2 cm to 2.5 cm.
This occurred over the weekend, and the patient was scheduled to have thrombin injection on Monday; however, a repeat ultrasound on Monday (two days after appearance of the bruit) revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
was increased to as much as 100 mg and then gradually decreased back down to 50 mg because of bradycardia to the 40s with sinus pauses of 2 seconds.
Because the patient was still hypertensive with mild ventricular systolic dysfunction, captopril was started and increased to 75 mg p.o.
On the day of discharge, the patient complained of greenish left eye discharge with crusting.
Eye was mildly injected.
Acute myocardial infarction.
3-vessel coronary artery disease.
