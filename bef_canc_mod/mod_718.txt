Was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in NH for depressed left occipital skull fracture.
Past Medical History: - pineal germ cell tumor s/p XRT & chemo at age 14 - s/p VP shunt for noncommincating hydrocephalus [**2148**] with h/o frequent falls and multiple revisions - CPS on Keppra [**4-14**] yrs after shunt placement characterized by brief auras, staring spells, and post-ictal confusion.
During an LTM admission, captured R temporal sz (oral automatisms & altered awareness).
- b/l hearing loss, R total and L hearing aid, writes as primary form of communication - adrenal insufficiency(?)
- pan hypopituitarism (hypothyroid, hypogonadal, elevated prolactin) - h/o prolactinoma - hyperchol - htn - osteopenia - head drop episodes associated with falls, no EEG correlate ~2x/mo - Father reports h/o SDH [**2156**] s/p evacuation c/b stroke where she had left sided weakness and slurred speech that completely resolved.
VP shunt was revised without improvement.
Physical Exam: Exam upon admission: T: 97.3  80  136/60  18  98% Gen: left occipital covered with dried blood, very tender and no obvious open wound, no active bleeding.
No racoon eyes, no otorrhea/rhinorrhea.
HEENT: PERRL EOMI Neck: on hard collar, difficult to assess neck tenderness due to skull fracture nearby.
Dysarthria but understandable.
VIII: Gross hearing impaired bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: [**2174-9-22**] GLUCOSE-86 UREA N-14 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-17 [**2174-9-22**] CK(CPK)-84 CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2174-9-22**] WBC-21.3*# RBC-5.46* HGB-17.7* HCT-52.0* MCV-95 MCH-32.4* MCHC-34.1 RDW-14.7  PLT COUNT-316 [**2174-9-22**] PT-11.0 PTT-21.8* INR(PT)-0.9 [**2174-9-22**] LACTATE-1.4  Head CT [**9-22**]: There is a new, approximately 1 cm, comminuted and mild depressed left posterior pareital/occiptal skull fracture.
Chronic deformity of the left side of the skull from previous craniotomy is otherwise unchanged.
There is subcutaneous and subgaleal air noted near the fracture site.
A tiny amount of hyperattenuation below the fracture is consistent with a small subdural hemtoma.
The ventricular system is unchanged from prior with mild dilatation.
The other enters the right posterior parietal and has its tip in the third ventricle.
Stable posterior encephalomalacia and dural calcifications are noted.
Bilateral hypodensities within the cerebellum are unchanged from prior.
New comminuted, mildly depressed left posterior parietal/occipital skull fracture with a tiny amount of associated pneumocephalus.
There is small underlying subdural hematoma.
Chronic deformity of the left skull, dural calcifications, appearance of the ventricles and shunt catheters, and encephalomalacia are stable.
There is Gelfoam and mild pneumocephalus seen at the surgical bed.
There is a tiny amount of linear hyperdensity along the surgical bed, likely consistent with minimal amounts of acute hemorrhage.
There is mild effacement of the sulci near the post-surgical bed and effacement of the left lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], likely consistent with post surgical edema.
There is no appreciable shift of normally midline structures when compared to previous exam.
Redemonstrated is the chronic deformity of the left skull consistent with history of previous craniotomy which is otherwise unchanged.
There is stable appearance of the posterior encephalomalacia and bilateral hypodensities within the cerebellum.
Patient is status post cranioplasty with overlying mesh and evidence of mild amount of pneumocephalus.
Postsurgical changes consistent with trace amount of blood products seen at the surgical site and effacement of the sulci in this area consistent with edema.
Effacement of the left lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] without evidence of significant midline shift.
On [**9-24**] she was transferred to the floor and seemed confused and was not at her baseline mental status according to her family.
By [**9-27**] she was back to her baseline mental status and was able to communicate her needs.
She had a video swallow study and was recommended to have thin liquids and ground solids.
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
