Admission Date:  [**2108-12-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-1-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: 32 M with pericarditis (dx 2 days pta) presents with worsening CP with radiation to the back, diaphoresis, N/V nad abd pain.
Bedside U/S by ED showed pericardial effusion with some RV invagination.
He had CTA of Torso which showed effusion and evidence of RHF.
The patient reports having similar symptoms last year when he was diagnosed with pericarditis as well.
He has had 3 prior episodes of similar symptoms, all with diagnosis of pericarditis, but each time the duration of symptoms has increased.
He had multiple episodes of vomiting today.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is significant for chest pain, but absent for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: history of Pericarditis x3  Cardiac Risk Factors: none  Social History: Social history is significant for occasional tobacco and occasional marijuana use.
Family History: There is no family history of pericarditis.
He has a first cousin with a diagnosis of lupus, otherwise no other rheumatological diseases.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.5, BP 118/75 , HR 86, RR 25 , O2 95% on 4L  Pulsus=8 Gen: WDWN athletic appearing black male, in mild to moderate respiratory distress with difficulty speaking in complete sentences.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
no friction rub ausculated Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp were mildly labored and tachypneic.
Abd: mild to moderate tenderness in RUQ/RLQ with voluntary guarding.
tenderness to percussion with some dullness in RUQ.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pericardial fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal/small cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized (1.0-1.5cm) circumferential pericardial effusion without right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse.
IMPRESSION: Small-moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Large pericardial effusion, heterogeneous perfusion of the liver with periportal edema, gallbladder wall edema, enlarged IVC and interval development of ascites (between initial and 20-minute delayed imaging) all suggest impaired venous return to the heart (early tampanade physiology?)
and hepatic congestion.
No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Possible effusive constrictive physiology.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial constriction.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Areas of focal pericardial thickening with circumferential pericardial late-gadolinium enhancement suggestive of pericardial inflammation.
Pericardial tethering on tagged images is consistent with, but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
Mild right and moderate left atrial enlargement.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Findings are consistent with acute on chronic pericarditis with possible pericardial constriction.
Brief Hospital Course: 32 M without significant PMHx with acute pericarditis and tamponade and also has RUQ pain with nausea and vomiting .
# Pericarditis/Tamponade:  The patient was found to have his 4th episode of pericarditis over the last few years.
He has never had a diagnosis of tamponade before this hospitalization.
On admission, the patient had an Echocardiogram that was suggestive of tamponade but he was hemodynamically stable with IV fluids.
Repeat Echo also showed probable tamponade physiology, and the patient was then taken to the cath lab for further evaluation.
He had equalization of pressures, consistent with tamponade, and a pericardial drain was placed with removal of pericardial fluid.
During this hospitalization, a complete workup was done for the cause of the recurrent pericarditis, and now tamponade.
The patient had a slight elevation in his LFTs, but hepatitis serologies were negative.
Rheumatoid factor was slightly elevated, but [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA were both negative with normal C3/C4 levels.
The pericardial fluid was negative by cultures, AFB, and negative for malignant cells on cytology.
At discharge, his symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain had improved and the patient was able to tolerate activity without difficulty.
It showed evidence of pericardial thickening, and likely pericardial constriction which is consistent with his recurrent pericarditis.
# RUQ pain/nausea/vomiting: The patient presented with RUQ pain, slightly elevated LFTs, but negative hepatitis serologies.
The patient had a RUQ ultrasound which showed gall bladder wall edema, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
This was likely due to backflow of venous pressures from the tamponade physiology.
Prior to discharge, the patient's symptoms had improved and he was eating without difficulty.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 10 days.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade Secondary Diagnosis: Pleural Effusion   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile.
Symptoms improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain.
You were found to have inflammation around your heart, and you were found to have fluid around your heart as well.
Your symptoms markedly improved prior to discharge.
