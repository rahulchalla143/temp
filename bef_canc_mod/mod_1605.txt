There are no new intra- or extra-axial foci of hemorrhage.
There is no obvious mass, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Extensive choroid plexus calcifications are present in bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricle.
There is mild periventricular white matter hypoattenuation suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Mild age-appropriate involutional changes are present.
CTA head:  FINDINGS: As seen on the prior non-contrast head CT, there is an area of hemorrhage involving the nodulus of the cerebellar vermis, with extension into some of the folia on the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere medially.
There is no definite focal underlying mass lesion.
There are vessels extending towards this region, including the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery which is larger than the left, as well as a prominent vein extending inferiorly.
There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection or aneurysm.
There is no midline shift.
There is no acute territorial infarct.
Degenerative changes are noted at the atlantoaxial joint space.
IMPRESSION:  Hemorrhage centered in the nodulus of the inferior cerebellar vermis and extending into the subarachnoid space between cerebellar folia.
There is no evidence of an underlying mass lesion.
While there is no definite vascular malformation, there is asymmetry of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries as well as a prominent vein.
MRI brain w/ and w/o [**6-2**]:  IMPRESSION: FLAIR hyperintensity and susceptibility artifact in the inferior cerebellar vermis with extension into some of the folia of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere, most consistent with hemorrhage and correlating to the findings on CT.
There is no definite underlying enhancement or mass lesion, given the limitations detailed above.
While a mass lesion is not identified, the differential diagnosis continues to include a hemorrhagic metastasis or other neoplastic process, an underlying vascular malformation (which includes a cavernous malformation possibly related to a developmental venous anomaly as well as an AVM).
Hypertensive hemorrhage and post-traumatic hemorrhage are considered much less likely given the location.
EKG [**6-1**]:  Normal sinus rhythm with frequent and grouped ventricular premature beats.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
ECHO [**6-4**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction with increased PCWP.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Increased pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
CXR [**6-1**]:  FINDINGS: Lung volumes are markedly diminished.
There is engorgement of the vascular pedicle with cephalization and mild vascular indistinctness.
Hazy opacity at the lung bases is presumed atelectasis, although an element of edema may be present.
There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No definite effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine and in the left shoulder.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema, presumed cardiogenic in etiology.
If incongruent with clinical presentation, consider PA and lateral views for more sensitive evaluation.
Course while on neurosurgery:  "His initial head CT revealed a 1 cm cerebellar hemorrhage.
He also had a CTA which was negative for aneurysm or AVM.
In the afternoon he did have some periods of dysarthria but remained alert and oriented.
Neurology service course:  79 yo man with hx of EtOH abuse, HTN, HL, DM who presented with acute onste of dysequilibrium, nausea, emesis and imbalance and was found to have a homorrhage in  nodulus of the inferior cerebellar vermis and extending into the subarachnoid space between cerebellar folia, measuring 1 x 0.8cm.
NEURO:  He underwent a CTA to r/o underlying which showed no vascular anomaly no definite vascular malformation, there was asymmetry of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries as well as a prominent vein.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast showed no definitive evidence of an underlying lesion and ddx included a cavernous malformation possibly related to a developmental venous anomaly as well as an AVM in a setting of a quantitative and qualitative platelet d/o of chronic liver disease (see below).
CV/PULM:  While hospitalized he was found to have acute pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation at OSH and on neurosurgery service.
He underwent an ECHOcardiogram showing diastolic dysfunction and restrictive disease.
There were no focal areas of hypokinesis.
It is possible that this is related to an underlying autoimmune process (psoriatic arthritis).
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at [**Hospital **] Medical Center, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106895**], thrombocytopenia is a chronic issue in setting of chronic liver failure (evidence by synthetic liver function tests at [**Hospital1 18**] as well).
Given these findings it is possible that the underlying liver dysfunction is due to either alcholol related cirrhosis vs. fetly's syndrome in setting of autoimmune disease.
Speech mildly dysarthric.
CNs notable: Bilateral lateral gaze nystagmus with saccadic intrusions.
Vertical non-fatiguing nystagmus on supeior gaze but not inferior gaze.
Motor - full, distally limited by MSK deformities due to RA type malformations (?
psoriatic arthritis given psoriasis patch on RUE).
with retropulsion and falling forward on standing even with eyes open.
You were found to have a bleed in your cerebellum (a part of your brain).
The most likely cause for your bleed was due to a vascular abnormality in that part of your brain in a setting of having low and poorly functional platelets due to your history of acholism.
Although unlikely, it is difficult to rule out an underlying neoplasm at that location at this time.
