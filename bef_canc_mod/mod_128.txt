Pain is better today.
Thought to be musculoskeletal with possible GI component.
As for episode of hematemesis.
Has chronic anemia, but recent admission his hgb was lower than baseline ([**7-20**]) to 6.5, hemeoccult neg, no obvious bleeding, got 2U.
This admission, initially no GI complaints other than chest pain.
No melena, no further hematemesis.
Over past couple days, has c/o intermitted periumbilical/epigastric pain, but that has also resolved by time of transfer to floor.
EGD at that time showed some gastritis in the antrum.
Also, while in ER, initially CXR with possible RLL PNA, started on levaquin, no fevers/white count/cough.

Echo: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF =30-35%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
These findings are suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT AND PLAN: 84year old male with a history of NICM and chronic HF, CKD stage IV, DM on insulin, afib off coumadin, gastritis, admitted to MICU [**7-12**] with chest pain and hematemesis, transfered to Gen Med [**7-14**].
Underwent EGD, revealing gastritis, no further bleeding.
Echo repeated, EF 35%, PE c/w volume overload still, pt asymptomatic for low BP, thus meds reintroduced.
hematemesis in ED and NGL with old blood, but hgb here has been stable.
No further bleeding.
-EGD with gastritis c friable mucosa/erosions, no ulcers.
Bx for H.pylori sent (note, neg serologies in past) -will place on on protonix [**Hospital1 **] X4weeks, then back to qd -appreciate GI recs, also started on carafate -should be on EC [**Hospital1 **], no NSAIDs .
Chronic heart failure: NICM, systolic HF EF 45% 12/07, also has diastolic dysfunction.
Currently appears euvolemic to slightly hypervolemi (though has slight crackles, elevated jvd, elevated BNP).
Echo repeated [**7-16**] showing global drop in EF 35% (was 45% 12/07, 35% 6/07).
-Also of note, echo suggestive of infiltrative process such as amyloidosis, which can be seen in CKD patients.
However, not sure if further w/u would be of any significancea at this age.
Periumbilical pain/epigastric pain: LFTs with elevated alk phos and lipase.
Reproducible and ?GI related vs volume related.
Atrial fibrillation - Rate well-controlled off coreg currenlty.
- unclear whether coumadin has been addressed but not issue currently in setting of erosive gastritis.
EC [**Hospital1 **] on discharge until f/u PCP or cards .
Right-upper lobe opacity - Persistent from [**2109-4-21**].
Urinary incontinence - Continue imipramine, though has not helped, will discuss with PCP.
