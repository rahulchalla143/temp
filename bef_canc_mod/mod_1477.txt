HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, status post pacemaker placement, history of seizure disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and numerous surgeries for his upper airway, who presented with hypoxia leading to generalized tonoclonic seizure.
The patient has a history of tracheal stenosis malacia resulting from prolonged intubation between [**12-19**] through [**2122-3-3**] and placement of tracheostomy after triple layer repair complicated by grafting section and revisions.
In [**2122-11-1**] the patient was found to have tracheal carcinoma in-situ and underwent multiple bronchoscopies with dilation and laser resection, as well as bronchial stent placements.
On the day of the admission, the patient presented with respiratory failure.
Per wife, the patient had identical episode two months ago in which he fell badly, had lied down in bed and began gasping for air and turning [**Doctor Last Name 352**].
The patient's wife could not report outcome of that episode with diagnosis or intervention.
The patient was brought to Emergency Room where he was found to be more alert, able to follow commands, however, dysarthric, seen by Pulmonary consult fellow who recommended transfer to Operating Room for rigid bronchoscopy.
While awaiting Operating Room, the patient had weakness generalized tonoclonic seizure.
The patient has history of seizure disorder but most recent seizure was numerous years ago.
During the surgical exploration, the patient had episode of desaturation to 30% despite ventilation which lead to removal of the ET and T-tube and placement of tracheostomy.
Tracheal stenosis/malacia after prolonged intubation after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with complicated postop course including graft infection and revision.
Further dynamic therapy for tracheal carcinoma in-situ of the right tracheal wall in [**2122-11-1**].
Tracheal and left main stent placements in [**2123-9-1**] complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
History of congestive heart failure with ejection fractions of 45%.
Obstructive sleep apnea, currently not on biPAP.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of seizure disorder status post head trauma, prior to this admission last seizure was many years ago.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
History of pseudomonal sepsis.
History of Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Deep vein thrombosis of the right axillary.
History of C. diff colitis.
History of right pneumothorax requiring chest tube.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck was supple with no jugular venous distention, no left anterior descending.
Lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Examination was significant secondary to breath sounds.
There was no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed no edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 65 year old gentleman with extensive past medical history currently with bronchial stents and tracheotomy who presented with respiratory failure complicated by seizure.
It was unclear if that episode presented a seizure or vasovagal episode during sectioning.
The patient's Dilantin level was monitored and was slightly subtherapeutic leading to his Dilantin level to final dose of 500 mg q.d.
He underwent an EEG which showed diffuse slowing more on the right than on the left.
The patient initially persisted with high oxygen requirement, was febrile with productive cough and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Once the sputum culture grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus the patient was changed to Vancomycin.
Because patient persisted with diffuse pulmonary effusions on his chest x-ray he was also started on Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
During this hospitalization, the patient did have an episode of transient decrease in his blood pressure to systolic of 70.
It was thought to be secondary to dehydration from a combination of diarrhea and Lasix.
With fluid administration, the patient's hypertension has resolved and his blood pressure remained stable.
