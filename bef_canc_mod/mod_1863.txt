She is [**Month/Day/Year 3584**] and oriented x3 with slight changes in her memory, but this issue was resolved by [**Month (only) **].
She did have an episode on [**2111-6-20**] at night of acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis and she looked very sick, very tachypneic.
Electrocardiogram showed a question of mild J-point elevation in V2-V3 of 2 mm.
Lung exam revealed poor air movement, wheezes, decreased breath sounds throughout.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and by 3:20 a.m. gas was 7.21, 60, 71 and then by 4:50 a.m. it was improved to 7.23, 56, 119.
The patient was also ruled out for myocardial infarction.
The actual cause of this acute decompensation was not fully known, probably a combination between congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare since it improved with nebulizers and Lasix, not clear which one, but we do not think she had another cardiac event.
PULMONARY:  For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we continued her metered dose inhalers and after this one night, she continued to do well.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She is on antiretrovirals for human immunodeficiency virus, Bactrim prophylaxis.
Her sugars were high and we are continuing to watch and will ask nutrition for help on a good nutrition supplement for a diabetic.
She was started on captopril on [**2111-6-24**], 25 [**Hospital1 **] for renal protection because of her renal failure and probable diabetic etiology for this renal failure.
