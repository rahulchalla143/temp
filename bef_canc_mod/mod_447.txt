A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Reference Range:  No antibody detected.
Negative results do not rule out B. burgdorferi infection.
Patients       in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may not produce       detectable levels of antibody.
Patients with clinical history and/or       symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in [**3-12**] weeks.

Median sternotomy wires, coronary artery vascular clips and the dual chamber pacemaker are unchanged in position since [**2166-3-22**].
Lung volumes are low, vascular crowding on this radiograph may be accounted for by low lung volumes.
There is no evidence of acute consolidation, edema or atelectasis.
The tip of the nasogastric tube is not included in the field of view of this radiograph but appears to descend well below the gastroesophageal junction  CTA CHEST [**2167-7-4**]: 1.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Dense left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
15 x 7 mm left thyroid nodule.
Scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and hilar nodes, increased in size since [**2166-3-22**], likely reactive.
No evidence of aneurysm, flow-limiting stenosis, or acute intracranial process.
[**2167-7-13**] HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST: No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
If there is a high clinical concern for infarct, an MRI should be considered  [**2167-7-14**] VIDEO SWALLOW: FINDINGS: Barium passed readily through the oropharynx into esophagus without evidence of obstruction with slow oral phase.
There was no aspiration or penetration with administered preparations.
IMPRESSION: No aspiration or penetration.
Brief Hospital Course: ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, ENCEPHALITIS: based on LP results, the patient likely had viral encephalitis.
He had a negative HSV PCR and negative VZV studies, however given vesicular rash on his face per ID consult this likely was VZV.
EEG without any seizures, CTA of the head without any acute abnormalities (MRI could not be performed given pacemaker).
The patient suffered acute kidney injury and ventilator associated PNA as complications of this (see below).
He lacked motivation likely related to the ongoing delerium and needed much encouragement with meals and with interaction, physical therapy and occupational therapy.
BIPOLAR DISORDER: lithium, prozac and buspar continued.
No active issues.
17. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with encephalitis and also developed pneumonia.
