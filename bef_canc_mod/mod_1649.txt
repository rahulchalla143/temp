He was running up a [**Doctor Last Name **] to catch at bus at 3:30 on [**2117-12-24**], when he noted some substernal nonradiating, pleuritic chest pain, which lasted 10 minutes, and then resolved with rest.
He then had a reoccurance of this same pain at 7:30 PM, and a friend with him noted him to be pale and diaphoretic, and so he was brought to [**Hospital1 **]-N ER.
He was noted to have some TWI on his EKG, but notably had a tropinin of 0.075, and so got a total of 325 mg ASA and was started on a heparin gtt.
He has no prior history of CAD, and has never had chest pain like this before.
On the morning of [**2117-12-25**], pt had several recurrences of chest pain, relieved with SL nitro.
His pain, however, continued to worsen and repeat EKG showed new ST elevations in II, III, avF.
Cardiac catheterization showed thrombus in RPL branch, CTO of the RPDA.
He reports that he has no prior history of CAD, and has never had chest pain like this before.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - ADD - L sided weakness from mild anoxia at birth - Only has a R sided kidney  Social History: - Tobacco history: denies - ETOH: quite > 1 year ago, previous drank approx 10 ETOH/ week - Illicit drugs: denies  Family History: - No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
PTCA of  vessel distal RCA and RPL branch followed by deployment of a 3.0 x 18 and a 3.0 x 8 mm Promus drug-eluting stents, reducing a 99% stenosis to 0% residual stenosis.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CXR PA and Lateral [**2117-12-28**]: FINDINGS: No previous images.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
No definite focal pneumonia.
On the lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased opacification at the base in the retrocardiac region.
This may well represent only crowding of vessels and mild atelectasis.

Active Diagnoses: # STEMI: Patient is obese, has hyperlipidemia, and had some classic signs of MI on presentation (chest pain at rest, diaphoresis) with continued rise in troponins.
He was also placed on a nitro drip for pain control.
He was taken urgently to cath [**12-25**] elevations in inferior leads.
Has found to have tight stenosis in RPL, CTO of the RPDA.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not have recurrence of chest pain after the procedure.
He was started on levofloxacin and will continue on discharge for 1 week course given questionable infiltrate on CXR which is concerning for pneumonia.
He was afebrile at the time of discharge.
# Mild tranaminitis: No abdominal pain to suggest acute etiology, has had elevated ALT in past but not elevated AST, most recently checked [**2117-11-19**].
Hep serologies negative for acute infection.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
2.1-cm hypoechoic region in left lobe of liver is favored to represent focal fatty sparing, although a solid liver nodule cannot be excluded.
Fundal adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder without evidence of gallstones.
6. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as directed as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 9. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q 8H (Every 8 Hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation myocardial infarction Possible pneumonia Dyslipidemia Transaminitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had chest pain and a heart attack.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for a cardiac catheterization which showed a clot and blockage in one of your heart arteries on the right side.
You will have some nitroglycerin to use at home if you have any further chest pain at home.
If you still have chest pain after 2 tablets, call 911.
You had some fevers that we think may be due to a pneumonia and you will be on antibiotics for one week to treat this.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29026**] if you develop fevers again and take tylenol for any fever or achiness at home.
START taking nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or the heartline if you have any chest pain at all.
