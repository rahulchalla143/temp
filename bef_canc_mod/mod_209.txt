Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: WBC 4.3 Hb 10.9 Hct 31.8 Plts 219  141  107  19  99   AGap=15 3.8  23  1.2  PT: 13.0  PTT: 29.3  INR: 1.1  ECG: NSR Rate 74 NANI LVH TWI II,III, AVF V4-V6  Rads: [**7-25**] GI Bleed study: Active GI Bleed in the right lower quadrant, likely cecum.
[**7-27**] CTA Abdomen + Pelvis: No source for active bleeding localized.
Colonic diverticulosis.
[**2181-8-2**] 04:15AM BLOOD WBC-5.1 RBC-3.26* Hgb-10.3* Hct-30.1* MCV-92 MCH-31.5 MCHC-34.1 RDW-15.7* Plt Ct-295  Brief Hospital Course: 75M with hx of prostate CA, CAD s/p BMS x3 in [**11-29**], chronic systolic CHF here with two days of BRBPR that was admitted with a large acute LGIB thought to be diverticular in etiology.
On day 3 while being prepped for colonoscopy the pt had an acute GIB and was brought to the unit.
As above, ultimately, the source was found to be a solitary cecal bleed found by a tagged RBC scan.
He was treated with blood transfusions, and ultimately IR deployed 2 coils to a branch of the ileocolic artery.
His bleeding stopped after this procedure, but upon tranfer to the general medicine service on the evening of [**2181-7-26**] he again began to have hematochezia.
He underwent a CTA on [**2181-7-27**] that showed no evidence of extravasation.
Follow-up colonoscopy to assess for source of persistent bleeding was was planned for [**2181-7-31**].
Colonoscopy did not show any active bleeding or any source of bleeding but revealed diffuse diverticulosis L>R.
# CAD: s/p two DES in [**2180-11-20**].
After IR embolization procedure, pt was tachycardic and hypertensive for a brief period of time, EKG was performed with ST-depressions in V3-4, which was felt to be demand ischemia in the setting of low HCT (trop 0.03, 0.04, 0.06).
He was transfused again to a goal of 28-30 (in the setting of possible ischemia) with resolution of his EKG findings.
Follow-up EKG showed stable TWI in III, aVF, V4-V6, no ST segment elevation, cardiac enzymes: CK-MG negative x2, trop 0.06 x3.
Pt denied chest pain on day of discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The pt did not have CP throughout his admission.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: EF 35%.
His antihypertensives (beta blockers, [**Last Name (un) **]) were both held early on during his admission given his hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
When he began bleeding again and was transferred back to the ICU, his Metoprolol was held and his Carvedilol was continued.
Nitrostat 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1)  Sublingual once a day as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnsosis -Acute Blood Loss Anemia Secondary to Diverticular Blled -Coronary Artery Disease -Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
It was felt that this was most likely due to a diverticular bleed.
