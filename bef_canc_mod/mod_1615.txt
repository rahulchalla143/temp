History of Present Illness: The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and hypokalemia with multiple past admissions for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypokalemia who was admitted for severe electrolyte disturbances.
The patient states that she felt some cramping in her hands and legs while gardening.
She initially felt a pins and needles sensation that progressed to spasms, particularly in both of her hands.
She became concerned and came to the ED for evaluation.
Hepatitis C with undetectable viral load.
Endometrial hyperplasia; status post total abdominal hysterectomy in [**2170**].
History of a liver lesion.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of hypokalemia attributed intermittently to alcohol, gastritis, poor oral intake - resulting in multiple admissions.
Chronic intermittent diarrhea.
Chronic lower extremity neuropathic pain.
History of pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in [**2158**].
Possible history of purging behavior with a history of self-induced vomiting.

It was also thought that she may have a degree of "beer-drinking hyponatremia."
Over the course of her hospitalization, her serum sodium began to normalize (119 on admission to 125 to 130-132) with progressive hydration.
2.Hypokalemia: Again, the etiology of her hypokalemia was uncertain.
She does, however, have a past history significant for chronic diarrhea which is likely a contributing factor, although not the main cause.
has had an extensive workup including GI and renal consults in the past.
The patient's presenting symptom of muscle cramping was most likely a result of this electrolyte disturbance.
3.Hypocalcemia: She was given calcium gluconate for repletion.
Therefore, the calcium values can be regarded as accurate, not requiring correction for hypoalbuminemia.
4.Hypomagnesemia:  Again, the etiology of hypomagnesemia in this patient is not entirely clear.
Possible etiologies include GI losses or alcohol-induced renal tubular dysfunction.
5.Increased CK:  This was felt to be likely due to a small degree of muscle breakdown secondary to the cramping that the patient was experiencing prior to admisssion.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled nevertheless and she did rule out for MI on this basis.
She was on CIWA scale with prn benzodiazipines ordered, but at no time did the patient appear to have withdrawal symtoms.
If you experience any concerning symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramping, chest pain or seizures, please call your primary care physician or come to the ED for evaluation.
