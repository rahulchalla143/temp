Chest: clear with few end expiratory crackles Heart: RRR, S1 S2, loud holosystolic murmur at apex Abdomen: thin, soft, NT/ND +BS Back: (limited) no CVA tenderness; +TTP low thoracic and lumbar spine Extrem: thin, warm.
Elbow Xray ([**2187-9-6**]): Cortical irregularity at the medial aspect of the coracoid process, suspicious for a non-displaced fracture in the appropriate clinical setting.
Please correlate with focal tenderness in this area.
Stable, bilateral pleural effusions moderate to large on the right and moderate on the left with bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
CT head ([**2187-9-6**]) : 1) No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2) Subcutaneous soft tissue hematoma along the frontal scalp anteriorly on the left.
3) Small amount of subcutaneous air within the scalp along the right temporal bone.
No dilated loops of large or small bowel are seen.

No abnormal pleural enhancement or suggestion of pleural disease.
Multifocal sclerotic lesions within the bones.
Differential diagnosis includes calcified hemangiomas, perhaps related to underlying renal disease; however, osteoblastic metastatic lesions cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course:  74 year old male with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, afib, no history of diabetes; presents to ED with back pain and hypoglycemia to 26, transferred to MICU for hypotension/hypothermia, he was transferred to the medical floor on [**2187-9-8**] and signed out against medical advice on [**2187-9-9**].
Originally presumed and treated as septic shock  given hypothermia and hypoglycemia.
There was no explanation for initial hypotension.
Heart failure was unlikely given clinical exam, no chest pain, sob, or EKG changes.
Hypothermia - Infectious workup begun in the MICU.
Concern was for sepsis, though patient was without fevers in the MICU.
Patient did have sources of infection with right heel ulcer, left elbow effusion and pleural effusion.
On the night of [**2187-9-8**], one blood culture grew out gram + cocci.
Vancomycin could not be started given history of red man syndrome.
He was told about his likely blood infection and the possibility of sepsis and death.
Differential diagnosis included prostate cancer, early-onset diabetes, insulinoma.
Pleural effusions: Patient with bilateral, chronic effusions.
Etiology was unclear, diagnostic pleural tap was being considered but patient signed out AMA before tap could be done.
Pancytopenia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by heme/onc who felt pancytopenia likely represented sepsis vs medications vs prostate ca.
Anemia is at baseline, and is attributed to CKD.
Prostate enlargement: PSA elevated to 40.1, followed by urology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**], has firm prostate on admission exam, will need CT ABD/PELVIS and bone scan per email from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11189**].
CT TORSO performed to evaluate for metastatic prostate ca, which found evidence of extensive sclerotic lesions in the bone.
Elevated INR - Patient was given vitamin K for elevated INR.
Back pain: Patient complaining of back pain on admission.
