Previous to this had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-23**] after being treated for a foot infection following a TMA revision surgery of the left foot.

She denies chest pain.

Pertinent Results: Lower Extremity Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT bilaterally  [**7-28**] portable CXR: Left basilar opacity likely representing pneumonia.
[**7-29**] portable CXR: Increase caliber of the mediastinum is probably due to progressive venous engorgement, accompanied by lower lung volumes and probable increase in vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, all point to cardiac decompensation.
No pneumothorax.
portable abdomen [**7-28**]: No evidence of obstruction.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-4-7**], no resting LVOT  gradient is identified on the current study.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no pericardial effusion.

ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2135-8-3**]):    NO GROWTH  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49 year old female s/p recent TMA revision being treated with antibiotics for lower extremity ulcer and then developed hypotension and hyperglycemia, with a finding of LLL opacity on CXR.
A chest xray performed showed a left lower lobe infiltrate which was characterized later as most likely being atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
When the patient was admitted, she had what looked like a cellulitis of her left lower extremity.
She responsed well to treatment and at discharge she was afebrile with normal blood pressures.
An echo performed during her hospital admission did not reveal any signs of endocarditis.
Anemia- Patient's anemia is most consistent with anemia of chronic disease based on her labwork (see labs).
ARF- The acute renal failure was likely due to her hypotension and hypoperfusion.
She was given IV fluids at admission with correction of both her hypotension and her creatinine.
Hypoalbuminemia- This was likely due to her poor nutritional state.
She will follow with her PCP regarding improvement in glucose control which will also help with her foot infections.
We sent Heparin Dependent Antibodies since the patient was maintained on heparin due to her inability to ambulate.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H:PRN as needed for fever or pain.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID:PRN as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary to left lower extremity cellulitis  Secondary Diagnosis: Peripheral Vascular Disease Ulcerative colitis   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of a low blood pressure.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have: fevers, chills, worsening pain, shortness of breath, change in mental status, redness or discharge from foot wound.
