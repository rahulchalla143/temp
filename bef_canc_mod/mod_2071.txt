Pertinent Results: Chest CT [**8-28**] Final Report REASON FOR EXAM: 61-year-old man with complicated medical history including stroke, neurogenic bladder status post suprapelvic cath, lymphoma, SLE who presented with fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
No prior exam for comparison.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are associated with peribronchial ground-glass opacity and alveolar consolidation in right upper lobe and both lower lobes, consistent with multifocal pneumonia or aspiration, mostly in dependent regions.
Mediastinum is shifted to the right associated with pleural fat thickening without calcification, could be due to noncalcified fibrothorax.
Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, the most prominent in the subcarinal region measures 4 mm.
Right subclavian lymph node measures 7 mm and multiple axillary lymph nodes are not enlarged.
The pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged up to 3.1 cm.
Bilateral gynecomastia is symmetrical.
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note gastric distention and a normal-sized spleen.
Lucent well-defined 19 x 9 mm left clavicular bony lesion has sclerotic borders, presumably benign.
Small bilateral pleural effusion associated with peribronchial ground- glass opacity and alveolar consolidation in right upper lobe and both lower lobes consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus aspiration.
Right pleural fat thickening with shift of the mediastinum to the right consistent with noncalcified fibrothorax.
Bilateral gynecomastia.
Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Gastric distention with thickening of the anterior wall of the stomach up to 25 x 22 mm.
Giving the knowp prior diagnosis of MALT lymphoma, endoscopy with further evaluation of the stomach is recommended.
Well-defined clavicular lesion with sclerotic borders, could be fibrous dysplasia.
