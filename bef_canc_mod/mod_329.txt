He denies any blood or coffee grounds in his vomtius.
He vomits food or gastric contents.
He has no blood in the stools, and no black stools.
He has had intermittent right lower quadrant "crampy" pain, but is not sure of the association of this with the vomiting or bowel movements.
His partner notes that he is becoming weaker, and has to rest after walking only a few feet because he's "tired."
He denies any shortness of breath.
He has a multi-resistant  virus, due to serial monotherapy in the early [**2142**]'s and some  adherence problems thereafter.
Invasive Squamous Cell carcinoma of the Anorectal Canal: In early [**4-/2157**] had BRBPR.
Colonscopy [**2157-5-10**] showed 8 mm sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon,and a fugating 3.5 cm mass just above the anal verge.
The biopsies of both lesions revealed focally invasive squamous cell  carcinoma.
He had a complicated course since the tumor was necrotic,  infected, and obstructing the rectal canal.
He needed a diverting  colonoscopy to be placed, and had two admissions for fevers due  to infection of the tumor.
He had been on a regimen of Actos and glyburide,  but has had medications withdrawn since marked weight loss during  the chemo-radiation therapy.
Remote EtOH abuse:He has a history of ethanol abuse, but this has been inremission for over 10 years.
Lung Nodule: He has a calcified pulmonary nodule on a chest X ray in 11/93.His sister had tuberculosis, but he had minimal exposure to her.
Syphilis: He has a history of syphilis in the late [**2132**]'s and does not recall what therapy he received.
Normal ETT MIBI: In [**9-/2154**], he had a CT Scan of his heart (as part of a study)that revealed extensive calcifications of his coronary arteries.He, therefore, had an exercise thallium study that revealed an EF of 62% and no perfusion defects at a 111% predicted heart rate.
Initial CT scan showed ground glass opacities.
He had some cosmetic surgery at the age of 18 to correct a scar on his head sustained in some childhood head trauma.
Physical Exam: T 97.7 BP 106/60 HR 83 20 97%RA Gen: Chronically ill appearing male in no respiratory distress HEENT: Moderate facial wasting.
Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilateally, no wheezes, rhonchi or rales Cor: Regular rate, nl s1 and s2, II/VI systolic murmur at the LSB.
Ext: There is no clubbing or edema.
Rectal: 2cm opening with white fluid at prximal edge of flap, no tenderness, no surrounding erythema.
No fluctuance.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 73 yo male with AIDS, DM2, invasive carcinoma of the anorectal canal s/p resection and diverting colostomy [**11-12**] presented with vomiting and and intermittent RLQ pain.
He was diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction until [**2-27**], when his symptoms failed to resolve and a CT scan showed a transition point.
He was taken to the operating room and underwent extensive lysis of adhesions and a biopsy of a small bowel mass.
The operation was made much more challenging by the existence of radiation changes in his pelvis after treatment for anal cancer.
On [**3-30**], he developed gross hematuria, and a Urology consult recommended a cystoscopy.
His surgery on [**4-5**] consisted of an ex lap and construction of an ileocolic bypass.
Cystopscopy revealed only small clot and expected inflammatory changes.
He continued TPN, and continued to have high NGT outputs.
Although his ostomy output continued to be negligible, the tissue itself was viable, and there was no indication of frank obstruction.
A repeat small-bowel follow through on [**4-18**] was negative for obstruction, and in fact the contrast could be seen freely passing from the ostomy site.
Initially the cloudiness was concerning for a colovesical fistula, but a sterile urinalysis and subsequent clearing of the urine argue definitively against this.
By [**4-19**] there was some return of bowel function, with evidence and gas and liquid contents in the ostomy bag, and his NGT was discontinued.
The pt experienced no nausea subsequently.
At all times he should try to support himself with food intake, unless his abdominal symptoms return.
