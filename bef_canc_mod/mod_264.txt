Denies increased sputum production but endorses small amount of blood-tinged sputum for past four days.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated blood in the left airways, which only partially cleared with irrigation.
He denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
No orthopnea or PND.
No abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation.
No burning with urination or change in urine color.
No blood in urine.
No lower leg edema.
Past Medical History: RUL NSLC s/p cyberknife treatment [**9-26**] interstitial lung disease emphysema CKD, baseline Cr.

He has significant asbestos exposure due to his factory work with rubber.

There is interval increase in the interstitial markings seen throughout the left mid and lower zones, more pronounced since the prior examination.
The appearances in the left lung may represent infectious etiology vs. a less likely possibility of a rapid progression of interstitial lung disease.
A CT chest would be helpful for further evaluation.
Chest CT ([**8-30**]): Since [**2147-5-6**] and [**2147-7-4**] diffuse ground-glass opacity and intralobular reticulations throughout the left lung and right upper lobe is new; the profusion is much less in the right lower lobe with relative sparing of subpleural parenchyma.
Longstanding fibrotic interstitial lung disease, mostly on the right and mostly in right lower lobe is otherwise unchanged.
New diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe, less in the right lower lobe could be due to [**Year (4 digits) **], diffuse infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
If the prior interstitial lung disease was due to asbestos, this is not the expected course of that disease.
Right perihilar radiation fibrosis 3.
Prior granulomatous exposure.
Improvement of left lung ground-glass and reticulation, not yet back to baseline of [**2147-7-4**].
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o man with known interstitial lung disease and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia.
# Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease with baseline oxygen requirement though clearly he is much worse than baseline.
Differential initially included infection (bacterial, including PCP or [**Name9 (PRE) 10540**], viral, or fungal); congestive heart failure; vasculitis (pulmonary-renal syndromes such as Wegener's or Goodpasture's versus pulmonary syndromes such as lupus or Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**]).
Other considerations included BOOP/COP, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Less likely was an acute worsening of underlying lung disease as that would be atypical for UIP.
Elevated LDH in setting of chronic steroid use without PCP prophylaxis was certainly concerning for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] visible on BAL was concerning for diffuse alveolar damage.
High resolution chest CT scan demonstrated new, diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe, less in the right lower lobe.
These findings were thought to be due to [**Name10 (NameIs) **], diffuse infection, or acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
[**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, legionella urinary antigen, BAL for AFB and PCP DFA were negative, negative beta-glucan and galactomanan.
CBC differential failed to demonstrate a peripheral eosinophilia.
He continued to desat to the low 80s with minimal movement.
# Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had distended bladder evident on examination.
A foley was placed and kept in place at the patient's request and because of his frequent desats with minimal movement.
He voided 300cc without difficulty.
On [**9-4**], he developed hyperkalemia to 6.1 which was responsive to kayexelate in the setting of bactrim use and CKD.
# Hypertension: As the patient remained normotensive, his HCTZ was held.
Azathioprine 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Pulmonary vasculitis.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
