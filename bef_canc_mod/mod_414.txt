Transthoracic Cardiac Echo [**2129-1-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferolateral wall.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-7-2**], a mild left ventricular wall motion abnormality is now apparent and the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse.
The severity of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Mild pulmonary edema is still present.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Neither of the frontal nor the lateral radiographs show evidence of pleural effusion.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo woman with a h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, HTN, HLP, moderate AS (valve area 1.0-1.2, gradient 55), moderate MR, ischemic colitis with LGIB who presents with acute dyspnea and respiratory failure in setting of URI.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This was thought to be secondary to acute on chronic heart failure secondary to worsening valve disease and likely triggered by an respiratory infection (question URI vs PNA?).
She was initially admitted to the ICU where she improved after positive pressure ventilation and some diuresis.
Therefore she underwent several days of diuresis until she was able to ambulate without desaturating and was able to go home with physical therapy.
She was also to follow up with her outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for continued management of her congestive heart failure.
# Guiac positive stool with melena: We considered GI bleed in the setting of a pt with h/o GI bleed and receiving sub C heparin.
We continued Pantoprazole 40mg PO BID and an active type and screen was maintained.
# Probable coronary artery disease: This was evidenced by a new focal wall motion defect op echo.
-Continued statin at 40mg PO Daily -Held off on Aspirin given recent GI bleed and hematuria.
- Continued beta-blocker .
Hematuria remained for several days requiring CBI.
Pt was to f/u for an outpatient [**Last Name (STitle) **] evaluation for cystoscopy .
# Hypertension: continued BB and ACE.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with pt, and left a message with HCP.
Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg (65 mg Iron) Capsule, Sustained Release Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sustained Release PO once a day: 2 Tablet(s) by mouth once per day as needed for take with [**Location (un) 2452**] juice or vitamin c .
)(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Acute on chronic congestive heart failure secondary to worsening valvular disease 2) Mitral regurgitation 3) Aortic stenosis 4) Community acquired pneumonia 5) Respiratory failure 6) Hematuria   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**].
You were admitted to the hospital because of respiratory failure.
The cause of your respiratory failure was thought to be congestive heart failure (excess fluid in the lungs) secondary to a respiratory infection and worsening heart valve disease (the cause of your murmurs).
You were given Lasix (water pills) to remove the excess fluid in your lungs and your breathing and oxygenation improved.
