Admission Date:  [**2197-9-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-4-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia and tachycardia post-procedure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: video swallow/barium swallow   History of Present Illness: This is a 68 year old man with esophageal cancer s/p 5 courses of 5FU/Cisplatin and radiotherapy with course complicated by neutropenic fever, who presented to IP on the day of admission for planned removal of a tracheal stent.
Unfortunately, during the procedure the IP team noted necrotic tissue above the proximal edge of the stent as well as granulation vs tumor on the distal end of the stent that nearly obstructed the airway.
The lower mass was debrided and afterward pt had new O2 requirement (satting low 90's on room air) and was newly w/ sinus tachycardia to the 120s.
He denied symptoms and felt fine but given concern of complication he was admitted for observation overnight (plan had been  to go back to rehab after procedure).
On arrival to the floor the patient is denying any acute issues particularly denying chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
He is slightly annoyed to be readmitted as he feels there have been worries about a similar need for oxygen several times and it goes away on his own.
Review of Systems: Positive per HPI also positive for cough and thick secretions (chronic) Notably negative for dyspnea, chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (pt reports resolved) Otherwise full review of systems negative for pertinent symptoms.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: [**2197-3-21**] CT chest and discovery of mass [**2197-3-23**] Head MRI: no evidence of metastatic disease.
[**2197-3-23**] PET: left mediastinal mass with avid FDG uptake, no definitive metastatic disease.
[**2197-3-27**]: Upper esophageal mucosal biopsy: gastric type mucosa consistent with heterotrophic gastric tissue.
Cell block showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.
[**2197-4-13**]: left portacath, open G-tube, tracheal stent replacement by thoracic surgery.
[**2197-6-4**] Pt admitted for aspiration pneumonia with hypoxia.
Social History: Was a small business owner.
No history of illicits.
Physical Exam: VS:  T 100.3, BP 110/92,  P 120's,  RR 20,  O2 90% on 4L Appearance: Very thin and slightly disheveled middle aged man in NAD Eyes: EOMI, Conjunctiva Clear ENT: Moist, no ulcers or erythema CV: Regular, tachycardic, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops/ no lower extremity edema; port in left chest is accessed; no JVP elevation appreciated Respiratory: Breathing comfortably without distress or accessory muscle use, bilateral soft rales throughout the lung fields with excellent air movement; no wheezing or rhonchi.
GI: Soft, Nontender, Non-distended, Bowel Sounds positive, no hepomegaly or splenomegaly appreciated; +PEG MSK: Globally diminished bulk, No cyanosis, No clubbing,  No joint swelling Neuro: CNII-XII intact, Normal attention, Fluent speech Integument:  Warm, Dry, diffuse, confluent erythematous rash on back Psychiatric: Slightly confrontational and odd affect, somewhat jovial at disagreeing with examiner Hematologic / Lymphatic: No Cervical [**Doctor First Name **], Thyroid WNL   Pertinent Results: CXR [**9-19**]=IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of previously identified bilateral basalparenchymal infiltrates as seen on chest examination of [**2197-8-15**].
New parenchymal infiltrates mostly occupying the right upper lobe are seen and may be related to recent performed removal of tracheal stent.
No pneumothorax is identified on either side.
CXR [**9-21**]: Multifocal lung consolidations consistent with multifocal pneumonia and aspiration are stable in the right upper lobe, worsened in the right lobe, and improved in the left lower lobe.
There is no evident pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
[**9-22**] The extensive progression of multifocal consolidation in both right upper, right lower, and left lower lobe.
Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Video swallow [**9-20**]-IMPRESSION: Marked aspiration and penetration of multiple consistencies of barium including ice chips, thin liquids, and nectar thick liquids.
No evidence of marked esophageal obstruction.
Atrial premature beats are not seen on the current tracing.
pathology [**9-18**]-DIAGNOSIS:  Tracheal mass, endobronchial biopsy: Extensive squamous metaplasia with granulation tissue and subepithelial fibrosis, see note.
Note:  The biopsy specimen shows squamous metaplasia with polypoid growth and extension into subepithelial salivary gland ducts.
The underlying stroma demonstrates fibrosis with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
Although some areas show pronounced cytologic atypia, they most likely represent reactive epithelial changes.
bronchoscopy [**9-18**]-Impression:	68 year-old man with esophageal cancer in remission and telescoping tracheal stents placed in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2197-4-7**] returns for stent removal.
Rigid bronchoscopy was performed with intent of stent removal, however a proximal posterior membrane ulceration and necrosis was visualized above the stent causing concern for tracheal rupture if manipulation of the stents were undertaken.

Therefore, pt underwent a videoswallow combined with a barium study and was found to have significant aspiration.
The following morning, pt became acquirely hypoxic requiring NRB, had altered mental status and tachypnea.
CXR showed pneumonia and pt was started on vanco/cefepime/flagyl with improvement in his symptoms.
Recent PET negative for malignancy.
Rigid bronch showing necrosis vs. mass-s/p debridement.
Dysphagia likely due to post-radiation changes.
Pt with significant promixal dysphagia and aspiration.
Discussed that pt will/may always have risk of aspiration and dysphagia.
Dysphagia related to radiation.
Can perform GI assessment for dysphagia after pharyngeal dysphagia is addressed in the outpatient setting.
Path consistent with metaplasia (ICU team discussed with Onc - nothing further to do).
#normocytic anemia-likely due to chronic illness.
#thrombocytopenia-likely due to acute illness.
Likely due to recent pulmonary process.
No diarrhea this admission.
The patient will need to continue a course of IV antibiotics till [**9-30**] for treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
Currently his cultures show no growth.
3. trazodone 50 mg Tablet [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
8. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for fungal rash.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: esophageal cancer s/p chemo and xrt dysphagia hypoxia leukocytosis hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
In addition, you had a area of concern biopsied which showed reactive changes, but you will should follow-up with your oncologist to have this monitored for the possibility of malignant changes in the future.
You were noted to have low oxygen levels after your procedure but this improved.
In additon, you had a video swallow and barium swallow performed and results show that it is too dangerous for you to take food or liquids by mouth at this time.
You will need to have speech therapy, then reevaluation of a swallowing study.
Unfortunately, you developed low oxygen levels and were initially transferred to the ICU.
You were found to have another aspiration pneumonia and started on antibiotics with improvement.
