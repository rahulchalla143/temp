During that admission, she had a CT scan which showed no cause for her pain.
Gastroenteritis was presumed and she was discharged home after her symptoms improved with zofran and dilaudid.
Then, this morning ~ 5 AM, abd pain woke her from sleep.
The pain was diffuse, sharp and intermittent.
She slept most of the day, but did have 1 episode of nbnb emesis and felt persistently nauseated.
She also took her temperature during the course of the day and it trended from 101 to 99.0.
Her mother thought she should go to the hospital because of the pain and vomiting so she went to Addison-[**Doctor Last Name **].
Her pain improved.
RUQ U/S showed cirrhotic liver, stable splenomegaly, unchanged gallbladder wall edema and new to-and-fro flow in the left portal vein.
She says that she feels silly to have come to the ED again with most of the tests being negative and asks if she is expected to have abd pain/nausea/vomiting with her disease.
Briefly, she was admitted on [**6-12**] for a GI bleed - grade 1 varices without bleeding seen on EGD.
She represented on [**7-1**] again with GI bleeding - EGD showed non-bleeding varices, gastritis, and portal gastropathy.
She was admitted again on [**7-12**] for a third GI bleed - this admission she had TIPS procedure performed.
Course was complicated by high-grade MRSA bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of IV vancomycin (at rehab, d/t concern of IVDA and PICC line).
She was then admitted from rehab on [**8-8**] for hepatic encephalopathy and again on [**8-25**] for hepatic encephalopathy and hyperglycemia.

DIAGNOSTICS: DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2180-9-9**] DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER: The liver demonstrates heterogeneous echogenicity, findings consistent with patient's known history of cirrhosis.
No focal hepatic lesion is identified.
There is unchanged diffuse gallbladder wall edema, findings consistent with patient's underlying chronic liver disease.
However, no focal gallstones are visualized.
There is a mild amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent CT examination.
LIVER DOPPLER: Color and pulse wave Doppler examination of the hepatic vasculature demonstrates a patent main portal vein with a peak systolic velocity of 44 cm/sec compared to 59 cm/sec on recent prior.
The TIPS is in unchanged position with wall-to-wall flow throughout and typical respiratory variations.
The left portal vein demonstrates some to- and fro- flow which appears new compared to prior examination, though centrally flow is in the direction of the TIPS.
Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and respiratory variability.
Stable velocities in the proximal and distal TIPS with slightly decreased velocities in the mid TIPS compared to recent prior examination.
Stable cirrhotic-appearing liver, diffuse gallbladder wall edema and splenomegaly.
Small amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent CT examination.

She underwent endoscopy on [**2180-9-12**] complicated by a GI bleed when a previously placed coil in the duodenum became dislodged.
The pt's Hct dropped to 16.9 and she was taken to IR to embolize the bleeding duodenal varix and subsequently transferred to the CCU.
Transplant surgery was consulted and on [**2180-9-13**] she was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal varix, duodenotomy, and retrieval of embolic coils.
Postop course was complicated by high ascites drain output requiring IV fluid replacements and albumin.
She had high pain med requirements for persistent abdominal pain.
Culture of fluid isolated 2 species of Acinetobacter Baumanii pan-sensitive except Bactrim.
Patient accepted and underwent Liver Transplant.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was seen.
