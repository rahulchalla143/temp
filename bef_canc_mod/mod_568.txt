The night before he presented to [**Hospital1 **] (one week prior to transfer) he was in his usual state of health when he began to develop abdominal pain and nausea, with subsequent melena and eventual coffee ground emesis.
He [**Hospital1 1834**] EGD twice, the first time limited by active bleeding and the second revealing a hiatal hernia, duodenitis, and an ulcerated duodenal lesion in the third part of the duodenum.
At admission, he complained of mild lightheadedness and chest pain.
He was afebrile with a bp of 82/36 and a hr of 76, satting 100% on 2Lnc.
He was bolused one liter of IVF, resulting in a bp of 92/44 and a resolution of his symptoms.

No dislocation or fracture.
IMPRESSION: Possible subchondral lucency of the superior aspect of the bony glenoid may be seen with degenerative changes.
Balloon angioplasty of the terminal, central portion of the right cephalic vein stenosis, using 6 mm, 8 mm and eventually 8 mm cutting balloons.
Balloon angioplasty to 10 and 12 mm of the stenosis in the central portion of the right subclavian vein and the right innominate vein stent, with unsatisfactory angiographic and hemodynamic result.
Successful deployment of a 14 x 60 mm Smart stent across that stenotic area, balloon-dilated to 12 mm, with moderate angiographic improvement in luminal narrowing and partial reduction in the degree of collateral venous opacification.
Active bleeding site in the proximal descending duodenum, possibly from an erosion or a Dielafoye's lesion.
Erythema and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis Erosions at the GE junction.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 y/o male with cad, chf, esrd, metastatic melanoma, s/p radical neck exploration and LN resection transferred from OSH with GI bleed, s/p .
#GI bleed -- Ulcerated duodenal lesion seen on OSH EGD.
Story consistent with UGI bleed.
In the ICU the pt [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] an EGD that demonstrated a small bleeding area in the duodenum that was cauterized with good effect and was felt to be the main source of bleeding.
#Hypotension -- Likely [**1-31**] to hypovolemia and [**Month/Day (2) **] loss, responded to bolus.
Other possibilities include sepsis (though does not fit SIRS criteria), cardiogenic (no ECG changes), and adrenal insufficiency.
Exercising caution given CHF and ESRD.
#RUE edema -- The first step in work-up was an ultrasound showing no DVT but a possibility of stenosis involving his AV-fistula.
This was examined with a fistulogram, showing areas of stenosis at the cephalic vein and more proximally near the stent he had placed (brachiocephalic vein).
#Anemia -- Pt has some baseline anemia, likely from chronic disease but also now has acute [**Month/Day (2) **] loss anemia.
#CAD -- No evidence of active ischemia, holding asa, clopidogrel, and metoprolol in setting of GI bleed/hypotension.
