Admission Date:  [**2185-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-1-9**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F  Service: Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3), type 2 diabetes, bilateral staghorn calculi, and presumed diastolic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation now being transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Service following treatment for acute-on-chronic renal failure with anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Per report, the patient was evaluated by primary care physician on [**1-3**] for markedly decreased urine output and increased lower extremity edema and swelling times several days.
No chest pain.
No shortness of breath.
Decreased oral intake.
Of note, the patient was in the midst of completing a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin starting on [**12-17**] for Klebsiella cellulitis.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3).
Congestive heart failure; presumed diastolic (with an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% in [**2184-3-20**]).
Bilateral staghorn calculi.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Status post right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis presumed secondary to central line.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post left popliteal posterior tibial bypass via saphenous vein graft.
Status post left fifth toe amputation and left transmetatarsal amputation.
Klebsiella bacteremia in [**2184-1-21**].
Recent Klebsiella cellulitis.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include SULFA (to which she gets hives).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   At the time of admission her vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 132/80, her heart rate was 60, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
Difficult to assess jugular venous distention secondary to a large body habitus.
Cardiovascular examination revealed first heart sound and second heart sound with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Pulmonary examination revealed bibasilar crackles (right greater than left) about one quarter to two thirds of the way from base.
Ecchymosis in the right lower quadrant.
Extremities showed bilateral upper extremity edema.
Left lower extremity with a bandage.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Her renal ultrasound (as mentioned above) showed minimal left-sided hydronephrosis at 3.4 cm X 3.6 cm X 1.5 cm cyst within the upper pole of the right kidney.
She had an echocardiogram on [**1-5**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60%, tricuspid gradient of 42 to 47, with moderate pulmonary hypertension, dilated left and right atrium, mid symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, mildly dilated aortic root, 1+ to 2+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with acute renal insufficiency and metabolic acidosis.
Given the degree of her acidemia with a pH of 7.16, she was initially transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she received aggressive hydration with bicarbonate supplementation.
The exact etiology of her renal insufficiency remained unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] her recent use of antibiotics and several eosinophils in the urine, there was concern for an acute interstitial nephritis.
It was also felt that possibly the patient could have been severely prerenal with a recent decrease in her oral intake and being on a diuretic.
There was also concern that the patient may have a degree of renal artery stenosis.
Finally, there was concern given her history of calculi that the patient may have some type of postobstructive renal insufficiency.
Further review of her initial renal ultrasound, however, did not indicate significant left-sided hydronephrosis.
Given that the patient was ineligible for magnetic resonance imaging given a pacemaker, it was decided that she may qualify for a follow-up ultrasound as an outpatient for further evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis and re-evaluation of hydronephrosis.
Meanwhile, the patient was continued on phosphate binders for her elevated phosphorous; she had received calcium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide.
The true etiology of the patient's renal insufficiency remained unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] the fact that her response to intravenous fluids, though, it was thought that the patient had a significant prerenal dysfunction.
She was due for a laboratory check status post discharge to assess whether or not she should resume her hydrochlorothiazide.
She was presumed to have diastolic dysfunction as the cause of her congestive heart failure.
The patient did have rales in her lungs throughout her hospital course but remained compensated during her hospitalization, saturating well off oxygen.
(b)  Hemodynamics:  From a hemodynamic standpoint, was found to have elevated blood pressures during her hospital course.
(c)  Rhythm:  From a rhythm standpoint, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
She was continued on Coumadin for a history of atrial fibrillation.
The patient had difficult vascular access.
Given concerns about an elevated INR on Coumadin, the patient had a right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter line placed on [**1-7**] that was subsequently discontinued at the time of her discharge.
She remained afebrile during her hospital course.
Meanwhile, she was evaluated by both Vascular Surgery and Podiatry for a wound at the site of her left transmetatarsal amputation.
Acute-on-chronic renal failure of unclear etiology; resolved.
The patient was also to go home with [**Hospital6 1587**] services for her wound care.
