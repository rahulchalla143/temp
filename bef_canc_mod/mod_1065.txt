[**2146-9-23**]: Right Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with past medical history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemai, and CAD s/p CABG [**2142**], who was recently found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.5cm which enlarged to 4.6cm.
He has previously had a right femoral sarcoma removed and radiation therapy and has a chronically swollen right leg.
CT angiogram showed a heavily calcified infrarenal aorta with 3 areas of distinct blowout, almost looking like contained ruptures.
The aorta was heavily calcified both proximal and distal to these areas of aneurysmal saccular degeneration and more so at the aortic bifurcation.
Because of the unusual saccular shape and the appearance that one of these may have actually been an old chronic contained rupture, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended open repair, as he did not have an endovascular option.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2126**], which was treated with angioplasty at the [**Hospital3 2358**].

Small right effusion.
Increased fullness of the right hilus and prominence of left basilar interstitial markings may refelect mild institial pulmonary edema.
Increased density at the right base likely a summation of low lung volumes, atelectasis, and mild edema.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No regional wall motion abnormalitu seen in suboptimal views.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Overnight, he was hypotensive requiring vasopressors and febrile to 101.7.
He continued to have febrile episodes and remained on broad spectrum antibiotics pending culture results.
On exam, his abdomen was mildly tender to palpation and distended.
Transplant surgery was consulted for a potential abdominal pathology, and a CT scan was obtained demonstrating pneumatosis of the sigmoid colon.
He underwent exploratory laparotomy that demonstrated necrotic sigmoid colon, which was resected with creation of an end-colostomy.
On POD 6 and 1 from the AAA repair and ex-lap, respectively, he was intubated on one pressor in the ICU, continuing to have low grade fevers and a mildly elevated white count.
He was volume overloaded and was maintained on a Lasix drip for adequate diuresis.
On POD 11(from AAA repair)/6(from ex-lap) he experienced increasing respiratory distress and required re-intubation.
Chest xray demonstrated a large pleural effusion.
During this time frame the Lasix drip was stopped, because of his creatinine.
Again this has normalized, pt also had increase in sodium from around 147 - 154.
He was treated with free water.
It was noticed that he had difficulty swallowing.
