Patient awoke @ 3:30 a.m. to urinate and when returning to bed had chest pain [**8-23**], substernal, radiating to left shoulder, accompanied by SOB.
Took 2 SL nitro and pain did not resolve (usually does with 1 SLNTG), so wife called 911.
Patient states that he has chest pain 3-4 times per week, but is usually relieved with ONE SL nitro.
He denies exertional or other triggers.
+ DOE with minimal activity - able to walk [**11-2**] feet before he usually gets SOB, sometimes has mild associated chest pain.
EKG done which showed ST depressions I, II, V3-V6, LVH, and ST elevation of AVR.
Patient was started on integrillin but developed hemoptysis and this was stopped.
Patient relates episode of hemoptysis this a.m., but states that this is not new, occurring a couple times a week, unable to quantify amount (coughs, may have BRB, but next cough productive of clear sputum).
+ chills, no fevers, no weight loss.

CT demonstrated a return of his mediastinal adenopathy back to the baseline that was present in [**2121**].
There is no evidence of recurrent tumor.
# Anemia - due to chronic disease, baseline 30s.
Past Surgical History: Right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass Aortofem BPG [**2118**] Multiple foot surgeries - Bilateral halux amputations, most recent [**2-/2125**] on R Graft in renal artery Endarterectomy Umbilical hernia repair Left upper lobectomy   Social History: lives independently with wife, limited mobility lately, ex-smoker 15 years ago x 30 pack year, no etoh.

He had [**Name (NI) 7792**] on admission in setting of severe anemia Then, had repeat [**Name (NI) 7792**] on [**5-7**] in setting of high fever and tachycardia with troponin peak of 3.0 and CK pear in the 700's.
The enzyme leak was thought to be due to lack of flow through collaterals.
CT surgery was consulted, but determined that he was not a CABG candidate due to extensive aortic calcifications, so he was taken back to cath on [**5-17**] and had a single cypher stent placed to his mid-LAD on [**2125-5-17**].
He had decreasing troponins and no further chest pain from that point.
#) Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis/Silent Aspiration - The patient has a history of lung cancer and there was concern for recurrent lung cancer in the setting of hemoptysis and enlarged tracheal nodes on admission.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed transbronchial biopsy of the mediastinum, which showed a clot in the right bronchus and negative cytology.
He was diuresed and his oxygen requirement disappeared.
On [**2125-5-18**], the day after cath, he had acutely worsened respiratory distress, fever, and hypotension with worsened CXR and was put on ceftriaxone/vancomycin/azithro for hospital acquired pneumonia.
On [**5-27**], he became febrile again and Vanc/zosyn were restarted.
He was put on levophedrine for hypotension on [**5-28**], and meropenem was substituted for vancomycin.
He gradually improved over 3 days and was extubated, but still had a significant oxygen requirement, with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 and bilateral infiltrates.
The DDx of his hypoxic respiratory failure was CHF, persistent pneumonia (atypical or other), lymphangitic spread of cancer, silent aspiration, Wegener's, interstitial lung disease.
All sputum cultures showed only oropharyngeal flora.
A bedside swallow showed no clinical signs of aspiration but video swallow showed significant aspiration.
He was re-intubated for hypoxia and taken to OR for left sided thoracotomy.
Biopsy results showed diffuse alveolar damage consistent with ARDS picture.
#) Pump/CHF - Patient has severe class III symptoms at home with Lasix 40 PO BID dose.
#) Adrenal insufficiency - For hypotension, [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was done which bumped from 33-39 so he was started on hydrocort/fludricort.
#) Anemia - Pt has aenmia likely due to chronic disease, baseline 30s with  although nl epogen level.
#) ARF - Baseline 1.0-1.3, but his creatinine became elevated from agressive diuresis and low BP up to peak of 1.9.
His ACE was held but then restarted in the setting of CHF with improvement back to his baseline of 1.1.
Then his creatinine started to rise again likley combination of ATN and pre-renal state.
#) GI bleeding - on [**6-14**] PM he was noted to have melenotic stools and several point hematocrit drop.
However, given his progressive decline with increasing renal failure, new gi bleeding, progressive hypoxia, intermittent sepsis, ARDS, ventricular arrythmias he was made DNR/DNI on [**2125-6-14**].
