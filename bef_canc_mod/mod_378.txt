[**Known lastname **]-[**Known lastname 1005**] is a 79 yo spanish-speaking female with h/o asthma (never intubated, not followed by outpatient pulm, used albuterol inhaler [**Hospital1 **] at home), DM2, and a recent admission for thrombocytopenia workup, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for fever and shortness of breath, transferred to MICU for respiratory distress, now called out to floor.
Per report, patient experienced dizziness/lightheadedness and SOB the night prior to admission.
Per report, she received both the seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccines last month at her PCP's office, and denies any recent sick contacts.
CXR in the ED did not show evidence of an acute PNA.
She was treated on the floor for asthma exacerbation but had persistent wheezing and increasing tachypnea (RR in the high 20s) and accessory muscle use, so she was transferred to MICU for furhter management.
Her symptoms have improved, and now doing well on 2L NC.
Her course has been complicated by hyponatremia, acute renal failure and worsening thrombocytopenia.

CXR from the ED on [**1-31**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process.
No focal pulmonary abnormality present.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
TTE [**2-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.

Flow cytometry [**1-21**]: Non-specific T cell dominant profile.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo spanish speaking woman with h/o asthma, DM2, dyslipidemia, CKD was admitted for respiratory distress.
# Respiratory distress: The most likely diagnosis was asthma exacerbation.
Pneumonia was less likely given no fever or leukocytosis, and chest x-ray was clear.
CHF was less likely, because pt appeared euvolemic on exam (she had diffuse wheezing but no crackles on exam, no LE edema, no JVD).
Acute PE was on the DDx, but pt was getting better without anticoagulation.
COPD was also within the differential given wheezing, but patient has never smoked.
[**Name (NI) **] daughters were worried about rugs in the apartment causing allergic asthma exacerbation.
On review of her previous CBC diff, it appears that patient has been having peripheral eosinophilia for years, so it is possible the carpet (which has been there for over 10yrs) is playing a role.
[**Month/Year (2) **] marrow bx showed hypercellular marrow for age with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis adn atypical lymphocytic infiltrate.
Flow showed T-cell dominance.
# Acute renal failure:  Patient's baseline creatinine 1.1, admission cr 1.2, which rose to 1.6 in the setting of getting multiple doses of lasix in the MICU for low urine output and hyponatremia.
# HTN: As above, patient was started on lisinopril during this admission.
# Depression/Anxiety:  Patient was continued on paroxetine HCl 20 mg daily and lorazepam 1mg qhs.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety, insomnia.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**1-2**] puff Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - asthma - acute renal failure - thrombocytopenia - hyponatremia .

You were found to have asthma exacerbation.
You were treated with nebulizers and steroids, and your symptoms signifiantly improved.
You were provided with a letter to your landlord for rug removal from your apartment, since it appears that your asthma exacerbation is at least partially attributed to your allergies.
Your medications have been changed: - please take prednisone as instructed - please take advair, [**Hospital1 35480**] and albuterol for asthma - please take flonase and [**Doctor First Name 130**] for allergies - please take lisinopril for your blood pressure and your heart  Followup Instructions: You missed your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] (a hematologist) for your low platelets because you were admitted.
