There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-9-1**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now seen.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has mild aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2186**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 3 years.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2190-9-13**] 2:58 PM  IMPRESSION: Large bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis and mild volume.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 82 year-old gentleman with history of CAD with NSTEMI s/p cath with DES to LAD in [**2183**], ESRD on HD, DM2, HTN, HLD, Hepatitis C, with recent admission for volume overload and NSTEMI s/p cath with no intervention 1 week ago prior to admission who presented with lethargy, SOB, and volume overload.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema while in the ED and was briefly on BiPap with improvement in symptoms.
He does have a history of ESRD and has had some frequent difficulty with blood pressure and fluid overload.
Echo during this hospitalization was largely unchanged with trivial pericardial effusion.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions.
With normalization of his blood glucose, mental status improved.
#  ESRD: ESRD thought to be secondary to HTN and FSGS.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Patient was recently admitted the week prior to admission with NSTEMI s/p cardiac catheterization that revealed distal lesion in his OM with no intervention.
He does have a history of NSTEMI s/p cath DES to mid LAD in [**2183**].
There was initially some concern for cardiac ischemia in the ED, but EKGs showed J-point elevation similar to prior.
# Mental status: Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was alert and oriented but did not recall details of hypoglycemic event that [**Last Name (un) 4662**] him to the ED.
#  HTN: Patient is on labetalol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] at home but continues to have episodes of acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to poorly controlled hypertension.
He was hypertensive in the ED and started on nitro drip for blood pressure control, though he did miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dose of home meds.
He did undergo hemodialysis x1 for fluid removal.
#  Urinary sx: Patient complained of some irritation in bladder of unclear etiology.
It was considered that pain may have been secondary to foley placement.
Has had been given recent course of cipro for UTI and has a history of blood in his urine.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you experienced shortness of breath, lethargy/confusion, and hypoglycemic episode.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Please START taking Aspirin 81mg daily - Please STOP taking Glypizide as this may have lead to your hypoglycemic episode (i.e., episode of low blood sugar leading to confusoin and lethargy).
