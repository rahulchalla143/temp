Slight ST-T wave changes with borderline prolonged QTc interval are non-specific, but clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2142-6-10**] there is no suggestion of prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Radiology [**6-10**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload.
Focal hazy opacity posterior chest, likely representing confluence of shadows, but early infiltrate cannot be excluded.
Background COPD  [**6-11**] CXR: There is persistent mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
[**6-12**] Lumbar MRI: Acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra, unchanged in configuration since [**2141-6-7**] but new since [**2141-5-28**].
Status post L4 through S1 laminectomy and fusion procedure with marked enhancing scar tissue at the laminectomy site and circumferentially within the canal.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old male with Type I DM, mod AS, HTN admitted w/ DKA secondary to med non-compliance.
No evidence of infection (U/A neg, repeat CXR w/o infiltrate).
His hospital course was notable for a.m. hypoglycemia (FS 60s), asymptomatic.
[**Last Name (un) **] felt that this was most likely to enhanced dietary compliance while in-house, and did not recommend further changes in his lantus dose.
Given gradually worsening vision over the last 2-3 months, he will need an outpatient ophthalmology evaluation.
2) ARF: The patient's Creatinine trended down to  3.4 from 4.2 on admit with hydration, indicating likely pre-renal etiology in the setting of osmotic diuresis.
His baseline Creatinine was the mid 2s until the last 4 mos when it rose to 3-3.3 (likely progresion of diabetic nephropathy).
4) HTN: As mentioned above, given acute renal failure, the patient's ACEI was held.
[**3-31**] iron studies were not consistent iron deficiency, and vitamin B12 and folate were within normal limits.
Given his chronic renal insufficiency, he would likely benefit from epogen as an outpatient.
7) systolic CHF: EF 50-55%, mild pulm edema on CXR.
As mentioned above, his ACEI was held; if his renal failure presents this from being resumed as an outpatient, hydralazine/nitrate may be considered.
8) Sciatica: Given reports of sciatica and compression fracture visualized on recent plain films, his PCP had ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lumbar MRI, which he had while in-house/ This showed an acute-to-subacute compression fracture of L1 vertebra, unchanged in configuration since [**2141-6-7**] but new since [**2141-5-28**].
It also showed marked enhancing scar tissue at L4 through S1 laminectomy/fusion site.
He was started continued on calcium and vitamin D. He was able to ambulate without difficulty and denied back pain at discharge.
