[**2147-11-8**]: Exploration of left femoral anastomosis with revison- left PFA endarterectomy and profundaplasty   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of multiple bypass grafts (initially R CIA to bifem BPG follwed by L axillary to fem-fem) who had acute onset of severe R lower leg and foot pain when leaving her home for a doctor's appointment this mornings.
The pain was sharp and she was unable to stand or walk to to acute weakness.
She also reports decreased sensation from mid-shin through the foot on the right.
She has a degree of chronic pain in her feet, L greater than right.

Extensive, diffuse atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, as seen previously.
Increased spiculated ground-glass opacity near the left hilar fiducial marker could represent post-treatment change versus recurrent carcinoma.
Bilateral renal cortical scarring, similar to the prior examination.
Diverting colostomy with no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Decreased soft tissue density at the left iliacus muscle.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid infero-lateral akinesis (?old infarct?).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Discharge summary  The patient was admitted to the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery service on [**2147-11-7**] for evaluation and treatment of acute LLE ischemia.
Neuro: The patient received fentanyl, prn oxycodone, and lyrica for her LE chronic pain with good effect and adequate pain control.
Chronic pain service was consulted and recommended restarting her on lyrica and placing her on a fentanyl patch.
however, the morning of [**2147-11-8**] she was noticed to have decreasing pulse exam on the LLE and increasing pain that was different from her chronic pain.
Cardiology was consulted post-op for elevated troponins, peak of 0.69, which continued to trend downward and resolved.
She had an echo that showed mild LV systolic dysfunction, trivial mitral regurgitation, and otherwise relatively unremarkable study.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout this hospitalization.
There was initial concern for a pulmonary mass seen on CXR on [**2147-11-8**] and due to her history of lung cancer, there was concern for recurrent.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
She remained afebrile in her post-operative course.
Her lower extremity pain also improved on anticoagulation therapy, oxycodone, and pletal was started on this admission.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left lower extremity ischemia status post prior bilateral groin cutdowns with thrombectomy of left- to-right femoral-femoral artery bypass graft and bilateral bovine pericardial graftotomy closures presenting with acute left lower extremity ischemia and absence of distal pulses.
?Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated  3.
?Eat small frequent meals ?????
?You may shower (unless you have stitches or foot incisions) no direct spray on incision, let the soapy water run over incision, rinse and pat dry ?????
?Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing over the area that is draining, as needed ?????
