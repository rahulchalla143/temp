Brief Hospital Course: 24 y.o female with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension who presents with HTN and SOB aftering missing HD.
# Malignant hypertension/hypertensive urgency: The patient has a well-documented history of paroxysmal hypertension believed to possibly be related to pain, anxiety, narcotic withdrawal and poor medication and HD compliance.
Has previously presented with BP up to 260/160 but most often without evidence of end-organ ischemia, as she did for this admission.
Pt was treated per OMR hypertensive protocol created by the patient's primary providers, with a goal SBP of 160-180.
With short course of IV antihypertensives and hemodialysis, pt's BP fell appropriately and was well maintained on oral outpt regimen of clonidine, labetalol, aliskiren, nifedipine.
Pt states she would like to reconsider peritoneal dialysis as she is experiencing increased fatigue since instituting HD.
# Coagulopathy/history of DVT: Patient on lifetime anticoagulation for hx of multiple thrombotic events.
# Pain management:  Pt was treated with PO dilaudid for her abdominal pain, as recommended per her OMR protocol.
She asked for IV dilaudid multiple times but there was no clinical indication.
# Anemia: Secondary to AOCD and renal failure.
