History of Present Illness: 64 year old female with a PMH of ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy, a-fib/flutter (on coumadin in the past, recently being held for hx of septic emboli), MSSA bacteremia/endocarditis in [**9-/2198**] and hypertension who was brought in from dialysis with a chief complaint of chest tightness x 1 hour and shortness of breath for 1 day.
However, she started having dyspnea over night when she was trying to go to bed and had to sit up.
Overnight, she had some anxiety given her dypsnea.
When she was at dialysis in the morning, she noticed some chest pressure/tightness, which was substernal, without radiation or frank pain.
She had palpitations during the episode, however they have now resolved.
She denies fever or chills.
Per report she was hypotensive during the session, though her BP improved with stopping dialysis and her symptoms of tightness resolved.
She has been at rehab since her discharge from hospital for MSSA bacteremia/endocarditis and for shortness of breath (during which she was found to be in afib and her amiodarone was restarted).

Wet Read: GMSj FRI [**2198-12-14**] 11:54 PM MRI Brain: No intra- or extra- axial hemorrhage No midline shift, no signs of herniation New punctate areas of restricted diffusion in the right parietal, left and right frontal, and right occipital lobes and in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the left - findings concerning for embolic infarcts.
Chronicity is uncertain and some of these regions appear hyperintense on FLAIR sequences suggesting a subacute process - though others are not clearly delineated.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with bihemispheric small infarcts, likely due to mitral valve vegetation, now status post MVR with change in mental status.
Given the multiplicity as well as the involvement of both cerebral hemispheres and multiple vascular territories including the splenium of left side of the corpus callosum, the findings are suggestive of embolic infarcts.
There is no evidence of acute or chronic hemorrhage seen.
Moderate-to-severe changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy identified.
Soft tissue changes seen in the mastoid air cells, right greater than left side.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple acute predominantly deep white matter infarcts are identified which are new since the previous MRI examination.
Small vessel disease and brain atrophy seen.
No midline shift.
No evidence of stenosis or occlusion of the major vascular structures seen.
No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
MRA NECK:  The neck MRA obtained with 2D time-of-flight study demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis in the carotid or vertebral arteries.

cholecystitis    Final Report INDICATION: 64-year-old female with abdominal pain status post MVR for endocarditis.
FINDINGS: Evaluation is somewhat limited by presence of a midline abdominal dressing.
Allowing for such, the liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder, however, appears to demonstrate slightly increased wall thickening as compared to [**2198-10-7**], with a suggestion of trace pericholecystic fluid.
The gallbladder remains mildly distended, with a few sub-3-mm anterior wall polyps, of doubtful clinical significance.
There is no appreciable abdominal ascites.
Persistent gallbladder distention with new wall thickening as compared with [**2198-10-7**], with trace pericholecystic fluid in this patient with normal albumin.
If there is a persistent clinical suspicion, a HIDA scan should be performed for further evaluation.

Electronically signed by [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4083**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2198-12-17**] 18:30    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 101283**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-12-6**] for surgical management of her mitral valve disease.
The renal service was consulted given her history of IgA nephropathy and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Hemodialysis was initiated for volume removal.
She was initially dialyzed daily for volume overload, and returned to her Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule when she stabilized.
She remained in the unit for sinus bradycardia.
She was found to have a ventricular escape rhythm with a rate of 40bpm.
She did develop Pseudomonas and Morganella bacteremia.
Ultrasound revealed gall-bladder wall thickening.
This will be pursued with HIDA if bacteremia does not resolve.
Transplant surgery was consulted to evaluate the left upper extremity AV fistula as the possible source of bacteremia.
There are aneurysmal areas of the fistula that will need to be evaluated as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], following discharge.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
INR became supra-therapeutic quickly in the setting of poor appetite and nutritional depletion.
Rapid atrial fibrillation developed.
She remained in Sinus Rhythm with 1st degree AV block on PO Amio and Coreg.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
She did develop some confusion in dialysis on [**12-14**].
MRA of the brain revealed multiple embolic infarcts- acute/ and sub acute.
By the time of discharge on POD #13 the patient remained deconditioned ambulating short distances with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
