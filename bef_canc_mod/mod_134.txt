Admission Date:  [**2154-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-3-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Aleve  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**] Chief Complaint: - GIB - Anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Emergent intubation for pulmonary edema  History of Present Illness: 69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF (EF 60-70%, 3+ MR), who had HD on Friday and then came to ED today with c/o darker stools.
This mornign she awoke and had a BM which was dark and states there was blood in his stool but could not provide mroe informaiton than that.
She said that there were multiple dark sotols over the last several weeks.
She deneis any chest pain but did admit to chest pressure on the left side without radiation which was reilieved with one ntg in the ED.
No abd pain.
The pt also has a history of colonic polyps from c-scope in [**2152**] s/p polypectomy.
Received 2 u PRBCS for Hct drop to 22.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy.
She also had an EGD on the same date which was significant for erythema, edema, and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis in addition to erythema in the proximal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
No bleeding was noted.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.3, 120/55, HR 113-118, 97% 4L NC--->intubated GEN: well nourished elderly AA female in NAD, comfortable, intubated with pink material from ETT HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, [**Last Name (un) **] mm, op clear NECK: no appreciable JVD CV: [**Last Name (un) 13223**], s1, s2, ?1/6 SEM CHEST: crackles in lungs ABD: obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+, ventral hernia RECTAL: guiac + per ED EXT: L UE fistula with thrill.
Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed fecal flora.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
Stomach: Linear streaks of erythema of the mucosa with contact bleeding and in a watermelon distribution was noted in the antrum.
An Argon-Plasma  Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
There were no blood or any bleeding lesions.
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with GAVE s/p APC  .
EGD [**2154-1-22**]: Impression: Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb consistent with duodenitis.
Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with GAVE Small angioectasias in the jejunum without evidence of bleeding  Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg Twice daily Capsule endoscopy .
Compared w/priors, ST depression in inferolateral distribution has changed to .5mm ST elevation in aVL, 1mm ST elevation in V2-V6, concering for anterolateral ischemia.
There are new bilateral central alveolar opacities as well as peripheral septal lines, consistent with pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2154-2-18**]: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved since 6:30 p.m. on [**1-28**].
Little if any pleural effusion is present.
No pneumothorax.
CXR [**2154-2-20**]: There is interval resolution of the pulmonary edema.
- Stomach: Flat Lesions Multiple angiodysplasias/watermelon stomach was seen in the antrum compatible with GAVE.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
- Impression: Watermelon stomach in the antrum, Angiodysplasias in the first part of the duodenum, Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum .
However, she then became acutely dyspneic, with pink frothy sputum production.
She was quickly intubated for airway protection for flash pulmonary edema [**12-27**] volume overload.
Differential diagnosis at that time included diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, PNA (though she was afebrile, with no WBC), PE, or cardiogenic shock (though her troponins were not above her baseline, but still possible with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13223**]).
Lasix was given with minimal effect as Mrs. [**Known lastname 13224**] is oliguric.
HD was initiated, with simultaneous transfusion of 2u pRBCs, but the session was aborted after 1 kg of fluid was removed due to hypotension requiring the use of neosynephrine.
# UGIB: Mrs. [**Known lastname 13224**] has a h/o GAVE.
She continued to have some blood in her stool, but her Hct remained stable.
# ANEMIA: Mrs. [**Known lastname 13224**] is anemic, likely of a multifactorial etiology including ESRD and iron deficiency from GIB.
She required 4 units of pRBCs on [**2-17**] to keep her Hct >28 with a concern for demand ischemia given her h/o CAD.
# CAD: In the ER, her EKG showed the acute onset of lateral ST depressions and dynamic which were concerning for demand ischemia.
# CHF: Mrs. [**Known lastname 13224**] has a h/o CHF with preserved EF of 60-70% per ECHO on [**2154-2-18**] with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 13225**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7216**] dysfunction.
Her flash pulmonary edema was likely due to volume overload from rapid infusion of pRBCs.
Her volume status was managed by HD and a low sodium diet.
# DM TYPE II: While hospitalized, Mrs.[**Known lastname 13226**] oral antihyperglycemic was held and she was covered with a RISS as she was not eating regularly.
She was somewhat hypoglycemic with her glipizide, so it was advised that she hold off on glipizide until she resumes a normal diet at home.
She was given no other IVF due to her tenous volume status.
# ACCESS: Peripheral IVs.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: GAVE Pulmonary edema .
Secondary diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus type II Diabetic neuropathy/nephropathy ESRD on HD since [**11-30**] CAD Anemia CHF with EF 60-70%, 3+ MR, 2+ TR Gout   Discharge Condition: Good, BP 110/60, HR 86, RR 18, sats 99% on 2L   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please call your PCP or go to the nearest ER if you develop any of the following symptoms: fever, chills, chest pain, dizziness, lightheadhedness, dark, tarry or bloody stools, burning on urination, abdominal pain or tenderness, or any other worrisome symptoms.
