Past Medical History: kidney stone with pyelonephritis in [**2170**] osteopenia GERD Asthma Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Migraines- last one over a year ago Seen by Neurology here in [**2170**] for an episode of sudden onset shooting pain L eye, followed by burning with looking up and to the left, diagnosed with trochleitis B12 deficiency   Social History: + tobacco 1 PPD, [**1-25**] glasses of wine/week, financial consultant at AG [**Doctor Last Name **], no children   Family History: Mother -> died of Lung CA at 65 Father -> died of PE at 55 Brother -> HTN   Physical Exam: T- 95 BP- 153/73 HR- 93 RR- 20 O2Sat- 96% on RA Gen: Lying in bed, NAD, eyes closed HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  NIH SS: 5 1a.

Mild NLF flattening on L.  Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
No extinction to DSS  Reflexes: +2 and symmetric throughout.
Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: dysmetria with finger-nose-finger and heel to shin on left  Gait: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: 141  104  19 -------------< 139 3.7  24  0.9  WBC 9.4 Hgb 14.9 Plt 394 Hct 42.2 MCV 87  N:59.4 L:33.5 M:4.9 E:1.7 Bas:0.6  PT: 11.0  PTT: 22.3  INR: 0.9  Imaging CTA Head and Neck with perfusion: On the unenhanced scan, there is no evidence for acute ischemia or hemorrhage.
On the CTP, there is no evidence for global perfusion defect in the MCA territory.
Preliminary evaluation of the CTA images demonstrate what appears to be occlusion of the distal basilar artery extending to the proximal right PCA artery.
This area also appears to be hyperdense on unenhanced CT.  No definite acute infarction in the brainstem or cerebellum is seen, although MRI evaluation would be recommended for further evaluation.
There is a 4.5-mm right lung apical nodule for which recommend correlation with dedicated chest CT.
The right distal vertebral artery appears to taper to a thread and there is also a filling defect in the V4 segment, suggesting of acute nonocclusive thrombus.
In light of this finding, the filling defect in the distal basilar artery could represent an acute clot from the right distal vertebral artery dissection rather than basilar artery thrombosis in the setting of atherosclerotic basilar artery disease.
IMPRESSION:  Preliminary images highly concerning for distal basilar artery thrombosis.
No definite acute infarction is seen in the cerebellum or brainstem, but would recommend correlation with MRI.
Repeat Head CT at 5:47: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is a hyperdense appearance of the distal basilar artery which correspond to the area of thrombosis seen on prior CTA.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3)  appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-1**], no change.
No source of embolism identified.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-9-21**] 8:23 PM MRI BRAIN: Areas of slow diffusion are seen in the pons right greater than left, left superior cerebellum, and right cerebellum.
These correspond to areas of low diffusion coefficient on ADC map, and probably represent acute infarction secondary to the previous basilar thrombus.
No other areas of cerebral infarction are seen.
There is fluid in the sphenoid sinuses.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY NECK: The right vertebral artery has loss of signal at its origin, which may be due to the recently placed stent.
Otherwise, the right vertebral artery, left vertebral artery, right and left common and internal carotid arteries are patent.
IMPRESSION: Reconstitution of flow in the basilar artery and branches, with bilateral posterior circulation infarctions, including the right cerebellum, left cerebellum, and pons.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2185-9-23**] 2:35 PM HEAD CT:  There is a large infarct involving the right cerebellar hemisphere and a small infarct involving the superior portion of the left cerebellar hemisphere as well as small infarcts involving the pons and midbrain.
There are no intracranial hemorrhages.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are noted.
Incidental note is made of a prominent right posterior meningeal artery arising from the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery.
There is minimal atherosclerotic disease involving the origin of the left vertebral artery, which comes off directly from the aortic arch.
Minimal atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left subclavian artery is also noted.
Minimal calcified atherosclerotic plaques are seen involving the bulbs of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
The maximal diameter of the left internal carotid artery at its bulb is 7 mm.
The distal cervical left internal carotid artery has a diameter of 4.6 mm.
The right internal carotid artery bulb has a diameter of 5.6 mm and the distal cervical right internal carotid artery has a diameter of 5.8 mm.
Again seen is a 3 x 3 mm outpouching of the right supraclinoid internal carotid artery which likely represents a posterior communicating artery infundibulum.
No new occlusions or stenoses are seen.
There are several small nodular densities of the visualized lung apices bilaterally some of which are peripheral.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are again seen with multilevel foraminal stenosis.
Stent at the origin of the right vertebral artery which makes the evaluation of the intraluminal contents difficult due to streak artifacts but there is some contrast within the lumen and the vertebral artery distal to the stent is widely patent.
A chest CT to further evaluate multiple small nodular densities is again recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old with a history of Asthma, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, who presented with acute onset of bilateral ptosis, diplopia, dsyarthria, dysphagia, and vertigo.
On initial exam she had evidence of a 3rd and 6th nerve palsy on the R, and 3rd nerve palsy on the left, bilateral ptosis, dysarthric speech, left nasolabial flattening, and L UMN pattern weakness in the arm.
These signs and symptoms were consistent with brainstem localization for possible infarction.
On CTA she had evidence of a large basilar artery thrombus.
One hour later her course in the ED was complicated by acute decompensation, with decreased level of arousal and vomiting.
She was acutely intubated and sedated, and Head CT was repeated, which showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
Angiogram showed a severe narrowing of the proximal vertebral artery on the left (atherosclerosis versus dissection).
The mid to distal portion of the basilar artery was closed and there was thrombus that extended into both PCAs.
There was still some clot in the proximal right PCA and SCA.
A stent was placed in the right proximal vertebral artery with return of good flow to the basilar artery, and proximal portions of the SCAs and the proximal PCAs  She has a history of several recent plane flights as well as multiple vascular risk factors.
She has a history of pulmonary embolism in the distant past.
She was successfully extubated without complication and trasferred to the neurology floor.
She was  The cause of her infarct is unknown at present, given her vascular risk factors (long time smoker, HTN, hyperlipidemia) could consider atherosclerotic plaque in the basilar with thrombosis.
Her discharge examination was notable for right eye ptosis and slight bilateral deficit of eye abduction.
Chest CT is recommended at follow up for evaluation of multiple small nodular densities seen incidentally on CTA of the neck.
slight right lateral eye abduction deficit.
You underwent extensive intervention to break up the clot and prevent further neurologic deficits.
Call your doctor or 911 if you experience any difficulty with speech, walking, new weakness, numbness, tingling, weakness, double vision, blurred vision or any other concerning symptoms.
He will order some blood work to be drawn for potential clotting disorder.
