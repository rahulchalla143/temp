Electrocardiogram changes showed lateral ST depression and T wave inversion in 1 and AVL.
He had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 45%, mildly dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation and unremarkable valves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, history of atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, creatinine 3.7 baseline, benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of myositis on Lipitor, status post [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 95965**] aberrant artery with gastrointestinal bleed, status post sigmoidectomy, status post gastrointestinal bleed one year ago with endoscopy and colonoscopy negative, status post knee replacement.
General:  Patient in no apparent distress.
Neck supple, no jugulovenous distension and no bruits.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities 2+ peripheral pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
His exercise tolerance test was positive by ST segment criteria although the patient remained symptomatic only for shortness of breath.
On cardiac catheterization he was found to have single vessel and branch vessel coronary artery disease of a right dominant system, left main normal.
Left anterior descending with discrete 70% stenosis, ramus intermedius of 50% stenosis proximally, second obtuse marginal with discrete 90% stenosis.
On [**2130-7-27**], the patient underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting of the following vessels:  Left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, vein to ramus intermedius, vein to obtuse marginal 1 with the indication of unstable angina under general endotracheal anesthesia.
Postoperatively the patient's creatinine had increased from baseline to 4.5 and he had some decreased urine output.
His postoperative course was also complicated by some drainage from his chest wall which was initially felt to be from his chest tube sites, however, he was found to have some scant sternotomy wound drainage which eventually decreased and the patient was 24 hours without drainage at the time of discharge.
It had remained stable throughout the entire postoperative course with no click and negative chest x-ray.
