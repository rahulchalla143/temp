Admission Date:  [**2193-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-9-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22401**] Chief Complaint: Hypertensie Urgency  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation due to acute respiratory distress .
Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 58 y/o female with h/o ESRD on HD, s/p renal tx in [**2173**] with acute on chronic rejection in [**2193-1-20**], initially presenting with a 4-5 days episode of severe frontal headaches, N/V/D and decreased appetite.
She missed her HD 2 days prior to admission due to severe HA and malaise.
Pt denies having had changes in vision, numbness or weaknesses, syncopes, SOB, CP, anuria or edema during that time.
During her next HD session on [**5-23**] it was noted that pt had SBP >200-250 patient was also c/o headache and sent to ED for HTN management.
Pt was admitted to the ED for severe hypertensive crisis, given captopril, labetolol 20mg, 40mgx2, 80mg then started on nitro and labetolol gtt.
She also received dilaudid for her HA and she was transferred to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and fevers (102).
MICU	 She had two seizures on [**5-24**] in the early morning hours, most likely due to hypertensive leucoencephalopathy.
Shortly after she suffered from a second seizure which stopped after Lorazepam 2mg iv, pt was then successfully intubated and entered brief post-ictal coma (with intact brain stem reflexes).
#s/p rheumatic fever in childhood  Social History: Lives alone with cats.
Physical Exam: T 99.6   BP 174/75 (146/66-190/96)   HF  91 bpm (83-105  RR 18 (18-24)	 O2-Sat 100%(97%)on 2l I/Os: 1012/275, after midnight 1132/0 General	 Alert, orientated, cooperative; pleasant; Skin     Warm, good color, normal turgor; no signs of ulcers, petechiae,          erythema or jaundice; Pt has bruises on her back (left lower chest)          and arms; Mild bilat.
CT Head [**5-24**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of CT compared with the prior examination obtained earlier on the same day.
No hemorrhage is seen.
If hypertensive encephalopathy is clinically suspected, MRI would be helpful for further assessment.
EEG [**5-25**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of intermittent right central parietal and left temporal and central sharp transients.
Additionally, there are prolonged bursts of  generalized slowing, bifrontally predominant and slow and disorganized background rhythm.
This abnormality suggests cortical dysfunction over the right central parietal region and possible left central and temporal region.
The bursts of the generalized slowing and the background  slowing suggests a deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are  consistent with an encephalopathy.
Echo [**5-28**]: Conclusions: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Single renal arteries are identified bilaterally, without evidence for stenosis.
The transplant renal artery rises from the right external iliac artery.
There is no evidence for stenosis within the renal transplant artery.
The aorta is normal in caliber without evidence for atherosclerosis.
There is severe cortical thinning.
The urothelium of the renal pelvis is abnormally thickened and edematous and demonstrates enhancement on post-gadolinium imaging.
There is no significant hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney and no focal renal lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The spleen is abnormally low in signal on T1-weighted imaging, consistent with iron deposition.
The visualized bowel is normal and there is no significant lymphadenopathy.
No evidence for renal artery stenosis in either the native kidneys or transplant kidney.
Abnormally thickened and edematous renal transplant urothelium.
No interval change in multiple nonspecific foci of increased FLAIR signal intensity throughout both cerebral hemispheres, non-specific.
This finding may represent a technical artifact, or less likely blood products, cells or protein within the subarachnoid space.
Minimal plaques identified.
IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
F admitted for malignant hypertension after missing HD session and nonadherent with her medications.
Patient with subsequent seizures due to severe hypertension and slowly resolving confusion due to reversible hypertensive leukoencephalopathy.
Patient was also found to be in microangiopathic thrombotic anemia with platelet consumption.
Her symptoms, confusion and cbc returned to her normal baseline upon control of her blood pressure.
# Confusion The pt presented with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] episodes of confusion when she was transferred from the MICU to the floor.
The possible DDx included post-ictal vs. IC bleeding (CT scan was negative) vs. secondary to leukoencephalopathy vs. sepsis vs. delirium vs. medication.
Since the pt mental status improved steadily parallel to BP control, it was thought to be reversible changes secondary to hypertensive leukoencephalopathy.
# Fevers Pt spiked temperature when still on the MICU and started on 7 day course of Ceftriaxone.
Since the pt had signs of LLL atelectasis on CXR a possible PNA could not be fully excluded.
Drug fever was also in the differential since the pt showed no other signs of infections (chills, elevated WBC, SOB) but remained with intermittent fevers.
After she was changed to Valproic acid, pt remained afebrile over the [**4-24**] prior to discharge and without any signs of active infection.
Seizures: Pt presented at MICU with new onset seizures, 2 generalized clonic episodes (each about 3min), which required intubation.
Initial seizures likely [**2-21**] HTN emergency - hypertensive leukoencephalopathy.
Patient did not have evidence of trauma, systemic infection, no electrolyte abnormalities especially with ESRD, no evidence of acute bleed with underlying thrombocytopenia.
- Head CT negative x 2 on [**5-24**] negative for hemorrhage or mass, MRI was not thought to be necessary at this point, neuro recs.
- EEG impression: Suggests cortical dysfunction over the right central parietal region and possible left central and temporal region.
The bursts of the generalized slowing and the background slowing suggests a deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with an encephalopathy.
There was no seizure activity recorded.
However, pt developed a fever which was thought to be drug induced (eosinophilia accompanied febrile episode).
Hypertension: Pt was admitted for hypertensive urgency with end organ damage - hypertensive leukoencephalopathy and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
She has a history of not taking her medications, missing HD may also have complicated situation along with worsening renal failure/hypoperfusion/high RAAS.
History from previous admission of bp elevated >200s but responded to Lasix and labetalol.
There were no ECG changes or evidence of cardiac ischemia.
BP was hard to control at first but stabilized over the past 72h under enforced treatment with Labetalol, Lisinopril, Clonidine, Nifedipine and intermittent Hydralazine (which was d/c on [**6-2**], due to orthostatic symptoms).
Repeated adjustments in BP-regimen were made to optimize current treatment and prevent hypotensive episodes.
The set goal for her SBP is 120-170, since the pt probably has a history of long-standing maltreated HTN and is used to high pressures.
She complains about light-headedness and dizziness once pressures get too low.
However, given her recent hypertensive episode it is essential for her to be well controlled.
Also considering a component of non-compliance it is important that the pt will f/u with PCP and for monitoring of compliance.
There was no evidence of compromising renal artery stenosis on the MRI.
CN III palsy Pt had two episodes of right sides ptosis/lat.
deviation/diplopia and mydriasis (reactive to light), accompanied by right hemicranial HA during HD on [**6-4**] - resolving within 10 minutes.
Initial DDx included Arteritis temporalis (ESR 7) vs. TIA vs. right posterior artery aneurysm.
deviation, mydriasis or diplopia)totally resolved and the work/up was negative, the intermittent CNIII palsy is thought to be secondary to transient ischemia due to hypotension.
Severe Headache Pt presented with severe fronto-facial HA, accompanied by N/V on [**6-6**] (day after LP).
Neuro saw pt and did not find signs for focal lesion or papilledema, which could be indicative for post-LP complications.
Pt is asymptomatic on day of discharge, denying HA, N/V, dizziness or blurry vision this am.
Anemia - Normocytic.
The anemia is thought to be secondary to ESRD (not treated with EPO previously) vs. occult bleeding vs. hemolysis.
The hemolysis studies obtained revealed an elevated LDH and a decreased haptoglobin, which are found in hemolysis.
The anemia is thought to be secondary to ESRD and initial microangiopathic hemolytic anemia induced by hypertensive urgency.
Hemolysis labs obtained revealed elevated LDH (not compared to previous days), Haptoglobin <20 (measured twice), normal direct and total Bili.
No signs of active bleeding, pt is asymptomatic (denies SOB, not tachycardic, no dizziness) nor signs of severe hemolysis (jaundice, splenomegaly).
Anemia and decrease in Hct is thought to be due to ESRD, ACD and hospital course (HD, frequent blood draws).
The thrombocytopenia were thought to be either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia secondary to her hypertensive urgency vs. TTP.
Indicative for an underlying TTP are the following findings are thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, schistocytes, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, elevated creatinine, mental status changes and fever.
Given that the pt Hct stabilized once her BP was controlled better made a MHA secondary to hypertensive crisis most likely.
Interestingly, the pt had a similar thrombocytopenic episode in [**2193-1-20**] when she was hospitalized for her renal tx rejection.
