Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 101891**] for high grade enterococcal bacteremia.
CT that admission showed bilateral central pulmonary emboli and a thrombus in the right common femoral vein.
An IVC filter was placed due to concern for cerebral emboli.
Course c/b sinus bradycardia with junctional escape rhythm.
Presents day of admission with loose stool, nausea, vertigo and weakness.
ruled in for MI with CK 1169, MB 10.9, Tnt 2.25.
Past Medical History: * myxomatous mitral valve prolapse with mild-moderate MR and early LV volume overload * hypertension * gout * peripheral vascular disease * hypercholesterolemia * aortic stenosis with moderate aortic insufficiency * chronotropic incompetence, even with 2 mg Atropine on [**2162-3-3**] * kidney stone * ulcer  Social History: retired orthodondist, quit smoking about 10 years ago.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Partial mitral leaflet flail, no vegetation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed withglobal hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior wall.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated LV cavity with severe global LV hypokinesis and regional  akinesis of the inferior wall c/w multivessel CAD.
Partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with moderate to severe, eccentric MR.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed critical CAD.
The LAD had a 90% proximal stenosis and an 80% mid-vessel stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension and a severely depressed cardiac output.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferolateral and inferior, apical and distal anteroseptal akinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Successful rotational athetrectomy of the mid and proximal LAD followed by stenting of the mid and proximal LAD with two overlapping Drug Eluting Stents.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The proximal LAD had a 90% stenosis and a 90% mid stenosis.
Successful Rotational Atherectomy of the proximal and mid LAD with 1.25 burr, followed by successful stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5x12mm Taxus DES and of the proximal LAD with a 2.5x12mm Taxus DES (See PTCA comments).
Succesfsul stenting of the Left Main with a 3.5x12mm Taxus  TEE [**2163-3-24**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 82yo M with NSTEMI with CHF exacerbation.
In the CCU, he had an emergent TTE which revealed a worsened EF (10%) and inferior wall akinesis, as well as severe global LV hypokinesis.
Because of these new findings, he was taken emergently to the cath lab, where an IABP was placed.
He was placed on milrinone for inotropic support.
Because of his history of enterococcal bacteremia with questionable endocarditis, it was originally hoped that he did not need to go emergently to the OR (although he had completed 4 weeks antibiotics).
From ID standpoint, as mentioned above, he had enterococcal bacteremia with questionable endocarditis for which he completed 4 weeks of treatment.He grew coag negative staph from [**1-27**] blood cx bottles from [**3-18**].
However, a repeat TTE showed a possible vegetation, which prompted a TEE, which confirmed that there were no vegetation.
Patient remain afebrile and asymptomatic.
