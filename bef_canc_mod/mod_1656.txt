No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Reason: Evaluate right pneumothorax  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 89 year old man with MR s/p CABG/MVR s/p chest tube pull.
with small right pneumothorax REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate right pneumothorax PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2119-12-17**] AT 08:42 HOURS.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
Near-complete left lower lobe collapse is also again evident.
Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation.
The previously noted right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed.
No pneumothorax is evident.
