The EKG obtained, showed a left bundle branch block and the patient was transferred for stress test with nuclear imaging on [**2102-2-21**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with hypokinesis of the septal and inferior walls and reversible ischemia of the apical wall.
The patient denies history of chest pain or shortness of breath.
The patient underwent an elective cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2102-4-21**], which showed LAD disease.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on hospital day #1, which showed an 80% to 90% LAD lesion and the patient is status post PCA to the LAD.
The patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
In addition, the patient had a witnessed syncopal episode with brief loss of consciousness arising from supine to standing.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient's right groin (from the first cardiac catheterization, showed a moderate ecchymoses around the groin site with no appreciable bruit.
Left groin showed small hematoma, but again no appreciable bruit.
CT of the abdomen was done, which showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient subsequently had two bowel movements with bright red blood per rectum and stool mixed with blood clots.
Following their evaluation, the patient had a third bowel movement with no bright red blood per rectum.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denied any history of bright red blood per rectum or melena.
The patient reports history of intermittent abdominal pain for the past one year, described as a diffuse, sharp pain reduced by passing flatus.
The patient had a barium enema approximately six months ago, which the patient reports was negative.
The patient's pain was attributed to constipation and the patient was placed on high-fiber diet with the use of Dulcolax suppositories p.r.n.
On admission, the patient reported worsening abdominal pain on the four to five days prior to admission.
The patient denies any history of chest pain, shortness of breath, or orthopnea.
The patient had no nausea or vomiting.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  The patient has no history of hypertension or tobacco use.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient walks two miles a day with no shortness of breath.
Radiographic imaging:  CT of abdomen and chest revealed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray:  No evidence of cavity lesion.
The rounded opacity in the region of the aortic knob likely corresponds with ectatic aneurysmal dilation of the arch of the aorta.
However, given the relative paucity of adjacent vessels and the presence of linear atelectasis in this region, partial obstructing mass cannot be entirety excluded.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course during the MICU:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with no history of coronary artery disease, who presented to his physician with the complaint of fatigue.
The EKG was abnormal leading to stress test with nuclear imaging and subsequent cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization revealed the following:  One vessel coronary artery disease with a 99% mid LAD stenosis, status post PTCA and stenting of LAD.
The patient subsequently developed lower GI bleed and was transferred to the MICU.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is status post cardiac catheterization revealing one vessel coronary artery disease status post PTCA and stenting of the LAD.
Of note, the patient has no history of chest pain or shortness of breath.
Given episode of hypotension during acute bleed, the patient's Mavik and Atenolol were held during the MICU course.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient transferred to the MICU after an episode of bright red blood in the stool.
The patient had no prior history of melena or bright red blood per rectum and reports normal barium enema approximately six months ago.
The patient had no recurrent bright red blood per rectum during his MICU stay.
