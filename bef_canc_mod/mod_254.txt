She has become increasingly short of breath for 3-4 weeks, but particularly in the last week.
Two days ago she was able to walk up a flight of stairs but became extremely winded with this exertion.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-/2152**] for rx of multifocal pna requiring an ICU stay, bipap but no intubation; in [**5-7**] for treatment of achalasia with botox injections; and in [**10-7**] for dyspnea thought to be due to a uri.
EKG showed AF@90, mild right axis, RBBB, diffuse down sloaping ST segments and NTW which are more pronounced compared to previous tracing and are consistent with digitalis effect.
CXR showed hyperinflation, elarged heart shadow, vascular congestions and increased bilateral effusion.

Resolution of pulmonary edema.
ECHO: [**2152-12-13**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate-to-severe (3+)] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular dilation with preserved function.
Anterior mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

# Dyspnea: Presentation was consistent with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
Patient was initially given antibiotics for concern for pneumonia especially given her recent history of infection.
Antibiotics were discontinued on admission as it was felt that pneumonia was less likely in the absence of an elevated white blood cell count, fever, or productive cough.
Respiratory status and lower extremity edema improved and she was transferred to the floor.
Beta blockade was held due to bradycardia but restarted at 12.5 mg prior to discharge.
She does not have symptoms of digitalis toxicity besides an isolated episode on n/v in the ED.
Her EKG is not concerning for digitalis toxicity as the qrs interval is normal, there are no PVCs, and the rate is normal.
#Elevated Lactate: No acidosis.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent increased work of breathing and lactate immediately decreased.
# Bradycardia- Patient had asymptomatic bradycardia with rates in the 30-60s.
#Elevated Potassium: Resolved without intervention.
#Osteoporosis: Patient was continued on calcium and vit D supplementation  Transitional Issues: -Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] regarding her heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
