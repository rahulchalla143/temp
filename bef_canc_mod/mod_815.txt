To evaluate his esophagus(given intraoperative use of TEE), a barium swallow was performed which found no evidence of stricture.
The rheumatology service found no contraindication for surgery as there was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension which is the main operative concern in CREST patients.
He also had no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis on preoperative chest x-ray.
It is recommended that he should followup with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59350**] at [**Hospital1 112**] for routine CREST care including high resolution Chest CT and esophageal evaluation in the future.
