HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female  with complicated past medical history significant for squamous  cell  lung  cancer  status  post  left  upper  lobe resection in [**2115**], multiple pneumonia, ischemic colitis.
The   patient   has   been  discontinued  to rehabilitation  late  in  [**Month (only) 956**],  [**2116**] on TPN and NPO with exception  to  medications  due to ischemic colitis for which the patient needs elective hemicolectomy.
At the rehabilitation, she has been gradually weaned from the ventilator,  but  had recent fever spikes and the sputum grew Methicillin  resistant  Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
These  were  treated  with Cefotetan and Vancomycin with mild improvement,  however, the patient spiked a fever and at this time  she  only  grew  out Klebsiella in her sputum.
She was started  on  Imipenem  for her Klebsiella pneumonia.
Over the  last  three  to  four  days,  the patient had increasing abdominal  distention.
She was complaining of nausea and had bilious  emesis.
The  NG  tube was placed on suction and the abdominal x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel and air fluid levels.
On  admission, the patient denied abdominal pain, and nausea.
On  arrival,  she  had a moderate-sized, green bowel movement guaiac-positive.
Squamous cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**8-24**], status post left upper lobe resection on [**9-24**].
Multiple  pneumonias  with  Pseudomonas  klebsiella and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Recurrent C. difficile colitis.
Ischemic colitis.
History of partial small bowel obstruction.
History   of  coronary  artery  disease  status  post catheterization  with three-vessel disease and stenting times two.
Status post non-Q-wave MI in [**8-24**].
Intermittent atrial fibrillation.
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Breast cancer status post right mastectomy.
Oropharynx with upper  dentures,  clean  and moist with poor lower dentition.
ABDOMEN:   Soft, but distended with good bowel sounds,  nontender,  no guarding or rebound.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or   edema   with   difficult   to   palpate  distal  pulses.
There was a slight right sided effusion.
Dilated loops of bowel mainly on the left side, however, air is seen throughout to the rectum.
HOSPITAL  COURSE:    In summary, the patient is a 74-year-old female   with  complicated  past  medical  history  including squamous  cell  lung  cancer,  status  post  left  upper lobe resection,    ischemic   colitis,   CMV   colitis,   multiple pneumonias, coronary artery disease, presenting with three to four  days  of  nausea  and vomiting abdominal distention, as well as fungemia with [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has history of fungemia with  [**Female First Name (un) 564**],  which  was  treated with Fluconazole.
In  addition,  the patient was found to be bacteremia with Staphylococcus, coagulase negative, which was resistant  to  Methicillin, but sensitive to Vancomycin.
She  had ophthalmological examination of her eyes, with no evidence of Candidal ophthalmitis.
In  addition,  the  patient underwent CT scan of her abdomen, which  did  not  reveal  any abscesses or localized source of infection.
GI:    The  patient  presented  with nausea, vomiting, abdominal  distention,  suggestive of small-bowel obstruction base on her abdominal film showing gas all the way through to the  rectum.
She  was  judged  to  have  partial small-bowel obstruction.
She underwent colonoscopy, which revealed  stricture at 25 cm from her rectum.
CT scan of her abdomen  was  obtained,  which had no evidence of small-bowel obstruction  or  ischemic colitis.
The Department of Surgery followed  the  patient  throughout  the  hospital and did not think  that  she  would  be a good candidate for the elective left-sided hemicolectomy for her history of ischemic bowel.
The blood gases, drawn at that time, showed an acute respiratory acidosis.
With  her  first  seizures,  the  patient underwent a head CT scan,  which  did not show any hemorrhage or new stroke.
An EEG was obtained, which did not  reveal  any  epileptiform  activity,  however, it showed generalized  slowing,  indicative  of  severe encephalopathy.
On [**2-21**], discussion with the patient's husband, as well  as her daughter, was undertaken regarding the patient's code  status and the patient's code status was changed to DNR with no pressor, CPR, or shock.
