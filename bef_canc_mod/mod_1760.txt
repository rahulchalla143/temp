Admission Date:  [**2112-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-11-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Morphine / Ultram  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, AFib  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement, INTUBATION, bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness:  Ms. [**Known firstname 110553**] [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Persian speaking woman with a history of CLL and non-Hodkins lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and recent recurrence of herpes zoster with subsequent postherpetic neuralgia.
She did not lose conciousness or bleed.
Initially she had some pain in her lower back, sacrum, and bilateral legs but was still able to ambulate with a cane as she does at home baseline.
However, as days went by the pain in her buttocks and bilateral extermities has worsened to the point that for the past 4-5 days she has been unable to ambulate with her cane.
Because of these worsening symptoms she finally came to the hospital.
Labs were significant for WBC of 11.3, negative cardiac enzymes, chem 7 within normal limits, and UA with moderate blood.
They reported normal rectal tone with an essentially normal neuro exam except for slightly decreased muscle bulk.
No UMN signs.
They recommended C-spine and L-spine MRI and admission for pain control.
Hit head and landed on buttocks but was able to ambulate around normally the next day and had been doing fine/improving until yesterday at when she suddenly developed pain in lower back, buttocks, and bilateral lower extermities that became excruciating later in the day.
Pt had one episode of uninary incontinence after acute pain onset.
No stool incontinence.
Pt has been drinking plenty of fluid and making uring over the last week.
Pt contracted shingles 1 month ago and was receiving gabapentin and fentanyl patch for shingles pain - these helped although somewhat loopy with fentanyl.
Shingles seemed to be improving recently and rash had scabbed over but had been down entire left leg starting at hip.
Otherwise she has been very healthy with reports of only CLL and some respiratory problems with a few bad PNAs per the grandson.
On the morning of [**10-28**], she went into atrial fibrillation with RVR with HRs in the 160s - 180s; she developed a rate related LBBB at this time and was not otherwise symptomatic.
2.5 mg of IV diltiazem was given with restoration of sinus rhythm almost immediately.
Her O2 sats were holding 90s-95 % on 2 L.  Given her new onset atrial fibrillation, especially in setting of recent bedrest and fracture, a CTA was ordered but has not yet been performed.
Given her persistent hypotension with no improvement in BP following fluids, she was transferred to MICU for further monitoring.
Hypogammaglobulinemia with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, improved with IVIG replacement therapy.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy (Stage 3, T3N1M0).
Pneumonia complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome in [**1-31**].
Pneumonia with prolonged intubation [**4-30**] 8.
Ejection fraction greater than 60%, mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension on an echocardiogram from [**2105-1-28**].
Chronic low back pain 10.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS HR 87, BP 100/52, 100% O2 sat, RR 10 Gen: Well appearing female in no apparent distress HEENT: Anicteric, dry mucous membranes Cardiac: irregular rhythm, no appreciable murmurs Pulm: clear bilaterally Abd: very soft and nontender Ext: no edema noted .
No evidence of superimposed consolidation.
Minimal interval increase in right upper lobe nodule now measuring 6 mm.
******This should be reevaluated in three months' time with a high-resolution CT so that the interstitial lung disease can also be adequately evaluated **********  DISCHARGE LABS:  [**2112-11-16**] 03:30AM BLOOD WBC-10.6 RBC-3.30* Hgb-9.6* Hct-30.0* MCV-91 MCH-29.2 MCHC-32.2 RDW-17.7* Plt Ct-520* [**2112-11-16**] 03:30AM BLOOD Glucose-88 UreaN-14 Creat-0.3* Na-140 K-3.7 Cl-92* HCO3-46* AnGap-6* [**2112-11-16**] 03:30AM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-2.8 Mg-1.7  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CLL s/p IVIG with recent history of zoster, now presenting with fall at home with small displaced sacral fracture, who developed hypotension in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR unresponsive to IVFs and was transferred to the ICU.
# Hypotension: Initially in setting of receiving IV diltiazem.
With antibiotics treating for UTI and possible pneumonia.
On discharge patient had sustained SBPs in 90s.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for respiratory failure/altered mental status on [**2112-11-4**].
She continued to be hypotensive and had trouble weaning for several days.
She was extubated successfuly once her pulmonary edema improved on [**2112-11-13**] and was started on a Kosher Diet.
Patient was also treated with Vanco and Cefepime for possible aspiration/health-care associated pneumonia for 8 days.
# Afib with RVR - Started on [**10-28**].
Sacral fracture: Patient sustained a sacral fracture on day of admission.
Opioids/narcotics should be avoided as patient becomes quite sedated with minimal doses.
Also, would recommend avoiding NSAIDs - patient developed decreased UOP and eos in urine, suggestive of possible AIN.
# UTI: Patient was diagnosed with UTI and treated with ciprofloxacin.
Patient was asymptomatic on discharge.
Gabapentin was held during admission because of concern for sedative properties.
No further complaints of thigh pain.
# Eosinophilia: Throughout the hospital stay the patient had intermittent eosinophilia.
An eosinophilic lung process was considered unlikely even her clinical improvement without steroids.
Recommend ongonig trend of eos count and surveying for signs of allergic reaction.
