Admission Date:  [**2182-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: PNA, aortic stenosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2182-4-30**] Intubation at other hospital [**2182-5-8**] Bronchoscopy at other hospital [**2182-5-14**] Tracheostomy [**2182-5-14**] PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: 75F h/o COPD, severe AS, admitted [**4-29**] to OSH with 1 week of weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oral intake.
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because of difficulty extubating.
CXR revealed RLL consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions.
She was admited to the medical floor for treatment of PNA and hyponatremia, with CTX/azithromycin, and gentle IVF hydration.
Cardiology consult was obtained given concern for CHF on CXR and known severe aortic stenosis.
Recs were to rule out endocarditis with TTE, and obtain renal and pulmonary consults.
Repeat TTE on [**5-7**] raised concern for mitral valve vegetation.
On [**5-8**] pt was noted to have moderate amounts of blood from her ET tube.
An emergent bronchoscopy was performed, while pt was on coumadin and lovenox, which revealed bleeding from the inferior segment of the lingula on teh left, into which 10mL of epinephrine were injectied in addtion to cautery.
CXR at that time revealed an effusion on teh right side which was drained via thoracentesis, removing 800cc of yellow fluid.
A urology consult was obtained given hydronephrosis [**2182-4-30**] (R kidney 10.9, left 10.2, with mild hydronephrosis), which recommended monitoring the patients creatinien and consideration of CT ABD/PEVLIS.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today given difficulty weaning from the ventilator, concern for contribution from critical AS, and consideration of valve surgery.

6/11-13/09 Bcx: No growth.
[**2182-5-9**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats and occasional atrial bigeminy.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-10-28**] there is frequent atrial ectopy.
Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and emphysema and persistent right pleural effusion.
No specific sign of cholecystitis.
Urothelial thickening involving the renal pelves bilaterally, right greater than left, and given the bilateral findings, this may represent chronic urinary tract infections, particularly fungal.
Also increased echogenicity of the kidneys bilaterally, likely reflecting chronic medical renal disease.
Subtle diffuse hepatic nodularity, suggesting the possibility of chronic liver disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions and minimal ascites.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is a large globular mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-20**], the left atrial myxoma is no longer present.
There is now a mass on the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with endocarditis.
[**2182-5-10**] CT CHEST: Gravity-dependent consolidative opacities bilaterally with high attenuation material in the left base suggestive of hemorrhage.
[**2182-5-17**] MRI BRAIN: There are multiple small areas of acute infarct seen in both supra- and infratentorial regions.
In both cerebral hemispheres, multiple small areas of infarcts are seen in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes as well as in the periventricular region and both thalami.
In the posterior fossa in both cerebellar hemispheres, left middle cerebellar peduncle and right side of the pons demonstrate foci of acute infarct seen.
There is a small area of blood product seen in the left parietal subcortical region as seen on the previous CT.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Mild brain atrophy is seen.
IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral acute infarcts in the supra- and infratentorial region.
[**2182-5-17**] MRA OF THE HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates bilateral fetal posterior cerebral artery with consequent small vertebrobasilar system.
No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty .
# Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, with contributions from apparent RLL PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis, RLL pleural effusion s/p 800cc thoracentesis (transudative), and an episode of pulmonary hemorhhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation.
She was intermittently diuresed for volume overload and kept net even daily thereafter.
CT Chest showed hemorrhage, atelectasis and evidence of severe COPD.
Bronchoscopy was performed and showed blood near lingula -> likely from suction trauma in setting of high INR.
Weaning of vent attempted without success.
Unclear what her baseline functional status is, as per her husband, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
She had been "sleeping all the time" the past few weeks, so unclear if she has been having symptoms of CHF.
Cardiology evaluationed for valvuloplasty and felt that she was extremely high risk and recommended not to proceed with valvuloplasty.
# ARF: No known renal dysfunction.
Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by urology with plan to follow clinically.
Renal u/s showed potential chronic UTI, especially fungal.
Urine cx grew yeast despite foley changes; ID recommended no further treatment as the fungal infection would only return in 14 days after treatment.
# Anemia: Hct slowly trended down over several days in the hospital.
Hemolysis labs negative.
# Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.
Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence of RUQ process, although though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
RUQ U/S here consistent with chronic liver disease and LFTs remained stable throughout stay.
CT surgery was consulted who felt that she was not a surgical candidate for multiple reasons including HIT positivity, recent embolic events, renal failure, operative mortality for two valves, and significant aortic valvular calcifications.
# H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated, although held in the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrage.
Anticoagulation was discontinued here after TTE showed no atrial thrombus.
# C. Difficile Colitis - Prior to discharge, she was found to be C. difficile positive and started on po vancomycin since she was not actively having diarrhea.
# Sacral decub: Admitted with stage 2 sacral decub.
A rheumatology note indicates she takes percocet for chronic intermittent chest wall pain.
# Anxiety: per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
# Elevated FSBS: no known history of DM, but on steroids, with elevated FSBS.
# H/o SVT: Cardizem in setting of severe AS.
# Goals of Care: Family was presented with the poor prognosis of mitral valve endocarditis in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
Since the patient is not a surgical candidate, even if medical management of the mitral valve endocarditis is successful, her prognosis given the critical aortic stenosis is poor.
# Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.
