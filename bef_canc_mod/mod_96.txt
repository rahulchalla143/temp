Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 12182**] Admission Date: Discharge Date: [**2116-8-4**] Date of Birth: Sex: Service:   ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with a 6 mm left internal carotid artery aneurysm.
On admission, CTA showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely secondary to a 6 mm aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation.
At the time of admission, he was found to have positive carotid and cardiac enzymes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
No medications.
No medications.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Carotid stenosis, 70 percent right internal carotid artery blockage.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He had a thyroidectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He had a right facial droop.
CTA at the time of admission showed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a 6 mm aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left internal carotid artery and left MCA; positive for intraventricular bleed.
The plan at that time was for Mr. [**Known lastname 12183**] to have a diagnostic angiogram with possible coiling.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2116-6-2**], the patient was given a ventricular drain to relieve pressure of his subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There were no complications.
On [**2116-6-2**], he underwent an angiogram with coiling of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm.
Cardiology saw the patient on [**2116-6-3**] at neurosurgery's request regarding his elevated troponin level and the electrocardiogram changes.
At that time, as stated, the electrocardiogram changes were likely representative of cerebral T waves and are unlikely to be due to a myocardial ischemia.
The elevated troponin may represent demand ischemia in the setting of an acute illness.
Otherwise, there were no interventions needed.
On [**2116-6-5**], the patient was reintubated for worsening congestive heart failure.
Slight blood tinged drainage oozing around the stoma was noted.
The patient continued to spike fevers and had difficulty with his tracheostomy and CTA showed bilateral large pulmonary effusions.
Infectious disease felt effusions were consistent with congestive heart failure and fever.
On [**2116-6-27**], culture showed nosocomial meningitis, Pseudomonas.
On [**2116-6-28**], infectious disease said that the patient still had pseudomonas meningitis and was being treated with systemic Cefazolin and intrathecal Gentamycin.
On [**2116-6-29**], the patient developed a fever still with nosocomial meningitis.
The patient had a complete fever work- up at this time.
They advised to continue Vancomycin and Flagyl empirically and continue Ceptaz for pseudomonas and consider repeat chest x-ray if still with fevers.
Infectious disease agrees that if cultures are negative, it is okay to proceed with ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Initial attempt was complicated by venous bleeding.
The patient continued to show elevated white blood cells and PNMT's with high protein and low glucose in his cerebrospinal fluid, suggestive of recurrent nosocomial meningitis.
The patient is a 77 year old male in mild acute renal failure, developed slowly over the past ten days.
Renal failure starting 10 to 12 days after beginning high dose Gentamycin, in the setting of Vancomycin and fevers consistent with Gentamycin toxicity.
This would fit with his high urine sodium.
Renal attending agreed with this and states that he has been on intravenous Gentamycin for treatment of meningitis for two courses.
Please add on serum Gentamycin level to determine whether there is a continuing effect from the IT therapy.
On [**7-20**], renal consult, Gentamycin toxicity leading to mild acute renal failure, is improving slowly.
Continue to follow renal consult.
Over the next several days, the patient's lumbar puncture continued to show elevated intracranial pressures.
Glucose was increasing over several days.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed without complication and he was sent to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
