[**2149-1-31**] 03:50PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.09* [**2149-1-31**] 10:00PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.08* [**2149-2-1**] 03:13AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-0.08*  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] is a 75 year old man who presented with acute on chronic diastolic HF thought to be due to secondary to pneumonia.
#.DYSPNEA: likely multifactorial in the setting of pneumonia with acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation.
Another possibility is new atrial fibrillation with worsening CHF.
On admission, he was found to have bilateral crackles, elevated BNP (althought not drastically above previous levels), lower extremity and cardiac wheeze on exam which were consistent with CHF exacerbation.
Besides new afib, another potential trigger for CHF exacerbation is likely infection given PNA on CXR.
In light of CHF exacerbation and history of AS a repeat echo was obtained and demonstrated normal cavity size and global systolic function (LV > 55%) as well as minimal aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 21 torr.
Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] was discharged on torsemide 40mg PO daily and metolazone as needed (take 2 tabs if weight gain) as well as metoprolol and nitroglycerin.
Given comorbidities and CHADS2 score of 4, we initially elected to bridge with heparin while coumadin became therapeutic but in light of prior bleed decided to hold on anticoagulation.
#.CAD: We doubted ischemia as a cause for the CHF exacerbation as he denied chest pain, CE were negative, and EKG does not meet Sgarbossa criteria.
Patient on appropriate cardiac medications except for a statin (as patient has had a low LDL off statins) and ACE-I (no history of systolic dysfunction and CKD).
#.RIGHT INDEX FINGER PAIN: While admitted, Mr. [**Known lastname 105012**] complained of right index finger pain secondary to presumed gouty arthritis.
He underwent surgery for this chronic index finger pain in [**2148-12-22**].
He espoused decreased range of motion and pain consistent with prior flares of arthritis.
He did not demonstrate any warmth or erythema concerning for infection.
