In the late [**2092**]'s, the patient was run over by a train and has since required multiple reparative operations since that time.
The patient has also had multiple dilatations and ablative therapy without sustained efficacy.
The patient most recently had his tracheal T tube removed, and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].
Upon examination, the patient's airway demonstrated a normal larynx with a subglottic stenosis starting at the level of the first tracheal ring and extending for about 1.5 cm.
Patient's tracheal lesion was noted to have an anterior and lateral stenosis from granulation and scarring while posteriorly, the membranous wall was noted to be floppy, producing some degree of obstruction.
The overall effect of these lesions was noted to be significant narrowing of the lumen resulting in upper respiratory stridor and shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 57%.
Right lower lobe pulmonary embolus in [**2125-1-31**].
Pacemaker placement for complete heart block.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Prior history of acute respiratory distress syndrome and coma.
History of abdominal aortic aneurysm with graft infection.
History of Pseudomonas sepsis.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Multiple abdominal surgeries.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2125-6-19**] to the Thoracic Surgery Service for preoperative workup.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was noted to have an intraoperative estimated blood loss of 150 cc.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with an intact neck retention suture.
Patient was noted to have bilateral breath sounds.
On the evening of postoperative day #2, the patient demonstrated an acute period of hypotension during which period he was noted to have otherwise stable vital signs including adequate heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
Followup bronchoscopy conducted on postoperative day #2 demonstrated a mild amount of respiratory secretions which were removed effectively with suctioning.
The tracheal surgical site was noted to be well approximated and healing well.
On postoperative day #4, the patient was noted to demonstrate some mild respiratory stridor, and was advised to diminish his speaking to allow for greater surgical site rest.
Due to some mild erythema at his neck surgical site, the patient was started on oral levofloxacin on postoperative day #5 on which he remained for the duration of his stay.
On the evening of postoperative day #5, the patient was noted to have yet another episode of acute hypotension with systolic pressures falling to the mid 60's.
Following review of the patient's past medical records, it was noted that the patient had exhibited similar episodes of unexplained hypotension on prior admissions, which were at that point ascribed to adrenal insufficiency in the setting of steroid discontinuation and the patient on chronic low dose steroid therapy.
The following day, postoperative day #6, the patient, however, demonstrated another acute episode of hypotension which subsequently was noted to self resolve.
Cardiology noted no evidence for an acute cardiac event given normal electrocardiogram tracings obtained during the course of all three acute hypotensive episodes.
Endocrine consultation deemed the patient's episode less likely to be attributable to adrenal insufficiency, considering the patient had experienced an additional episode of hypotension following reinstitution of his steroid therapy.
Nevertheless, Endocrine recommended continuation of the patient's steroid schedule with prednisone 10 mg po q day and advised followup on an outpatient basis with the autonomic dysfunction laboratory.
Thereafter, the patient was noted to remain stable for the duration of his stay with no additional acute episodes of hypotension.
On the evening of postoperative day #6, the patient was noted to have increasing erythema and swelling at the site of his neck incision.
The patient's neck incision was subsequently aspirated with drainage of [**11-14**] cc of serosanguinous fluid and no evidence of purulence.
The patient was thereafter begun on Flagyl, as well as levofloxacin, and his neck wound left open to heal with regular dry sterile gauze dressing changes.
Repeat bronchoscopy conducted on postoperative day #7 demonstrated an intact anastomosis with some persistent granulation tissue noted at the patient's stent site.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to home with services and instructions for followup.
Home VNA for daily wound evaluation and dressing changes with dry sterile gauze.
