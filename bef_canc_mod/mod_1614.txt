History of Present Illness: 59 year old female with breast cancer status-post bilateral mastectomies in [**2120**], complicated by subsequent non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy related to adriamycin toxicity, admitted for elective R TKA.
At that point, she developed onset of SOB and lightheaded, without chest pain.
Stat transthoracic echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion, 2+ mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, global hypokinesis, and EF 30-35%.
Review of systems negative for PND, orthopnea, or DOE (activity limited by knee).
Past Medical History: History of breast cancer - b/l mastectomy; tx with adriomycin, taxol, XRT Congestive heart failure/CM- EF 25%; [**12-26**] adriomycin Gastric ulcers.
History of gram-negative sepsis.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia - tx with amioderone.
Left knee arthroplasty.
Chronic renal failure.
Hyponatremia Thyroid cyst   Social History: Pt lives in [**Location 47**] with husband and son.
Non [**Name2 (NI) 1818**]   Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: Vital signs: T 97.9, BP 115/58, HR 89, RR 20, O2 sat 100% 3.5L; pulsus to 15 on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, oropharynx clear CV: Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at apex Chest: Scattered wheezes on right, otherwise clear BS bilaterally Abdomen: Soft, NT, +BS Extr: Mild edema on right, right knee dressing clean, dry, intact Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3, non-focal  Pertinent Results: TTE ([**2126-12-6**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2126-3-19**], global left ventricular ssytolic function is slightly improved and the left ventricular cavity is smaller, the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.
R KNEE FILMS: Right knee: Two views show new total knee arthroplasty without complication.
There is post-surgical soft tissue swelling with joint effusion.
On POD #3, she developed onset of shortness of breath and lightheadedness, but denied chest pain.
A stat echocardiogram was signficant for no pericardial effusion (results detailed above).
Her elevated pulsus was presumed to have been exagerated by her subjective dyspnea.
She was transfused 2 units of pRBCs with lasix, and noted improvement in her dyspnea and LH.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Right Knee Osteoarthritis 2.
Congestive Heart Failure 3.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: good.
short term rehab needs.
Discharge Instructions: Please report chest pains, shortness of breath, palpitations or other medical concerns to your primary physician.
