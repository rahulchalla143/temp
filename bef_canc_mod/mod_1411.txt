He went to an outside hospital where his CT head was consistent with a diffuse subarachnoid hemorhage.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: Head CT IMPRESSION: [**2140-7-30**]  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the bilateral temporal regions with blood noted in the fourth ventricle, not significantly changed in extent compared to the prior study.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2.5 mm broad-necked aneurysm of the basilar artery tip.
The patient has been taken for a conventional cerebral angiogram at the time of this dictation.
Apparent mild focal narrowing at the origin of the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery.
Cervical internal carotid atherosclerosis without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic and cervical spine as detailed above.
Prominent vessel in the midline upper lower thoracic spine which may represent a prominent vein/increased vascularity related to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Spinal angiography is more sensitive to evaluate for pial AVM and is recommended if of clinical concern.
Radiology Report [**Numeric Identifier 75057**] VERT/CAROTID A-GRAM Study Date of [**2140-7-31**] 10:33 AM IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 1683**] presented with a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Two small lesions were found, and extensive evaluation was also done of the cervical spinal canal since there was significant subarachnoid blood in that region.
There was no evidence of spinal AV fistula.
Based on this bleeding pattern, we will also get an MRI of his cervical spine and thoracic spine prior to deciding on surgical approach to these aneurysms.
Radiology Report [**Numeric Identifier 83116**] CAROTID/CEREBRAL UNILAT Study Date of [**2140-8-1**] 8:54 AM FINDINGS: Left internal carotid artery arteriogram shows a 2 mm infundibulum of the left posterior communicating artery origin and a 2.4 mm aneurysm with a [**Date Range 15015**] neck of the anterior communicating segment.
Post-coiling, there is very faint filling of the left anterior communicating artery aneurysm at the base.
New small foci of subarachnoid blood in the paramedian bifrontal sulci.
Otherwise, extensive diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged.
Possible left atrial abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-7-30**] there is no significant change.
No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
No evidence of residual lumen of aneurysm; however, due to coil artifact, cannot exclude tiny residual lumen.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-8-7**] 10:54 AM IMPRESSION: Status post coiling of the ACA, with only minimal residual subarachnoid foci.
No new hydrocephalus.

On [**8-4**] late in the afternoon when the patient's wife was visiting she noticed that he was confused and perseverating about a web site that he couldn't find, knowing that he wasn't actively working on the computer.
There was no evidence of vasospasm or developing stroke on this study.
MRI/MRA showed prominent vessel in the midline upper lower thoracic spine which may represent a prominent vein, increased vascularity realted to SAH.
On [**8-7**], pt complaining of persistent headache, decadron and dilaudid added and CT scan ordered.
CT scan showed no change.
On [**8-8**], patient is alert and oriented x 3, full motor and no drift.
Percocet was added for pain control.
Medicine was consulted for HTN control.
He is neurological intact on the day of his discharge complaning of some chronic low back pain without headache at the time of assessment.
The patient was seen by the medicine service for his hypertension and was transitioned from captopril to lisinopril.
He continues to be orthostatic and will be followed at home for this and his hypertension by visiting nursing.
