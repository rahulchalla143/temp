He was admitted on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, and he was given a dose of cipro in the ED, but this was not continued on the floor.
His foley was changed, and urine culture showed preliminary culture showed >100K yeast, but no bacteria.
Other causes of altered mental status were considered.
The pt was on several medications which could cause altered mental status, most of which were presecribed by his nursing home and were not on his prior discharge summary dated [**2171-8-23**].
The pt's electrolytes were normal, his bicarb was WNL indicating no acute avid/base dirsorders, and tox screens were drawn and negative.
He was not having any acute [**Month/Day/Year 862**] activity, but his serum dilantin level was low on admission (see below).
Hypotension - Pt had some episodes of hypotension in the ED for which he was given IVF before being sent the the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His SBP did have some dips into the 90's which was felt to be related to autonomic dysfunction related to long standing MS with very little mobility, along with how the pt was not able to eat and hydrate ad lib due to his non-mobile state.
Urine culture showed yeast but no bacterial growth after 1 day.
Facial Pain - Pt has history of trigeminal neuralgia and TMJ pain.
On exam, the pt has very poor dentition, so the idea of oral abscess or other dental conditions was considered.
Dental consult was requested, who ordered mandibular films which showed non-specific findings.
They otherwise found no signs of acute abscesses on exam, and recomended panorex films when pt was stable for transport for further evaluation.
Back Pain - Pt was reporting some back pain on [**9-19**], which he attributed to lying in bed for the past 2 days.
He states that he does not have any specialized or electric wheelchair and that a regular chair suffices.
No acute issues currently.
Constipation - Continued most of the pt's outpatient bowel regimen (Held Miralax).
From prior d/c summary, pt apparently develops severe constipation if regimen is decreased, but he's doing well currently.
Bisacodyl Delayed Release 10 mg by mouth QAM prn constipation Carbamazepine 200 mg by mouth four times a day.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL injection PRN for Seizures.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Solution Sig: Two (2) mg Injection once a day as needed for anxiety.
