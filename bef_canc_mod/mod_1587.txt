Complaints of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath beginning one week prior led to echo [**7-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which demonstrated an EF of 40%, trace regurg, thickened mitral valve,  increasing pericardial effusion circumferential, no evidence of tamponade.
Office visit this AM due to increasing sob leading to inability to sleep, chest pain.
Echo demonstrating 3 cm anterior effusion with RA inversion and no signs of tamponade.
Admitted to CCU for hemodynamic monitoring, setting of pericardial effusion, obtundation, possible hx of CHF.

1+ pitting edema in extremities bilaterally Neuro: Appears stuporous, sleepy, snoring heavily.
Thickened mitral valve with trace regurgitation.
Persistent circumferential pericardial effusion slightly increased since [**2170-5-25**], no evidence of tamponade.
Head CT [**2170-7-13**] Stable appearance of the brain from [**2169-11-21**], without intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic lacunar infarcts within both basal ganglia, unchanged.
No blunting of costophrenic angles.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No evidence of florid pulmonary edema.
[**7-14**] TTE Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion (1.5-2.0 cm).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2170-1-8**], the effusion may be slightly bigger but there is no signs of tamponade.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion (small anteriorly; moderate inferolaterally).
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 78 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, stents, CHF EF 40% presented to PCP with shortness of breath pleuritic chest pain, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Known 3 cm pericardial effusion, echo in ED with no evidence of tamponade.
patient became unarousable in ED with blood sugar 28, given 3 AMPS D50 and admitted to the CCU.
# Pericardial effusion: has known h/o pericarditis with worsening chest pain and SOB.
Echo shows evidence of RA collapse.
Considered related to infectious, viral or autoimmune causes.
Repeated echo in preparation of possible pericardiocentesis given extent of effusion and concern for tamponade.
TTE [**7-14**] with no evidence of significant worsening effusion of tamponade.
Treated pain with cochicine [**Hospital1 **], per PCP pt did not achieve any relief from NSAIDS.
Rheumatology consult to determine treatment options for symptomatic pericardial effusion unable to be managed surgically.
# CAD: s/p CABG and stents: ECG unchanged.
No current s/sx ischemia .
Did not feel as though hydral likely cause of pericarditis and subsequent effusion.
BP markedly elevated, likely in setting of med non-compliance.
# altered mental status: likely [**2-22**] hypoglycemia in setting of pt takes large dose of lantus usually, decreased po intake on day of admission.
Has signs of prior lacunar infarcts on head CT. Likely pt is slow to improve mental status from hypoglycemia.
Head CT did not show acute bleed.
LFT's with no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.
Pt became alert and oriented, talkative within one day and was stable to discharge.
# DM: hypoglycemia as above.
Held Lantus, and neurontin for diabetic neuropathy.
# mild hypoxia - has h/o COPD.
Nebulizer treatments and cxr with no evidece of pulmonary edema or bleed.
# h/o depression: continued paxil.
# h/o prostate cancer: continued flomax.
# h/o hypoaldosteronismm: continue florinef.
