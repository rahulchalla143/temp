Pain noted in left hip at the time but plain films negative.
She was readmitted on [**11-18**] after being noted to have fever to 100 at CH in association with abd pain.
Pt's fever attibuted to pna (?
MRI showing left intertrochanteric fracture.
Pre-op CXR [**11-24**] showed increased effusion on R and increased infiltrate on L. Intra-op, spiked to 100.9, transiently on neosynephrine.
[**Name (NI) **], pt developed thick, copious secretions felt to preclude extubation.
Without complaints at this time.
s/p therapeutic tap [**2178-7-12**] admission -Diabetes Mellitus 2 -Esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension s/p banding after bleed in [**2171**].
Most recent EGD 5/06-2 cords of grade I varices were seen in the middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the esophagus non-bleeding and non-amenable to banding.
-GERD -HTN -Asthma -Depression/anxiety -history of UTI urosepsis [**12-14**] -s/p open CCY in [**Country 532**], [**2147**] -s/p removal of ovary, [**2147**]  Social History: Patient was admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**].
No EtOH, no tobacco, no IVDU.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.8 BP 126/50, P 78, Resp 20 98% on 3L General: Alert, no acute distress, no complaints HEENT: PERRL, extraocular motions intact, sclera mildly icteric, dry mucous membranes with some mucosal crusting Neck: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest: Decreased breath sounds R base, rhonchorous on L, difficult to auscultate lower lobes due to positioning CV: Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd: Soft, nontender, significant distention, hyperactive bowel sounds Extr: [**1-13**]+ pitting edema to knees b/l.
L hand in splint, left leg with bruising of medial thigh, patient propped on pillow for positioning of leg   Pertinent Results: CXR ([**2178-11-18**]): There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
There are increased interstitial markings bilaterally with areas of confluent opacities in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe concerning for asymmetrical pulmonary edema and/or aspiration.
CXR [**12-1**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2178-11-29**], there is again prominence of interstitial markings consistent with increased pulmonary venous pressure.
Opacification at the right base with preservation of pulmonary markings is consistent with a large pleural effusion.
Abdominal US: IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
BLE US: IMPRESSION: No DVT, bilateral lower extremities .
Left intertrochanteric fracture with varus angulation and marked surrounding muscular and soft tissue hematoma/edema including a 2.7 x 4.3 x 4.0 cm fluid collection containing hemorrhage posterior to the proximal left femur and contained within the gluteus minimus muscle.
Marked soft tissue swelling of the left hip and subcutaneous edema extending circumferentially around the proximal left thigh.
Not mentioned above, there is a focal area of increased signal on STIR sequence with a ring and arc configuration most consistent with enchondroma.
Marked pelvic ascites.
One view of both hips and the pelvis and four views of the proximal femur and two views of the distal left femur are submitted showing a nonhealed nonacute intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur with only mild superior overriding of the distal fracture fragment, and no dislocation of the mildly to moderately degenerated left hip joint.
There is no knee joint effusion, and the pelvic ring is intact.
Mid shaft fifth proximal phalanx fracture again seen.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
# L hip fx: Patient was taken to the OR by [**Month/Day (3) **] for a dynamic hip screw placement on [**11-25**].
She is weight bearing and requires rehab for physical therapy.
On tylenol and prn morphine for pain control Has some post-op edema in her L>R legs.
# Hep C/Cirrhosis with known esophageal varices and ascites: Patient had a diagnostic tap in the Emergency room prior to admission that was negative for SBP.
She has had evidence of volume overload and has been diuresis with IV lasix, however, has had a bump in her creatinine over the last few days.
# DM: On Lantus and insulin sliding scale.
# Macrocytic Anemia: She has been anemic since surgery, but stable.
Thought to be secondary to liver disease.
# Hand Fracture: Left sided 5th digit fracture s/p fall.
# Pt discovered to have a UTI on [**2178-12-1**].
Culture thus far shows no growth.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued on outpatient Citalopram .
Tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for SEVERE pain for 10 days.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
