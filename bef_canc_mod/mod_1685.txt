Patient tells me got up this morning around 8am, had a vitamin shake with ensure, that he usually takes three times a day.
Then went to the shower, and after felt a bit "queazy", and thats when he vomited out the milkshake, but no blood, just food.
Since last admission he had several small episodes of emesis, but no new bleeding since EGD.
But had no withdrawal episodes lately.
At that time he was intubated, with active bleeding, thought to be arterial at GE junction.
Pt had repeat EGD showing 3 grade [**1-8**] esophageal varices.
Overlying one of the varices was a linear ulcer with 3 clips distally.
No active bleeding.
Few other smaller ulcers at GEJ that looked like peptic injury.
No active bleeding.
There was some evidence of protal HTN gastropathy in body/fundus.
There was a 4mm polyp at junction of duodenal sweep.
No biopsies taken because of recent significant GI bleed.
