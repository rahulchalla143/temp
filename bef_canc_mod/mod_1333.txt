Admission Date:  [**2133-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2133-7-10**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old man with history of hypertension, coronary artery disease with three vessel disease status post cath, recent syncopal episode, arrhythmia status post pacemaker placement who presented to ER in respiratory distress.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for syncopal episode on [**2133-6-17**].
Prior to syncopal event, the patient had unusual feeling in chest with palpitations.
A cath was done on [**2133-6-18**] which revealed three vessel disease, the left main was 20% occluded distally, LAD 80% at bifurcation of diagonal, left circumflex 50% occlusion at proximal, RCA had total occlusion with filling from left to right collaterals.
An echo at that time showed an EF greater than 55%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, no AR, 1+ MR, mild symmetric LVH and borderline pulmonary hypertension.
EKG was suggestive of prior inferior wall infarct at that time showing Q's in 3 and AVF.
During the hospital course the patient had a new onset atrial fibrillation and DDD pacemaker was placed and patient was started on Amiodarone.
He went to the cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] on [**7-3**] where pacemaker was interrogated and one episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was noted on the pacer.
Wife says that patient's sleeping did improve over the last couple nights since switching medication.
The shortness of breath progressively worsened and patient was brought to the Emergency Room.
The patient denied chest pain at the time.
He was noted to have bilateral diffuse crackles [**1-25**] of the way up.
EKG at the time showed sinus tachy with questionable ST elevations in V1 and V2.
The patient was put on C-pap and given Morphine and Ativan for agitation and Lasix and started on Nitro drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, syncopal event, atrial fibrillation, right colon cancer, status post resection in [**2099**], left colon cancer status post resection in [**2115**], benign prostate hyperplasia status post prostatectomy in [**2116**], thalamic bleed secondary to hypertension in [**2125**] and a renal mass, hemorrhagic cyst in [**2129**].
He was lying in bed, sedated with C-pap mask on with deep breathing and no acute distress.
He had positive external jugular but no internal JVP was discernible.
No carotid bruit was appreciated.
His rate was regular S1 and S2 with questionable S4, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs had diffuse crackles, expiratory rhonchi and rales ??????
His CEA was elevated at 11.
His EKG on admission was heart rate 130, sinus tachy, no axis deviation, ST depressions in V5, V6 and 1 and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V1 through V3.
Chest x-ray was consistent with CHF.
Heparin was initially held secondary to his history of thalamic bleed and the fact that he had guaiac positive stools on his last admission on [**6-17**].
Beta blockers were also initially held secondary to his CHF.
His cath was reviewed two weeks earlier and showed severe three vessel disease with 90% lesions in the LAD and total occlusion of the RCA and 70% of left circumflex.
It was agreed upon that the patient would give a trial of medical management for the time being and if he became symptomatic, he would then go for PCI.
He had no longer had shortness of breath or chest pain and IV Heparin was discontinued and patient was started on beta blocker.
The patient had no symptoms of angina or chest pain or shortness of breath during the rest of this hospital course.
An echo was done on the first day of admission and it showed an EF of 30-40% LV systolic function moderately depressed, symmetric LVH, severe hypokinesis of anterior septum and anterior free wall, extensive apical HK, AK, no aortic stenosis, no AR, 1+ MR, pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal and no pericardial effusion was noted.
Compared to the echocardiogram done on [**6-17**], his overall LV function was significantly worse secondary to a major anterior septal infarct/injury.
Long-term anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis was determined to be unnecessary and would be too risky due to the patient's history of thalamic bleeding.
Rate & Rhythm:  The next morning after admission the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
EP was called and interrogated his  pacemaker device which showed that the patient was in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 6% of the time.
He was started on 25 mg of Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, during the course of his admission, he was noted to have a sustained run of atrial fibrillation lasting over three hours.
Pulmonary:  Patient initially was in respiratory distress requiring C-pap with pressor support with the face mask, however, after diuresis, the patient no longer required face mask and was put on nasal cannula for which he tolerated having good O2 sats.
Renal:  His creatinine was slightly higher on admission than baseline which is normally elevated between 1.6 and 1.8.
However, due to his past history of guaiac positive stool on last admission and the fact that he continues to have anemia, the patient should continue to follow-up with his GI doctor as an outpatient.
ID:  Patient initially had a slightly elevated white blood count, however, this fell during the course of admission and the patient remained afebrile.
There were no active neurological issues.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease with ischemic event, positive troponin.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
