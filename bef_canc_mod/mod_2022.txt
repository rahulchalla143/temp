On [**1-12**], she underwent ultrasound-guided thoracentesis of a right-sided pleural effusion.
Pleural fluid analysis showed a transudative effusion.
No pneumothorax or other complications occurred.
On chest x-ray from [**1-13**] it was again noted that she had left lower lobe collapse with white out of the left lung on chest x-ray and shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left.
Her respiratory status has remained stable despite the left lower lobe consolidation and remains stable status post bronchoscopy.
Her baseline abdominal examination reveals mild to moderate abdominal distention without tenderness, rebound or guarding and with normal bowel sounds.
If it is felt that she has recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis after the second course of antibiotics, the next logical step would be to treat this as a Metronidazole failure and start her on p.o.
The plan as far as completion colectomy in the future for her ischemic colitis is as follows:  She should be well enough to withstand another major surgery.
Hematology - The patient had an ultrasound of her left upper extremity to rule out a deep vein thrombosis given asymmetric swelling of this extremity.
Ultrasound was negative for clot.
Upper extremity swelling is felt to be secondary to infiltration of the PICC line that was previously in that arm.
