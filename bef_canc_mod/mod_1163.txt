Splenomegaly, with peripheral areas of hypoattenuation likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
[**2108-3-1**] Tagged RBC scan showed: Blood flow images show radiotracer demonstrated tranversely along the midabdomen also demonstrated on dynamic series that is likely related to free pertechnate layering along the dependent aspect of the stomach.
He underwent EGD which found transient bleed from cardia, old blood, and no bleed from duodenum.
Repeat EGD, twice on [**2108-2-27**], found clotted blood in the stomach.

Although tRBC scan showed bleed in the RUQ though to be from ascending colon, no bleed was seen from the SMA.
The patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable, requiring intermittent transfusions of blood products for intermittent unlocalizable GI tract bleeding and episodes of hypotension.
