Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination."
4 mm hypodensity within the pancreas, a nonspecific finding that could represent a dilated duct or pancreatic pseudocyst or cystic lesion.
Tiny, rounded, hypodense lesion within the right kidney, too small to accurately characterize but likely representing a cyst."
Withdrawal/N/V:  On HD#1, the patient was initially worked up for possible GI causes of n/v including gastroparesis, pancreatic disease, liver disease, infectious and obstruction.
He was also scheduled for a head CT to evaluate possible central causes of persistant n/v (including raised intracranial pressure).
While awaiting the head CT on the evening of HD#1, the patient developed symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal.
He was initially considered low risk for withdrawal as his tox screen was negative and he reported he had not had a drink for >10days secondary to n/v.
He then became tachycardic, diaphoretic with marked tremors and agitated.
The patient was given 40mg po valium without much effect.
In sum, he recieved 430mg of valium IV/PO and required a versed gtt to stabilize his symptoms of withdrawal.
Due to his signficant withdrawal symptoms the patient was maintained on a versed gtt.
He was subsequently transferred to the MICU where he was given more valium and observed for signs of respiratory depression.
Lab values on admission were consistent with significant alcohol abuse (elevated GGT, with AST>ALT at 2:1 ratio), therefore most of the symptoms of n/v may very well be due to alcohol withdrawal.
Pancreatic hypodensity: given the presenting symptoms of n/v as well as his history of ?pancreatitis - pancreatitis was on the differential, however, the patient has normal amylase and lipase in addition to a benign abd on physical exam.
Hematology: Pt with elevated total bili (mostly indirect) as well as elevated LDH suggesting he may be hemolyzing.
