Admission Date: [**2170-5-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2170-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-12-30**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure:  The patient was again status post trach on [**5-16**] secondary to failure to extubate.
Of note during this hospitalization, events including a VATS evacuation of the right hemothorax and  on [**5-9**].
The right hemothorax was thought to be secondary to a complication of chest compressions.
On follow-up x-ray upon discharge, the patient had a persistent right loculated pleural effusion.
CT Surgery was reconsulted before discharge, and they recommended no further treatment at this time given no acute worsening of respiratory status.
The patient remained trach dependent throughout this hospitalization and required 50 percent trach mask throughout his hospitalization.
Acute renal failure:  Of note, during this hospitalization on past discharge summary, the patient is thought to have acute renal failure secondary to ATN, which is secondary to cardiogenic shock, in addition to intravenous contrast given during his cardiac catheterization, over diuresis, and questionable  during the Intensive Care Unit stay.
The Renal Team felt that the patient has no acute indications to continue dialysis; however, upon discharge, his tunneled IJ catheter will remain in place given the patient's 10-year status and may need further hemodialysis in the near future.
The patient has anemia secondary to his renal disease and is on Epogen.
The patient is on Calcitriol secondary to increased PTH.
Additionally in terms of volume status and dialysis, the patient is to have daily weights checked and is to continue intravenous Lasix at the outside hospital.
Cardiovascular:  Of note during his MICU stay, the patient had an urgent cardiac catheterization showing severe jugular venous distension, including lesions in his left anterior descending coronary artery which were severe diffuse disease up to 80 percent in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
This was intervened on with three stents placed; however, his left circumflex continues to have a 70 percent lesion, a distal 90 percent lesion, and a 99 percent stenosis in the left posterior descending coronary artery.
This additionally bifurcated on one branch with an 80 percent stenosis of the lower branch and a 70 percent stenosis.
Once transferred to the floor, the patient had a hemodialysis session at which the patient complained of chest pain and had dynamic ST changes in lead V4 and V5 with ST depressions.
Of note, the patient has multiple wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram including an akinetic apex.
Based upon discharge to the floor, the patient had no runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
The patient is a likely candidate for EPF in the future and possible AICD placement.
The patient in the Medical Intensive Care Unit had a negative MRI and negative head CT.  Additionally, EEG showed diffuse changes consistent with a broad differential.
The patient was started on hemodialysis initially with thoughts that his uremia was causing these mental status changes; however, with dialysis, the patient's uremia improved; however, his mental status did not improve drastically.
Most likely the patient has a component of noxious brain injury given his episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post ST elevation myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Acute renal failure secondary to presumed ATN.
Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient is also to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] after acute renal failure resolves.
