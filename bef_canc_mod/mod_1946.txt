Admission Date:  [**2125-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-7-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Desipramine / Nortriptyline / Penicillins / Nsaids / Erythromycin Base / Sulfonamides / Ceclor / Aspirin / Doxycycline / Ticlid / Elavil / Neurontin / Vioxx / Bupropion / Latex / Singulair / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central line placement Arterial line placement Colonoscopy IR guided PICC line   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76yo female with HTN, HL, R lung mass, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, s/p open cholecystectomy and hysterectomy, who re-presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2126-8-19**] with nausea and abdominal pain just 3 days after she was discharged from this hospital following conservative management of a presumed ileus.
She initially presented on [**2125-8-5**] with 1 day of nausea, vomitting, and abdominal pain.
CT was consistent with generalized ileus.
A colonoscopy revealed severe diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and rectum with areas of lumenal narrowing, but no inflammation or obstructing mass.
She describes the pain as an ache that progressed to sharp pain.
She localizes the pain to a band passing from her L lower quadrant across her abdomen to the R upper quadrant.
She had dry heaves initially which progressed to severe nausea.
Father died of a PE after surgery.
Dry mucous membranes.
No guarding or rebound.
Mild discomfort with deep palpation R upper quadrant.
Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with fluid distension of the colon.
There is, however, caliber change at junction of descending/sigmoid colon, as was noted on the previous study.
These findings likely represent ileus, however, partial obstruction cannot be totally excluded.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and other vessels.
[**2125-8-13**] Colonoscopy: Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon and rectum.
Diverticulosis appeared to be severe with areas of luminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo female with HTN, HL, lung mass, and rheumatoid arthritis admitted for recurrent idiopathic ileus ([**2125-8-18**]), with hospital course complicated by acute decompensation in respiratory status due to saddle PE and heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
# Respiratory distress - Pt with acute decompensation in respiratory status at 12pm on [**8-22**].
However, pt remained tachypneic and tachycardic.
Pt had slight wheezing on physical exam so nebulizer treatments were given, dose of solumedrol was given as well but no improvement seen.
Lasix was then given for possibility of overload with no improvement.
Pt became hypercarbic and continued with increased work of breathing so she was intbuted and placed on AC mechanical ventilation; she had a recent associated episode of RUQ, right flank pain ([**8-21**]) two days prior which was concerning for pleuritic chest pain and PE.
A V/Q scan to eval for PE was indeterminate; LENIS were negative.
TTE showed dilated right ventricle which was could be correlated with PE.
MRA of chest showed saddle pulmonary embolus.
(Note: CT contraindicated secondary to an iodine allergy).
The patient was not felt to be a candidate for TPA due to her lung mass.
During this episode, the patient was intubated for respiratory distress, but upon discharge from the MICU was extubated successfully extubated and transferred on 2L NC saturating between 96-100%.
Plans are to repeat ECHO as outpatient in [**3-13**] months to assess long term cardiac damage s/p PE.
# Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - Pt had a drop in her platelet count by >50% from 132 to 56.
She was started on argatroban as above for her PE with transition to coumadin.
# Bacteremia - Gram positive cocci (Coagulase negative staphylococcus) grew from arterial line tip [**8-28**] in 1 of 4 sets of BC (other BC were from other sites).
# Ileus: Likely secondary to diverticulitis.
Surgery reviewed CT advised that stricture in sigmoid possibly secondary to diverticulitis.
Levofloxacin and flagyl were begun for empiric coverage of diverticulitis; pt completed a 14 day course of abx  # Diarrhea - Pt complaining of chronic diarrhea x50 yrs.
After ileus from admission resolved, diarrhea commenced once again.
Pt started on cholestryramine and nortryptaline per GI recs for symptomatic improvement.
Head CT showed no metastatic disease.
Given current labile state with PE and anticoagulation, held off on biopsy to be rescheduled on discharge.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Lipitor  # Tachycardia - Likely [**2-9**] PE and RV dysfunction and resolving as PE lyzed.
# Thrush - nystatin swabs.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.0 peaked at 1.3, currently 1 on discharge.
Creatine bump was likely prerenal in etiology; patient was dehydrated since NPO and Cr trended down with fluid repletion.
# PPX: Protonix and agatrobran bridged to coumadin; patient only on Coumadin upon discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: PE HIT Ileus  Secondary: Aortic atherosclerosis Allergic rhinitis Hypertension Spinal stenosis: h/o herniated cervical, lumbar disks with lumbar radiculopathy PUD Basal cell carcinoma Cerebrovasvular disease (small vessel infarcts) Hypercholesterolemia Rheumatoid arthritis Migraines Left eye blindness Depression Asthma R lung mass, currently being worked up as outpatient s/p cholecystectomy (open procedure) [**2101**] s/p hysterectomy ?
While you were being treated for this condition you developed a "pulmonary embolism" which is a blood clot in your lungs.
While you were being treated with "heparin", a type of blood thinner, you had a reaction to heparin which caused you to have low platelets in your blood.
Also during your time here, you completed a full course of antibiotics for "diverticulitis" or an infection in an outpouching of your bowel.
You also had a bacterial infection of your blood for which you are now taking an antibiotic called "vancomycin."
In addition to your new antibiotic and coumadin medications, some of your blood pressure medication doses have been changed due to fluctuations in your blood pressure and you have been started on new medications for your diarrhea.
Please return to the Emergency Department if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, or any other worrisome concerns.
