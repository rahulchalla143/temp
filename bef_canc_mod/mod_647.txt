The patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurologic observation.
His language was fluent with no dysarthria.
On [**2128-2-24**], the patient had repeat head CT which showed blossoming of the bilateral temporal contusions, now left greater than right with no midline shift.
Suprasellar cistern open and no hydrocephalus and a new right watershed infarct in the distal MCA region.
The patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt placed at that time for decreasing mental status.
The patient remained neurologically somewhat sleepy but arousable to voice.
They recommended a CTA of the neck which showed no evidence of carotid disease.
The patient had a transthoracic echo done on [**2128-2-25**], which compared to his prior study of [**2126-9-4**] showed left ventricular function more vigorous and mitral regurgitation more prominent.
The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2-25**], that showed a revolving infarct at the right MCA, otherwise no change.
MRI of the C-spine showed no evidence of ligamentous injury and no evidence of fracture.
He was seen by speech and swallow and failed a swallow evaluation and therefore had a feeding tube placed without complication.
