Admission Date:  [**2157-7-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-7-20**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, non-small-cell lung cancer, status post left pneumonectomy, and bladder cancer, status post transurethral resection, who presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room on the evening of [**2157-7-18**] after transfer from [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital.
She denies any syncope or loss of consciousness.
She did not note any symptoms of headache, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, sweating, or palpitations before the fall.
She did not experience any chest pain or shortness of breath either.
At the [**Hospital3 4527**] Emergency Department, her evaluation included a head CT, which was reported as showing a "intracranial bleed," and she was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**].
On arrival at the [**Hospital6 256**], the patient denied headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, vertigo, or dysphagia.
Work-up undertaken in the Emergency Department included consultations with Neurology and Neurosurgery, as well as a repeat head CT.
The head CT performed at [**Hospital6 256**] demonstrated an extraaxial hemorrhage in the region of the left cerebellar tentorium, which was felt to most likely represent a subdural hematoma.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam revealed a normocephalic, atraumatic head.
Lung exam revealed essential lack of breath sounds on the left.
Cardiac exam revealed an irregularly irregular pulse.
Extremity exam revealed trace peripheral edema.
The patient's speech was fluent without dysarthria.
The patient was noted to be mildly unsteady on exam of her gait.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter with a ventricular rate in the 60s.
There is left axis deviation.
Q waves consistent with a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction were noted in leads V1 through V4.
ST segment 1-2 mm elevations were seen in leads II, III, aVF, V5 and V6.
The patient's head CT, as noted, revealed extraaxial hemorrhage in the left cerebellar tentorial region.
No subarachnoid hemorrhage was seen.
There was no shift of midline structures.
There was periventricular white matter ischemic changes.
Because of her high INR, secondary to the Coumadin, which she was taking for her atrial fibrillation, the patient was administered fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K to correct her coagulopathy.
These neurological checks revealed no change in neurologic status.
At that point, more fresh frozen plasma and intravenous Vitamin K was administered.
This head CT revealed no interval change in the subdural hematoma.
Given her new electrocardiogram findings, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and enzymes were negative for myocardial infarction.
Given her neurologic stability and her lack of desire for neurosurgical intervention, the patient was discharged to home on the afternoon of [**2157-7-20**] with arrangements made for home nursing and home Physical Therapy.
Atrial fibrillation.
