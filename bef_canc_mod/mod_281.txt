Admission Date: [**2158-12-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2158-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-6-1**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was sent to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal pain, decreased colostomy output x 24 hours and increased abdominal pain.
Denied vomiting, fevers or chills.
She was seen at an outside hospital, and reportedly had a small-bowel obstruction.
Per report, she has had increasing abdominal pain coinciding with decreased ostomy output over the past 24 hours.
Per her husband, she had no vomiting, fevers or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for recurrent fungemia; Klebsiella pneumonia; VRE UTI; mesenteric ischemia; respiratory failure; end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis since [**2158-8-25**], the patient was actually due for hemodialysis on the day she presented to the ED; breast CA; status post chemo and radiation therapy; peripheral vascular disease; CAD; status post MI x 2; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; DM; chronic anemia; gout; depression.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Extended right colectomy with ileostomy in [**2158-4-24**], renal transplant in [**2143**], transplant nephrectomy in [**2158-10-25**], tracheostomy in [**2158-4-24**], breast lumpectomy, left BKA, right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] and popliteal-to-dorsalis pedis.
Abdomen was firm, distended, tympanitic, and diffusely tender to palpation; but no apparent peritoneal signs.
No masses or hernias.
There was brown fluid in the ostomy bag without air.
An admission, a chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral large pleural effusions and CHF.
A KUB demonstrated mildly dilated loops of small bowel, likely representing early or partial obstruction versus ileus with a moderate right pleural effusion.
This demonstrated bowel ischemia with pneumatosis of a loop of small bowel in the right lower quadrant.
The assessment of the SMA was severely limited due to heavy calcification and the presence or absence of clot in the superior mesenteric artery, which could not be evaluated.
There was generalized bowel dilatation consistent with ileus.
The evaluation of the gallbladder was limited due to artifact.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe collapse was noted, increased from prior study with mild edema.
She underwent resection of the ischemic portion of the small bowel under general anesthesia with minimal EBL.
The patient was intubated in the surgical intensive care unit, on a fentanyl drip and a Levophed drip.
A heparin drip was also instituted per vascular for mesenteric ischemia.
On postop day #1, the patient still required pressure support with multiple fluid boluses for a low blood pressure.
She was taken back to the OR on postop day #1 by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection for ischemic bowel.
On the previous day she had 60 cm of gangrenous distal jejunum, which was resected.
It was felt that the patient either had emboli or low-flow situation.
A swab of the abdomen on [**5-20**] demonstrated Enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin, resistant to ampicillin and penicillin.
On [**12-22**], the patient presented for her third laparotomy for ischemic bowel.
The patient underwent reexploration of the abdomen with creation of an ileostomy and closure of the abdomen for ischemic bowel.
Intraop findings demonstrated the remaining 150 cm of proximal small bowel was pink and viable upon exploration.
The patient was in a sinus rhythm with sinus tachycardia with PVCs and PACs.
The patient went into rapid AFib with a rate up to 128.
The patient was noted to be in AFib with a rapid ventricular response.
She was given 25 grams of albumin with no response.
ABG demonstrated moderately severe partially compensated metabolic acidosis with good oxygenation.
In the OR, the patient had loss of ectopy.
