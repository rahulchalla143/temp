Admission Date:  [**2127-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-7-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Oxycodone / Zanaflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: falls  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58 YO man with h/o PE (on coumadin), CAD, s/p L BKA, who has had multiple recent mechanical falls (pt reports 15 falls over the past 5 days due to "right leg weakness").
He does say he hit his head on the ground.
No reports of seizure activity.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have diffuse ecchymoses, INR > 22.8, and hct of 28 (recent baseline 38.1).
He underwent pan-CT, which revealed only buttock contusions.
He was thought to have a R hip fracture clinically, however this was not seen on CT or XR.
Past Medical History: hypercholesterolemia HTN, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, h/o CVA, total thyroidectomy for thyroid CA, appendectomy, b IH repair history of seizures PE [**11-20**] on coumadin  PSH: R fem-DP ([**2116**]), R revision ([**2119**]), L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2115**]), L re-do ([**2121**]), L SFA stent ([**9-18**])   Social History: He denies alcohol use.
L temporal ecchymoses.
R femur/hip XR: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative changes of the hips.
There is no pneumothorax.
No focal areas of consolidation are seen.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Large contusions of the buttocks, right greater than left as well as smaller contusion of the left flank and lateral left chest.
No other evidence of traumatic injury including no fracture.
No change in slightly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Small right renal cyst as well as small subcentimeter hypodense lesion of the right kidney, too small to definitively characterize.
17-mm hyperdense round lesion of the right kidney measures higher density than expected for simple cyst, but is unchanged compared to [**2125-9-18**] and may represent proteinaceous material within a cyst.
CT head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or fracture.
CT C-spine: No fracture.
Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-3-2**] FINDINGS: No intracranial hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or infarction are identified.
No underlying fractures are identified.
IMPRESSION: No masses or infarction identified.
EEG [**2127-3-4**]: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured occasional generalized spike and slow wave or polyspike and slow wave discharges in drowsiness and sleep.
No electrographic seizures or pushbutton activations were captured.
The slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized theta or delta frequency slowing suggest an encephalopathy.
Infection, medications, and metabolic disturbances are among the most common causes.
BILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2127-3-9**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 YO M with h/o PE (on coumadin), CAD s/p CABG, s/p L BKA, who presents s/p fall with elevated INR, anemia, hypotension, and hypoxia.
1) Hypotension: Likely [**1-17**] to dehydration from decreased PO intake and in the setting of blood loss.
He had an episode of hypotension on HD 6 also with sinus tachycardia.
EKG was stable and he re ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
This was thought to be due to poor po intake and his BP and HR responded to IVFs.
CTA neg for new PE on this admission.
Pt may also have been hypoxic [**1-17**] symptomatic anemia in setting of COPD (per CT read).
3) Elevated INR: Pt has blood drawn by VNA, followed by "[**Hospital1 882**] Labs."
Ddx includes malnutrition in setting of elevated dilantin level.
5) Anemia: likely [**1-17**] diffuse ecchymoses in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
6) Frequent falls: pt with frequent falls at home (lives alone), likely mechanical in setting of worsening RLE ischemic neuropathy.
Pt may have been pre-syncopal due to dehydration.
EKG without ischemic changes and he ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
Initially ASA and plavix were held given elevated INR and transfusion requirement but were restarted once INR therapeutic.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - supratherapeutic INR - dilantin toxicity - hypotention - hypoxia .
Secondary diagnosis - Seizure disorder - history of PE [**11-20**] - Hypertension - Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Able to use wheel chair, respiratory status stable on O2 (uses home O2)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an elevated coumadin level and elevated dilantin level.
Please go to all follow up appointments  If you develop fever, chills, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, seizures or any other symptom that concerns you, call you doctor or if unavailable, go to the emergency room.
