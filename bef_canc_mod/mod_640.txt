At that time hospital course was remarkable for acute renal failure requiring renal biopsy, which demonstrated a cholesterol emboli and vascular disease as the cause of his renal failure.
The biopsy site was complicated by a hematoma and this was embolized.
The patient's subsequently got an AV fistula for hemodialysis access.
He has since discharged complained of increasing size and left flank pain.
He is now admitted for evaluation and treatment of his flank hematoma.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal DP bypass graft, status post left carotid endarterectomy, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Acute renal failure on hemodialysis, left flank hematoma secondary to renal biopsy embolized with reoccurrence, history of hypertension controlled, history of prostate carcinoma.
Patient is alert and oriented x 3, in no acute distress.
Heart is a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
The patient has no guarding or tenderness.
The right lower extremity bypass incision site is clean, dry and intact.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for facial changes, somnolence, dysphagia, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, melena or bright red rectal bleeding.
Chest x-ray with left lower lobe atelectasis and a small pleural effusion.
The study demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions of the lung bases with left greater than right.
There were no pulmonary nodules.
There is a large subcapsular left renal hematoma extends from the lateral portion of the lower pole and extends downward with a maximum XY diameter of 11 cm by 9.6 cm.
There are multiple loculations within the left flank hematoma especially medially and posteriorly in the pelvis.
There is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that measures 5.2 cm in diameter that is unchanged on comparison study.
There is no mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
The pelvic portion of the study was unremarkable except for evidence of seeds within the prostate.
The evening prior to anticipated surgery for hematoma evacuation, the patient complained of and exhibited depression enough to end his life.
They felt that the patient had mild symptoms of depression in the context of severe medical illness.
They do not think the patient was at acute risk for suicide, but recommended that the patient would benefit from outpatient either by a psychiatrist or by his primary care physician.
His trazodone was discontinued, because the patient was hypersomnolent and consideration from a stimulant or antidepressant if depressive symptoms persist or return after surgery might be indicated  Patient proceeded on [**10-13**] for anticipated surgery.
Prior to surgery he spiked a temperature to 102.8 with atrial fibrillation with a rate of 180 to 160.
He required 2 doses of 5 mg of IV Lopressor to stabilize his ventricular rate and bring his systolic hypertension to normotensive.
Renal service continued to follow the patient for hemodialysis needs.
Patient was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that the patient was unsafe to be discharged to home, because of deconditioning and would benefit from rehab in order to increase his endurance and strength and optimize his level of function.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left flank hematoma, MSSA positive, history of renal failure on dialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday, history of prostate carcinoma, history of atrial fibrillation, history of chronic anemia.
Postoperative blood loss anemia transfused.
MAJOR PROCEDURES:  Open evacuation of left flank hematoma on [**2135-10-13**].
Upon discharge from rehab the patient should follow up with his nephrologist for continue management of his hemodialysis and his primary care physician for continued management of his atrial fibrillation and blood pressure.
