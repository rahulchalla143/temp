Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old man with a history of peptic ulcer disease s/p gastric resection followed by roux-en-y in distant past ([**2143**]), now s/p Whipple in [**12-28**] for ampullary carcinoma complicated by enterocutaneous fistula's and failure to thrive.
His initial blood cultures from [**2173-8-25**] were + Klebsiella and they presumed he had cholangitis as a source for his gram negative bacteremia.
His antibiotics were adjusted due to his prior h/o ESBL Ecoli.
Based on an abdominal CT which was done on [**2173-9-7**] and showed multiple fluid collections, he was sent to IR on [**2173-9-2**] and had 2 drains placed and a 3rd site aspirated.
His antibiotic regimen included Clindamycin, Ciprofloxicin and Bactrim DS however on [**2173-9-7**] he had another temperature spike and was recultured.
On [**9-8**] and 21 his blood cultures were positive for enterococcus therefore his PICC line was removed.
His chest xray showed an enlarging right effusion for which he underwent thoeracentesis and he returned to Interventional Radiology for manipulation of his drains to aspirate any undrained collections.
From a nutrition standpoint, his Fibersource tube feedings were infusing at 90cc/hr over an 18 hour period however he had many interruptions in his feedings secondary to the tube either being dislodged or removed by the patient.
Due to the fact that the feeding could not be replaced until the week of [**2173-9-20**] and he was feeling better and anxious to get home, he was discharged on [**2173-9-17**] and will return for placement of the feeding tube next week.
His pain was controlled with a Fentanyl patch and oral Dilaudid for breakthrough.
He will be discharged with [**Date Range 269**] follow-up for wound and drain care, and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks with a repeat abdomional CT.

*Steps of care: [**Location (un) **] small fistula pouch # 9773 *Using the pattern trace it onto the paper side of the pouch and then cut the drawing out *Make radial cut around the cut opening to allow the pouch to mold to his contours, remove release paper *Using [**1-22**] a strip of Coloplast past strip stretch it to fit around the cut opening and secure it to the adhesive surface of the pouch *Treat the peri-fistula skin with Stomahesive powder and dust off the excess.
*Center the pouch over the fistula and apply being sure to mold the pouch to his contours *Change appliance: 2 times per week ([**Month/Day (2) 766**] & Thursday), and as needed.
