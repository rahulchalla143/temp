While being worked up was found to have a low-grade fever (per wife- baseline temp is 94-95F) and UTI for which he received Ceftriaxone and Vancomcyin and was also hyponatremic to 120.
He was given NS and shortly thereafter had two seizures and bit his tongue during one of them with bleeding and was thus intubated for airway protection in addition to receiving a total of 3 mg IV Ativan.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurological evaluation.
Of note, patient does not have a history of seizure disorder and is not on seizure medications.
After arriving to [**Hospital1 18**], he was evaluated by neurology who felt that the patient's seizure was likely multifactorial in etiology with infection and [**Hospital1 **] being the likely contributors.
Meningitis was on the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were continued.
No menigismus.
Erythema around suprapubic cath site, but no exudate.
Past Medical History: MS - since [**2119**], progressive, quadriplegic, neurogenic bladder with suprapubic catheter, restrictive [**Year (4 digits) 1570**]'s History of Aspiration PNAs Esophageal Ulcer - [**12-23**] NSAIDs, [**2139**], small bowel bx negative Recurrent UTIs CHF (EF > 65% with moderate LVH in '[**39**]) HTN Legally Blind   Social History: He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.
Family History: Father had CAD and CVA.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.9, HR 71, BP 118/66, R 16, 98% intubated Gen- obese, critically ill, bleeding from the mouth, intubated and sedated.
NECK: no carotid bruits bilaterally, no nuchal rigidity.
CV: distant sounds, RRR, accentuated split S2, no MRG PULM: CTA B Abd: obese, RLQ with baclofen pump, + BS, ND Extrem: generalized edema with 1+ pitting LE edema bilaterally to above the knee.
Motor- withdraws left arm purposefully to nailbed pressure, no withdrawal to pain on left, nail bed pressure on right foot induces clonus but no withdrawal, left foot nailbed pressure results in slight withdrawal.
Reflexes- clonus at R ankle, absent patellar reflexes, 2+ symmetric brachioradialis, unable to elicit bicep or triceps reflexes.
Pertinent Results: EKG: Normal sinus at approximately 80, nl axis, nl PR, narrow QRS, < 1 mm STD in II and TWI in III.
CT Head ([**3-6**]): There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct, or intracranial hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
CXR ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to low lung volumes.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent the combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, cannot rule out consolidation.
EEG ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with more complex rhythms, at times with faster frequencies, noted on the left compared with a slightly lower voltage and slower frequency activity over the right side.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was of low voltage, disorganized, and slow typically in the [**4-28**] Hz frequency range, admixed with bursts of generalized mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the interhemispheric asymmetry with somewhat more complex and faster  frequency rhythms noted broadly over the left side compared with lower voltage and slower frequency rhythms noted over the right.
The findings suggest bilateral subcortical dysfunction which is more prominent over the right side.
In addition, the background was disorganized, low voltage and slow with admixed bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing with this constellation of findings being consistent with a diffuse moderately severe encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic  disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
VIDEO SWALLOW OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  An oral and pharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with speech and pathology department.
There was reduction in AP tongue movement secondary to weakness.
Bolus control was mildly reduced with premature spillover into the pharynx.
A mild coating of the oral cavity residue remained after the swallow.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was mild delay in swallowing initiation.
Pharyngeal transit time was normal, but pharyngeal constriction appeared mildly reduced.
There was one trace aspiration episode after the swallow.
Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia.
Premature spillover, swallow delay and reduced pharyngeal constriction.
Penetration before the swallow, with one episode of trace aspiration.
CXR [**2142-3-15**] PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Nasogastric tube is seen with tip overlying the stomach, with residual contrast material within the stomach.
No definite consolidation identified, although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the image.
No definite focal consolidations are identified.
SEIZURES Patient does not have a history of a seizure disorder though he has had one seizure in the past, in the setting of an infection.
He was found to have both UTI and pneumonia (possibly aspiration) on admission.
No further seizures during admission.
WEAKNESS / MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS At baseline he is wheelchair bound and unable to life his legs.
He has LE weakness at baseline (in a wheelchair) and ha owrsening UE weakness that was starting to improve on discharge.
[**Month/Day (2) **] Possible etiologies included hypovolemic hypoNa and SIADH.
With mild fluid restriction, sodium improved into mid to upper 130s.
UTI / PROTEUS, YEAST Patient has a history of recurrent UTIs s/p suprapubic catheter.
Cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone and he completed a 7 day course.
He had low grade temperature to 100.1 and was pancultured.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA Had infiltrate, fever, and clear aspiration after seizing with tongue trauma.
Support for respiratory failure as detailed below.
The patient was evaluated for recurrent aspiration risk.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE Patient reportedly has a history of restrictive lung disease, which is evidenced on CXR, though by history, he was only intubated for airway protection in the setting of a seizure.
THROMBOCYTOSIS The patient developed elevated platelet counts while in house.
CHF Appears euvolemic to mildly fluid-up.
Some evidence of pulmonary and peripheral edema.
DYSAUTONOMIA The patient's wife reports that he runs low temperatures, and was very concerned about temperatures which were 98-99, which she considered fever.
He had several swings in his blood pressure, for which iv medication for hypertensive urgency (BP 200/100) were avoided.
HTN Initially with borderline hypotension requiring decrease in hypertension regimen.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: 0.083% neb solution Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
