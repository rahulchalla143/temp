The patient was admitted and placed on Azithromycin for what appeared to be a community acquired pneumonia diagnosed by chest x-ray.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and was given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix for presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation.
The patient is admitted to the medical service for further management of her congestive heart failure exacerbation.
History of breast cancer, status post right mastectomy and XRT invasive ductal carcinoma on Tamoxifen.
Remote history of tuberculosis status post treatment times one year.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Guaiac positive stool.
for neuropathy.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or intravenous drugs.
Neck:  JVD to angle of jaw Cardiac examination: Normal S1, and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally and egophony on the left lower lobe with good air movement.
Mild dullness to percussion left lower lobe.
Extremities:  No edema, no clubbing.
CT of the chest:  Pulmonary artery hypertension which correlates to dilated structure on chest x- ray.
Biapical thickening which probably is secondary to granulomatous infection probably TB but neoplastic process cannot be excluded.
Trace pleural effusions, pleural thickening and left lung laterally consistent with focal opacity seen on chest X-ray.
TTE:  Moderate dilated left atrium.

The patient was subsequently diuresed with subsequent improvement in her congestive heart failure.
The patient did develop hypotension on the floor likely due to her decompensated HF and too much verapamil.
She underwent right heart cath which revealed elevated filling pressures, including a wedge of 34 and low cardiac output.
She was transfused three units of packed red blood cells given her hypotension as well as her history of chronic anemia.
