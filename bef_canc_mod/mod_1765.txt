LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; septal apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mildly depressed mid portion of the inferior wall, inferior septum and anteroseptal walls.
4.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
