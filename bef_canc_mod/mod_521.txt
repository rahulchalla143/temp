Patient notes that he was doing all prescribed pulmonary hygiene, including inexsufflator and was at his baseline until early on day of admission when he felt acutely dyspneic and was noted to have an oxygen saturation in the 70s.

No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Oral mucosa dry with thick secretion, oropharynx benign NECK: Supple, no [**Doctor First Name **] CARDIAC: RR, nl S1, nl S2, nl M/R/G LUNGS: Scattered coarse crackles with rhonchi and expiratory pleural rub.
Tender across lower abdomen.
EXTREMITIES: BLE with 2+ pitting edema halfway up shins.
2+ radial pulses.
SKIN: Dry skin throughout and multiple wounds with scabs NEURO: A&Ox3.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-9-28**] there is no change .
[**2124-10-14**]: Chest Xray: Markedly limited study as above.
There has been interval opacification of the retrocardiac left lower lung which is presumably in part due to atelectasis and large effusion although a concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Mild edema.
Stable left pleural effusion with dependent consolidation.
Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion and dependent consolidation at the right lung base.
New opacities at the right lung in a dependent distribution, likely atelectasis, though a component of aspiration is possible.
Multilevel compression fractures throughout the thoracic spine, not significantly changed compared to prior study.
[**2124-10-17**] Chest Xray: Greater opacification at the base of the right lung is probably worsening atelectasis.
Severe atelectasis in the left lower lobe and small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
Lungs elsewhere are grossly clear though pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion suggests volume overload.
Of note, recent chest CT scan showed abundant bronchial secretions which may be playing a role in the persistent atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
[**2124-10-23**] TTE: IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-4-24**], mild aortic regurgitation is seen on the current study.
This was present on the prior study although not reported as such, likely due to suboptimal image quality.
The pre-existing left pleural effusion has not changed in extent.
The extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis is also unchanged.
Unchanged perihilar haziness, small right-sided pleural effusion, and bilateral signs indicative of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 year old male with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who presented from an LTAC following an episode of hypoxia with O2 sats in the 70's.
Hypoxia:  He has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD that causes persistent respiratory compromise requiring 4L NC of oxygen at baseline.
On admission it was felt that he may have also developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged hospitalizations.
He was ruled out for influenza and sputum culture and viral culture were negative.
CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD: He was continued on mycophenolate mofetil and continued on prednisone, which was tapered to 20mg po daily as above.
Chronic abdominal pain and back pain:  He has chronic pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior work-up.
A pain management consult was obtain, and it was felt that the patient was likely not absorbing his fentanyl scondary to skin tears and generalized edema.
Consequently, his fentanyl patch was discontinued and he was started on a dilaudid PCA with improvement in his pain control.
Both the basal and bolus rates can be increased for better pain control.
Additionally, he was started on amytriptiline for improvement in neuropathic pain control.
# Risk for Serotonin syndrome: The patient is currently on various drugs that can precipitate serotonin syndrome (amytriptiline, citalopram, dilaudid).
Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
He was continued on enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H, which is a reduced dose because of a prior episode of profuse bleeding when on a higher dose.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation, which occurred again this admission, likely triggered by hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.
# Hypotension: Intermittently hypotensive to 80s systolic, likely related to administration of sedating medications.
Anemia: Hct slowly trended down over the course of his admission, likely combination of anemia of chronic disease and recent procedures.
The patient remained guaiac negative.
