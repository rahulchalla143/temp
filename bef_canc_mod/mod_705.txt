Chest x-ray revealed a new left lower lobe infiltrate.
Blood pressure remained 94/23 and given concern for hypotension the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Per the patient's daughter she denied abdominal pain, dysuria, shortness of breath, cough, melena, bright red blood per rectum, but she did have decreased urine output.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for C section, cholecystectomy, ovarian cancer in [**2131-9-29**], status post TAH/BSO, omentectomy, ileocolectomy complicated by a perforation of the anastomosis in [**2131-12-29**], which led to peritonitis and resection and a perihepatic abscess and a new ileostomy.
Diabetes mellitus.
Paranoid schizophrenia, depression, recurrent herpes zoster, history of acute renal failure.
Urinary tract infection with Klebsiella.
Neck no JVD or bruits.
Lungs at the left base there were dry rales without wheezes or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular tachy regular rate with a 1 to 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Urine culture revealed no growth.
Chest x-ray revealed new left base consolidation.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachy in the 120s with left axis deviation and normal intervals.
No ST or T wave abnormalities.
She was begun on antibiotics with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin and Flagyl given her history of MRSA, pneumonia and aspiration.
On MICU day three two out of three bottles were positive for staph aureus.
Additionally, cardiovascularly the patient had no signs of ischemia, but remained hypotensive.
The patient had ongoing sinus tachycardia attributed to fever.
The patient had no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Infectious disease:  Up until the time the patient was transferred to the floor team the patient had continued temperature spikes and was being treated for pneumonia.
No abscess or intra-abdominal pathology was found.
This found left atrial dilatation, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe hypokinesis of the basilar interior septum.
There were no discreet vegetation.
There was trace aortic regurgitation and no vegetation of the mitral valve leaflets.
There was 2+ mitral regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiovascular:  For the patient's rhythm and episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred when the patient was restarted on her beta blocker and magnesium and potassium were repleted.
However, the patient did have frequent ectopy and occasional couplets of premature ventricular contractions.
Her blood pressure remained stable on Lopressor and there were no signs of congestive heart failure.
Additionally the patient was found to have low platelets as low as 86.
Neuro/psych:  For the patient's tremor and Parkinsonism symptoms that were found on MICU admission her Risperdal was held initially and her symptoms resolved.
