MICROBIOLOGY: [**2201-1-24**] 6:51 pm URINE CULTURE (Final [**2201-1-26**]): NO GROWTH.
[**2201-1-24**] 9:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE PICC LINE: NGTD (final results pending)  IMAGING / STUDIES: # ECG ([**2201-1-24**] at 6:07:50 PM): Normal sinus rhythm with short P-R interval.
Q waves in leads III and aVF suggest possible inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2201-1-21**] no diagnostic interim change.
Bibasilar opacities appear more prominent, suggesting moderate pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
Prominence of the central vasculature may be due to vascular engorgement.
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
Prominence of the central vasculature may be due to vascular engorgement.
# CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2201-1-24**] at 9:41 PM): There are moderate simple bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, partially imaged.
The heart shows coronary artery and mitral annular calcifications.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a 7.8 x 3.6 x 7.1 cm right upper quadrant high density collection, most likely representing a hematoma adjacent to the entry of the J-tube.
Moderate amount of free air is noted in the anterior upper abdomen.
The left-sided J-tube terminates in a loop of jejunum with thickened wall.
There is a cyst originating from the lower pole of the right kidney.
No abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present.
No abdominal free fluid or free air is present.
Extensive arterial and aortic calcifications are seen.
The prostate is mildly enlarged.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is noted.
A small amount of high density fluid is seen in the pelvis, most likely hemorrhage vs less likely leaked bowel contrast.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show mild anterior osteophyte formations with no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions noted.
7.8 x 3.5 x 7 cm high density collection, likely intraperitoneal hematoma adjacent to the J-tube site.
Moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum in the upper abdomen may relate to recent procedure.
Small amount of high density pelvic free fluid most likely hemorrhage vs much less likely mixing of leaked oral contrast.
Partially imaged moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
Mild thickening of the J-tube containing jejunum.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 86 year old male with CAD, AS, DM2, HTN, HLD, and recent J tube placement and balloon valvuloplasty who presented with dyspnea and chest discomfort, and was found to have worse anemia due to an intraperitoneal hematoma at his J tube site.
He was initially admitted to the ACS service for evaluation and treatment of low Hct and an anterior intraperitoneal hematoma.
His stool was brown but guaiac positive, but flushing of the J-tube revealed no blood.
The only bleeding source identified was the hematoma on CT.  # Intraperitoneal Hematoma: He was initially hypotensive to the 80s and complaining of chest pain in the ED.
Troponin was < 0.01, and his EKG showed no acute ischemic changes.
CT abdomen showed a 7.8 x 3.6 x 7.1 cm hematoma in the anterior abdomen intraperitoneally near the site of his recent J-tube placement and lysis of adhesions.
His CT was otherwise reassuring, with only a small amount of free air consistent with his recent J tube placement.
His Hct remained stable after the unit of PRBCs, and he did not experience any further chest pain.
He remained hemodynamically stable after transfer and no external bleeding was appreciated on exam.
His abdomen was only mildly tender.
The video swallow exam showed improvement, but continued high aspiration risk.
# Urinary Retention / BPH: He had urinary retention during his last admission with plan to keep Foley in place for 2 weeks and treat with Finasteride and Tamsulosin.
He denied any urinary complaints with the Foley in place.
Found to have pleural effusions and volume overload on CXR on [**2201-1-24**], but has remained close to euvolemic since transfer to floor.
He had mild lightheadedness after his video swallow study but has otherwise been asymptomatic.
# Nausea/vomiting: He had a single episode of nausea and vomiting prior to his transfer to medicine, but this resolved with no subsequent nausea.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Continued sliding scale with QACHS fingersticks.
# Hypotension: He had an episode of hypotension shortly after after admission but remained fairly stable since then.
His initial hypotension was likely hypovolemic given his hematoma and emesis, with no fevers to suggest sepsis.
# Access: Right PICC  # DVT Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots  # Pain Management: Acetominophen 650 mg PO Q6H PRN pain  # Code status: FULL CODE, confirmed with patient  # Transitional Care: -- He will need intensive swallowing therapy in rehab with the goal of resuming limited PO intake.
