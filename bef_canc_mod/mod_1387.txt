Hepatic vasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices.
There was small-volume ascites.
On [**1-22**] a cholangiogram was done to assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature.
Post procedure, he spiked a temperature to 104.
Blood cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca and VRE (enterococcus facium).
Biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilation visualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosis site.
A biopsy was then performed with features representing indeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection.
On [**1-28**], an MRCP was performed to assess for biliary obstruction or leak.
This demonstrated diffuse mild-to-moderate dilatation of the entire intrahepatic biliary system.
There were several foci of intrahepatic biliary stenosis as well as a 2-cm segment of the distal CBD which demonstrated wall thickening and associated luminal stenosis.
Distally, the segment abutted the anastomosis of CBD and jejunum.
There was a small amount of free fluid around the hepatic and splenic flexure.
On [**1-29**], he was re-biopsied with findings concerning for biliary obstruction or ischemia.
On [**2-3**], a cholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation of intrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bile duct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowing freely down to the small bowel.
He developed severe bilateral upper and lower extremity tremors and ataxic gait likely from prograf toxicity causing a significant decline in his ability to ambulate.
TFTs were significant for a slightly low T3 otherwise TSH and T4 were normal.
The two left hemipheric lesions were stable in size, non-enhancing with contrast, and of unclear etiology.
His CSF profile [**12-8**] was normal, with no evidence of inflammation or pleiocytosis.
It was not clear what the lesions  represented, but given no further growth or lack of enhancement, infection or malignancy were remote possibilities.
A repeat MRI brain WITHOUT CONTRAST (as lesions did not enhance and given risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy)was recommended in 3 months to re-evaluate for evolution of these lesions.
Site was without redness or drainage.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: elevated LFTs mild liver transplant rejection biliary stricture tremors secondary to prograf toxicity malnutrition   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: please call the Transplant Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to take any of your medications, worsening tremors, abdominal pain, diarrhea, redness/bleeding or drainage around capped Roux tube.
