Admission Date:  [**2107-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-3-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8961**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 78 year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma s/p LUL lobectomy, DVT, afib on Coumadin, GI bleed, and nonverbal at baseline from severe dementia who is coming in from a nursing home with worsened altered mental status, fever, and hypoxic respiratory distress.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 29475**]/11 for lethargy and fever.
He was initially started on Vancomycin and Zosyn due to concern for sacral decubitus ulcer infection and possible osteomyelitis v. pneumonia.
The tachypnea was attributed to aspiration pneumonitis v. fever/stress response with the infected sacral ulcer thought to be the primary infectious process.
He also was found to have C. diff colitis and started on oral flagyl.
However, over the past day, he has had worsening altered mental status and shortness of breath.
He was tachypneic and minimally responsive on arrival so was intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.
In the peri-intubation setting, he went into rapid afib with mild V4-V6 ST depressions captured on EKG; the RVR resolved with IV fluids.
CK was 115 but trop mildly elevated at 0.09, consistent with prior admission (0.08-1).
CTA chest showed no PE and bibasilar infiltrates mostly at the periphery consistent with pneumonia, less likely aspiration pneumonitis.
Past Medical History: - Severe dementia, unable to complete any ADL's on his own - S/p LUL lobectomy for spiculated mass: 3.3 cm adenocarcinoma with all regional lymph nodes negative, T2a, N0.
Then, L sided effusion s/p thoracocentesis [**8-/2106**] - Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, h/o RVR on initial diagnosis  - h/o DVT in RLE, [**4-/2106**] Tx'd with Lovenox - h/o TIA - colonic adenoma - hypothyroidism - Anemia - Osteoarthritis, s/p total L hip replacement, s/p total R knee  replacement - h/o tibial fracture - spondylosis of the lumbosacral spine - h/o Gastric ulcer - h/o urinary retention requiring Foleys - h/o GIB in [**2-8**], presumed to be lower source, resolved on own.
Family History: No family history of lung cancers, prostate cancers or clotting disorders.
Physical Exam: On admission: GENERAL: Intubated, sedated, not responding to command HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA 3mm b/l, intubated and sedated, does not respond to voice or pain, grimaces to deep pain NECK: Supple LUNGS: clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezing or rales HEART: irregularly irregular, II/VI SEM, nl S1-S2.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding, clean stoma with no raw erythema, ostomy in place with soft brown stool; foley in place EXTREMITIES: WWP, no c/c, trace pretibial edema, with R leg with mild skin darkening and slightly more swelling, 2+ peripheral pulses.
SKIN: No rashes LYMPH: No cervical LAD.
NEURO: sedated, PERRLA, withdraws to deep pain RECTAL: decubitus (stage 4) on left presacral area, wound vac in place with no surrounding drainage .
Left basilar opacity may representing a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.
Minima patchy opacity in the right lung base could reflect additional area of infection.
No pulmonary embolus.
Post-surgical changes of left upper lobectomy.
Diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass nodular opacities compatible with and infectious process.
Right sided pleural-based nodules and 5-mm nodule in the left lower lobe are likely part and parcel with the infectious process.
A 1-cm lymph node in the prevascular space is likely reactive.
No evidence of complications.
Unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left basal parenchymal opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma s/p LUL lobectomy, DVT, afib on Coumadin, GI bleed, chronic stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer s/p diverting colostomy and surgical debridement, and mostly nonverbal at baseline from severe dementia who presents with worsened mental status, fever, and hypoxic respiratory distress.
He was discharged back to his extended care facility with transition to hospice care to provide comfort and increased quality of life for his remaining life.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress (MICU course): On arrival to ED patient had O2 sats of 82% on NRB and was minimally responsive.
He was intubated and in post-intubation setting went into rapid A fib with V4-6 ST depressions on ECG, which resolved with IVF.
WBC elevated to 21 and BNP at 1293 (previous baseline), troponin mildly elevated to 0.09 (also at previous baseline).
Post-intubation CXR showed bibasilar infiltrates and patient was started on vanco/zosyn for broad HCAP coverage given recent hospitalization.
Confirmed with family (nephew who is HCP) that patient is DNR and do not reintubate, and decision was made to extubate patient while accepting risk of subsequent respiratory failure.
Patient is at great risk of aspiration and decompensation due to pneumonia.
Sputum showed staph aureus coag + moderate growth, and yeast in sparce growth.
He was ruled out for Influenza and Legionella.
# Health-Care Associated Pneumonia: Confirmed on CT imaging.
S/P intubation and mechanical ventilation and initially on broad antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn); however, upon transfer to the Medicine floor the regimen was narrowed to Vancomycin alone given his endotracheal sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus.
# Clostridium Difficile Colitis: C diff toxin positive on last admission on [**2107-6-6**].
# Stage IV Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Clinically probes to bone.
On prior admission there was no xray evidence of osteomyelitis; however, MRI was not performed.
# Altered mental status: Severe underlying dementia exacerbated by toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection.
# Afib with RVR: Most likely stress response in setting of sepsis; RVR resolved with IVF.
# Elevated troponin: Stable from prior admission with normal CK.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent mild demand in the setting of Afib with RVR.
# Colostomy: Appears to be working appropriately, no evidence of infection around stoma, and patient making normal stool.
Currently underway on 2-week course of Flagyl for positive C diff with resolution of symptoms.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**],  You were initially admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit) for treatment of worsening respiratory status, likely secondary to a pneumonia.
We are discontinuing medications that are not necessary and we are adding medications to address your symptoms and focus on providing comfort.
