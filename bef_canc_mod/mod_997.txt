Also with recent aspiration PNA on [**9-30**], now [**Hospital 74711**] transfered from an outside hospital with N,V and CP on [**2129-10-12**] with troponin increease.
Has known AAA, and on OSH imaging, found to have 4.4 x 4 cm infrarenal AAA with concern for new blood within the intima.
Also with abdominal pain and colitis concerning initially for ischemic colitis associated with dissecting aneurysm.
INR was reversed with vitamin K. Upon admit surgery was called to evaluate her and thought her to be a poor surgical candidate.
HCP [**Name (NI) **] agreed with conservative management given her high risk of perioperative mortality.
While in the MICU she was not hypotensive but had average BP of 140/90s and never required pressors.
Has been afebrile but is C.dif positive.
Initially thought to be septic so treated with vanc for GP bacteria and IV cipro/flagyl for GI bacteria.
Once C.dif positive, cipro was discontinued given negative repeat UA and po vanc/flagyl were continued for severe C.dif colitis.
Upon transfer to the floor, VSS with mild tachycardia to 100.
Confirms pain in LUE, abdomen and [**Name (NI) **].
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2129-7-6**] with thrombectomy.
History of cerebrovascular accident x2, ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with residual dysphagia and aspiration.
Asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4.3 cm.
11.Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused.
12.Left axillary-femoral bypass with a left femoral to distal bypass on [**2129-9-18**].
NECK: Right IJ, supple, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
CV: RRR s1, s2, no M/G/R RESP: CTAB ABD: Bowel soudns audible, guarding with diffuse abdominal tenderness Buttocks: Erythema diffusely but no pressure ulcers.
EXT: Left foot with medial thigh ulcer with granulation tissue about 4cm by 2cm.
Multiple necrotic lesions in the left lower extremity with no pulses on L extremity.
No edema lower and upper extremities bilaterally.
[**2129-10-12**] 10:00 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: NOT APPLICABLE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2129-10-14**]**     FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2129-10-14**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2129-10-14**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 85 yo female with PVD, DM2, s/p multiple bypasses who presents with n/v/cp, found to have AAA with possible dissection and C. difficile colitis.
Concerning for possibility of PE but O2 sat is 95%.
Abdominal exam significant for wincing pain to palpation, concerning for toxic megacolon given C. diff infection.
Thought to be pain causing increased respiratory rate.
KUB revealed no dilation.
Morphine changed to standing with improved pain control.
# Left groin ulcer: S/p left femoral bypass with continued ulceration at left groin.
Preliminary wound swab revealed GPC in pairs, still pending on discharge.
# Colitis: Initially thought to be infectious vs. ischemic.
Involving ascending and transverse colon with possible involvement of the small intestine.
Initially evaluated for surgery given concern for ischemic colitis, but area of involvement thought to be too extensive.
Cultures then positive for C.dif within a few hours of collection so transitioned to both po vanc/flagyl for severe C.dif infection.
# AAA dissection: After reviewing with radiologist in house and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], there is evidence of possible minor leakage into the intimal flap although no overt dissection at this time.
Repeat imaging studies would be ideal to better assess the OSH images, but given the patient's family wishes of no surgical approach and the risk of IV contrast, no further imaging was pursued.
# Septic Shock: Likely secondary to translocation of colonic bacteria in the areas of infection.
Upon discharge, all blood cultures negative, campylobacter & samonella negative.
# Coagulopathy & Left IJ Thrombus:  Previously being treated for Left IJ thrombus found on prior hospitalization [**1-7**] to PICC placement.
On discharge, patient was therapeutic with INR = 2.5 despite held warfarin, thought to be due to poor diet.
# Elevated Troponin: Elevated troponin on admit from OSH.
No EKG changes.
Finding likely secondary to hypoperfusion from septic shock.
Not indicative of acute ischemia.
# ARF:  Baseline Cr 1.0, Cr elevated to 1.8 on admission.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.

Warfarin 1 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day as needed for INR goal [**1-8**] : Likely very sensitive to coumadin; INR on transfer 2.5 without coumadin, likely secondary to recent poor nutrition.
