While watching TV, he developed L sided chest "tightness" that was [**2124-5-22**] in intensity, nonradiating, constant, and not pleuritic or positional in quality.
He did subsequently have nausea without vomiting.
He has had very infrequent similar episodes of left chest discomfort in the past (a few times a year) that were less intense and not activity-related.
His EKG revealed ST-segment elevations in leads II, III and avF inferiorly and V4-6 anterolaterally with depressions in I, aVL, V1-V3.
Angiography revealed a mid-RCA lesion.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Family History: His father had a stroke in his 80's.

[**11-1**] EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at ~66 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no LAA, no RAA, no LVH, no RVH, ST-segment elevations in II/III and aVF inferiorly (III>II) and V4-V6 anterolaterally with depressions in I aVL and V1-V3, normal RWP.
The LAD was calcified with a 50% ostial stenosis of the D1.
The LCX had mild luminal irregularities.
The RCA had a mid vessel 70% stenosis and distal total occlusion with moderate calcification.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and mean PCW of 31 mmHg.There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 40 mmHg.
There was  moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP of 170 mmHg.
Final angiography demonstrated no  residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow throughout.
Successful stenting of the proximal RCA with a Minivision (3.5x12mm) bare metal stent.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow throughout.
Moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular  systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior  wall.
There  is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic  dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary  muscle dysfunction.
STEMI - The patient experienced a strong vagal reaction after his left groin sheath was pulled, necessitating IVFs and dopamine briefly for blood pressure support.
He had no further significant hemodynamic instability.
He did have persistent bradycardia in 40's and 50's (sinus with occasional junctional escape with HR in 40's at night) that was asymptomatic.
He did have NSVT on telemetry >48 hours post-MI, with some symptomatic palpitations, so was started on carvedilol with resolution of palpitations and significantly less ectopy on telemetry by the day of discharge.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. acute myocardial infarction   Discharge Condition: good, free of chest discomfort or recent significant arrhythmia on telemetry   Discharge Instructions: You came in to the hospital with chest discomfort.
Your symptoms were due to a heart attack.
Following the heart attack you had episodes of an irregular heartbeat (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) that improved with medicines.
Please call your doctor and seek medical attention at once if you develop: ** chest discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, blood in your stools, black stools or other bleeding problems, or any other symptoms that worry you  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4023**] [**11-26**] at 2:20pm ([**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 7, [**Hospital1 18**]) from Cardiology.
We recommend that you have an exercise stress test and repeat echocardiogram in one month.
Please have your potassium and kidney function tests (BUN and creatinine) measured in the next week.
