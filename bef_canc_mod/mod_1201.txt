PEG lavage performed on admisison returned negative, although without bilious return.
CT torso negative for aneurysmal leak.
GI consulted on [**6-26**], and scope deferred secondary to tenuous respiratory status.
Stools remained guaiac positive.
Per OSH records, this is the patient's second admission for Hct drop in 2 months.
After patient was transfered to the floor, GI performed an EGD which showed gastritis with no active bleeding.
It was deferred because the patient has stabalized and a lower GI source was unlikely.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presumed secondary to COPD exacerbation +/- component of CHF.
CT ruled out PE, and revealed mild septal thickening without obvious infiltrate.
The patient completed an empiric 10-day course of Levofloxacin for coverage of respiratory organisms.
ID: Febrile to 104 on admission, without septic physiology.
He was empirically started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, and Flagyl was added given recent history of C. diff colitis.
While in the MICU, his creatinine rose to 2.4, with rising phosphate.
He was dialysed on [**6-29**] via right tunneled hemodialysis catheter to help with fluid status.
CAD: EKG on admission with RBBB and some lateral ST depressions.
No previous EKG to compare.
He was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes (peak troponin 0.31, with flat CK and CK-MB).
ASA on hold at present given concern over GI bleed, BB transiently held [**12-22**] borderline BP, resumed on [**6-27**] and titrated up to optimize HR and BP control.
On [**2174-6-29**], he was found to have left-sided arm myoclonus, and neurology was consulted.
EEG performed, preliminary read negative for seizure activity.
Per neuro, possibly epilepsy partialis epilepticum.
An MRI was obtained to avoid any new structural lesions (it was negative).
