for afib on coumadin, CAD s/p MI ([**2178**]), sCHF (EF 30-35% TTE [**2178**]), OA and remote hx of GIB ([**2178**]) and anxiety who preseted to [**Hospital1 **] ED in setting of new onset of dyspnea and b/l infrascapular back pain and hypoxic respiratory distress.
She was found to have a vertebral wedge fracture and RSV infection with exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.
She was diuresed fluid, received steroids and bronchidilators for RSV, and lidocaine patch for pain control.
She was discharged home with better oxygenation and adequate pain control.
Hypoxemic respiratory distress.
Initially felt to be combination of b/l CAP and CHF in setting severe pain from compression fracture and flash pulmonary edema with SBPs to 220s.
Patient was treated with NTG, diuresis, pain control, standing duonebs and anxiolytics, with transient improvement in her respiratory distress (accessory muscle use), however required use of BIPAP on HD2,3.
Given persistent distress and b/l scapular pain, CTA was performed, no PE or dissection was found.
Given exposure to URI at [**Hospital3 **] facility and no significant improvement in oxygenation w/ ABx and diuresis, viral screen was sent.
found to be positive for RSV.
ROMI was completed and TTE was performed showing normalization of EF and no significant valvular abnormality and TR gradient of 46 mmHg.
Most concerning for dissection on admission, but CTA negative.
Likely due to compression fracture (this is of unknown duration).
Pt was treated with narcotics and lidocaine patch with near resolution of her pain.
CHF, acute on chronic diastolic:  Likely due to diastolic dysfunction in setting of acute illness and hypertension leading to flash pulmonary edema.
OA: Hip pain at this time mostly, chronic.
Patient became bradycardic at night on that dosing, but with dose adjusted to 25mg of metoprolol daily she had adequate HR control to 60's and 70's range.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**],  You came to our hospital for shortness of breath and cough along with back pain.
After arrival in the ED, you were found to have respiratory distress, and were transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory support.
We found that you had a viral infection of your airway called respiratory syncytial virus.
We gave you medication to remove excess fluid around the lung and breathing treatment to prevent tightened airways.
Your back pain was found to be a compression fracture of a bone in the spinal column and you should follow-up with your PCP regarding this issue, but continue with the pain control medication we have initiated with you.
Take 1 neb inhaled every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze.
START guaifenesin 50 mg/5 mL Liquid  take  Five (5) mL by mouth every six (6) hours as needed for cough.
START benzonatate 100mg by mouth three times daily as needed for cough 8.
Use one spray each nostril as needed for cough 9.
- There are no further changes in your medication .
