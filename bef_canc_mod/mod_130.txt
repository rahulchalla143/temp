History of Present Illness: This is an 85 yo m w/ a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening renal function.
He received a femoral line, calcium, 1500cc NS (not more out of concern for possible cardiogenic shock).
A bedside shock u/s did not demonstrate a pericardial effusion but showed global hypokinesis, and a large right sided pleural effusion.
A CT torso demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions R>>L with associated atelectasis and cardiomegaly, but no intraabdominal pathology on wet read.
Lactate was wnl, CE's were within his baseline in the setting of renal failure.
EKG was notable for low voltage afib with bradycardia but no ischemic changes compared to prior.
An ABG was notable for a respiratory acidosis and he was intubated with etom and rocuronium for airway protection and increased minute ventilation.
He is transferred to the MICU for further management of hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure and hypothermia.
Of note, pt was recently admitted from end of [**Month (only) 116**] to [**5-23**] for hypotension, respiratory failure and GIB.
During recent hospital course, pt intubated for presumed CHF, had worsening renal failure, and also found to have new parietal CVA.
Coumadin held given bleeding and pt d/c'd to rehab on [**5-23**].

The patient initially presented with a respiratory acidosis and was intubated in the ED.
Additionally, after his empiric 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn, the patient developed a leukocytosis and was started on zosyn, which was switched to meropenem when sputum cultures grew out klebsiella.
Pt then transitioned to trach mask without difficulty and has tolerated it well.
Hypotension ??????
?s history of GI bleed, it was felt that hemorrhagic shock from a GI bleed was unlikely.
He was initially treated for a mixed septic and cardiogenic shock.
He was also tried on dobutamine several times in an attempt to increase his cardiac output; however, the dobutamine was ultimately stopped because it resulted in an increased levophed requirement.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - The patient had chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.0-2.5.
He had significant edema in all extremities on admission.
Dobutamine was given in an attempt to increase cardiac output and renal blood flow but was stopped as explained above.
The patient developed significant edema in his scrotum and sacral area with skin breakdown, requiring wound care consultation.
A lasix drip was started but was eventually stopped secondary to hypotension and minimal effect on UOP.
# Heart Failure ??????
The patient has known heart failure and presented with significant upper and lower extremity edema.
Echo results showed improvement in systolic function but were indicative of a restrictive cardiomyopathy.
As explained above, the patient was also tried on a lasix drip and then started on CVVH for volume overload.
After significant volume reduction and initiation of midodrine pressors were d/c'd and pt was able to maintain adaquate BP's.
# Anemia ??????
During his ICU stay, nursing reported that the patient was having some very dark stools.
Given the slow decrease in HCT and multiple other problems management consisted of monitoring and transfusion.
Altered Mental Status ??????
Numerous factors that could have contributed to his altered mental status.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was sedated and on a ventilator, making assessment of his mental status difficult.
Increasing blood sugars levels required frequent adjustments to the patient?????
It was unclear whether this hyperglycemia was secondary to an underlying infection or decreased responsiveness to the insulin.
Atrial Fibrillation ??????
The patient has atrial fibrillation; however, he is not on Coumadin secondary to his recent GI bleed.
On admission, his nodal blocking agents were held secondary to his hypotension and were not restarted secondary to his persistent hypotension and borderline pressures.
# Pleural Effusion ??????
On admission, the patient had a large pleural effusion.
This effusion was monitored through serial chest x-rays with some resolution following volume removal.
# Yeast in Urine Cultures ??????
Pt has continued to have dirty UA's and was started on a 7day course of Cipro on [**6-27**] for empiric coverage of UTI.
