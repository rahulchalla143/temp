Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right femoral venous catheter placement Temporary HD catheter placement Hemodialysis PD catheter placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old man w/ CAD s/p CABG, CRI who was admitted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for hemodialysis.
He had CABG in [**9-4**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 7349**], which was c/b ARF requiring hemodialysis.
He has been receiving HD at [**Location (un) **] w/ no complications until 1 month ago, when he became frustrated by fatigue that he attributed to HD and then refused to continue HD.
He has not had dialysis for the past month, but has been making urine.
The pt was then found to have elevated creatinine to 11 and acidosis w/ bicarb 11, and was sent to the ED for evaluation.

He continues to make urine, but has persistent renal failure requiring dialysis.
On admission, his tunneled HD catheter was not functional, requiring placement of R femoral catheter that was later complicated by femoral bleed as below.
CAD: he is s/p CABG in [**9-4**], w/ no evidence of active ischemia during his admission.
He had transient SSCP during active femoral bleeding, but ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes and was pain free for the rest of his stay.
Anemia: he was profoundly anemic on admission, most likely [**2-2**] underproduction of blood [**2-2**] renal disease.
This was supported by low retic count in this setting.
There was no evidence of hemolysis given normal haptoglobin and LDH.
At d/c, there is no evidence of active bleeding.
No evidence of platelet consumption; no splenomegaly on exam.
Right femoral bleed: he had bleeding into his right thigh [**2-2**] walking to the bathroom after placement of temporary dialysis catheter in R femoral vein on [**2185-2-2**].
The pt had grossly edematous right leg, and CT scan showed large R thigh hematoma.
The pt was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring, where it was clear that the bleeding had stopped and the pt was hemodynamically stable.
There were no signs of infxn in the leg during his stay.
He was transferred back to the Medicine service for ongoing care, and again demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding or infxn in the R thigh.
At d/c, he has extensive echymosis of the R thigh, but no edema and good LE circulation B.
Chronic renal faiure  2.
Thrombocytopenia  Secondary:  1.
Anemia  2.
CAD  3.
Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable to go home w/ outpt hemodialysis.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged after treatment for renal failure and right femoral vein bleeding.
