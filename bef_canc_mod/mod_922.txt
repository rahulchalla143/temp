Admission Date:  [**2173-5-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2173-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-6-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Neurology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48749**] is a 49-year-old man diagnosed with neurosarcoid in a previous neurologic admission who was recently discharged to rehabilitation on [**5-11**] after extensive workup for neurosarcoid.
He had breakthrough pain in his lower back and exacerbation of this allodynia in his feet and legs.
In his lower extremities, he had severe decrease in sensation, decreased pin prick, light touch, vibratory, and cold from T7 down, worse on the left side.
He was seen and admitted for acute worsening of his lower extremity weakness.
He had severe pain and at first we increased his methadone and Neurontin, and started a Morphine PCA pump.
Over the coming days with his movement and pain was somewhat better controlled, Rheumatology saw him and agreed with Solu-Medrol, and then felt that he would also benefit from steroids after that as well.
This electroencephalogram showed a mild encephalopathy, but was negative for seizures.
He was monitored and his respiratory distress was watched closely.
It was felt that his acute change in mental status was attributed to his increased pain medications especially his PCA pump.
We also discussed the issue of a positive PPD with Infectious Disease and given that we were giving him infliximab and high dosed steroids, we may need to be more aggressive with his anti-TB prophylactic treatment.
He was found to have a urinary tract infection with some blood in his urine, and he was started on Levaquin 500 mg po q day.
His pain was controlled on his gabapentin, nortriptyline, Percocet, and methadone and his leg shaking was controlled on increasing doses of primidone tapered up to 225 mg po tid.
Over the few days before his discharge, he had increasing leg strength, and was able to abduct his legs for the first time since admission.
He continued to have hyperesthesia in his bilateral lower extremities and his strength was returning slowly.
He was deemed stable for discharge to rehabilitation on [**5-26**] with followup in the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic as well as followup in the Pheresis Unit at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for his infliximab treatment.
Urinary tract infection.
