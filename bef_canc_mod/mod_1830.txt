Brief Hospital Course: 81yo woman with past medical history significant for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolus, and obstructive sleep apnea presenting with subacute onset of dyspnea.
Her exam was remarkable for decreased air flow but FVC at baseline.
She was monitored with NIFs and FVCs initially, but it was later determined that these were likely inaccurate secondary to significant air leak around the tube.
She was no longer feeling dyspneic and fatigued (at baseline).
2. anemia - This was consistent with iron deficiency anemia, with a Fe of 14, a low ferritin, and a high-normal TIBC.
3. atrial fibrillation - She was continued on coumadin, with INR 2.6.
4. myasthenia - Mestinon, cellcept, prednisone continued during the hospitalization without adjustment per her primary neurologist.
