He has done well over the past few years until about 2-3 weeks ago when his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1911**], interrorgted his device and found he was having numerous episodes of VT (100 or so episodes without ICD firing).
However, on [**2181-10-15**] he presented to [**Hospital6 20592**] with shortness of breath and orthopnea; he also stated that he has been increasingly dyspneic with exertion over the past few weeks.
He was admitted, had no biomarker evidence of MI, was diuresed, and underwent an echocardiogram yesterday showing an EF of 30% which was essentially unchanged, but he was found to have new 3+ mitral regurgitation and hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] had the patient transferred here for right and left heart catheterization.
ROS: He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

There was a 50% lesion at the origin of the vertebral artery.
Abdominal aortography using an angled pigtail catheter just below the level of the renal arteries revealed no apparent renal artery stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o man with H/O CAD, congestive systolic heart failure, and lung cancer with worsening dyspnea on exertion.
History of numerous VT episodes on recent ICD interrogation.
# CAD - Known severe coronary artery disease.
Cardiac catheretizations this admission showed PCW 22 and LVEDP 26 mm Hg with preserved cardiac index.
He had severe LMCA and three vessel disease with patent proximal left subclavian artery stent and patent LIMA-LAD.
Abdominal aortography showed extensive aortic and iliac disease, precluding using of the Impella Assist Device.
This procedure was delayed for several hours due to arrhythmias (see below), but on [**10-18**], a Xience DES was placed in the LMCA into the circumflex artery with right femoral arteriotomy closure using the Mynx device and IABP secured in place in the left femoral artery.
# Pump - Has severe chronic systolic and diastolic left ventricular heart failure with recent acute exacerabtion with recent EF of 25% and akinesis to dyskinesis of thinned inferior and infero-lateral walls with slightly dilated LV wall.
Repeat echocardiogram here showed moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, prompting the decision to revascularize the native circumflex in hopes of reducing papillary muscle ischemic dysfunction.
Lasix and spironolactone were continued, and captopril was decreased then changed to low dose lisinopril due to hypotension.
# Rhythm - Has a pacer and ICD.
Patient did have VT upon interrogation of ICD prior to admission; unclear etiology for this, but likely secondary to ischemia.
He had recurrent SVT during this admission with HRs into 160s, mostly asymptomatic with relatively low BPs which are now close to baseline.
He triggered for atrial fibrillation with VR to 160 the night prior to discharge, however, he had not received his quinidine or metoprolol that evening.
He was asymptomatic and his arrhythmia resolved after receiving these medications.
He was evaluated by EP who felt that no further changes to his pacer/ICD settings were needed at this time.
This can be considered in the future if atrial fibrillation returns.
# Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was likely multifactorial including past lobectomy, worsening heart failure, and asthma.
# Diabetes mellitus - The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control.
# Knee pain - A few days prior to discharge, the patient developed a painful right knee.
The patient was afebrile and the knee was not warm.
It was felt that his knee pain was most consistent with a gout flare.
He was given indomethacin for 24 hours with resolution of his knee pain.
He was discharged with a prescription for a prednisone burst-taper in the event that his symptoms recur.
# Mild Acute Renal Function - The patient had a creatinine elevated to 1.4 on admission, likely due to hypovolemia and poor foward flow from CHF.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-24**]  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Oxygen 2L continuous 17. please provide tubing for oxygen  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Coronary artery disease, treated with Drug-eluting stent deployment in the left main and circumflex coronary arteries Acute on chronic left ventricular systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure  Secondary Diagnoses: Gout Atrial fibrillation Supraventricular tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia Diabetes mellitus Prior lung cancer Asthma Hypoxemia Acute renal failure Mitral regurgitation  Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, SBPs in 80s-100s, breathing comfortably on 2L O2.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath.
You continued to have low oxygen saturations while walking, dropping to 84% and will need to go home with oxygen.
You have been given prescriptions for these changes.
You also developed knee pain which improved after a few doses of indomethacin.
If your knee pain or other gout symptoms return, you should take a short course of a steroid medication called prednisone instead of indomethacin.
