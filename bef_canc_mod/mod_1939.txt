Patient is homebound at baseline but ambulates with walker and requires assitance with ADL's.
He has recent history of recurrent UTI and had a cystoscopy on [**9-30**] for work-up of persistent hematuria.
Following the fall he had a persistent cough and then developed large amounts of dark vomitus.
At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] was HD stable with SBP in the 140's, found to have positive NG lavage that did not clear, was noted febrile to 102, with positive UA and CT abdomen/pelvis showing 1cm obstructing left kidney stone at the UPJ.
CT head and CXR showed no acute processes.
Patient was last admitted to our institution in [**2168-5-4**] for UTI with pan-sensitive e.coli.
Per his last PCP note from [**8-/2168**] he was since treated twice for UTI and had persistent microscopic hematuria despite completion of treatment.
He does have known prostatic enlargement and some lower urinary tract symptoms and he is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 986**] at NWH for this.

He was in a wide complex tachycardia, and EP was consulted, who felt this was his usual atrial tachycardia with abberency.
A repeat lavage posivice for cofee-grounds.
A Nephrostomy tube was inserted with good drainage, with relief of the obstructing Left Ureteral stone.

Inferoposterior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Non-specific anterior T wave changes.
Small amount of urine sample sent for laboratory analysis.
No hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Multiple echogenic foci, which may represent air or less likely nonobstructive left renal calculi.
Stomach:  Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Other Multiple red circular lesions of the same diameter were noted in the stomach body.
The final two lesions were flat with apparent submucosal hemorrhage.
Taken together, these lesions appeared consistent with significant NG trauma.
Impression: Gastric bezoar Circular lesions likely NGT trauma as noted above Food in the Distal esophagus Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  EGD Friday, [**2168-10-7**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa suggestive of short segment (about 2cm) Barrett's Esophagus was found.
Biopsies were not taken given recent Upper GI bleed.
Stomach:  Excavated Lesions A single superficial 3-4 mm ulcer was found in the stomach body.
There was no high risk associated stimgata.
Impression: Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus Ulcer in the stomach body Pills in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 77M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and stent placement, pacemaker, hemorrhagic frontal CVA [**2152**], prior DVT and PE, BPH, type 2 DM, Hypertension, ulcerative colitis (with h/o of admissions for GI bleeding) transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with GI bleed and septic shock due to UTI with obstructive kidney stone.
# Septic Shock from Bacterial UTI with Proteous, infected ureteral stone: admitted with fevers and positive UA in the setting of obstructive kidney stone and recent cystoscopy.
- Zosyn empirically for gram negative and anaerobe coverage in the setting of recent instrumentation/hospitalization, which was changed on [**10-8**] to ceftriaxone with sensitivities.
- Pt was initially hypotensive to 70s on admission so gave fluid boluses and started on levophed, with good result, patient transferred to the floor on [**10-6**].
- CT A/P at [**Location (un) 620**] showed multiple left renal calculi with mild left hydronephrosis and delayed nephrogram c/w acute obstruction as well as cystitis.
Concern was for infected fluid collection behind stone so he underwent nephrostomy tube placement by IR to drain renal pelvic space behind stone.
# Hypokalemia, Hypomagnesemia - Patient has required almost daily supplementation.
# Upper GI bleed due to gastric ulcers: Initially presented to outside hospital with coffee-ground emesis.
GI was consulted and performed EGD on [**2168-10-5**] which showed multiple circular lesions consistent with NG trauma, as well as large bezoar, with no evidence of recent or active bleeding.
A repeat EGD was performed on [**2168-10-7**], which showed a superficial ulcer in the stomach body and short-segment Barrett's esophagus.
EP was consulted to interrogate his pacemaker and found that he had an episode of asymptomatic wide-complex tachycardia.
EP described it as an atrial tachy-arrhythmia with aberrancy and subsequently re-programmed the pacer to detect it at 135bpm.
CT head showed no acute intracranial process.
# Atrial Tachycardia with Abberency - The patient frequently goes into a wide complex rhythm.
# Acute renal failure: This was thought to result from a combination of septic shock as well as the obstructing calculus.
# Extrapyramidal syndrome: The patient was noted to have tremor and bilateral cogwheel rigidity.
Most likely parkinson's or vascular EP syndrome but in the setting of enlarged ventricles on CT head, urinary incontinence and his h/o recurrent fall.
# CAD s/p CABG / chronic systolic CHF / Benign Hypertension: ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35-45% at baseline.
held ACE-I and BB initially in the setting of bleeding and sepsis.
# Ulcerative colitis: Continued asacol.
# Type 2 Diabetes Controlled without Complications: Continued standing NPH and sliding scale  # Depression - continued lexapro, seroquel, ritalin  # Constipation - patient became highly constipated, but was succesfully treated with PEG over 3 days.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock GI bleed due to Gastic Ulcers Barrett's esophagus Obstructive nephrolithiasis Acute kidney injury Bacteremia Urinary Tract Infection Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Constipation Chronic Systolic CHF CAD Bypass Vessle Depression  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for treatment of your blood in your vomit, an infected kidney stone, and urinary tract infection with septic shock.
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a large collection of undigested food in your stomach.
Repeat endoscopy showed a small ulcer in your stomach and abnormal lining of your esophagus called barrets esophagus.
You will need to complete antibiotics until you have your lithotripsy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103548**].
You have also had low potassium levels, which the rehab will continue to monitor, and they can give you potassium as needed.
