Admission Date:  [**2160-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-11-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-10-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old male with a complicated cardiac history including coronary artery disease status post CABG x2 ([**2139**], [**2152**]), pericardial constriction status post stripping, diastolic dysfunction, stable angina (patient no longer an operative candidate per Cardiothoracic Surgery).
Patient also with history of diabetes mellitus type 1, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic pleural effusion, who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2160-10-28**] in decompensated heart failure.
Patient complained of progressive shortness of breath and pedal edema as well as an approximately 11 pound weight gain over the past 2-3 weeks.
While on the floor, diuresis was attempted with Lasix and nesiritide, but patient's heart failure was refractory to treatment, in addition he had worsening renal failure and became hypotensive.
He was subsequently transferred to the CCU for PA catheterization and further evaluation of hemodynamics/tailored CHF therapy.
Upon transfer, the patient denied complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness, fever or chills.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG '[**39**] with SVG to LAD and D1 and CABG in '[**52**] with SVG to RCA, and pericardial stripping secondary to constrictive pericarditis.
Catheterization [**1-20**] reveals 100% LAD lesion with unsuccessful PTCA attempt, patent D1 and a subtotal D2.
Catheterization [**1-20**] also revealed constrictive physiology with RA approximately equal to PCWP approximately 20 mm Hg.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.8.
Diabetes mellitus type 1 complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.
CVA secondary to prior CABG.
Seizure disorder secondary to CVA.
PVD status post right toe amputation and right fem bypass.
Chronic anemia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Dad with "[**Last Name **] problem", diabetes mellitus.
General:  Patient is alert, comfortable, and pleasant in no acute distress.
Extremities:  3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
ECG:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, flat T waves, no ST changes.
Echocardiogram:  [**10-28**] EF 60%, E/A ratio 1.57, no evidence of effusion or constriction, trivial MR.  HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.
Given patient's etiology for hypotensive on the floor was unclear and he was found to have elevated wedge pressure.
Dopamine was added to increase renal perfusion and enhance diuresis, however, patient became tachycardic and experienced anginal symptoms which resolved upon discontinuing dopamine.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable and given that his heart failure was secondary to diastolic dysfunction, his beta blocker was titrated back on board and increased as tolerated, as it was felt that slowing his heart rate, increasing his filling time would improve his cardiac function.
Coronary artery disease:  Patient remained chest pain free throughout stay except for episode of chest pain associated with dopamine drip.
He is known to have native LAD and SVG to LAD occlusion with perfusion via collaterals.
He is not an operative candidate for CT surgery given substantial mortality associated with third redo CABG, and patient with longstanding diabetes.
Hyponatremia:  Etiology felt related to either SIADH secondary to his SSRI or Tegretol or CHF.
Urine electrolytes were more consistent with SIADH picture, however, patient was hypervolemic and urine electrolytes can be confounded in the setting of diuretic therapy.
Tegretol was felt to be an unlikely etiology as this patient had been on this medication for many years with no prior history of hyponatremia.
Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency and initially elevated creatinine.
Urinalysis was sent which was negative for any evidence of ATN contributing to his renal disease.
He had no evidence of active bleeding, was guaiac negative, and additionally had no evidence of hemolysis.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease most likely secondary to longstanding renal failure.
