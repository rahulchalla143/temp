A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
**FINAL REPORT [**2139-9-3**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-9-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2139-8-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2139-9-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2139-8-29**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
IMAGING: CXR PA and lateral [**9-4**]: IMPRESSION: Improved bilateral atelectasis and edema after diuresis.
The effective forward LVEF was mildly reduced at 52%.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The indexed diameter of the main pulmonary artery was mildly dilated.
No evidence of pericardial constriction found.
There was a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
A note is made of large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, measuring less than 1 cm, likely reactive but better evaluated on prior CT 2 days prior.
Reaccumulation with increased extent of a right moderate-to-severe simple non-loculated pleural effusion since the pre-thoracentesis examination from [**2139-3-27**].
Increased now moderate left simple pleural effusion.
Interval progression of disease with new left-sided nodular opacification and increased in extent, peribronchiolar soft tissue and nodular opacities.
CTA CHEST [**2139-8-27**]: IMPRESSION: No pulmonary embolism.
Mild interstitial edema.
Right upper lobe consolidation and peribronchial opacities are suggestive of infection.
Large bilateral effusions with atelectasis of the adjacent lungs.
Brief Hospital Course: 34 y/o F with history of DM, HTN, CKD, recent admission for cellulitis presenting with facial swelling and foreign body sensation concerning for drug reaction, subsequently found to be with dyspnea and hypoxia, felt to be from pleural effusions related to serum sickness and hypoalbuminemia.
# Hypoxia: Patient's initial hypoxia concerning for drug reaction from quinolone.
No airway compromise.
There is evidence for systemic allergic reaction given facial swelling and skin rash, though.
She subsequently developed dyspnea and hypoxia again, with imaging suggestive of pneumonia.
On re-imaging, she also developed pulmonary edema.
Her clinical picture appeared most consistent with increased capillary permeability leading to increase capillary leak.
Rheumatology and renal teams were consulted and felt that diagnosis was most consistent with serum sickness and possibly hypoalbuminemia.
Echo was performed, and initially showed diastolic dysfunction, but this report was addended to state that cardiac systolic and diastolic function was normal.
To review prior records, patient does not carry diagnosis of CHF and last Echo did not show evidence of dysfunction.
There was a question of peribronchiolar soft tissue and nodular opacities on [**2139-9-1**] CT chest, which pulmonary felt was related to fluid and edema; however, f/u imaging in [**4-29**] weeks is recommended.
Patient will also f/u with rheumatology re: pending labs, and to see whether there is a rheumatologic cause for her pleural effusions, particularly given her strongly positive [**Doctor First Name **].
CXR not revealing for mediastinal or neck mass to cause SVC syndrome.
Unable to fully assess OP given Mallampati score, however, there was some concern for angioedema and capillary leak syndrome.
# Acute renal failure: renal team was consulted and reviewed sediment, which was consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria, without superimposed process.
No evidence for ATN.
On discharge, she was felt to be near her new baseline renal function.
# Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: Patient with several admissions for DKA in past.
No evidence for DKA during admission.
[**Last Name (un) **] was held given elevated Cr above baseline.
No evidence for hemolysis or blood loss.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued simvastatin .
# Depression: continued citalopram .
# Transitional issues: - f/u CXR post discharge after 4-6 weeks re: nodular opacities on [**2139-9-1**] CT chest, which pulmonary felt was related to fluid and edema - EPO level pending on discharge - rheumatology labs pending on discharge - PCP to address lasix titration and possible [**Last Name (un) **] re-initiation - Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain bloodwork for chemistry 7 on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2139-9-11**] and send results to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].

You had been taking the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin for your recent right lower extremity cellulitis, when you developed significant facial swelling.
While you were in the hospital, you also became short of breath and had oxygen saturation levels that reached as low as 60%.
Given this sudden decrease in your respiratory function, you were placed on oxygen and received a chest X-ray on [**2139-8-26**] that revealed significant fluid around your lungs, known as pleural effusions.
A CT scan of your chest on [**2139-8-27**] was also obtained that confirmed the findings from your X-ray, and suggested the possibility of an infection as well.
Given the effect the fluid was having on your breathing, the interventional pulmonary team was consulted to remove some of the effusion to relieve your symptoms and also to send it for analysis.
Your breathing improved significantly where you no longer needed oxygen, and on a follow-up chest X-ray on [**2139-9-4**], your pleural effusions had decreased significantly.
Due to the nature of the fluid around your lungs, we were concerned that your heart may not be pumping effectively resulting in the back up of fluid.
To follow-up this finding, you had a Cardiac MRI on [**2139-9-3**] which revealed no dysfunction with your heart whatsoever.
Your previous ultrasound study was also reread by a Cardiology attending on [**2139-9-3**] and he confirmed that there was no dysfunction seen on this modality either.
You had some elevated blood sugars which were may have been from recent steroids given in the emergency room for controlling your allergy symptoms.
Lastly, the team noted a low red blood cell count or anemia that has been worsening in recent weeks.
Given your history of GI bleeding and recent use of ibuprofen you should continue taking a daily anti-acid medication called omeprazole and stop using any ibuprofen as this medicine can promote GI bleeding and worsen kidney function.
Please use Tylenol as a safer alternative for headaches and joint pains.
MEDICATION CHANGES/INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Decrease usual simvastatin to 20mg daily (this is due to possible interaction with amlodipine) 2) Please do not take ibuprofen, instead take Tylenol 650mg q6hrs as needed for headaches and/or leg pain 3) Continue glargine at 3 Units in morning and 7 Units at bedtime and see attached full Humalog Sliding Scale insulin dosing schedule which is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] 4) Please restart omeprazole 40mg daily 5) Please start ferrous sulfate 325mg iron tablets twice daily 6) If you develop constipation on iron, please take over the counter colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed to help soften stools 7) Hold valsartan on discharge 8) Increase metoprolol tartrate to 37.5 mg twice a day .
