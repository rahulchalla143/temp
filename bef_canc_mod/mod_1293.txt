Admission Date:  [**2131-6-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-9-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed by chest CT and diabetes mellitus who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a left scapular and left arm pain since 1 a.m. on the day of admission.
The patient had a similar episode five days ago which resolved spontaneously.
Patient was having 5/10 chest pain on presentation.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 958**] denied chest pain, chest tightness, no cough, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting upon presentation.
The patient had no history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea orthopnea.
In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room, the patient had an anterior lateral lead ST elevation and CK elevation minimally to 45.
Catheterization laboratory showed a normal left main with a twin left anterior descending system with 50-60% ostial proximal stenosis, 100% mid stenosis after D1, D1 diffuse 80% proximal with distally graftable lumen, left circumflex 40-50% mid lesion before the large OM1 and mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with a 100% distal mid after posterolateral branch with TIMI II flow.
The culprit left anterior descending lesion was Hepacoat stented with 0% residual and TIMI III distal flow, proximal ostial 60%.
Sarcoidosis, mild pulmonary involvement.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 15 years.
Blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy.
Physical examination:  Alert and oriented times three in no acute distress, lethargic, obese female.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  She had bilateral submandibular gland enlargement.
She had a slight amount of dry blood was noticed on her lips but there was no evidence of oral syringeal or tongue wax, otherwise, she was normocephalic and atraumatic.
Her neck exam:  There is no carotid bruit.
No thyromegaly.
No jugular venous pressure.
Possible S4 with distant heart sounds.
Abdominal exam:  Nontender, positive active bowel sounds, obese, but not distended abdomen.
Her pre catheterization pain free electrocardiogram showed a regular rate and rhythm, ST elevation in V1 to V6 without reciprocal changes in I and aVL.
Her post catheterization electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block, anterior myocardial infarction based on Q waves development, acute and recent.
Cardiovascular:  A.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient's left anterior descending was stented, however, the patient continued to have a high risk coronary anatomy with persistent stenosis as noted above.
A heparin drip was initiated to prophylax for potential left ventricular thrombus in the setting of an anterolateral left ventricular wall infarct, however, the patient was taken off heparin when it was determined that her risks were low given the results of her echocardiogram, status post catheterization, which showed reasonably good ejection fraction and no apical akinesis or dyskinesis, just hypokinesis, which could not significantly increase the risk for left ventricular thrombus formation.
The results showed a mildly dilated left atrium, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular cavity size being normal.
Overall, left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed with septal, distal, anterior and apical hypokinesis.
There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Electrocardiogram showed no rhythm abnormalities and no evidence of arrhythmia throughout her hospitalization.
Renal:  The patient had no renal issues throughout her hospitalization.
Intravenous fluids were administered without dextrose per post catheterization protocol to minimize the chance of dye induced nephropathy.
Hematology:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Post catheterization, she was checked daily for evidence of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma at the catheterization site.
Patient had no evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm at the catheterization site.
The Cardiothoracic Surgery Team was to contact the patient after she was discharged to arrange surgery, which will be the best long-term option for patient with significant coronary artery disease with high risk anatomy in the setting of diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease.
Myocardial infarction.
Diabetes mellitus.
