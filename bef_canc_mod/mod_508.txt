#Atrial Fibrillation: On POD#3, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, after having missed a dose of his metoprolol; this resolved with iv metoprolol, and his po metoprolol was re-dosed to TID to provide better control.
The next day, he went into afib again, and was rate controlled with iv metoprolol; by this time, the patient was having nausea and emesis with gastric distension likely secondary to ileus, and it was thought that his PO metoprolol was not being absorbed.
By POD#5, after continued afib with occasional tachycardia to the 130s, it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for rate control with esmolol and diltiazem drips.
Cardiology followed and it was recommended that he start an amio gtt to improve chances of successfull cardioversion.
A TEE was performed on [**2116-5-14**] which was negative for intracardiac thrombus.

He was cultured and was ultimately found to have a pan-sensitive E. Coli UTI.
-follow renal recommendations for cyclosporine dosing -follow up cyclosporine level and check with renal whether to check daily cyclosporine levels.
POD#6, he was passing over 2L of liquid stool, and it was decided to start octreotide to slow down the output and perhaps also improve his intermittent nausea.
Continued to have loose liquid stools at time of ICU call out.
Noted to have UTI per above with recommendations for 14 day course.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on heparin 5000 units SQ TID for DVT/PE prophylaxis.
