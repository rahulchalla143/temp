No evidence of thrombus in the basilic or cephalic veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Since no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound was used to identify the right basilic vein, which was patent and compressible.
A dressing was applied, and final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrated tip of the catheter to be located in the distal part of the SVC.
130 ml of nonionic contrast were administered.
No evidence of new hematoma.
A small fluid collection near the left cardiophrenic angle measuring 45 x 22 mm (2:38) appears to be slightly smaller than the previous study from [**2148-12-3**], and also more hypodense.
The findings are consistent with a resolving hematoma.
Severe coronary artery calcifications and stents in the coronary arteries.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, similar to [**2148-12-3**].
CT ABDOMEN: Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen with simple characteristics.
No evidence of hematoma within the abdomen.
The proximal portion of the pancreatic duct is slightly dilated measuring 8 mm, but the distal pancreatic duct is unremarkable.
No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Small periportal nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
Multiple nodules in the subcutaneous tissues in the anterior abdominal wall, likely from medication injection.
CT PELVIS: There is malposition with the Foley catheter likely with the balloon in the urethra.
Small amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes of the spine, but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Large bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
The pleural effusions have simple characteristics and are unchanged since prior study.
Mild dilatation of the central portion of the pancreatic duct measuring up to 8 mm of unclear significance.
Correlate with history of simple ascites.

Right occipital lobe lesion as described above, of uncertain etiology.
The intense restricted diffusion may suggest a small involving infarction with surrounding hemorrhage.
Areas of susceptibility artifact seen scattered throughout both cerebral hemispheres suggestive of amyloid angiopathy.
Subgaleal fluid collection over the left temporal bone- etiology uncertain.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] no stenosis or aneurysm centrally.
Evaluation for a mycotic aneurysm is unsatisfactory, as there is no clear visualization of the distal intracranial arterial vasculature, which is the usual locale for mycotic aneurysms.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.
He underwent preoperative workup including cardiac catherization and infectious disease consult.
Cardiac catherization mild single vessel coronary artery disease.
He returned to the operating room that evening due to bleeding and widened mediastinum.
He continued to progress but on postoperative day 4 he was in atrial fibrillation with hypotension and returned to the CSRU for monitoring and vasopressors.
He continued to be in and out of atrial fibrillation and sternal click noted with no drainage.
Plastic surgery was consulted, VAC dressing was placed until he was ready for sternal closure.
He required returns to the operating room for sternal exploration due to bleeding.
He has continued to progress since sedation was weaned and he underwent a tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator.
Do to failure to wean he required prolonged ventilation, he had a tracheostomy placed # 8 Portex without complications.
In addition he has had pigtails placed for pleural effusions which are now removed.
Medications adjusted due to renal clearance and has been slowly diuresed.
Heme: Received multiple blood products due to coagulopathies and falling hematocrit.
