Admission Date:  [**2168-1-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-1-18**]   Service:  Vascular  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral lower extremity discomfort; left greater than right over the past several months with pain at rest and pain with ambulation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is wheelchair bound and has had a myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year with an ejection fraction is 20% to 25%.
An echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 205**] demonstrated global hypokinesis with 1+ aortic insufficiency and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
The native vessel disease showed irregularities in the left main trunk.
There was no left anterior descending artery disease.
There was a large branching ramus intermedius which was normal.
The circumflex was very short and immediately gave rise to the atrial circumflex artery and branching obtuse marginal.
The lower pole of the first obtuse marginal was occluded and filled via left-to-left collaterals.
It had a long proximal 90% tubular stenosis and a 60% ablation and an 85% lesion involving the medial right coronary artery with a distal right coronary artery lesion of 40%.
Chronic anemia.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction; status post congestive heart failure.
Bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass in the past.
Left carotid endarterectomy.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed left foot was cool and tender to palpation.
There was dopplerable signal of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses on the right.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with an atrioventricular conduction delay.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
When compared with previous tracings of [**2168-1-8**] there were no changes.
A chest x-ray was unremarkable for congestive heart failure.
Intravenous hydration and Mucomyst preparation was begun because of his chronic renal insufficiency.
The abdominal aorta showed mildly diseased suprarenal aorta.
The left renal artery which had previously received endarterectomy was widely patent; although, there was a fibrinous probable hyperplastic intima at the renal artery midportion prior to its bifurcation.
There was a visible nephrogram on that side.
The renal artery on the right was substantially higher, and there were two lesions with approximately 50% to 60% stenosis in the artery of post stenotic dilatation.
There was a previously placed aortobifemoral graft which was widely patent without evidence of thrombosis or stenosis of either arteries.
There was no left common femoral artery, and the left limb of the aortobifemoral was anastomosed to the profunda femoris.
The bypass graft was visualized coming off the profunda, and there was no evidence of stenosis proximally.
Distally, there was a patent reconstructed anterior tibial.
Anterior tibial constitutes runoff to the ankle which perfused the dorsalis pedis which promptly occludes 4 cm.
However, there was a small tarsal branch visualized prior to determination.
There was reconstitution of a very small peroneal artery which filled all collaterals which go to the heel.
They felt there was no need for any interventional or diagnostic cardiac studies since the patient had been recently revascularized, and that he should be treated for any susceptible congestive heart failure and maintained with a systolic blood pressure in the 120s to 130s.
Other recommendations were to add and aspirin after there was no surgical contraindication.
His x-ray was without pneumothorax.
Electrocardiogram was without acute changes.
His Foley catheter was discontinued, and he had no difficulty voiding.
Blood loss anemia; corrected.
