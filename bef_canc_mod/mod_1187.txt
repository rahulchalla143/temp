Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-21**] Femoral line placement [**2146-9-27**] Hemodialysis [**2146-9-28**] Transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells [**2146-9-29**] Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-30**] Laminectomy of L5-S1 for removal of epidural abscess [**2146-9-30**] Removal of surgical drain [**2146-10-6**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76-year-old male with no significant past medical history who was transferred from an OSH for 6 weeks of fevers and acute onset lower back pain.
On [**2146-9-18**], he experienced acute onset of lower back pain that radiated down his left leg to his left toes.
He has had similar episodes of lower back pain in the past, but less severe in intensity.
He also complained of urinary incontinence; however, this had been going on for several months.
Due to the severity of lower back pain, he presented to MWMC where he was found to have fevers to 102.4 and a leukocytosis of 19.6.
He was also noted to be in renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 (baseline unknown), thus an MRI with contrast was not performed.
Laboratory data was notable for a leukocytosis to 18.6, renal failure with BUN/Cr 40/2.2, anemia with HCT 30, urinalysis with large blood and [**2-17**] RBCs.
An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained without contrast, which showed moderate canal stenosis at L4-L5, severe canal stenosis at L5-S1, and impingement of the L5 nerve root by the disc.
No epidural abscess was seen on this study.
A CXR showed mild pulmonary edema with no pneumonia.
The patient was given 1g IV vancomycin and morphine for pain control.
After 3L of IVF, tachycardia improved to 108.
Wheezes were appreciated in both lung fields and CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
EKG was significant for ST depression of <1mm in leads V4-V5.
Pt was transferred to MICU for management of respiratory distress and flash pulmonary edema.
Cardiology consult suggested NSTEMI likely secondary to demand ischemia.
ACEi, hydralazine, and isosorbide mononitrate was also recommended for blood pressure control, but ACEi was held as pt was in acute renal failure.
Pt continued to have back pain and was found to have enterococcus faecalis in his blood.
TTE was negative and TEE showed an aortic valve vegetation.
Bacterial sensitivities were completed and pt was started on a course of Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin.
MRI L-spine with and without contrast shows pt has multiple epidural abscesses.
IR and Neurosurgery were consulted, surgery is being held for now as pt pain has been improving.
Back pain is currently an issue, for which he's on Dilaudid PCA, Neurontin, and Valium.
Pt had been encouraged by family and staff to use Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Pt complained of decreased rectal tone and saddle anesthesia, but not confirmed by neurosurgery consult.
RN noticed pt had difficulty swallowing pills and had mild aspiration.

FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No signs of cholecystitis.
Left LE ultrasound ([**10-5**]): INDICATION: 76-year-old man with asymmetric lower extremity edema.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
The largest of these, measuring 12 x 7 mm, continues to exert significant mass effect on the caudal thecal sac with some crowding of the traversing nerve roots within, and abuts the left dorsolateral aspect of the traversing right S1 nerve root sheath.
There is also some evidence of intervening L5-S1 discitis, as well as anterior subligamentous phlegmon, as before.
No definite evidence of noncontiguous involvement of the remainder of the spine, with stable hyperintensity within the L1-2 disc, which may be on a degenerative basis, as there are no other signs of infection at this level.
Normal overall appearance of the spinal cord and conus medullaris, with no pathologic leptomeningeal, intramedullary or nerve root enhancement.
Extensive degenerative changes involving, particularly, the mid-cervical spine, with ventral canal and neural foraminal narrowing and cord flattening from the C4-5 through C6-7 levels.
However, there is no definite abnormality of intrinsic signal within the cervical spinal cord.
Assessment for enhancing lesions is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
A small focus of negative susceptibility adjacent to the left vertebral artery is of uncertain nature (series 8, image 108) and it is unclear if this relates to the orientation of the vessel or a focus of calcification; less likely a focus of aneurysm and this can be better assessed with CT angiogram.
MRI Brain w/o contrast ([**10-3**]): IMPRESSION: Evolving deep white matter infarcts without evidence for new infarct or other acute findings when compared to the most recent MRI one week prior.
Given the patient's history, it is possible the infarcts relate to underlying infection, and a repeat examination with gadolinium could be considered as indicated clinically to look for evidence of meningitis.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
Transesophageal echocardiogram ([**9-20**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly thickened aortic valve (3 leaflets) with 6mm echodensity on the LVOT side of non-coronary leaflet with some mobile components c/w a vegetation.
An eccentric jet of mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable aortic valve endocarditis with mild aortic regurgitation.
Complex atheroma in arch and descending aorta.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
A probable thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a small vegetation on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
INDICATION:  This is a 76-year-old gentleman who presented with several weeks of back pain associated with fever.
Ultimately the patient underwent an MRI that demonstrated an L5-S1 epidural abscess.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  L5 laminectomy and S1 laminectomy and epidural abscess evacuation under microscopic visualization.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent and preoperative laboratory values were verified, the patient was brought into the operating room and he underwent general anesthesia and intubation without difficulty.
The planned incision was initially infiltrated with local anesthetics with dilute epinephrine.
There were several epidural collections identified that were tightly adherent to the dura.
Specimen sent included the epidural abscess.
[**MD Number(2) 71682**]  Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 71683**]  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76-year-old male with a past medical history of benign prostate hypertrophy, gout, and chronic kidney disease, who presented from [**Hospital6 1109**] for workup of 6 weeks of fevers and acute onset of lower back pain.
# Enterococcal Bacteremia / Aortic Valve Endocarditis The patient's subacute history of fevers was concerning for endocartidis, and blood cultures on the day of transfer grew gram positive cocci ultimately speciated as enterocccus faecalis that was vanc/amp sensitive.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a vegetation on the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
He underwent transesophageal echocardiogram intraoperatively (during the epidural abscess drainage) that showed persistent vegetation on aortic valve, with mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
# L5 Epidural Abscesses The patient's complaint of back pain prompted additional imaging with tagged wbc scan and ultimately MRI with gadolinium that was positive for several small epidural abscesses around the area of L5 with some thecal sac impingement on the right side, and possible L5-S1 discitis.
However, the patient's pain continued to increase and he showed evidence of worsening sensory/motor deficits in his left lower extremity.
Tissue and fluid samples were sent for gram stain, culture and pathology, but did not yield the identity of the causative organism (sterile after prolonged treatment with ampicillin and ceftriaxone).
# Pain Control: Post-operatively patient was treated with Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
# Probable Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus: This was visualized on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram.
Anticoagulation was deferred immediately post-operatively due to the risk of bleeding at the surgical site.
# NSTEMI / Demand Ischemic Event The patient was transferred to the medical ICU in the setting of hypertensive emergency with SBPs > 200, pulmonary edema requiring bipap, and a rise in CK/CK-MB/troponin with question of lateral ECG changes/ST depressions.
Echocardiogram showed mild apical hypokinesis.
Cardiology was consulted and the consensus was that this was likely demand ischemia in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
Statin was stopped due to slight transaminitis.
# MRSA Positive Sputum In the ICU, patient was noted to have MRSA positive sputum.
CXR did not show evidence of pneumonia and patient was asymptomatic.
# Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Disease The patient had a creatine of 2.0-2.5 during recent admission, with baseline estimated at 1.5-low 2s with h/o BPH, h/o TURP and obstructive symptoms.
Sediment showed granular casts, felt to be consistent with low grade GN related to the endocarditis.
His creatinine at time of discharge is ~2.0, consistent with previous baseline.
A temporary right femoral line was placed for hemodialysis following the MRI with gadolinium to prevent nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
# Upper Extremity Tremor The neurology service was consulted when patient developed upper extremity tremors/myoclonic jerks one week into the hospitalization.
He underwent EEG that was negative for seizure activity.
He had a brain MRI that showed areas of restricted diffusion in the deep white matter that could represent embolic infarcts.
A follow-up MRI showed evolution of these infarcts but no new lesions.
Overall, his tremors and upper extremity jerks were felt to be secondary to a toxic-metabolic state from the underlying infection.
The symptoms resolved as his infection was treated, and have not been a problem for several days prior to discharge.
# Anemia This was felt to be secondary to his acute inflammatory state.
# BPH The patient has had a foley catheter in place for most of this admission.
# Elevated LFTs Patient was noted to have LFTs post-operatively.
The alternative would be to exchange ceftriaxone for gentamicin, but this may place the patient in danger of permanent renal failure and cause need for hemodialysis.
High-dose statin, which was started in context of troponin leak in the ICU, was stopped in the setting of elevated LFTs as it too may have been a contributing factor.
# Fevers Patient has had fever throughout this admission.
Post-operatively, he had several high fevers to > 102, which were felt to be related to disruption of infectious material in his epidural space.
Vancomycin (started for MRSA-positive sputum) was stopped as patient had no evidence of PNA and antibiotics may have been contributing.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Enterococcal Aortic valve endocarditis Epidural Abscess on L5 nerve Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure Thrombus in right atrial appendage NSTEMI (in setting of demand ischemia)  Secondary: Gout Asthma Benign Prostate Hypertrophy   Discharge Condition: Stable vitals, fever curve trending down, not yet ambulating.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital6 **] to the [**Hospital1 1535**] for workup of your six weeks of fevers and your acute lower back pain.
A blood culture showed you were growing bacteria in your bloodstream.
A transesophageal ultrasound showed you had a vegetation on your heart valve (endocarditis) which was likely the source of the bacteria in your blood.
You were started on intravenous antibiotics and subsequent blood tests showed you were no longer growing bacteria in your bloodstream.
While you were in the ICU, you had an episode of low blood pressure that triggered chest pain and damage to the muscle cells of the heart.
You had no further problems with chest pain after you left the ICU.
This may have happened because of some underlying coronary artery disease - you should discuss the best medical management of this issue with your primary care doctor and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] of cardiology.
On an MRI, you were found to have abscess in your spinal epidural space (the layer covering your spine).
This was likely the source of your left lower back pain and leg pain.
MRI of your brain shows several small lesions that may represent bacteria that have traveled to the brain.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: - BEGIN TAKING Ampicillin (last day = [**11-11**]) - BEGIN TAKING Ceftriaxone (last day = [**11-11**]) - BEGIN TAKING Coumadin (last day [**12-7**] or as directed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] - BEGIN TAKING metoprolol for high blood pressure - BEGIN TAKING amlodipine for high blood pressure - CONSIDER TAKING medications to treat constipation, pain, and SOB as needed (these will be provided for you at the rehab facility) - STOP TAKING medications for gout and BPH until directed to do so by your physician(s)  Please keep/arrange the follow up appointments as outlined below.
You may need to have another MRI of your lumbar spine with and without contrast prior to this appointment (check with [**Location (un) 3230**] about scheduling this).
Additionally, he will address any cardiac issues or make necessary changes in medication related to your troponin leak that occurred while you were in the hospital.
