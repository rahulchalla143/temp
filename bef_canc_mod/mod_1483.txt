HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was brought to the Emergency Room from [**Hospital1 **], status post syncopal episode while being turned in bed that lasted about 30 seconds.
The patient was previously discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit on East the day prior to stay that was from [**3-15**] for congestive heart failure secondary to fluid overload.
Prior to that from [**1-6**] to [**1-31**] he patient was admitted for pseudomonal pneumonia and was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy placed.
She was anxious although she did not have any chest pains and her potassium was found to be 7.8 nonhemolyzed.
Lungs - she had scattered wheezes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: she was sinus tachycardia with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
It was soft, nontender, with positive bowel sounds and she had right lower extremity edema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for 1) nonHodgkin's disease in [**2125**] treated with CHOP and radiation therapy complicated by histoplasmosis, ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis.
Also had a left pneumonectomy in [**2122**] secondary to aspergillus.
Last pulmonary function tests are [**2130-9-18**] with an FVC of 0.6, FEV1 to FVC of 68 and severely depressed total lung capacity indicating severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease.
2) Tuberculosis in [**2121**].
4) Anxiety and depression/insomnia.
5) Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 20 percent diagnosed in [**2124**].
Occasional alcohol and no intravenous drug abuse.
Her urinalysis at this time was negative ad chest x-ray showed improving congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 122, normal axis and no hyperkalemic changes, no ischemic changes.
Patient had another similar episode while in the hospital while being suctioned, likely also vasovagal.
On hospital day five patient became hypokalemic at 2.6 and was started on daily potassium supplements.
She has not had any electrocardiographic changes secondary to her hyperkalemia.
As her diuresing progressed the patient tolerated decreased pressure support for about a week and over her last week of her stay she has been having increased tachypnea and tachycardia requiring increased pressure support, now on a pressure support of 20 divided with 5 with an FIO2 of 40.
She has had cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 percent.
On admission her weight was over 60 kilograms, about 20 kilograms over her dry weight secondary to fluid overload.
Baseline she is hypotensive running in the 80s/50s and tolerates her Lasix doses even with this low blood pressure.
She was initially given Captopril for afterload reduction.
This was discontinued secondary to hypertension and she has been doing well on he Digoxin and Lasix.
Also throughout her stay she had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, usually in the middle of the night running up to 150, most likely secondary to her hyperkalemia interfering with her Digoxin.
She is currently without any symptoms from this.
5: Infectious Disease.
She had a fever on admission, was started on Vancomycin secondary to line infection.
She was also on Tobramycin for 28 days for prophylactic therapy for pseudomonal pneumonia and she was on Ancef for five days starting [**3-27**] for status post J tube placement and then placed on Ancef for three days on [**4-13**] for cellulitis at her J site.
As far as microorganisms she had positive blood cultures on [**3-16**] that grew out coagulase negative staph.
Her sputum on [**3-17**] grew out sparse yeast.
Urine grew out yeast on [**3-28**].
Her stool on [**4-11**] was negative for C. difficile and [**4-12**] she had blood, urine and sputum.
On [**3-27**] the procedure was done in the operating room by surgery where they closed the gastric opening from the gastric tube, left her epidermal gastric site as it to close by secondary intention and then placed a J tube.
b) She had issues related to constipation, most likely secondary to morphine.
Urine output decreases so please be aware of her potassium dose.
Also continue with Lasix even secondary to low blood pressure as this is her normal where she runs 80s/50s.
