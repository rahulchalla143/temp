Per family, patient has had decreased energy and more fatigue, ?????
No specific localizing symptoms or complaints, though did note mild nonproductive cough and c/o shortness of breath last night; also with intermittent c/o RUQ pain today.
Temp mildly elevated to 100 axillary at [**Hospital1 1501**] today.
Noted to have worsening leukocytosis on routine labs (gets frequent lab checks due to myelofibrosis history), 23K on [**10-21**].
Discussed starting interferon alpha for myelofibrosis with hepatic infiltration; this has not yet been started.
Received morphine 4, haldol 2, olanzapine 10, Ativan 1 for agitation and premed prior to CT abdomen.
Past Medical History: # myelofibrosis: JAK2 mutation (V617F) positive myeloproliferative neoplasm, (MPN)followed since [**2176-6-2**] # Portal hypertension, no clear etiology, ?related to hepatic infiltration of extramedullary hematopoiesis.
# CKD, stage IV - baseline around 2.0 # PAF, now [**Year (4 digits) 4448**] dependence after AV nodal ablation (Currently with [**Company 1543**] Thera single chamber [**Company 4448**] programmed in the VVIR mode at 75 beats per minute).

Brother in late 60s with CAD, Parkinson's, and renal failure.
Mother died of aortic stenosis in her late 80s Extensive family h/o alcohol abuse  Physical Exam: Admission: General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress, lethargic but easily arousable.
Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Diminished), (Left DP pulse: Diminished) Respiratory / Chest: (Percussion: No(t) Resonant : ), (Breath Sounds: Crackles : R mid lung fields and base, L base, No(t) Wheezes : , Diminished: and poor effort) Abdominal: Soft, Bowel sounds present, Distended, No(t) Tender: , Obese, + HSM Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+ edema.
No drainage, + surrounding erythema.
No drainage, + surrounding erythema.
Underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-7-11**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
CXR [**2177-10-24**]: IMPRESSION: New opacity within the right lung base, worrisome for pneumonia.
Mild ascites and pleural effusion.
[**2177-10-24**] CT-HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of bowel obstruction or pneumatosis.
No free air.
Unchanged urinary bladder stone.
Right lower lobe opacifications persist consistent with pneumonia.
Right pleural effusion and ascites.
Given differences in semi-upright to upright technique, the moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent opacity reflecting either underlying pneumonia or compression atelectasis is likely not significantly changed from [**10-26**] but has clearly progressed from [**10-24**].
More oblong density projecting over the right hemithorax is consistent with worsened lower lobe and likely middle lobe atelectasis/collapse.
CXR [**2177-10-31**]: post-thoracentesis: IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion with no pneumothorax.
Patchy right upper lobe consolidation.
There is a small right pleural effusion, which has increased since the prior study.
There is right lower lobe atelectasis.
There is continued right middle lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, containing air bronchograms.
Right-sided [**Month/Day/Year 4448**] is present with dual leads in right atrium and right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 M with myelofibrosis and extramedullary/liver hematopoiesis, PVD, recurrent cellulitis; admited with acute on chronic altered mental status and pneumonia.
He did not require intubation or ventilatory support.
# Pneumonia.
His fever and leukocytosis improved.
6 days into his hospital stay he complained of positional SOB worse when lying down.
He was found to have a unilateral right sided effusion that had developed since admission.
The etiology of his pleural effusion is somewhat unclear but may be [**1-4**] IVF in the MICU, heart failure or ascites.
Since thoracentesis, the patient has had no difficulty breathing.
# Altered mental status.
An ongoing issue for several months, has seen outpatient neurobehavioral specialist.
He has had recurrent delerium atrributed to narcotics and various infections, most frequently cellulitis.
On admission, he was lethargic and disoriented, thought to be due to pneumonia.
Hepatic encephalopathy was also considered given hepatic infiltration of extramedullary hematopoiesis and ascites although the patient had no asterixis or clonus.
He was started on lactulose without improvement and with worsening metabolic acidosis in the ICU; lactulose was stopped.
He was noted to have a minimal amount of ascites that appears to be attributed to portal hypertension.
He did not have a paracentesis given the small amount of ascitis and the fact that he was treated with Zosyn.
However, he should have a paracentesis to rule out SBP the next time he is admitted with AMS.
He also developed hypernatremia [**1-4**] to NPO status several days into admission.
# Cellulitis.
Has severe PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound consult.
It is unclear if he truly had cellulitis vs venous status during this admission.
However, the antibiotic for HCAP would also have treated cellulitis.
# Leukocytosis.
Treating for pneumonia and cellulitis as above.
Given history of C.diff and recent clindamycin use, C.diff was considered although the patient only had diarrhea once with lactulose.
Patient also with history of myelofibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Per hematologist, often tends to spike high WBC counts in times of stress and infection due to disordered cell production.
# Myelofibrosis/anemia: Hydroxyurea and epogen continued.
Patient also has iron deficiency that may be contributing to anemia.
# CHF, systolic dysfunction: Initially lasix and metoprolol were held in the setting of possible SIRS physiology.
Not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] due to angioedema.
# ARF on CKD.
Renal U/S w/o acute pathology.
# Metabolic acidosis.
Worsening metabolic acidosis (bicarb as low as 8), likely secondary to worsening renal failure and to diarrhea from lactulose.
# Hepatitis.
?cirrhotic physiology with chronically elevated INR, AST>ALT; mildly elevated bilirubin (not seen in recent past).
Thought to be due to infiltration of extramedullary hematopoeitic cells given severe myelofibrosis.
He has had intermitted low level elevations in transaminases over the past year.
