Admission Date:  [**2124-3-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-3-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post a recent two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on [**2124-2-17**], diabetes, hypertension, and a recently noted right upper lobe lung nodule on prior CT scan, who presents to the hospital on [**2124-3-3**] for wheezing and dyspnea noted by VNA at home.
He was also noted to have bilateral crackles and evidence of some congestive heart failure on initial chest x-ray.
Patient had previously had an uneventful postoperative course on his prior admission except for some hyponatremia which had been evaluated, admit by the medical consult team.
Most recently the patient's sodium had been 126 on [**2124-2-20**], and he had been sent home with a presumptive diagnosis of chronic hyponatremia, possibly SIADH, and prescribed sodium tablets.
He was planned to followup for workup of his right upper lobe lung nodule.
The patient denied feeling dyspneic or having other complaints such as chest pain at home.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had a cough for approximately one week productive of some clear sputum.
History of an enlarged prostate/prostate cancer, the details of which the family was uncertain.
Lung nodule as noted on prior CT scan.
Hyponatremia as noted on prior admission.
The family states that patient has had a low sodium for approximately four years.
Coronary artery disease status post two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on [**2124-2-17**].
Cardiovascular: Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Lungs:  Scattered wheezes bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
There is an incision in the left groin secondary to prior intervention with no obvious erythema or drainage.
Chest x-ray on [**2124-3-3**] showed an interval increase in the patient's small right pleural effusion with adjacent increased opacity in the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe, question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There is also evidence of a small left pleural effusion.
From prior admission, chest CT scan on [**2124-2-16**] noted bilateral small effusions with adjacent atelectasis, an addition consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, atelectasis, versus aspiration, versus pneumonia.
A 5 mm ill-defined density in the right upper lobe malignancy versus scarring.
His scars showed good evidence of healing.
In the setting of some mild congestive heart failure, he was also started on an ACE inhibitor.
For congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his standing dose of po Lasix and given daily prn Lasix typically 20-40 mg IV q day to keep the patient approximately 500 cc negative/day.
Repeat chest x-ray after the patient was transferred to the floor showed additional interval increase in the patient's right sided pleural effusion which was thought to be possibly associated with a right lower lobe consolidation.
Given the patient's history of right upper lobe nodule on CT scan however, possibility of a malignant effusion was also considered possible.
Given the patient's mild congestive heart failure, it was also felt that his congestive heart failure was contributing to the effusion.
The patient had no complaints of chest pain and actually denied shortness of breath throughout his hospitalization.
As noted, the patient is noted to have an interval increase in the size of a right sided pleural effusion compared to last chest x-ray from prior admission and even an additional interval increase during the first several days of his hospitalization here.
It was thought to be secondary to congestive heart failure versus pneumonia versus possible malignant effusion.
The patient was complaining of a dry cough.
Was noted to have a low grade temperature early on his hospitalization and chest x-ray did suggest the possible associated right lower lobe consolidation.
On [**2124-3-7**] the patient underwent thoracentesis which drained approximately 1 liter of serous fluid slightly turbid appearing.
Fluid analysis was consistent with exudative effusion.
There were 1+ polys, no organisms noted on the Gram stain, and bacterial cultures were negative.
Fluid was also sent for cytology, which was notable only for some reactive mesothelial cells.
Given the exudative nature of the fluid, this is still possible to be a malignant origin, and will be monitored for reaccumulation as an outpatient.
Their feeling was that if the patient had significant reaccumulation of fluid or became symptomatic over the next several weeks, they would consider reintervention such as pleuroscopy to look for evidence of pleural malignant involvement and do biopsy if necessary.
The combination of some mild diuresis and the removal of the fluid and antibiotic coverage and/or a combination of the three resulted in improvement in the patient's level of oxygenation as he was initially sating in the low 90s on [**1-19**] liters on presentation to the Medical Service.
He had been notable to have some mild hyponatremia which was thought to be chronic on the prior admission to approximately 126-130.
Given the presence of his right upper lobe lung nodule and the results of his urine electrolytes, the patient was thought to have SIADH.
Should the patient not have evidence of hypoparathyroidism, other etiologies such as vitamin D deficiency can be explored.
The patient is noted to have a low hematocrit to approximately 27-28 which was not substantially changed from his hematocrit at the time of his last discharge.
His iron studies revealed a low iron, a mid to low TIBC, and an elevated ferritin suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic disease.
The patient with a history of some urinary retention as per the family.
Patient's family noted that on repeat evaluation he was noted not to have prostate cancer, although it is unclear of the exact workup.
Was noted to have clear urine without any clots or evidence of obstruction secondary to bleeding.
The Urology Service was curbsided, who felt that likely the patient had some baseline urinary retention which had been exacerbated by Foley placement.
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Right pleural effusion (exudative).
Urinary retention.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Anemia of chronic disease.
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q five minutes prn chest pain up three tablets in 15 minutes.
