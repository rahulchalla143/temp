**Overdue for colonoscopy and will need follow-up scheduled with gastroenterology for colonoscopy by PCP after discharge.
Anemia [**Hospital1 **] were pending on discharge and will need follow-up as well.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to the ICU, where she was aggresively diuresed for dCHF decompensation as detailed below and a suspected multi-drug resistant PNA in light of the patient's history of MDR GNRs on sputum culture.
# Suspected MDR PNA: Initially treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin for MDR PNA given the patient's history of sputum growing GNRs sensitive to meropenem during a recent hospitalization.
On admission to the ICU, sputum cultures were collected and confirmed GNRs, at which point vancomycin and azithromycin were stopped; however, it was not until after the meropenem course was completed that sensitivities showed resistance to meropenem and sensitivity to imapenem.
At this point, the patient's clinical improvement was thought to be more likely reflective of her diuresis and steroid pulse for a presumed COPD flare rather than a resolving infectious picture.
Further antibiotics were deferred in the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms of PNA, including no leukocytosis, fever, or productive cough.
Remained afebrile after transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**].
# COPD Flare: Started on a steroid pulse in the ICU for a presumed COPD flare in the setting of dCHF decompensation - methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q8h tapered to 80 IV q8h over 3 days; transitioned to Prednisone 40 mg daily with taper planned to 10 mg, ending [**2197-12-29**].
# (PUMP) dCHF Decompensation: On admission had pulmonary congestion on CXR and exam consistent with elevated LVEDP.
The etiology of the patient's decompensation remains unclear, but it was likely viral URI +/- dietary non-adherence; it is also possible that the patient's AF potentiated the decompensation, although her AF is chronic.
Diuresis resulted in a contraction alkalosis in the setting of chronic metabolic abnormalities as detailed below.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Diuresis was complicated by Cr bump, which showed a trend toward normalization with PO intake of fluids.
# (Rhythm) AF: Rate controlled on her home dose metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem, which was uptitrated from her home dose of 360 mg daily to 420 mg daily.
TEE was raised as a potential therapy but ultimately it was decided that the potential benefits of an atrial kick in the setting of chronic AF and dCHF were outweighed by the risks conferred by anticoagulation subsequent to the cardioversion in light of the patient's history of GI bleed on coumadin.
# CORONARIES: Had no ischemic events this admission.
Was maintained on home dose ASA 325 mg for primary prevention of MI and CVA.
# Chronic Respiratory acidosis, compensatory metabolic acidosis + contraction alkalosis: Admitted in hypercarbic respiratory failure, diuresed, pulsed with steroids, treated with antibiotics, and durably extubated as detailed above.
Known to be a chronic CO2 retainer in chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
During diuresis, bicarbonate rose higher than would be expected for chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, suggesting a contraction alkalosis.
Bicarb on discharge was showing a trend toward normalization but was still elevated at 40, which near the patient's baseline as of 09/[**2197**].
# Leukopenia: Presented with a chronically abnormal CBC with WBC trending in the 2-3 range during her previous admission in 09/[**2197**].
# Blurry vision: Noted new onset blurry vision without pain or discharge after transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**]; symptoms did not improve with empiric artificial tears for presumed dry eye.
Direct ophthalmoscopy showed likely bilateral cataracts.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 14468**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Decompensated diastolic heart failure -Atrial fibrillation -COPD -Leukopenia  Secondary: -Moderate aortic stenosis -Moderate pulmonary hypertension -GERD -OSA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized because you developed a cough and were short of breath.
You were intubated and admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure; your chest x-ray showed fluid in your lungs due to heart failure.
You were given a medicine to remove this extra fluid and your condition improved.
You were also treated for a suspected pneumonia, but in retrospect, you may not have had a pneumonia and your symptoms were likely the result of your heart failure.
We suspected that your heart failure may have been provoked by your atrial fibrillation, which is a fast irregular heart rate that makes your heart less effective at pumping blood.
