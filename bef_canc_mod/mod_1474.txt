CT HEAD W/O CONTR ([**2146-9-14**]): FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarct.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities reflect small vessel ischemic disease.
Calcifications are noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries and right vertebral artery.
There is mild S-shaped deviation of the nasal septum.
There are apparent chronic posttraumatic defects in the bilateral lamina papyracea, with herniation of periorbital fat into the bilateral ethmoid cavities.
Incidental note is made of cavernous sinus gas, likely from prior intravenous line placement.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Chronic involutional changes and sequelae of prior trauma.
There may still be residual subtle opacity within the lower lobes bilaterally suggestive of residual infection.
There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration in the lower lungs though with mild residual opacity suggestive of residual infection.
Unchanged echogenic liver, findings consistent with hepatic steatosis.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination.
No focal hepatic mass.
Sludge- and stone-filled gallbladder without secondary signs of acute cholecystitis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Progressive multifocal pneumonia and lower lobe collapse.
Pancolitis, likely infectious given the diffuse distribution, and more than usually expected simply from third-spacing.
However, possibility of superimposed ischemia from low-flow state cannot be excluded.
Volume overload, with changes of third-spacing such as body wall edema, ascites, and pleural effusions.
Cholelithiasis and partially distended gallbladder, likely due to patient's fasting status.
Chest Xray ([**2146-10-3**]) Appearance of the right lower lung, combination of pleural effusion and consolidation, has not changed appreciably over a week, but left lower lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion are clearing.
Heart size is normal, and there is no pneumothorax.
Penetration and trace aspiration of thin liquids.
Penetration of nectar thick contrast.
Chest Xray ([**2146-10-7**]) IMPRESSION: No new aspiration pneumonia.
Improvement in right small pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE Patient is a 62 y/o man PMHx EtOH abuse, recent GI bleed admission complicated by respiratory failure, recently discharged, then re-admitted with altered mental status, found to be aspirating with subsequent HCAP and ARDS requiring intubation, vasopressors, treated with 14d course of abx, exubtated, transferred to floor.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt was delirious upon transfer out of MICU, likely related to long stay in MICU.
On transfer, his mental status waxed and waned with periods of increased lucency when he is interactive and periods of hypoactive delirium.
He did continue to have periods of mild confusion but was overall much improved and per the family near baseline.
# Recurrent Aspirations, HCAP, Sepsis and ARDS: Patient presented with altered mental status increasing oxygen requirements / leukocytosis, worsening clinical status resulted in transfer to the ICU afterwhich patient was soon intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress; subsquent imaging demonstrated diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS; patient was ventilated on ARDSnet protocol and treated with broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin).
The patient did have a leukocytosis which responded to therapy.
Repeat chest xray showed not recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
#Hypothemia- Patient was hypothermic on admission in the setting of hypotension with temperature of 91-92 F.  While on the floor he remained intermittently hypothemic with temperatures of 93-94 F.  His blood pressure remained stable and he was asymptomatic during these events.
The rash was most consistent with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] intertrigo and was treated with topical clotrimazole cream x4 day.
# Volume Imbalance: Pt was given >20 fluids in the MICU and subsequently aggressively diuresed.
The patient was 3.3L negative on transfer out of the MICU, and euvolemia was maintained on the floor.
# Diarrhea: Patient w high stool output, Cdiff tox negative x multiple tests, Cdiff PCR negative, thought to be [**3-9**] non-infectious abx effect; resolved without intervention.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient w recent diagnosis hypothyroidism on prior admission he was continued on levothyroxine.
# GI bleed: Patient w h/o prior GI bleeds (most recent [**7-/2146**] [**3-9**] [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear), w guiaic positive stool during this admission; required 3 units pRBCs during this hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 106354**]) for Hct trending down to low 20s.
Patient was maintained on IV PPI w/o any subsequent signs of hemodynamic instability.
On last admission the patients EGD showed a gastric ulcer with adherent clot that was endoclipped, several small duodenal ulcers, and some gastritis.
# GERD - PO omeprazole was changed to IV Protonix while NPO then to dissolvable lansoprazole since omeprazole cannot be crushed.
# Psych - Held ambien and ativan in setting of acute illness.

You were admitted for difficulties thinking and diarrhea, but your hospital course was complicated when food went down the wrong tube and you developed a lung infection.
You still had some difficulty with swallowing but were as you got stronger you were able to swallow thick liquids and mashed up food without choking.
The last time you were in the hospital you had some bleeding from your stomach.
