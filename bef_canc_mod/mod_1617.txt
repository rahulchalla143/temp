H/O cardiac surgery.
Mitral valve disease.
21 mm C-E aortic valve and 25 mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic mitral valve.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50-55 %).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for dvt Final Report HISTORY: 60-year-old patient, status post CABG, who presents with increased bilateral lower extremity swelling, to assess for a cardiopulmonary process.
A valvular cardiac prosthesis is unchanged.
Atelectasis and a small right basal effusion are unchanged.
The left basal effusion has decreased.
Linear atelectasis is present in the left mid zone as well as right mid zone.
There is no focal pulmonary consolidation.
CONCLUSION: Atelectasis in mid zones bilaterally and right lung base with a persistent right basal effusion.
Interval improvement with decrease in the left basal effusion.
Her emergency room workup was negative for DVT by US and CXR showed cardiomegaly small bilateral effusions and associated atelectasis.
