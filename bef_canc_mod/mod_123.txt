Stable linear opacification in the left mid lung likely represents atelectasis or scarring.
Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are again seen.
No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.
IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without radiographic evidence for acute change.
[**2179-11-25**] CT head FINDINGS:  There is no CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
White matter hypodensity is likely secondary to sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease; bilateral basal ganglia lacunes are again seen.
Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells is again noted.
No acute bony abnormality is detected.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.

Active Issues:  # Altered mental status: This was initially thought to be likely secondary to urinary tract infection and hypernatremia.
CT head negative for any acute intracranial process.
Neurological exam not suggestive of focal deficit.
CXR similarly negative for acute process.
Troponin elevated, but likely secondary to kidney injury, as Mb within normal limits.
Rest of metabolic work-up not suggestive of source of altered mental status.
Pt has sterile pyuria on urine microscopy so was initially treated for a urinary tract infection with cefepime and vancomycin.
However, his UA had large leukocyte but urine cx was negative so ABX were stopped because of sterile pyuria and lack of fever and elevated WBC count.
Pt's hypernatremia is likely the cause of his altered mental status and is likely from decreased access to free water in the setting of aggressive diuresis for sCHF.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Pt with elevated Cr initially to 2.5 (baseline Cr is 1.5).
Assumed to be in the setting of prerenal azotemia from too much diuresis.
Initially he appeared dry on exam, likely in the setting of diuresis from heart failure.
# Sterile pyuria: Urinalysis showed pyuria, and in the setting of altered mental status was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Urine culture showed no growth, and given his normal WBC count and lack of fever it's reasonable to assume this is sterile pyuria.
Chronic Issues:  # Dementia/Parkinsonian symptoms: Patient should be frequently re-oriented and his mental status evaluated.
# Systolic CHF: BNP actually below typical level for patient.
Mild pulmonary edema on CXR.
We initially held outpatient torsemide in setting of hypovolemia.
Transitional Issues: # Pt will need to be encouraged to drink fluids to prevent recurrent dehydration and hypernatremia but cautiously in setting of sCHF.
# Studies pending at time of discharge: blood cultures (NGTD) # Foley discontinued at 2pm on [**2179-11-29**].
