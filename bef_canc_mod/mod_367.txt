Admission Date:  [**2164-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-6-18**]   Service:  General Surgery  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents with ileostomy status post total colectomy and ileostomy for diverticulosis in [**2163-10-2**] with recurrent episodes of small bowel obstruction after surgery.
Surgery consultation was obtained on [**5-23**] to evaluate the patient for his ileostomy.
Briefly, the patient was an 84-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and also a total colectomy ileostomy for diverticulosis in [**2163-10-2**].
The patient was admitted to the MICU and underwent an arteriogram which showed no bleeding in the mesenteric arteries.
The patient developed a gram positive cocci bacteremia initially at presentation and was started on intravenous vancomycin for a moderately elevated white count and temperatures.
Surgery consultation was obtained at this time to evaluate the bleeding from the ostomy and evidence of patient having small bowel obstruction.
The patient showed evidence of small bowel obstruction, was made NPO and started upon total peripheral nutrition.
The patient required nasogastric tube with significant amounts of drainage, as well as decreased stool output through his ostomy bag.
Over time, the patient's obstruction appeared to open up with decreased nasogastric tube output and increased ostomy output.
However, at approximately [**6-5**] to [**6-6**], the patient appeared to develop a recurrent small bowel obstruction.
The patient became nauseated and required the replacement of the nasogastric tube.
The ostomy output decreased and the patient's abdominal exam became distended and tender.
These symptoms persisted for two or three days and then gradually improved.
It was evident upon radiologic studies and physical examination the patient had incurred a repeat small bowel obstruction.
Intraoperatively, an adhesive band with chronically dilated small bowel was noted proximal to the previous repair of an enterotomy (which had incurred during a previous ex-lap), as well as finding a minor peristomal hernia.
The patient did have some blood pressure lability postoperatively, most likely secondary to the epidural catheter.
The patient was restarted on his TPN and was given both Protonix and Zantac for ulcer prophylaxis.
