Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 65215**] is a 71 year old male nursing home resident with a history of C6 fracture, recent admission for urosepsis, VRE infection, MRSA wound infection, DVTs, pulmonary embolus, urinary retention with chronic indwelling foley, CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF, diabetes, and hypertension.
Given 1 L fluid bolus with brief normalization of pressure but then SBP to 90's again.
Repeat WBC 18.1 with no bands.
Of note, the patient had an [**8-2**] admission for UTI with sepsis: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was started empirically on Linezolid, Ceftazidime, and Flagly  based on his history of multi drug resistant infections and urine culture grew pseudomonas and E. coli which was only intermediately susceptible to ceftazidime.

He is a 71 year old gentleman from nursing home with history of recent urosepsis, chronic foley, MRSA infections (pneumonia, meningitis), CAD, DM II, hypertension admitted for sepsis/septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia, urinary tract infection or both.
ID was consulted, and given his extensive nosocomial infection history, it was decided to empirically start the patient on meropenem and linezolid.
1) Septic shock: See also above.
Underlying cause was likely pneumonia vs. UTI.
Pt was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on discharge.
It is recommended to follow up on the sensitivities of Pseudomonas growing from his urine cx.
2) Acute renal failure, Cr 2.1 from 0.9 but quickly trending down to baseline again.
Thought to have been prerenal based on urine lytes, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
3) Anemia, 9 point hct drop on admission.
Held ACEi and beta-blocker until septic shock fully resolved.
7) DM II: Humalog sliding scale, tight control while infected.
Pt also developed erythema and tenderness around both heels towards the end of his stay.
10) Pain control, chronic R leg pain (ulcers).
