Admission Date:  [**2119-8-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-1-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**] Chief Complaint: Fall and hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 97258**] is an 81M with a h/o myelofibrosis, zencker's diverticulum s/p surgery, blindness, hypothyroidism, hearing loss, and recent shortness of breath who presented today after a fall.
This morning the patient went to see his PCP for his shortness of breath.
His PCP was concerned that he may have CHF, pneumonia, or aspiration and ordered a CXR which showed possible CHF and left base PNA.
With regards to his shortness of breath, it has been going on for the past month.
He is concerned that he is aspirating again since he had similar symptoms prior to his zenker's diverticulum repair in [**2116**].
He denies fevers and night sweats but has noted some chills over the same period.
He has chronic swelling in his lower extremities R> L which he thinks may be worse lately.
He endorses 1 pillow orthopnea and PND which are both worse over the past few weeks.
EKG showed no ST changes, old RBB and LAFB and PAC's.
CXR from PCP's office before the fall showed likely CHF and L lower lobe PNA, patient refused repeat CXR.
CT head/ cspine showed no acute process.
He is A+OX3 and able to give a complete history without respiratory distress.

No acute intracranial process.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease and atrophy.
Lucent lesion within the right calvarium, likely hemangioma.
Opacification of the right mastoid air cells, likely due to inflammation.
No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
Rotation of C1 on C2 may be positional, correlate with patient's pain to exclude rotatory subluxation.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Likely mild pulmonary edema.
Acute, non-comminuted, non-displaced fracture of the head of the fourth metacarpal.
Acute, non-comminuted, laterally displaced fracture of the base of the fifth metacarpal.
Moderate degenerative changes in the first carpometacarpal joint.
[**8-11**] ECHO IMPRESSION: At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Dilated right ventricle with borderline-normal systolic function and evidence of pressure overload.
[**8-11**] LENI US IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.
[**8-11**] CXR AP There is increased opacity in the left lower lobe, consistent with increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
A small right pleural effusion is less conspicuous than before, is associated with adjacent atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97258**] is an 81M with a h/o myelofibrosis, Zencker's diverticulum, and blindness who presents with shortness of breath and a fall.
ACTIVE ISSUES  #) Hypoxemia: CXR showed new left lower and middle lobe opacity.
On arrival to the MICU, amp/sulbactam and azithromycin were started to cover atypicals and anaerobes as pt has significant aspiration risk with Zenker's diverticulum.
He had been off of his lasix for 4weeks and he appeared slightly volume up on exam and chest x-ray showed vascular congestion.
Echo on [**8-11**] did not show evidence of CHF.
He had been afebrile since ED.
#) Anemia: He has a normocytic anemia worsening from myelofibrosis and was admitted with 29.0.
Acute drop in Hct could be due to hemolysis secondary to infection/DIC.
He was transfused 1u of RBCs on [**8-12**] for hct of 20.7 and was also started on home dose Lasix to prevent fluid overload.
Pt's initial hct of 29 on admission was most likely related to hemoconcentration as pt was not taking in good PO at home and was dehydrated.
Syncope may have been related to acute illness as above or dehydration/orthostatic hypotension as pt admits to not have been taking in good PO in past week (possibly related to pneumonia vs disabled vs depression).
With pt's recent swelling of bilateral feet due to not taking Lasix, may have been a mechanical fall and with pt's head trauma (ecchymosis on chin), did lose consciousness with subsequent concussion.
Hypoxia was another possibility as pt has pulmonary hypertension seen on echocardiography with pneumonia, and thus pt required high amounts of O2 supplementation in the MICU.
ECG and troponins ruled out MI, but arrhythmia is a possible etiology given RBBB and bigeminy found on telemetry.
Head /c-spine CT showed no fracture.
Pt's pain in chin and L hand was controlled with acetaminophen 650 mg Q6h PRN.
PT evaluated pt and found that pt's risk for future falls was significant and recommended rehab dispo.
Pt is to work on balance and lower extremity exercises at rehab facility.
Pt also should see PCP and consider cardiology referral as RBBB was found on EKG along with atrial bigeminy on telemetry and at risk for complete heart block.
#) Left Hand Fracture of 4th and 5th metacarpals: Pt fell on day of admission and found to have fractures of L 4th and 5th metacarpals.
Pt was seen by plastic surgery hand team and had hand placed in ulnar gutter + thumb spica short arm cast.
Pain was manageable with PRN Tylenol and was no longer needed on day of discharge.
#) Zencker's Diverticulum: He complains of episodes of N/V and chronic cough, which initially improved following surgical repair of diverticulum, but has now worsened; pt endorses having food particles regurgitation intermittently.
Pt's intermittent nausea and cough (may also be related to pneumonia) may suggest possible worsening of zencker diverticulum and thus outpatient barium swallow is recommended to evaluate chronic aspiration and diverticulum.
#) Depression: Pt endorses worsening depression during hospitalization and feels extremely lonesome.
He denies active suicidal ideation or any intent on hurting himself, but does have some passive suicidal ideation, and expresses desire to "give up".
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES #Conduction disease of the heart: -Pt is to followup with PCP for cardiology referral to investigate RBBB and atrial bigeminy.
#Pneumonia: - continue PO augmentin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 7 days (started [**8-10**], end on [**2119-8-16**])  #Anemia: - f/u w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3638**] on [**9-27**] - monitor CBC - continue Vitamin B12 100 mcg PO daily - continue folic acid 1 mg PO daily  #Left hand fracture: - Keep hand elevated - Patient will FU in ortho hand clinic in one week following discharge or re-evaluated in one week  #Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid 100 mcg PO daily - check TSH and titrate synthroid accordingly  #Zencker Diverticulum - We recommend pt have an outpatient barium swallow to further investigate chronic aspiration  #Depression: - Pt requests outpatient psychiatry appointment for depression  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were admitted to hospital after falling and losing consciousness.
We found that you did have fluid in your lungs and a pneumonia and you did well in the ICU before being transferred to the medical floor for continued treatment of your pneumonia.
In addition, please follow up with your primary care physician in regards to possible cardiology (heart specialist) referral as we saw some abnormalities on your EKG and heart tracings.
Your history of Zenker's diverticulum puts you at risk for aspiration and future recurrent lung infections.
