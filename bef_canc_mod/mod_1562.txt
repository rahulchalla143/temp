HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for HIV and hepatitis B who through the Emergency Room was evaluated for the onset of acute right upper quadrant pain following meals.
This pain was consistent with pain that he has had on four previous episodes.
As such was worked up for acute cholecystitis and biliary colic.
A son[**Name (NI) **] through the Emergency Department did not reveal cholelithiasis, however, there was a dilated gallbladder and some pericholecystic fluid.
It was unclear whether there was definitive wall thickening.
The patient remained with some focal tenderness in the right upper quadrant and as such was taken to the Operating Room for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Intraoperatively there was a complication of some bleeding at the triangle of Calot.
After clipping and dividing the cystic duct, this turned out to be a small bleeding from a venous vessel of the gallbladder.
An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed and revealed normal anatomy of the cystic duct and common duct prior to cholecystectomy.
There were no stones and no ductal dilatation observed.
Due to the nature of the bleeding the patient's laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open cholecystectomy, which was then able to clearly identify the source of the venous bleeding from the gallbladder, which was appropriately treated.
There was no evidence of further bleeding and no further evidence of a drop in hematocrit.
His hematocrit was checked daily, which revealed a hematocrit drop down to about 25 or 26, but he had received approximately four to six liters of IV fluid and was quite positive.
This was felt to be hemodilution and it's effect, he was not symptomatic from this hematocrit change.
His morphine PCA was changed to an oral pain medication, which he tolerated without difficulty.
No tachycardia.
He has resumed all of his anti HIV medications without difficulty.
