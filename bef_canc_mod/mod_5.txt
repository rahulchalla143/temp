HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], six hospitalizations since [**2176-5-27**], last discharged on [**2176-8-4**], with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU, chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2175-9-28**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness of breath beginning on the day of admission.
The patient reported a [**1-29**] day history of general fatigue.
The patient also complained of some dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms.
The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough, however, denied any sputum production.
The patient no longer complained of shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly tired.
Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute PE.
Stage III squamous cell lung cancer diagnosis in [**2175-2-26**], status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], with radiation, Carboplatin, and Taxol treatments.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with PFTs in [**2176-5-27**] showing an FEV1 of 0.83 L, which is 25% of predicted, and FEV1 to FVC ration of 68% of predicted.
Congestive heart failure with preserved left ventricular function in [**2176-5-27**].
Atrial fibrillation.
Prostate carcinoma diagnosed in [**2172-2-26**] status post radical prostatectomy in [**2172-8-27**].
Diabetes type 2.
History of PE during the patient's postoperative course in [**2175-6-28**].
Status post myocardial infarction.
Catheterization at that time showed normal left ventricular function, ejection fraction of 50%, and a 30% right coronary artery lesion.
Status post transient ischemic attack in [**2165**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Father with history of coronary artery disease.
Sister with heart valve disease.
General:  The patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.
Distant heart sounds.
Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No apparent wheezing or rubs.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no pneumothorax, no effusion.
CT angiogram showed no acute PE, possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left lower lobe that is not occlusive.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**] for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions, and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with respiratory distress.
It was thought that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely secondary to mucous plugging.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
The patient also recently completed a steroid taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this admission.
He had no cough and no sputum production and no fevers.
The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress and because it was unclear whether steroids was really benefitting this patient.
Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes of respiratory distress.
It was thought that the patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to hypovolemia.
He also had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been given to the patient.
He continued to remain normovolemic during the rest of his hospitalization.
Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.
q.6 hours for shortness of breath to relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes type 2.
History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.
