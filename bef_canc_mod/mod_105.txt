He is a 55-year-old Caucasian male with known human immunodeficiency virus who presented with a gastrointestinal bleed.
He has a prior history of a gastrointestinal bleed in [**2135-8-3**].
He now re-presents with bright red blood per rectum bright red blood per rectum and melena.
He had a syncopal event while on the toilet and regained consciousness and activity with Emergency Medical Service.
He denies any abdominal pain, fevers, or chills.
He was noted to have a poor prep; however, there was no bleeding and no masses.
Human immunodeficiency virus positive.
Cytomegalovirus retinitis.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Aforementioned gastrointestinal bleed in [**2135-8-3**].
In general,  Mr. [**Known lastname 10620**] was noted to be in no acute distress.
No evidence of any lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with the absence of any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No evidence of any masses or organomegaly.
No tenderness and guaiac positive.
There was no evidence of any edema.
The findings included fresh blood within the proximal jejunum extending into the mid jejunum; however, no lesions was identified.
At that time, a differential included arteriovenous malformation mass or ulcer.
During this procedure, a selective celiac left gastric, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arteriograms and multiple injections were performed.
There was no evidence of any active extravasation or vascular malformation.
He continued to have significant hematocrit drops necessitating 4 additional units of packed red blood cells in response to a hematocrit of 19.
On the morning of [**2138-4-22**] the patient again had a 3 to 5 point hematocrit drop and bright red blood per rectum.
At that time it was found that one proximal jejunal branch demonstrated active extravasation.
Post doppler flow arteriogram demonstrated stagnant flow through the vessel with no further bleeding.
Apparently, this selective and superselective SMA arteriogram demonstrated active extravasation from proximal jejunal branch with successful Gelfoam embolization of the bleeding jejunal branch.
Initial evaluation of the intestines revealed no outward or obvious deformities.
At this point, it was noted that there three bleeding ulcers in the proximal jejunum approximately two feet from the ligament of Treitz.
The scope was proceeded down to its maximum length past these ulcers, but no other lesions were found.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**4-25**] showed some areas of nasogastric erosion; however, no areas of new or acute bleeding were noted.
This would provide an access to the small bowel in case a repeat endoscopy was needed and would also allow to definitively differentiate between small bowel and colonic bleeding in case of rebleeding.
On postoperative days 13 and 6, the nasogastric tube was removed and his diet subsequently advanced from sips through solids; all of which he tolerated extremely well.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post massive upper gastrointestinal bleed with presumed arteriovenous malformation and/or ulceration.
