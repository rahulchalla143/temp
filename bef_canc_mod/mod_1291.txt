Findings which suggesting a large air pocket in the lower mediastinum, which may reflect a dilated viscus or extraluminal air-fluid collection, as well as persistent and potentially increased intraperitoneal air; correlation to CT performed on the same day is recommended.
Moderate to large suspected pleural effusions with parenchymal opacities at the lung bases probably atelectasis.
Differential considerations include aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded, however.
Bilobed mediastinal fluid collection containing the JP drains and oral contrast, smaller than on [**2197-4-6**], representing a leak, although no definite connection to the esophagus or stomach is identified.
Likely resolving hematoma at the inferior liver tip.
Pleural thickening and enhancement around a partially loculated right pleural effusion, probably due to chronic pleural effusion but which can be seen complex pleural effusions.
The left pleural effusion has largely resolved with minimal left pleural fluid remaining.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are increased in size from [**2197-4-6**] and are likely reactive.
2mm RML nodule.
Splenic infarction is unchanged from [**2197-4-6**] but new from [**2196-9-6**].
[**2197-4-22**] G-J tube study : Brisk leakage of contrast from the known distal esophageal leak site filling the paraesophageal collection and layering along the right hemidiaphragm without evidence of reflux superiorly in the mediastinum.
Extension of leak into the right pleural space.
Resolving hematoma at the inferior tip of the liver.
Ectatic aorta with ulcerative arthrosclerotic plaque is unchanged.
Small left pleural effusion stable  [**2197-5-2**] Ba swallow : Small quantity of extravasation of Omnipaque elicited only during retrograde filling of the esophageal stent with slow passage of small amount of contrast through to the adjacent surgical drain.
Decreased size of moderate right hydropneumothorax.
Although no large volume of oral contrast is seen in the right pleural collection, there is evidence of oral contrast leakage into the adjacent drainage catheter.
No site of leak is seen on this study.
Increased size of moderate right pleural effusion.
Hematoma inferior to the right liver edge is stable.
Increased dependent opacity within the left upper lobe abutting the fissure representing atelectasis with aspiration not excluded.
No acute aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental levels.
Unchanged severe ulcerative atherosclerotic plaque throughout the thoracic aorta with extension into and severe narrowing of the proximal left subclavian artery.
Unchanged small right hydropneumothorax with moderate effusion and persistent right lower lobe severe atelectasis.
Mildly increased large left pleural effusion with continued near collapse of the left lower lobe and moderate left lingular atelectasis.
Unchanged small splenic infarct.
Arterially hyperenhancing subcentimeter foci within the right hepatic lobe are statistically likely benign given no correlative lesions seen on prior venous-phase contrast-enhanced imaging.
Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules for which follow-up chest CT in one year can be performed.
Unchanged appearance of the esophageal stent and fluid filled esophagus.
18-mm linear metallic object at the superior margin of the stent presumably is related to the stent.
No extraluminal contrast was identified.
[**2197-5-13**] CXR :  Again seen is left-sided PICC line with tip over proximal SVC, bilateral L>R effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, and upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.
Old healed distal right clavicle resection noted.

He gradually became more hypotensive, required more fluid resuscitation and pressor support and was admitted to the SICU in preparation for emergent surgery due to intra abdominal sepsis.
He eventually became hemodynamically stable off of pressors and was taken back to the OR for abdominal closure and G/J tube placement on [**2197-4-10**].
He was extubated easily post op but developed bilateral pleural effusions which required pigtail catheter drainage.
He developed a temp of 102, lethargy and tachycardia on [**2197-4-22**] and a G-J tube study revealed a leak at the Colles suture line.
Over the next few days his diet was advanced to clears, all cultures were negative and his abdominal wound was healing.
Unfortunately he had another fever on [**2197-5-4**] and a subsequent EGD revealed no visible leak but the mucosa was very edematous and friable.
He was placed on Zosyn and Fluconazole and a PICC line was also placed as access was a problem.
During his episodes of sepsis he developed some SVT then bradycardic episodes while on atenolol which he was on pre op.
Another problem is urinary retention.
His urologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**University/College **] Vangard in [**Location (un) 1468**] and he has been awaiting treatment for his prostate cancer which was recently diagnosed.
He had some trouble with thin liquids but tolerates pureed solids and nectar thick liquids without difficulty.
His abdominal wounds are healing well and he is working well with physical therapy to increase his mobility and endurance.

Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hoapital with fevers and  abdominal pain after falling.
You required an operation to repair a small hole in your esophagus and you spent many days in the ICU as you required special medications, antibiotics and a breathing tube.
* There is a stent in your esophagus which is covering the hole and you have been able to tolerate moderate amounts of food over the last few days.
* If you have any new fevers, abdominal pain or any new symptoms that concern you please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**]  Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2197-6-1**] at 9:30 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3000**], MD [**0-0-**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Please report 30 minutes prior to your appointment to the Radiology Department on the [**Location (un) **] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center for a chest xray.
