Admission Date: [**2176-8-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2176-9-6**]   Service:  VSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left hallux infection and left foot pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year-old gentleman who presented to our emergency room with a left hallux infection.
The patient's toe changes are secondary to nail clipping which resulted in gangrenous changes which have progressed over the last two to three months.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses include type 2 diabetes with retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
History of congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 45%.
History of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2169**].
History of chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General appearance: An elderly male in no acute distress.
Heart is a regular rate and rhythm without rub, rub or gallop.
Extremity examination shows warm extremities with two dry gangrenous lesions on the left hallux without erythema or drainage.
The dorsalis pedis on the left is monophasic with a biphasic posterior tibial signal.
Chest x-ray was obtained which was negative for congestive heart failure and pneumonia.
No wound culture was obtained at the time of the patient's assessment in the emergency room but urine cultures and blood cultures were obtained which finalized at no growth.
Patient underwent pulmonary vascular resistances of the left extremity which showed forefoot pressures of 7 mm.
He then underwent an arteriogram on [**2176-8-22**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] which demonstrated the abdominal aorta was patent with single renal arteries which were patent and duplicate and patent renal arteries on the left.
The right lower extremity had a patent common iliac, internal and external iliac arteries.
There was a patent common femoral, profunda and superficial femoral artery.
There was mild distal disease in the superficial femoral artery.
Anterior tibial occludes proximally.
The perineal has proximal stenosis but runs off to the ankle and reconstitutes a plantar in the foot.
Cardiology was consulted regarding the patient's perioperative risk assessment for anticipated left leg revascularization.
The overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There were resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral hypokinesis with distal septal, distal inferior and apical akinesis.
The mitral valve leaflet was a mild thickness with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Compared with previous echocardiogram done [**2174-6-1**] there was no change.
The initial portion of stress showed no anginal symptoms or ischemic electrocardiographic changes.
The resting and stress perfusion images demonstrated moderate reversible perfusion defect in the anterior wall and apex that is more prominent when compared to [**2174-11-21**].
The patient's diabetic management was under the care of the [**Last Name (un) **] Service during his hospitalization.
He was able to be maintained on his pre-admission insulin dosing with minimal correction.
The patient had a monophasic dorsalis pedis and a biphasic posterior tibial and a warm foot post procedure.
Patient's heart rate was well controlled on Toprol XL 25 mg and nifedipine CR 30 mg. Postoperative day #2 the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Patient remained in sinus rhythm during the rest of this hospitalization.
Study demonstrated metatarsal pressures on the left of 7 mm and on the right 4 mm.
Left hallux dry gangrene with infection secondary to     arterial insufficiency.
Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused.
Postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, controlled.
Type 2 diabetes with triopathy.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
History of coronary artery disease with congestive heart     failure, status post coronary artery bypass grafts in     [**2169**].
Chronic renal insufficiency.
