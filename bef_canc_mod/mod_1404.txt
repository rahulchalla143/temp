Admission Date:  [**2144-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-7-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, tachypnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis [**2144-7-5**] Fine needle aspiration of axillary node [**2144-6-30**]   History of Present Illness: She is a 58-year-old [**Last Name (un) 18355**] resident with mental retardation, COPD, and no reported past cardiac history who presents for examination of distended belly, anemia and noted to have large pericardial effusion.
Given mental retardation, interview with patient is extremely limited, and pt.
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] after ECHO for workup of shortness of breath revealed moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Repeat ECHO 24h later showed stable-to-improved effusion and was discharged with plans for f/u ECHO in 14d.
Today, she presented to ED from NH with short episode hypoxia with recovered with albuterol and 02 and started on levofloxacin.
also had KUB given some abdominal distension which reportedly was concerning for ileus.
In ED, she had a distended abd with minimal TTP, normal LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, without leukocytosis.
She was guaiac negative with VSS and received Abdominal CT shich showed large pericardial effusion and presacral, perihepatic fluid, but no acute abdominal process.
Given large pericardial effusion without previous comparisons, pt.
's brother and wife who report that 8 weeks ago, she started to become pale, have increased shallow breathinig, low grade temps to 100-101, with some abdominal distension that has been ongoing.
she has had no bloody or black stools per family until she starte Fe So4.

Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no wheezes or rhonchi.
crackles at Right base.
Abd: mildly distended, obese, with difficult abodminal exam as pt.
denies belly pain but seems to grimace on palpation of RUQ>RLQ.
No organomegaly noted in context of bodyhabitus and difficulty participating in exam.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema to knees (new per PA at bedside.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is substantial right atrial collapse and brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular outflow tract (cine loops #15 and #28), consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic findings of early tamponade.
Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the axillary, supraclavicular and mediastinal regions.
Pulmonary nodules in the left lung apex is also noted.
This is concerning for a neoplastic process.
Differential diagnosis includes primary lymphoma or lung neoplasm.
Small pericardial effusion, decreased in size.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Splenic hypodensity.
Multiple hepatic subcentimeter hypodensities which are too small to characterize.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Diffuse colonic distention up to 12.2 cm.
No evidence of obstruction.
Of these, B cells comprise approximately 15% of lymphoid-gated events and do not express aberrant antigens.
No expansion of CD34-immunoreactive events are identified in the "blast gate".
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a lymphoproliferative disorder are not seen in specimen.
L axillary lymph node FNA Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
B cells comprise approximately 9% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens.T cells comprise approximately 89% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens (CD2,3,5,7).
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Review of cytospin slide (1096V-[**7-1**]) shows predominantly blood with admixed lymphocytes and numerous degenerated cells precluding definitive morphologic assessment.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo F with mental retardation & h/o volvulus s/p colonic resection admitted with hypoxia & abdominal distention, also repeat echocardiogram given newly diagnosed pericardial effusion.
# Pericardial Effusion: s/p pericardiocentesis when early signs of tamponade seen on echocardiogram.
Bloody pericardial effusion ~510cc's removed, ?malignancy.
However no evidence of malignancy cells seen on flow cytometry as well as cytology.
W/u already started at [**Hospital6 **] and so far studies negative except for elevated ESR, CRP & CA 125.
Developed afib with RVR during stay.
No evidence of reaccumulation of fluid seen on repeat echocardiogram or vital signs including nml pulsus.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: ?r/t pericardial effusion, worsened after pericardiocentesis during which time she stayed in the CCU given pericardial drain.
The decision was made for no anticoagulation given bloody pericardial effusion, pt was continued on full strength aspirin.
# CT findings: Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the axillary, supraclavicular and mediastinal regions with pulmonary nodules in the left lung apex which were concering for neoplastic process.
Pt underwent L axillary lymph node biopsy for concern of malignancy, ?Lung CA, lymphoma vs. other other cancers.
Pt with no prior colonoscopies or vaginal exams, however with nml mammograms & per report, last [**3-/2144**] nml.
# Abdominal distension: Appeared to be chronic, however worsened acutely during admission.
No evidence of volvulus, cholecystitis or obstruction; imaging showed significant amounts of air with colonic distention, likely colonic ileus.
had no episodes of nausea or vomiting, however it was difficult to access abdominal pain.
# Microcytic anemia: c/w anemia of chronic disease; low retic count, however hematocrit stable.
# Peripheral edema: Unclear if new, no evidence of chronic venous stasis and no significant ascites seen on CT despite abdominal distention.
No evidence of proteinuria, however sl.lower albumin.
# Neurodermatitis: continued topicals # DJD: continued celecoxib & tylenol.

Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) **] center  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis Atrial fibrillation with RVR Colonic ileus with abdominal distension s/p rectal decompression Mental retardation Degenerative joint disease s/p volvulus with colonic resection   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with pericardial tamponade and you underwent draining of the fluid around your heart.
You were also found to have multiple enlarged lymph nodes in your chest.
During your hospitalization, you had abdominal distention from an ileus that resolved with rectal tube decompression which should be continued intermittently as needed.
Please call your PCP or come to the ED if you develop chestpain, shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptoms.
