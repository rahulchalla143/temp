He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient had a further episode of chest pain, was given SLNG x 1, with resolution of chest pain.
Patient noted to have ST segment depressions in anterolateral and anterior leads.
He was friendly and cooperative throughout interview and denied any chest discomfort.
Became tachycardic and uncomfortable with a decreas of sats from 99 to 93% on 2L with new crackles on exam b/l [**1-13**] way up lung fields.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
No signs of conjunctivitis.
Midpeaking III/VI murmur best heard at along left SB.
Though the lung volumes appear larger, there is diffuse interstitial prominence with [**Last Name (un) 16765**] B-lines and pulmonary vascular congestion, as well as stable cardiomegaly.
There is no overt edema or pleural effusion.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There are atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.
TTE [**3-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral hypokiensis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional LV dysfunction.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
A 70% calcific mid LAD lesion was noted at the D1 origin.
The proximal LCX had 50% in-stent restenosis extending into the stented OM2 branch.
The AV groov LCX was diffusely diseased with 80% stenosis in a small lower pole of OM2.
The RCA is a large caliber dominant vessel with diffuse mild plaquing and focal heavy calcification.
The flow within the RCA system was rather slow consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (134/46 mmHg) and the pulmonary arterial pressure was mildly elevated (39/12 mmHg).
The mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was mildly elevated (11 mmHg).
Successful PTCA of the ISRS of the LCX and OM2 with a 2.75 x 15 mm and a 3.0 x 12 mm balloons.
Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis in the stents, no dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments)  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension and mildly elevated PCWP.
Step up O2 saturation from 53% in the SVC to 65% in thebpulmonary artery suggestive of a possible left-to-right shunt on the RA level.
Systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
CAD:  The patient has a history of pronounced CAD status post BMS x 3.
ST segment depressions noted on EKG seem to be similar multiple baseline EKGs in OMR, but degree of ST depressions seems to deponstrate a dynamic component with correlates with the patients complaint of chest pain.
Was unclear if respresented ischemia from ACS vs. repolarization abnormalties vs subendocardial ischemia with severe AS and LV thickness.
Patients chest pain persisted, despite transfusion.
Heparin was initally held due to concern of GI bleeding, but with persisent chest pain and rising of troponins to peak of 0.49, patient was transfered to the CCU for monitored heparinization.
He was chest pain free following cath, with trending down of CK to baseline and resolution of EKG changes.
Pump:  The patient has known valvular disease with mod-sev AS, mod AR/MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7216**] and systolic HF.
Had appeared euvolemic on intial presentation, and did not endorse symptoms of heart failure.
During admission patient became SOB in setting of chest pain with fall in O2 sats and new pulmonary edema on CXR.
In setting of severe AS, patient may have had increased stiffness in setting of ischemia.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have had been overloaded with increased pre-load after discontinuing nitro gtt.
Patient had no further episodes during hospitalization.
# GI Bleed: The patient presented with a hct 10 pt lower since [**Month (only) **] with history of colon CA and guaic positive stool.
No hx of melena or hematochezia.
Hypertension:  continued metoprolol and amplodipine for afterload reduction.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for angina: If chest pain does not resolve after 3 doses five minute apart call your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 911.
Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for gouty pain.
