Mild generalized mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged since [**Month (only) 359**] [**2166**].
No good evidence for active recurrence of esophageal carcinoma.
Severe emphysema.
ART DUP EXT UP UNI OR LMTD RIGHT [**2170-1-25**]: There is no evidence of arterial stenosis in the right upper extremity.
Nearly completely occlusive thrombus involving the basilic vein.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2170-1-30**]: The substantial increase in consolidation in the necrotizing left upper lobe pneumonia that took place between [**1-22**] and [**1-30**] after left upper lobe bronchoscopic biopsy, has improved little, but is still quite substantial.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
LINE PLACEMENT [**2170-2-5**]: Interval placement of left subclavian PICC line with its tip at the superior aspect of a superior vena caval filter.
There is persistent opacity in the left upper and mid lung suggestive of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Left upper lobe opacity, consistent with known pneumonia, is grossly unchanged.
Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with increasing atelectasis.

# GI bleed: Pt initially presented to OSH with BRBPR and Hct drop to 23 in setting of recently being started on warfarin for bilateral PEs.
Of note, patient also had SVC filter placed after he was found to have RUE DVT.
Here, Hct initially remained stable, and patient did not have further GI bleeding.
GI was consulted, and once Hct stable, they felt that need for anticoagulation outweighed risk of further bleeding, despite increased risk due to his many surgical anastamoses.
Patient will likely need MAC anesthesia for the procedure.
Did have one 6 point drop in Hct, though this was in setting of probable dilutional effect and hemoptysis.
# LUL necrotizing pneumonia: Pt w/extensive recent history of consolidations beginning [**2169-11-27**].
Treatment of these probable aspiration pneumonias (which grew Klebsiella, Morganella, and Pseudomonas) was c/b pt's extensive antibiotic allergies.
His admission exam was less concerning for an acute respiratory process.
However, in setting of increased rhonchi on lung exam, CT chest obtained and demonstrated a LUL necrotizing pneumonia and developing abscess.
Post-procedure, patient required brief admission to MICU for stabilization of tachycardia, tachypnea, and increased oxygen requirement.
Did have 6 point drop in Hct at this time, in setting of receiving IVF and developing blood-tinged secretions and a mild amount of frank hemoptysis.
These may have been secondary to mucous plugging, as patient would quickly respond with improvement in sats when placed on oxygen face mask, and with nebulizer treatments and clearance of secretions.
At time of [**Month/Day/Year **], oxygen requirement 4L NC.
Given GIB and high risk for repeat events given numerous surgical anastamoses, was concern for restarting anticoagulation.
However, given known large clot burden, including not only the PEs but also a RUE DVT (for which SVC filter placed at OSH), was felt that benefits of anticoagulation outweighed risks.
For easy titration and reversibility, heparin gtt drip was chosen for initial prevention of clot extension, rather than immediately restarting warfarin.
Heparin was started without bolus and titrated to goal of PTT 60-80.
Heparin gtt was held prior to bronch on [**2170-1-30**], and was not restarted until [**2170-2-2**] after patient developed 6 point drop in Hct post-bronch with increased bloody secretions.
However, Hct remained stable thereafter, and heparin gtt restarted without issue.
# Right upper extremity DVT: Noted at OSH, and patient had SVC filter placed prior to transfer as his anticoagulation was being held in the setting of GIB.
Ultrasound of RUE on HD4 revealed no arterial obstruction or stenosis, but did show non-occlusive venous embolism in the axillary and brachial veins and nearly complete obstruction of the basilic vein.
# Tachycardia: Patient noted to have intermittent sinus tachycardia, occasionally with frequent PVCs and ventricular trigeminy.
Patient was asymptomatic during these episodes, with stable BP.
# COPD: Pt was on prednisone taper initially begun for COPD exacerbation at OSH on [**2170-1-2**].
On HD2, decision was made to taper dose to prevent immunosuppressive effects in the face of neutropenia and pneumonia.
Accordingly the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with no active antibiotic prescriptions.
Patient was on furosemide and spironolactone at time of admission, though these were held in setting of lower BPs, with SBP in 90s-110s throughout much of hospital course.
Patient did not have evidence of pulmonary edema on exam or imaging, and he did not appear volume overloaded on exam.
# Tube feeds s/p colonic interposition: The patient arrived with a previously placed J-tube in situ.
# Decubitus ulcer: Pt arrived with a Stage II decubitus ulcer on the buttocks.
Wound care was consulted, who oversaw dressing of the ulcer throughout the patient's stay.
-Patient noted to have left hilar lymphadenopathy on imaging this admission, possibly reactive vs. malignant.
-Patient should have periodic monitoring of Hct, given recent GIB and ongoing anticoagulation.
-Would recommend nutrition follow patient as outpatient, given recent weight loss.

While you were here, the bleeding stopped and your blood counts stabilized.
While you were here, a CT scan of your chest showed a severe pneumonia in your left lung.
You underwent a procedure called a bronchoscopy, in which they looked inside the lung with a small camera and took biopsies.
You were started on antibiotics for your pneumonia, and will continue receiving an antibiotic called ertapenem through [**2170-2-28**].
This filter is intended to prevent the blood clot in your arm from going to the lung.
