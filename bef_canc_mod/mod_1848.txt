There is ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
There is a slight leftward septal deviation.
[**8-4**]: CT pelvis: There has been interval left total hip replacement, which is noted to cause a large amount of streak artifact in the pelvis, slightly limiting evaluation for signs of infection.
Allowing for this, there are no bony destructive changes.
There is no evidence of hardware loosening.
No fluid collections are identified.
There is diffuse stranding of the subcutaneous fat consistent with anasarca.
A cleft is noted along the midline of the posterior subcutaneous tissues overlying the sacrum, which is most consistent with a skinfold.

Mild congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**8-12**]: Head MRI: FINDINGS:  Again, note is made of pontine abscess with ring enhancement, which has increased in size compared to the prior study and now spreading across the midline to the right side of the pons, with increased amount of surrounding edema.
Note is made of high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images corresponding to the area of abscess, which also spread across midline.
Note is made of low signal intensities on gradient echo at the location of the abscess, which may represent hemorrhage content or free radicle.
Note is made of fluid within the bilateral mastoid cells.

IMPRESSION:  Continued left sphenoid fluid with air bubbles, representing sinusitis.
Mucosal thickening of bilateral ethmoid sinuses.
[**8-21**]: MRI head: Decrease in size of the enhancing multi-cystic lesion in the pons, with decreased amount of edema, surrounded by high low signal intensity ring on T1-weighted images, probably representing improving pontine abscess.
Unchanged appearance of opacification of the left sphenoid sinus.
Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification.
[**8-30**]: MRI head: Compared to examinations performed at the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**], and even to the study of [**2111-8-21**], there is less edema in the dorsal pontine body, than on previous studies.
The left paramedian abscess, which has susceptibility artifact along its rim, is slightly smaller in size.
Diffusion signal hyperintensity persists, and may represent residual liquified material within the abscess.
There continues to be opacification of the mastoid air cells and fluid or mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus.
[**9-4**]: GI bleeding study: Probably negative GI bleeding study, indicating no active bleeding at the time of study.
No evidence of DVT, but the right distal SFV and left politeal could not be imaged.
[**9-9**]: MRI Head: No significant interval change seen involving the examination of the brain since [**2111-8-30**].
An area of residual enhancement is still present along the posterior aspect of the pons and upper medulla with some diffusion abnormality still present suggestive of a partially resolving posterior pontine abscess.
Bilateral T2 hyperintensities within the mastoid and sphenoid sinuses.
When compared with prior study, there is no significant interval change in appearance of the lungs.
There remains pulmonary vascular congestion and redistribution bilaterally, and there are stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Again, noted are fibronodular opacities within bilateral lung apices, as previously described.
Stable interval appearance of pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with congestive heart failure.
EEG [**2111-9-30**] : Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespred encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no overtly epileptiform  features.
Some artifact appeared due to tremor or other head movement.
No electrographic  seizures were recorded.
Pontine abscess: It was originally thought that the symptoms could be related to a brainstem ischemic event, as the MRI performed on admission revealed an area of restricted diffusion in the left pontine tegmentum.
Upon further review of the entire MRI study by the radiology service, it was felt that this lesion more likely represented an abscess given that it was ring-enhancing on T1 with gadolinium.
In addition, the patient had a persistent fever, supporting this hypothesis.
A lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis and elevated protein; gram stain was negative; serologic and laboratory studies on CSF remained negative.
In addition, the pt was ruled-out for tuberculosis with acid fast smear taken from endotracheal samplings.
In addition, a TTE was performed that revealed no valvular lesions or vegetations.
A dental consult, given a history of mandibular implants, provided no evidence of infection at the site of the implants.
A CT scan of the left hip was performed which showed no evidence of infection of the replacement hip.
CT of the sinuses were performed and showed evidence of mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.
A biopsy of the left sphenoid sinus demonstated a group of cells that were suspicious for carcinoma.
The infectious disease consult team recommended treating for presumptive bacterial infection with intravenous ceftriaxone, ampicillin, vancomycin and metronidazole.
On hospital day ten, a repeat MR of the head was performed to assess for response of the lesion to a course of antibiotics.
The pt showed evidence of worsening clinically on hospital day twelve with a small (1mm) but reactive right pupil and sluggishly reactive (although normal-sized) left pupil as well as evidence of a left cranial nerve twelve palsy.
It was felt that given the location of the lesion, biopsy or drainage would entail too great a likelihood of morbidity.
This demonstrated decreased size of the lesion and surrounding edema after treatment with antibiotics  Given the high suspicion for Listeria as the etiologic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], with other possible pathogens including HSV, the antibiotic regimen was changed to high-dose penicillin and acyclovir at this time.
Further MRI studies ([**8-30**] and [**9-9**]) showed continued improvement.
Upon discharge, the patient had regained slight horizontal eye movements.
To evaluate an episode of altered mental status, an EEG was obtained that showed no epileptiform waves but did show patterns consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.
Neurology was consulted and did not suggest that any of her altered mental status or tremors were due to seizures.
In addition to the problems involving her cranial nerves, she has significant proximal muscle weakness in her upper and lower extremities, mostly secondary to her infection and high dose steroids.
SHe completed course of penicillin G to treat the presumed Listeria abscess.
Atrial fibrillation:  On admission, the pt was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 130s.
Anticoagulation was held early in the course of the admission over concern for hemorrhage into the pontine lesion, but was later restarted.
The patient than developed a GI bleed, while her INR was supratherapeutic and her platelets were dropping.
Hypotension: the patient had several episodes of hypotension.
These might have been related to her primary brainstem lesion in combination with sedation and blood loss (see below).
DDX included adrenal insufficiency, fluid shift, or new infection/early sepsis.
She was able to be weaned off pressors w/o stress dose steroids and stabilized on vanc/meropenem.
Her blood pressure has been lowish with SBP in the loww 100's.
During her stay, she developed worsening respiratory distress.
As described above, patient also being tx for MRSA PNA and is currently d9/10.
Of note, the patient has a poor pulmonary baseline secondary to radiation (breast ca).
Ophthalmology: The patient has bilataral keratopathy (L>R) and evidence of corneal abrasion on left.
Gasteroenterology was consulted to evaluated for GI bleed as her stools looked tarry, suggesting an upper GI bleed.
Heparin Abs were negative and lab results did not suggest intravascular hemolysis.
Another etiology might include pancytopenia secondary to her chronic disease.
Following a drop in Hct and tarry stools, she was evaluated by GI.
an EGD [**9-3**] showed no active bleed but an AVM that might have bled.
A bleeding scan with tagged blood was negative for GI bleed as well.
These abnormalities might be related to overall poor condition or sludge/stones.
The patient did not complain of abdominal discomfort.
The patient's home dose of 6 units NPH [**Hospital1 **] was discontinued since she had several hypoglycemic events as low as 30.
Consider to further improve her protein status with supplements.
This should be improved by ace-wraps, improvement of protein status and mobilization.
