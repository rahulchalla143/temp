Postop, he did well with pain controlled by dilaudid PCA.
On pod 1, LFTs were elevated (ast 339, alt 277, alk phos 156, t.bili 2.0)prompting a liver u/s that showed echogenic material within the main portal [**Name (STitle) 5703**] with lack of wall-to-wall flow concerning for nonocclusive portal [**Name (STitle) 5703**] thrombosis.
There was stable intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
A CTA was then done showing extensive portal venous thrombus extending from the central SMV through the main portal [**Name (STitle) 5703**] and extending into the right portal [**Name (STitle) 5703**].
Postoperative changes from recent hernia repair with mesenteric edema as a result of these two processes were noted.
This demonstrated extensive thrombosis and secondary stenosis in portal [**Name (STitle) 5703**] anastomosis site.
Post procedure, he spiked a temperature to 102.7.
CT was done to rule out thrombosis.
Interval appearance of hyperdense material within the proximal right and left biliary system with progression of intrahepatic ductal dilatation suggestive of new biliary hematoma.
Increase in size to hyperdense postoperative anterior abdominal wall hematoma.
Mild progression of intra-abdominal/ pelvic ascites and bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left).
An abdominal CT on [**7-10**] showed a new hypoattenuating collection identified within the liver likely representing a biloma with dependently layering blood products.
5cc of bloody fluid was sent for culture.
