Admission Date:  [**2136-11-19**]       Discharge Date: [**2136-12-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-11-20**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (two intubations, baseline 4 liters of oxygen, steroids), hypertension, who presents with increasing shortness of breath on the morning of admission.
No chest pain, no fever or chills.
Positive nonproductive cough for two to three days.
No nausea or vomiting, no abdominal pain, no relief with her inhalers.
Chest x-ray shows questionable right lower lobe infiltrate superimposed upon long-term right lower lobe opacity with question of scarring.
Upon examination, the patient states breathing better, but still with shortness of breath.
No abdominal pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with last FEV-1 15%.
Diverticulosis status post colectomy with colostomy bag 3.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes secondary to steroid use 5.
Hypertension  ALLERGIES:  Percocet causes gastrointestinal upset.
Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no jugular venous distention.
Extremities:  No edema, distal pulses 1+ bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram shows MAT at 110, normal axis, normal intervals, no segmental Q waves, normal R wave progression, no significant ST changes, with nonspecific ST depression in V5 to V6.
Chest x-ray was a suboptimal study with stable appearance of right lower lobe opacification, likely secondary to focal scarring, may have slight increase in opacity consistent with atelectasis or scarring or fluid within fissure.
Pulmonary:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, questionable precipitant.
The patient was started on empiric antibiotic coverage while waiting for sputum culture analysis with Levaquin 500 mg once daily.
Her PCO2 was noted to increase to over 100 and then stabilize in the 90s on her ventilation, without any evidence of somnolence secondary to hypercarbia.
She was able to maintain peripheral oxygen saturations and PCO2 in the 90s, with periods of rest off of her BiPAP on Venturi mask and nasal cannula combined, and also just nasal cannula on its own.
The patient remained tenuous during her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, and had an acute decompensation which was requiring increasing oxygen requirement in order to maintain her peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 88%.
She developed thick copious sputum with a temperature spike.
The patient, however, was able to be stabilized with noninvasive ventilation.
There was no identified organism in her sputum secondary to nonproductive cough.
When the patient developed a temperature spike and increased secretion production, repeat sputum culture was obtained, which was pending at the time of this dictation.
She was given a dose of vancomycin and three days of ceftazidime during this increase in her sputum production for coverage of nosocomial infection, however, given her rapid clinical improvement, it was thought that this was unlikely, and the ceftazidime was discontinued.
The patient also developed change in her stools to green liquid diarrhea with an increase in her white blood cell count from the baseline of 20 through her hospital course to 30, with evidence of increased bands.
She was then started empirically on Flagyl for likely C. difficile with cultures pending.
Her theophylline level was checked as the possible precipitant, which revealed low levels.
She was discontinued off of her Digoxin, and started on Diltiazem, which was titrated up to 60 mg four times a day for her heart rate control.
Her blood pressure was elevated, and the patient was continued on Zestril, started at 10 and increased to 30 mg once daily at the time of this dictation, which obtained better blood pressure control without any evidence of increase in her creatinine.
She received one time dosage of lasix secondary to desaturation and crackles on examination, presumed fluid overload with pulmonary congestion.
Endocrine:  The patient normally is on Glipizide secondary to her diabetes from steroids.
She had hypernatremia with a sodium of 149, for which she was given free-water repletion via intravenous and then encouraged to take in oral intake.
She was on Ativan as needed in order to maintain compliance with her mask ventilation.
She was given Tylenol for pain as needed.
Lines:  She had an arterial line while she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, as well as peripheral intravenous lines and a Foley.
