Mild degenerativedisease of the underlying left hip noted.

Interval small lacunar infarct in the left centrum semiovale.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 82 yoM w/ SSS s/p pacer and a h/o recurrent lower GI bleeds thought to be due to diverticulosis presents with BRBPR and presyncope.
1) Lower GI bleed: likely related to diverticulosis given previous history of bleeds and history of diverticulosis.
His bleeding previously on bleeding scan was localized to the hepatic flexure, he has diverticulosis of the entire colon making diverticular bleed most likely.
He has a history of polyps so a poly bleed is also possible but less likely, he also has internal hemorrhoids however this is also lower on the differential given the presence of clots.
No fever, leukocytosis or anything else to suggest inflammatory or infectious cause of bleeding.
He continued to have small amounts of blood when wiping which resolved by [**2159-10-23**] The patient was given IV fluid.
He was given a red cell transfusion to improve phsyiologic reserve given his multiple bleeding episodes.
Surgery was consulted and did not feel that surgical intervention was warranted at this time given the cessation of acute bleeding and that a complete colectomy would be necessary.
He should have follow-up hematocrit (serially, likely on a weekly basis) given his recurrent lower GI bleeds.
2) s/p Fall: no LOC, likely from volume depletion and possible vagal stimulus after visualization of blood +/- micturation / BM.
No prodromal symptoms, urinary/fecal incontinence, or tongue biting to suggest seizure.
Sick sinus syndrome may have contributed however this is less likely given the previously placed pacemaker.
CT head and hip films were negative for bleed or fracture.
The lower GI bleed was most likely due to diverticulosis, a condition in which blood vessels can bleed into outpouchings in your colon.
The light-headedness that caused your fall was due to your blood loss.
Surgery was consulted but did not feel that your bleeding warranted surgical evaluation at this time.
You should follow-up your recurrent lower GI bleed with your primary care physician with regular checks of your hematocrit.
------------------- No changes were made to your medications ------------------- If you experience any of the following symptoms you should contact your primary care physician or go to the emergency room:  Grossly bloody or tarlike stools, abdominal pain, fevers or chills, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness or light-headedness.
