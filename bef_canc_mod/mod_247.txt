No gallops or rubs noted.
LUNGS: Diffuse crackles were noted over both lung fields.

Right-sided abdominal hernia noted which was easily reducable.
The wound bed is 100% nonviable tissue and the bone is palpable in the center of the wound bed.

R ankle is significant for displaced calcaneus bone.
+1 Ankle edema was noted on the right ankle.

Decreased vibration and temperature sensation in stocking glove distribution.
Low lung volumes limits evaluation.
Small amount of linear atelectasis is seen in the left mid and lower lung.
No large effusions are present.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of CHF.
Stable cardiomegaly, with linear atelectasis involving the left mid-to- lower lung.
Transthoracic Echo: IMPRESSION: No vegetations or abscess seen, but the study is technically suboptimal for full assessment of valvular structure.

Left Ankle X-ray: There are no findings to suggest osteomyelitis such as bony destruction or soft tissue defects.
However, of note there is significant demineralization of the osseous structures, which decreases the sensitivity for detection of such findings.

Mild diffuse crackles were noted on physical exam; CXR was clean.
X-ray of the foot showed no findings of osteomyelitis such as bony deformation of soft tissues.
Patient was noted to have significant demineralization of the bone which decreases the efficacy of x-ray for osteoperosis diagnosis.
