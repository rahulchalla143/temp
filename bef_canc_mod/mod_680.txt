Her course was complicated by atrial flutter requiring attempts at cardioversion  (electrical) which failed.
She states that she is unsteady on her feet because she is "tired."

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**7-3**]:No acute intracranial abnormality Renal Scan [**7-4**]:Decreased contrast excretion from the transplanted kidney, can be seen with ATN in the appropriate clinical setting.
No definite leak identified, though assessment is limited as no delayed images are available.
Mildly elevated resistive indices since the prior study.
Small amount of free fluid persists.
Mild fullness of the collecting system.
Pathology [**7-5**]: renal biopsy: There is no evidence of acute cellular rejection in this sample.
The glomerular changes are that of a TMA and/or humoral rejection.
The C4d preparation suggests humoral rejection, but the material available is severely limited.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the transplant surgical service with acute mental status changes and presumably taking double medications.
A CT of her head was obtained which showed no acute abnormality.
Psych was consulted for her mental status changes and was thought to be in delirium.
There was concern that this was a Prograf toxicity effect and on [**7-5**] Rapamycin was initiated and Prograf was discontinued.
A kidney biopsy was performed on [**2150-7-5**] which showed that there was no evidence of acute cellular rejection.
The glomerular changes were consistent with TMA and/or humoral rejection.
The C4d preparation suggested humoral rejection, but the material available was severely limited.
She received one session of plasmapheresis and then this therapy was terminated due to lack of indication in this setting based on the biopsy results.
Psychiatry was noting this seemed less of a psych issue and so neurology was consulted who did a complete workup and evaluation.
