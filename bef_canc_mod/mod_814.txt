Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter with tip at the distal SVC.

There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
There are bilateral hypodensities in both kidneys, which are too small to characterize.
The common bile duct measures 6.5 mm within the head of the pancreas which is unchanged from previous CTs.
There is an oblong area measuring 1.9 x 0.5 cm in the left periaortic region (3:57), which may represent a vessel or less likely a lymph node and is unchanged in appearance from previous CTs.
There is no free fluid.
There is no free air.
There is no evidence of colonic wall thickening or edema.
There is no evidence of obstruction or free air.
CT PELVIS: There is a persistent area of thickening along the left side of the anorectal junction (3:123), which is unchanged from previous and poorly delineated by CT.
There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
There is no free fluid.
VASCULATURE: There is 50% stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery.
