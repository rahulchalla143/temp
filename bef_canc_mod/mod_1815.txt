No chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, PND, orthopnea, leg pain or swelling, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
At 5AM on the morning of hospital day 2, the patient was noted to have low O2 sats on 3L NC (had been satting 92% on 3L NC earlier in the night).
Suctioning revealed copious whitish sputum.
Of note, the patient was not eating prior to the event, has no known history of COPD or emphysema, and did not receive any narcotics or sedating medication on the floor.
Past Medical History: - Cerebral palsy - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - AVR with bioprosthetic valve ([**2085**]) - Diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - CRI (baseline Cr ~1.5-1.8) - Bladder Cancer s/p TURBT [**2098**]; cystoscopy [**3-/2099**] wnl - H/o several GI bleeds; most recent in [**12/2104**] secondary to polyps in setting of supratherapeutic INR (3.4) - Left ankle fracture s/p ORIF complicated by LLE DVT in [**2104-11-25**] (partially treated on coumadin - LENI on [**2105-2-20**] neg for DVT) - GERD - BPH - Pancreatic tail lesion (outpatient MRI scheduled) - Appendectomy - Hernia repair  Social History: Lives independently but has multiple friends who come by the house to help.
No family history of CAD or early MI, arrhythmia, or sudden death.
Anicteric sclera.
No murumurs rubs or gallops appreciated.
No conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus.
[**4-19**] diastolic murmur at LUSB.
[**3-22**] systolic murmur at apex.
No gallops or rubs.
No LE edema.
IMAGING: [**2105-2-20**] LENI: No evidence of DVT in either leg.
[**2105-2-24**] CXR: Left basilar opacity may represent atelectasis adjacent to a large hiatal hernia, although underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Mild patchy opacity in the right lung base may also represent atelectasis or infection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
RV chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate to severe regurgitation and high transvalvular gradients c/w prosthetic valve stenosis.
Mild regional LV dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate RV systolic dysfunction.
Mild MR. .
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Bilateral areas of atelectasis and likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
The lung apices and thoracic inlet are partially obscured by the patient's chin.
There is streaky density at the lung bases likely representing subsegmental atelectasis.
In addition, there is hazy density in the left costophrenic sulcus that may represent pleural fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo man with cerebral palsy, paroxysmal Afib, h/o DVT, and h/o aortic valve replacement, admitted with fevers/SOB secondary to [**Hospital **] hospital course complicated by an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress.
# CAP/Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient noted early on the morning of hospital day 2 to have low O2 sats on 3L NC (90-93%) with increased work of breathing and increased secretions.
There was concern for worsening pneumonia vs aspiration in the setting of his cerebral palsy.
No known history of COPD or restrictive lung disease.
He did not appear volume overloaded on exam.
EKG without any new ischemic changes concerning for ACS and troponins were flat at 0.05 (pt with CKD).
Although he had a DVT in [**11/2104**], LENI on [**2105-2-20**] was negative for DVT in either leg.
Repeat CXR was concerning for fluid overload so he was diuresed with IV lasix.
ECHO showed worsened aortic regurgitation and prosthetic valve stenosis, so he was transfered to the [**Hospital1 1516**] cardiology service for further management.
Upon reviewing the ECHO, there is no LV enlargement so the aortic regurgitation is unlikely to be as severe as suggested, and the patient was euvolemic on exam.
His respiratory symptoms were likely due to the pneumonia and possibly a silent aspiration.
- He was noted to have brief apneic episodes during sleep, so we recommend an outpatient sleep study .
# H/o aortic valve replacement: ECHO shows moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and high transvalvular gradients c/w prosthetic valve stenosis.
There is no left ventricular enlargement, so the aortic regurgitation may not be as severe as suggested, and the patient is euvolemic on exam.
# H/o Paroxysmal AFib: Patient remained in NSR during this admission.
He is also not anticoagulated considering his h/o GI bleeds.
# Coronaries: Cardiac cath in [**2085**] was negative for CAD, however recent ECHO revealed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall consistent with CAD.
Patient w/o angina, EKG w/o ischemic changes, and troponins flat at 0.05 (patient has CKD).
The patient is not currently taking aspirin considering his history of GI bleeds.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was monitored via FSBS with regular insulin sliding scale.
# Anemia: Normocytic.
No evidence of active bleeding and stool is guiac negative.
# GERD: Asymptomatic.
# BPH: Continued tamsulosin.
