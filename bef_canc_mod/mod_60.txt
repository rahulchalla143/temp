IMAGING & STUDIES: ------------------ [**2164-4-3**] EGD/ Esophageal stent placement: A slight narrowing was noted in the mid/upper esophagus at 26 cm likely corresponding to known anastamotic stricture.
Once anastamotic stricture was traversed there was a large saccular area identified which was ulcerated and friable - Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], this represents the gastric conduit.
Again identified was a 1-2 mm area concerning for fistula.
After extensive discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], decision was made to place a fully covered metal stent to attempt closure of the fistula and symptom control.
A 23 mm x 155 mm Wallflex Esohpagael fully covered metal stent [Ref# 1675; Lot# [**Serial Number 6548**]] was placed successfully into the esophagus under fluoroscopic guidance.
