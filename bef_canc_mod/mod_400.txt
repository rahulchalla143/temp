US FINDINGS: Limited survey of the four quadrants of the abdomen demonstrates no intra-abdominal ascites.
IMPRESSION: No intra-abdominal ascites.
Lung volumes are slightly decreased when compared to previous.
Fullness within the hilar regions bilaterally is believed secondary to low lung volumes and vascular crowding.
There is a subtle opacity within the left lung base.
No effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Suble opacity in the left lung base which may represent focal atelectasis however correlation with PA and lateral radiographs recommended.
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process is detected.
Within the limitations, there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
There are no extra-axial fluid collections.
No calvarial fractures identified.
There is complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with mild thickening of the underlying bone, suggesting chronic sinusitis.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
Chronic right maxillary sinusitis.
CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous examination of [**2142-11-20**], there is no relevant change.
The pre-existing very subtle parenchymal opacity at the left lateral lung base is slightly smaller than on the previous examination.
The lack of contour loss of the left hemidiaphragm, not the left heart border, makes an inflammatory opacity unlikely.
No pleural effusion.
No signs of fluid overload, no other suspicious pulmonary opacities.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is within the upper range of normal, with an accentuated left heart border.
IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2140-11-20**], there is slight decrease in subtle left- sided opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: # H/o DM type 2 / Hypoglycemia: from poor po intake from missing dentures.
VNA arranged for at home for continual diabetic education.
# Delirium: resolved.
No signs of infection on LP.
#Fever in ER: no recurrence.
D/w liver team - no indication of acute encephalopathy.
# Post LP headache - resolved with conservative measures.
# Thrombocytopenia: dilutional vs hypersplenism.
Has had low platelets in past.
# Hematuria: repeat UA with PCP.
# Abnormal CXR: Opacity since [**2139**] - as above.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia, resolved Diabetes mellitus type 1, uncontrolled with complications Delirium, resolved Alcoholic cirrhosis Chronic kidney disease stage 3   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: Your were admitted for confulsion likely related to very low sugar levels.
Nursing services have been set up for you at home (visiting nurses) mainly for diabetic education.
Return to the hospital if you notice any bleeding, confusion, sweating or other symptoms of concern to you.
