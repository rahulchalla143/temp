Patent hepatic and portal venous vasculature.
Trace bilateral lower quadrant ascites.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler venous Ultrasound [**2117-9-26**]: IMPRESSION: No DVT.
[**2117-9-26**] CXR: Low lung volumes similar to prior exam.
There is pleural effusion.
In either case, if not new, this is unlikely to have enlarged recently.
No large bleed detected.
CT sensitivity for a slow-flow GI bleed is very low.
Moderate simple ascites.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild pneumobilia secondary to hepaticojejunostomy, without evidence of biliary obstruction.
no concerning hepatic lesions detected.
Splenomegaly and splenic and gastric varices, compatible with chronic portal hypertension.
12 mm RLQ intrapelvic node, unchanged in size since [**2114**], with interval calcification, likely a lymph node.
Endoscopies:  [**2117-10-1**]: EGD: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Ulcer in the antrum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2117-10-1**]: Unable to visualize the rectum due to poor prep.
Significant amount of dark bloody stool and clots were seen in the rectum.
[**2117-10-2**]: The scope was advanced to the mid-transverse colon but could not be advanced further due to significant looping.
Further attempts to advance to scope were limited by the fact that the patient was unsedated because of his marginal blood pressures.
By the mid-trasnverse, there was no blood seen.
No obvious bleeding site or source was identified.
There was a single rectal varix withoutbleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding.
There was bilious non bloody fluid in the terminal ileum.
Edema and loss of the normal vascular pattern consiistent with portal enteropathy in the mid-sigmoid colon Two nonbleeding large rectal varices were seen in the rectum upon retroflexion.
There were no stigmata of recent bleeding Thus, the decison was made not to inject as per Hepatology attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The distal rectum was somehow friable consistent with portal enteropathy.
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids There was a small area of mucosal irregularity in the distal rectum, suggestive of condyloma.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: 54M with h/o HIV (CD4 28 in [**6-5**]), HCV cirrhosis, s/p OLT in [**2112**], HCV recurrence, DM2, recently admitted thrice for rising LFTs, multiple biopsies concerning for acute cellular rejection presenting with BLE edema and BRBPR  Hematochezia- patient had hematochezia at home with a 7 point HCT drop.
He was admitted to the MICU but had no further bleeding so was just given transfusions and once stable was transferred to the floor.
On the floor the patient was stable,but on his third hospital day large bloody bowel movement with a HCt drop to 18, and he was transferred back to the unit.
There he underwent a colonoscopy and endocsocpy which showed no active bleeding and no interventions were taken.
He had another episode of hematochezia but colonscopy the next day showed no evidence of bleeding.
As it was felt this may be from his small bowel he udnerwent a CT angiogram of his abdomen which showed no bleeding sites that could be intervened upon palliatively.
Goals of Care- patient had multiple discussions with his primary hepatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] as well as the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] team about the prognosis of his condition (rejection of the liver).
Edema- patient came in with anasarca, with 3+pitting edema of the legs and scrotal edema.
His scrotal edema improved during his stay however he continued to have 3+ pitting edema on the legs bilaterally and was limiting his ability to walk.
His bilirubin was markedly elevated at 40 on admission, and his LFTs were worsening.
His tacro level became subtherapeutic during this admission (was being held) so he was given one dose and will continue weekly dose of 0.5mg po qwednesday  Renal failure- patient had elevated Cr at 1.7 (with his baseline being around 0.6).
He was started on treatment for HRS with midodrine and octreotide.He will be sent home on midodrine to help with his blood pressure as well.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having rectal bleeding and your blood counts had dropped significantly, and you had a lot of swelling in your legs.
You had another episode of bleeding and underwent another colonoscopy on [**10-6**] which did not see any areas of active bleeding.
You were also noted to have worsening liver function tests and it was felt that this was a sign of rejection of your body against the liver transplant.
