Rhythm: patient with known AV delay, RBBB, LAFB, now presented with bradycardia, chronotropic insufficiency, ddx included (1)increased vagal tone, (2)primary sinus node dysfunction -- SA node fibrosis or arrest (3)medication affect due to beta blockers or dofetilide especially given poor renal function although there is no evidence of recent change (4)hypothyroidism (5) myocarditis; (1) no evid of increased vagal tone or inciting events (2) most likely etiology; worsening conduction disease (3) pt has been stable on these meds for some time (4) TSH wnl (5) no recent infection though difficult to r/o.
Held pt's dofetilide, metoprolol given low HR and BP; started on dopa drip at 5 for stimulation of SA node and for pressure support; EP decided to place permanent pacer; dopa weaned off over 1d; held coumadin for PPM placement  Pt had PPM placed (DDD), no complications though difficult anatomy and as part of a research study has a special set of timing parameters to be readjusted at his follow up appointment in the device clinic in two weeks.
B. CAD s/p CABG: continue ASA, Lipitor increased from 10mg PO qd to 40mg PO qd as recent lipids profile still elevated; held BB and ace-I initially while hypotensive, rrestarted prior to discharge with some dizziness and SBP 92 after restarting the ACEI.
Pulmonary: mild hypoxia on admit, likely due to pulmonary edema, weaned to off  3.
