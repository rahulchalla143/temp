Admission Date:  [**2152-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-11-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-11-19**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 93777**] is a 75 -year-old female with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and hypercholesterolemia who presented with complaints of shortness of breath and back pain.
She was found to be in decompensated congestive heart failure and was admitted to the Medical Service for diuresis and investigation as to why she had suffered an acute decompensation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission examination was remarkable for tachypnea, respiratory rate of 28, 84% on room air saturation, bilateral crackles to the mid thorax, 9.0 cm jugular venous distention, and an S3 gallop and trace pretibial edema.
Admission electrocardiogram was remarkable for sinus rhythm at 70, a left bundle branch block that was new, flipped T-waves in I, AVL, V5, V6 that were consistent with lateral ischemia.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly, cephalization, and bilateral effusion.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2152-10-27**] showed high grade stenosis in the distal left main system, involving the origin of the left anterior descending artery as 90% osteal stenosis, moderate disease of the left circumflex including 50% stenosis of the oblique marginal and other diffuse disease throughout the circumflex system.
There is an 80% osteal stenosis of the right coronary artery and it was additionally reported that the patient ultimately ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
On [**2152-10-29**], the patient had a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft; a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to first diagonal and also to second obtuse marginal artery sequentially, as well as a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
The patient's pulmonary status was also an issue because of the relative volume overload due to her acute renal failure and she was noted to have bilateral pulmonary effusions by chest x-ray.
She underwent a thoracentesis drainage of the effusions with marked symptomatic relief on postoperative day four.
Postoperatively she did also suffer from serous drainage involving the inferior aspect of the sternal wound that persisted up until 24 hours prior to discharge.
The patient received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation for diabetes management and her usual measurement of Avandia and sliding scale was changed.
Wet-to-dry dressing changes were utilized to manage the wound dehiscence as well as vancomycin and Levaquin.
On discharge, the patient was afebrile without sternal drainage.
The sternum was stable, no erythema or exudate was noted.
Extremities were without edema and wounds were granulating well with no erythema.
Chest x-ray had shown stable, but resolving bilateral effusions and a room air saturation of 93%.
She will have a wound check in one week, here on Far Six at the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with the outpatient clinic staffed by the cardiac physician's assistant.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post coronary artery bypass graft times four, complicated by postoperative renal failure.
She had a right saphenous vein graft site wound infection and dehiscence.
The patient has native three vessel disease and left main disease, is now status post repair.
