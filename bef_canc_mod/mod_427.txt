Denies focal numbness, weakness, vision changes, or word-finding difficulties.
Also described feeling lightheaded, denies LOC but reports that he occasionally feels as though he may pass out.
Reports he is not always compliant with his medications, has stopped Lisinopril or Lipitor recently, and states he has not taken Coumadin in 7 days.

CAD: s/p CABG [**2168**] after non-Q wave MI, Cath with 70% LAD, 50% circumflux lesion with LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA and PVA, ETT-MIBI [**7-26**] without ischemic EKG changes or anginal symptoms, with significant ventricular and supraventricular irritability, MIBI with fixed LV enlargement with decreased EF 35%.
There were no perfusion defects.
Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: Quit smoking 27 years ago.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals T 97.7; HR 48; BP 127/43; RR 20; O2 Sat 97% 2L GEN: AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI Neck: No JVD at 60 degrees, supple CV: bradycardic, irregular rhythm, no MRG Lungs: diffuse expiratory wheezes, fair air movement, no crackles at bases ABD: soft, NTND.
2+ DPs Skin: no rashes Neuro: No focal deficits.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the entire septum with relative preservation of the remaining segments.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic stenosis of aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax or other acute process identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 76 year-old male with history of chronic Atrial Fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG [**2168**], CHF (EF 30%), and COPD who presented with progressive dyspnea.
DYSPNEA/CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES Patient was initially thought to have COPD flare vs. CHF exacerbation, and was treated with Levaquin and diuretics in the ED.
Lung exam was consistent with COPD exacerbation, but patient also with asymptomatic bradycardia, with pulse dipping into mid-20s on occasion.
After arrival to the floor, patient experienced episode of pulseless polymorphic VT/torsades.
Initial EKGs were notable for QT prolongation to 500s-580s.
Once COPD exacerbation and supratherapeutic INR were adequately dealt with, patient received single chamber [**Company 1543**] VVI pacer.
CXR was without evidence of focal infiltrate but consistent with emphysematous changes.
Repeat PA/Lateral were without evidence of mass.
Patient was afebrile throughout hospital course.
Recent dyspnea/fatigue were attributed to both COPD flare and worsening conduction abnormalities, with bradycardia impairing forward cardiac output (symptomatic bradycardia).
Small Cerebellar Bleed Given supratherapeutic INR in the 40s on presentation, patient received a Head CT in the Emergency Department, which revealed a small cerebellar bleed.
CAD Given bradycardia impairing blood pressure control, patient's Lisinopril was held until after pacemaker insertion.
Anemia Hct stable, at baseline on discharge.
Weight loss On presentation, patient denied any recent weight changes.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for wheezing.
Prolonged QT, symptomatic bradycardia s/p [**Company 1543**] VVI Pacer  Secondary 1.
COPD 2.
CAD s/p CABG [**2168**] 3.
Chronic Atrial Fibrillation 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: clinically and hemodynamically stable, ambulating without oxygen requirement, CXR confirming proper pacemaker placement   Discharge Instructions: 1.
If you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, fever, bleeding around your pacemaker site, or other concerning signs/symptoms, please contact your PCP or report to the Emergency Department immediately  Followup Instructions: 1.
