Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED [**2162-3-6**] with complaint of fever to 103 and rigors.
Prior to that he had been ill for about a month with productive cough and congestion.
His urinalysis was consistent with infection, and he received doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin to cover UTI and possibility of pneumonia given h/o pulmonary fibrosis.
He was also treated with hydrocortisone 100mg iv Q8hr given h/o chronic steroid use and risk of adrenal insufficiency.
An abdominal u/s was performed to evaluate for ascites and revealed a cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and ascites.
An ECHO was done to evaluate for cardiomyopathy given pt's hx of hemochromatosis.
He endorses only some sore throat which he attributes to oxygen.
On review of systems, he states that he has had a 37 lb weight loss over the last six months coincident with tapering of his prednisone.
He denies any recent headache, vision changes, chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, PND, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, BRBPR, melana, arthralgias or skin rash.
Past Medical History: * Hemochromatosis - diagnosed 2yrs ago, treated with every other month phlebotomy * Cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis and ?EtOH cirrhosis * h/o EtOH abuse, no h/o withdrawals, now rare use * Hypertension * Coronary artery disease * Pulmonary fibrosis - diagnosed 3yrs ago, on chronic steroids and intermittent home oxygen (for the past 6 months) * Asthma??
* Hyperlipidemia * Psoriatic arthritis * s/p right rotator cough injury .

Interstitial opacity within the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**] is a 64 year old male with a PMH significant for CAD, hemachromatosis and pulmonary fibrosis (on chronic prednisone therapy) who was transferred from an OSH with sepsis.
Given presentation and history, the patient was thought to have sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
Steroids were tapered to his home dose for pulmonary fibrosis.
Hematology was consulted and felt that the anemia was due to chronic phlebotomy for hemochromatosis.
Leukopenia may have been secondary to infection given that it dropped suddenly in setting of sepsis.
Thrombocytopenia was likely due to chronic liver disease and sepsis.
HIT was not likely given that patient has chronic thrombocytopenia and the platelet count did not drop to [**2-9**] of what is was originally.
The patient takes Arava for psoriatic arthritis.
In addition, his INR was elevated and may be related to impaired synthetic function of the liver given a history of hemachromatosis and cirrhosis.
Lasix and spironolactone were restarted for cirrhosis when the patient stabilized.
Pancytopenia NOS.
Elevated Troponin NOS - likely secondary to sepsis.
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis - dx [**2159**], on steroid taper.
Psoriatic Arthritis.
Right Rotator Cuff Injury.
Ambulating without assistance.
Please return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms: fever > 101.5, shaking chills, worsening cough, severe pain, intractable nausea or vomiting or any other concerning symptoms.
