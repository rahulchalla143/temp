CXR: Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence for pneumonia or overt CHF.
Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
Increased consolidation in both lower lobes, probably explained by the combination of atelectasis and BOOP.
Increased elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Mild subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
[**2-19**] Lung biopsy.
Right lung, lower lobe, wedge biopsy (A-P): Patchy organizing pneumonitis No malignancy identified 2.
Right lung, middle lobe, wedge biopsy (Q-V): Patchy organizing pneumonitis No malignancy identified.
*  There is a peribronchiolar chronic inflammatory infiltrate with focal alveolar collapse and intra-alveolar macrophages and fibroblastic proliferation.
[**2-29**] - Video Swallow eval: IMPRESSION: Penetration of the vocal cords during swallowing of both thin and nectar thick liquids.
No frank aspiration during this study.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic and left lower lobe atelectasis currently present is intermittent.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable on the left but increased on the right following some improvement in transient interstitial pulmonary edema.
Cardiomegaly with particular left atrial enlargement is longstanding.
Ca: 8.3 Mg: 1.9 P: 4.2 CBC:  WBC 4.6 Hct 26 Plt 188 PT: 13.0  INR: 1.1   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a a 63yo M s/p OLT ([**5-11**]) for HepC cirrhosis/HCC on immunosuppression, s/p tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis ([**7-11**]), recurrent pna admitted from [**Hospital3 **] rehab for increasing dyspnea x 1 month, found to have multiple pulmonary nodules but no PE seen on CTA.
These nodules were not previously seen (last CT chest at [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-11**]).
## Respiratory Failure - On this admission, patient was re-started on vanco, ceftaz, and levo for nosocomial PNA.
Infectious disease was consulted for possible infectious/inflammatory etiology.
Bronch was attempted by IP on [**2-15**] but was unsuccessful due to small trach.
Thoracics were consulted for VATS, and the patient underwent VATS with BAL and wedge biopsies of right lower lobe and middle lobes on [**2-18**].
Patient likely developed acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.
The acute respiratory acidosis was thought to be secondary to narcotics/sedatives causing hypoventilation as well as exposure to 100% FIO2 leading to decreased respiratory drive and causing more shunt lung physiology given his chronic obstructive lung disease and Pickwickian syndrome.
He required very frequent pulmonary toileting due to copious amount of sputum production which was thought to be secondary to his pulmonary nodules vs infection.
They did not feel necessary to start high dose prednisone for BOOP and felt that pt would recover with discontinuation of sirolimus.
In addition, BAL and tissue culture from the VATS came back positive for pseudomonas, GNR, and Coag positive Staph.
The chest tube was placed during VATS procedure was managed by thoracis and initially planeed on removing the chest tube on [**2160-2-23**] or [**2160-2-24**].
He continued to have copious yellow/white thick secretioning requiring suctioning every few hrs initially.
# Renal Insufficienty - Post operatively patient was noted to be in oliguric renal failure.
He had acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
#  OLT - Liver followed the patient in the unit and discontinued sirolimus and increased Cellcept as above.
#  Anemia - Microcytic.
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease, iron normal.
#  Hypertension - Continued on metoprolol and amlodipine.
# RUE swelling - noted to have RUE swelling.
Ultrasound was done which showed no evidence of DVT.
Speech and swallow were consulted for Passy Muir Valve Evaluation, but pt was thought not to be safe to use it due to his tracheal stenosis.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
