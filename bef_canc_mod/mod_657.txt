Admission Date:  [**2179-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-11-23**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old female with past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CCU with bradycardia and hypotension status post cardiac catheterization.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 2018**] for an elective cardiac catheterization.
She was scheduled for mitral valve replacement and required a catheterization as part of her preoperative evaluation.
However, during that catheterization procedure patient decompensated with markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to the 50s when placed supine.
Her respiratory distress did improve at this point.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Non-small cell lungs cancer status post right upper lobectomy and mediastinal and lymph node dissection.
Rheumatic heart disease with history of rheumatic fever.
Her catheterization showed three-vessel coronary disease.
Her left circumflex had a moderate osteal calcification with diffuse disease to 30% proximally.
Obtuse marginal 1 branch had a 70% stenosis at its origin.
Patient had no active ischemic symptoms on following her catheterization.
Pump:  Patient with severe ventricular diastolic dysfunction following cardiac catheterization which did show severe diastolic dysfunction which was complicated by significant pulmonary edema.
She also developed cardiogenic shock during the catheterization, likely a combination of her congestive heart failure decompensation and multiple medications administered.
However, she then developed hypotension and bradycardia requiring a Dopamine drip for her cardiogenic shock.
There was concern for overdiuresis following her respiratory decompensation.
Patient with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone at time of admission:  When patient was first admitted to the CCU she was in sinus rhythm.
However, given her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation she was maintained on a Heparin drip with plans to eventually transition her to Coumadin.
However, she first underwent cardiac catheterization as detailed above for preoperative clearance.
[**Last Name (STitle) 48164**] a history of rheumatic heart disease which was thought to be the likely etiology for her valvular disease.
Respiratory failure:  Patient developed severe pulmonary edema during her cardiac catheterization requiring intubation.
Oncology:  Patient with history of non-small cell lung cancer and right upper lobe lobectomy.
Patient had no active oncology issues during this admission.
Urinary tract infection:  On routine urinalysis a urine culture did grow out Enterococcus.
A urinalysis showed no evidence of white cells, bacteria, or other infection.
However, given the finding of Enterococcus in her urine it was decided to treat patient empirically with Cipro as per the Cardiothoracic Surgery service.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Aortic insufficiency.
Urinary tract infection.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for plans of mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.
