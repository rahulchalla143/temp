History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 8163**] is a 65 year-old woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], stroke ([**2121**]), lung cancer s/p chemoradiation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation who presents from her NH with a history of worsening NIF and weakness.
She was originally admitted on [**3-25**] for endovascular repair of enlarging aortic aneurysm.
Over the subsequent days, she was noted to have generalized weakness and fatigueability.
Neurology was consulted on [**3-30**] and per their note, she complained of limb weakness, facial weakness marked by difficulty maintaining her eyes open.
Her overall post-operative course was complicated by a myasthenia flare requiring MICU stay with intubation x2, plasmapheresis x5 treatments, mestinon and steroids.
She represented to the emergency room with declining NIF, weakness and fevers to 100.5 degrees.
Although she appeared short of breath she was not complaining of dyspnea.
She was evaluated by the neurology consult service who recommended Q2H NIFs and vital capacity checks.
She does have mild cough but is unable to bring up sputum.
She denies shortness of breath and chest pain.
No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: - [**2121**]: diagnosed; closely followed by primary neurologist in [**Location (un) 38**] - mild crisis in the past marked by visual changes (diplopia) and generalized weakness - has been on mestinon 60mg TID for her maintenance and recently prednisone 60mg qd since discharge on [**2122-4-16**] - at baseline, uses wheelchair for any extended travel and walks around the home with a walker most of the time - not really able to perform activities of daily living without substantial support by her husband who is also her primary caretaker 2.
Stroke, [**2121**] - felt to be [**2-9**] hypertension - residual weakness in BLLE 3.
History of lung CA in [**2116**], s/p chemoradiation, treated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 4223**] in [**Name (NI) 392**], pt believes it was small cell lung cancer.

ECHO [**2122-4-25**]: Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarct.
If there is a high clinical suspicion for an acute infarct, an MR is suggested.
Large bilateral low-attenuation inguinal collections.
Differential diagnosis includes a seroma, or chronic hematoma 2.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with patent aortobiiliac graft without evidence of endoleak.
Due to decreasing NIF and VC she was transferred to the MICU:  This is a 65 year old female with history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], recent prolonged hospital course after MG flare s/p elective AAA repair who is transferred to the MICU for increasing weakness and worsening NIF/Vital Capacity measurements.
Myasthenia Flare: For the past week the patient has had increasing weakness and worsening NIF/vital capacity.
Her metoprolol was restarted for atrial fibrillation.
On the night of [**4-26**], the ICU team was called to reassess for worsening NIF and vital capacity (-32 and 750 cc).
On exam she did not endorse worsening dyspnea but reported feeling weak persistently since transfer to rehab.
Her ABG was notable for a compensated chronic respiratory acidosis.
CXR was negative for acute cardiopulmonary process.
It remains unclear whether this is a worsening of her Myasthenia or rather a prolonged recovery from her previous flare complicated by reduced endurance and deconditioning from prolonged hospital course.
In the MICU other causes of weakness were evaluated and the CT head showed no evidence of new infarction.
Pt also had a chest floroscopy study to evaluate for phrenic nerve injury given her recent AAA repair.
After discussion with transfusion medicine, we decided not to pursue plasmaphoresis for multiple reasons: no fatigability or physical signs of active [**Month/Year (2) 15099**], risks associated with putting phoresis catheter in her right atrium with new onset a. fib, and it would pull off her coumadin and make anticoagulation more difficulty.
We intiated CPAP at night to improve her respiratory mechanics and treat OSA in hopes it would help her fatigue as well.
Atrial fibrillation:  Patient with episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation in the setting of holding metoprolol (held due to potential to worsen her Myasthenia).
This was cautiously continued but with low threshold to discontinue if worsening respiratory status.
During this admission she developed hyponatremia again while on the floor.
She has a history of small cell lung cancer (per pt) which can be attributed with SCLC but no neoplasm was seen on CT chest done [**4-7**].
We attributed her SIADH to her moderate to severe COPD which she has on chest CT.  - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
Right common femoral DVT: She was diagnosed with new right common femoral DVT during last admission.
Post-operative course as outlined above with Myasthenia crisis.
During plasmapheresis treatment during the prior admission, the patient had developed bleeding from wound.
On the neurology floor she complained of hip pain and CT pelvis was done to evaluate for hematomas at catheter sites or avascular necrosis given pt's treatment with prednisone.
CT found no AVN but there were bilateral hematomas or seromas.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 81219**] [**Hospital 7755**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: MYASTENIA FLARE SIADH Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Right common femoral DVT Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
