Retroperitoneal hematoma within the right iliacus and psoas musculature.
Cholelithiasis without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Thoracolumbar degenerative change, without fracture.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2121-12-27**], gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve is similarly high, trace aortic regurgitation is now seen.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE [**Date range (1) 21036**]: 60 year old male who presents to the ED with PMH of AVR for endocarditis on coumadin, DM, HLD, CRI baseline Cr 1.5,  who presented to ED with back pain for two weeks and was found to have a right psoas hematoma on CT scan in setting of supratherapeutic INR to 4 and acute on chronic renal failure.
His renal failure improved to baseline of 1.5.
Echo done over concern of possible endocarditis given slight leukocytosis which showed no endocarditis (can't be fully ruled out on TTE).
His bleeding remained stbale and pt was transferred to the floor.
His vital signs were stable and he was increasingly able to move his right leg with minimal pain.
At time of discharge pt had near normal range of motion of his right psoas with no pain when the psoas muscle was isolated and stressed on physical exam.
# AVR: Pt anticoagulation for AVR was stopped secondary to supratherapuetic INR and psoas hematoma.
There were no complications related to the short discontinuation of his warfarin therapy and there were no complications with his AVR.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Pt has a baseline Cr of 1.5 prior to admission and on admission it was elevated to 2.2.
This acute rise in Cr was likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of a large psoas hematoma.
You were admitted because you were found to have a large collection of blood in your psoas, hip, muscle.
This collection of blood caused the extreme pain you felt when you moved your right leg.
