HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male well known to the cardiothoracic service after a had initially presented with aortic insufficiency and aortic root dilation with shortness of breath.
The patient had a Bentall procedure performed on [**2184-5-19**] and underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] postoperative course including mental status confusion, reintubation for pulmonary secretions, and chest tube for a worsening right sided pleural effusion.
Initially at home the patient was doing well without complaints.
However, the patient soon developed progressive shortness of breath.
The patient presented to the emergency department in the evening of [**2184-6-2**] where Cardiology performed an echocardiogram which showed a moderately large circumferential pericardial effusion, moderate right ventricular invagination, no overt evidence of cardiac tympanode, and no significant aortic regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient presents as a well developed elderly male, appearing stated age in mild respiratory distress and mildly tachypneic.
Lungs showed a right sided rub at the base with decreased bilateral breath sounds.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds.
Abdomen was normal, nontender, nondistended and with positive bowel sounds  External examination did not show evidence of an obvious click.
There was no signs of erythema or tenderness at the sternal wound.
Extremities showed no signs of edema and were warm and well perfused.
Chest x-ray showed a moderate right sided pleural     effusion, increased cardiac size and a displaced sternal     wire in the mid to lower sternal pole.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic surgery service for follow-up of presenting signs and radiologic findings.
Over night the patient had large amounts of serous drainage from his right chest tube site without symptomatic change.
The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
On [**2184-6-4**] it was noted that the patient developed an area of induration and erythema at the inferior pole of the sternal incision.
It was felt this was of significant concern for infection of the sternal wound, although there was no expressible puffs from the wound site.
Upon re-examination of the sternal wound there was an audible click indicating probable sternal instability.
An echocardiogram of [**2184-6-4**] which showed an enlarged pericardial effusion.
A CAT scan with contrast was obtained at this time which helped to distinguish between pleural effusion and pericardial effusion for this patient.
It was also noted that the sternal edges did not align properly, though there was no free fluid or signs of infection present along the sternal incision.
The patient was extubated on postoperative day one and did so without any difficulties.
Operative wounds appeared to be clean, dry and intact and the patient sternum was no longer unstable.
The patient continued to improve the following days and worked well with physical therapy.
He was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient remained having a small O2 requirement of two liters nasal cannula which maintained his O2 saturations in the mid 90's.
The patient was noted to develop atrial flutter as early as [**6-6**] and was seen by the electrophysiology staff on [**2184-6-11**].
On [**2184-6-6**] the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient s wounds were clean, dry and intact and there was no sternal click.
The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in one week in order to get wound check and a white blood cell count.
The patient was instructed upon the precise types of symptoms and signs which would necessitate the patient coming in to see a cardiothoracic surgeon.
