ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Fatigue, weakness and gastrointestinal bleed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation and history of prior gastrointestinal bleeds including peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II procedure, history of esophagitis, history of gastric adenocarcinoma, status post partial esophagogastrectomy in [**2119**], who presents with weakness, fatigue, and lightheadedness that began on the day prior to admission.
At that time, he felt particularly weak and his daughter, who is a nurse, found him to be orthostatic.
He was noted to have a melanic bowel movement in the Emergency Room.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS;  The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis or hematemesis.
He had no bright red blood per rectum.
He denied any syncope or loss of consciousness and he denies non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use for his history of osteoarthritis.
Atrial fibrillation since the [**2101**], previously on Coumadin.
Gastrointestinal bleed in [**2123-4-13**] with diffuse esophagitis, Grade IV and clotting diverticulosis noted.
Gastric adenocarcinoma status post partial esophagogastrectomy in [**2119**].
Peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II in [**2091**].
Question of history of hypertension.
The patient was noted to be an awake, alert, thin, cachectic elderly man who is pleasant and in no apparent distress on arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He had moist mucous membranes and no blood was visible in his oropharynx.
Cardiovascular:  Heart was irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheeze, no rhonchi.
Abdomen was noted to have well healed vertical midline laparotomy scar and a well healed scar over the left upper quadrant, consistent with prior surgeries.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally.
Neurological examination was alert and oriented times three, speech was slightly slurred; no focal findings.
EKG noted atrial fibrillation with a rate of 84, normal intervals, axis of 60 degrees.
No ST or T wave abnormalities compared with old EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further work-up where he had an urgent endoscopy by the Gastrointestinal Service which showed evidence of old esophagitis.
Gastric petechiae were noted consistent with gastritis and blood with clot was evident in both limbs of his prior small intestinal anastomosis.
No evidence of active bleed and no deep ulcers were visualized at that time.
At the conclusion of the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the patient vomited a fairly large amount of blood and was immediately placed on his side and able to cough up most of the bloody emesis, however, there was a concern for possible aspiration, although patient's respiratory status remained stable with normal respiratory rate, O2 saturations at 100% on two liters nasal cannula which he had been put on prior to the procedure and a chest x-ray was obtained that was clear.
At this time, he was also slightly hypotensive into a systolic of 70 but had a normal heart rate and was sleeping.
The second esophagogastroduodenoscopy was carried out in the Intensive Care Unit by the Gastrointestinal Service on hospital day number two and showed evidence of an ulcer in the distal esophagus as well as ulceration at the gastroesophageal junction near the prior anastomosis.
There was no active hemorrhage noted at this time.
Repeat chest x-ray on the morning of hospital day two showed a slight improvement in a retrocardiac opacity that was noted on the initial chest x-ray following the question of aspiration and the patient's white count which had increased to 14.8 on hospital day two, decreased to 12.3 on the day of discharge.
Given the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeds and history of partial gastrectomy, iron studies and B12 were added on to his initial laboratory tests and he was noted to have a low B12 as well as iron deficiency, and so he was started on B12 oral replacement and iron sulfate.
Anemia secondary to blood loss and iron and B12 deficiency.
Atrial fibrillation.
