Admission Date:  [**2114-11-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-12-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-7-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old Asian male who has a history of hypertension and was doing yard work and had a syncopal event.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2114-11-21**] which revealed an ejection fraction of about 30% with 1-2+ MR, anterior basal hypokinesis, anterolateral hypokinesis, apical dyskinesis, and inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis.
His left anterior descending artery had ostial and proximal severe diffuse disease and was totally occluded after the first diagonal.
His left circumflex showed major OM with 40% ostial lesion and a 70% distal stenosis.
His right coronary artery is dominant with a mid tubular 60% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis.
He also had an echocardiogram which revealed an EF of 50% and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
His heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm without rub or gallop.
There is a III/VI holosystolic ejection murmur from the apex to the axilla.
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, without masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
The EKG showed sinus rhythm in the 60s with ST elevations in the inferior leads, ST elevations in V2, V3, and V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While awaiting surgery, he was seen by the Electrophysiology staff in regards to his syncopal episode.
They did feel that his syncopal episode was consistent with a possible vagal episode but they felt that they would rather do EP studies following his CABG and at that point may or may not place an AICD.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with the cardiopulmonary bypass time of 175 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 154 minutes.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on epinephrine, milrinone, nitroglycerin, and propofol in normal sinus rhythm, two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
He was noted to have profound hypotension and underwent TEE which revealed hypokinetic anterior wall but was actually better than the immediate postoperative TEE.
He was able to move everything to commands but became hypotensive and was eventually placed back on the propofol drip.
His intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued without incident.
Later that day, he had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation from which he converted to normal sinus rhythm and then a junctional rhythm.
On postoperative day number five, he had his chest tube discontinued and he had a new left subclavian Cordis and Swan placed.
His chest x-ray did show a left-sided pneumothorax and he did have a new chest tube inserted on that side which showed reinflation of the left lung.
By postoperative day number seven, he was started on heparin for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and his mechanical mitral valve.
He continued to be treated with heparin and have his Coumadin held while the Electrophysiology Service sorted out his echocardiogram and decided when would be the best time to do his studies.
His chest x-ray did show a left lower lobe consolidation and he was started on levofloxacin.
On postoperative day number 11, he was complaining of throat pain.
He was noted to have a purulent exudate around his uvula and he was started on Rocephin for that and his Levaquin was discontinued.
Discharge chest x-ray showed his lungs to be clear with a very small left apical pneumothorax.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
