Admission Date:  [**2101-11-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-11-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-3-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: 78 year old woman with history of MI, RHD, HTN and elevated cholesterol presented to outside hospital with a chief complaint of sharp SSCP (~[**7-6**]) that radiated up her neck at 0530 on [**11-3**].
The pain was not associated with N/diaphoresis/dyspnea.
She states that this pain was different from the dull chest pain that she had 1.5 years ago when she had her first MI.
She took two SL NG with minimal relief.
She called the ambulance and states that her pain began to dissipate during the ambulance ride.
Past Medical History: # Cardiac Hx: Rheumatic Heart Disease - as a child Myocardial Infarction: [**2099**] A Fib: had a few episodes after MI in [**2099**] - but not known to have AFib since OSteoporosis Hypothyroidism (THyroid nodule removed) HTN Hypercholesterolemia Appendectomy Breast Lumpectomy x 4 B/L LE vein stripping # Baseline Hct: 30 ([**2-28**]   Social History: Retired school teacher No tobacco, No EtOH  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: ADmission Physical Exam: T: 98  BP: 85/55  HR: 70s HEENT: PERRL EOMI.
No bruits Resp: Good anterior air movement (patient seen after cath  and with femoral sheath) CV: Normal S1, soft S2.
III/VI systolic murmur radiating to R carotid and heard well at RUSB and LUSB.
1+ edema   Pertinent Results: ECHO: [**2101-11-3**]: - LVEF: 70% - Marked LA enlargement - Mild symmetric LVH - Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Cath [**2101-11-3**]: - 0.9cm^2 aortic valve area with 60mmHg peak aortic valve gradient - consistent with aortic valve stenosis - 50% mid LAD - R dominant circulation - unchanged from [**2100-3-5**] .
[**2101-11-4**]: CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis: INDICATION: Asymmetric hilum on chest x-ray.
Also exclude retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Patient cannot receive IV contrast secondary to renal failure and recent cardiac catheterization.
No prior studies are available for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained without IV contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are heavy aortic calcifications and coronary artery calcifications.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pericardial effusion.
There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, in the prevascular, peritracheal, and subcarinal regions.
The largest discrete lymph node appreciated is in the subcarinal region, measuring 1.1 cm in short axis dimension.
There is lymphadenopathy of the right hilum, which is not well evaluated due to the lack of IV contrast.
The lungs are difficult to evaluate due to the degree of respiratory motion and patchy ground-glass opacity.
There is a 3-mm nodule within the right mid lung, as is seen on series 2, image 29.
There is a 3-mm nodule within the right middle lobe, as seen on image 38.
There is a 5-mm nodule within the left mid lung, as seen on image 26.
Ground glass opacity in the lungs bilaterally may represent edema.
No significant axillary adenopathy.
Within the left breast, there is a rounded soft tissue density lesion measuring 0.9 x 1.3 cm.
There is a large soft tissue density lesion on the left kidney, measuring 9.7 x 8.5 cm in greatest axial dimensions.
Other areas are higher in attenuation, consistent with soft tissue or blood.
The mass is extremely suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.
There is enlargement of the central left renal vein, which raises the possibility of involvement.
There are enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Within the mid portion of the right kidney, there is a low attenuation lesion consistent with a cyst.
No free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is residual contrast within the bladder.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
No free pelvic fluid, and no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
There is a right femoral venous catheter in place.
BONE WINDOWS: There is likely a hemangioma within the L1 vertebral body.
There is a bone island within the left inferior pubic ramus.
There are degenerative changes of the spine.
Left renal mass, incompletely characterized on this study is indicative of renal cell carcinoma.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Ground glass opacity within the lungs bilaterally, possibly representing pulmonary edema.
The lungs are otherwise not well evaluated, however, due to respiratory motion.
Soft tissue density rounded lesion within the left breast.
[**2101-11-5**]: MRI Abdomen: FINDINGS: There is an 11.0 x 11.7 x 10.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass arising from the mid left kidney.
This mass has a large necrotic center.
It demonstrates regions of signal drop out on out-of-phase sequences, suggesting intravoxel fat.
Findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma, likely a clear cell given the presence of intravoxel fat.
There is no evidence for renal vein invasion.
Of note, there is a large retroaortic left renal vein, which is formed by the confluence of 2 large extra-pelvic renal veins approximately 3.5 cm proximal to the IVC.
Large retroperitoneal collateral veins were seen as well.
Lung bases show small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
No focal liver lesions are identified.
The visualized bowel is normal, and there is no significant free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: 11.0 x 11.7 x 10.4 cm heterogeneous mass arising from the left kidney.
Findings consistent with a renal cell carcinoma, likely clear cell type given its signal characteristics.
Probable extension into the perirenal fat and possible extension to the left posterior flank wall.
No evidence for renal vein invasion or significant lymphadenopathy.
Retroaortic renal vein fed by 2 large renal veins extending beyond the left renal pelvis.
[**2101-11-6**]: CT Head w/ contrast - NO intracranial hemorrhages or masses .
Lung nodules of this appearance and size in patients without malignancy generally represent benign findings; however, in the presence of a large left renal mass, the nature of these lesions are indeterminate.
2) 11 cm extremely vascular left renal mass.
3) Borderline mediastinal lymph node enlargement.
No hilar adenopathy.
4) 1.7 cm wide aspiration or pneumonia, right lung apex.
4) Heavily calcified aortic valve and mitral annulus, coronary atherosclerosis.
[**2101-11-8**]: STORY: PT WITH L RENAL MASS ,CONCERNING FOR RCC ,ASSESS FOR METASTATIC LESIONS  INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections.
Increased tracer uptake is seen approximately at T1, which is consistent with a collapsed vertebra as seen on a recent CT examination.
Scoliosis and degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osseous metastatic disease  Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with history of MI, rheumatoid heart disease presented with aortic stenosis in AFib who was found to have a newly discovered renal mass on AbdCT.
# Cardiac: On admission from OSH, patient was sent for cardiac cath which revealed: 1.
Moderate one vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Severe aortic stenosis.
2+ mitral regurgitation.
She also had an Echocardiogram which demonstrated: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Urology was consulted and she had staging of her mass with Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis imaging.
It was felt that she had a renal cell carcinoma.
Urology felt that her aortic stenosis needed to be fixed before any abdominal resection of the mass could be attempted.
Anticoagulation was held for surgery and [**12-29**] renal mass and question of bleeding into mass (as patient had a small Hct drop).
Her ASA was increased to 325 daily for some anticoagulation .
#Ischemia: - No significant ischemia by cath on [**11-3**] - 50% occ of LAD - on ASA, Statin, BB .
#Pump: - Patient wanted to wait until after [**Holiday **] to undergo surgery for her aortic stenosis.
Bone Scan for metastasis work up was negative.
Afebrile for 72 hours prior to discharge.
# Respiratory Distress: - This was likely a mixture of poor forward flow and fluid overload.
# Hypothyroidism: - cont synthroid .
