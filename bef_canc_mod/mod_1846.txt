End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, Monday, Wednesday and Friday 3.
Diabetic retinopathy 4.
Hypertension 5.
Phoslo  ALLERGIES:  Minoxidil causing facial swelling  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient describes being in his normal state of health until the day of admission when he felt unwell and dizzy while at work.
The patient then became confused and disoriented and was given some juice and crackers for presumed hypoglycemia.
The patient was also noted to have some slurred speech and then developed some vomiting and a headache which was rated at 9 out of 10.
He underwent a computerized tomography scan which demonstrated no intracranial pathology.
The patient had a recent echocardiogram on [**2154-5-30**] which demonstrated left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had an ejection fraction of over 50% and trace mitral regurgitation.
He also had a stress test in [**2152-10-5**] which was an exercise stress test which he was able to perform for 11 minutes achieving 80% of his maximum heart rate and had to stop secondary to fatigue.
He at that time was also noted to have an ejection fraction of 54% with no wall motion abnormalities.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was in no apparent distress and/or somewhat somnolent.
His neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy and he had no meningismus.
He did not have any carotid bruits.
He had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
He had the presence of a right bruit in his forearm fistula.
His chest film showed him to be in mild pulmonary edema.
The Neurology Service was consulted after the patient was noted to have some left-sided weakness.
In addition to left-sided weakness, the patient was also found to have some left-sided neglect and a left hemianopia.
The patient also ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Due to the nature of the patient's hypertensive crisis the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance imaging scan of his kidneys to rule out renal artery stenosis.
This was performed on [**9-10**] which showed him to have no abnormality in his renal artery stenosis or with his renal arteries.
The patient's neurologic symptoms resolved two to three days prior to discharge from the hospital.
His echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of over 60% with mild left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy and normal valves.
