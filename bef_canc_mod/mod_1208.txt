In the ED, had BNP newly elevated to 279 and had CXR showing increased interstitial markings, read by radiology as pulmonary vascular congestion without focal consolidation.
He was then placed on home BiPAP settings and had desats to 70s which improved with discontinuation of BiPAP and increased suplemental oxygen.
Patient himself denied confusion or altered sensorium.
Despite no new hypercarbia, given increased somnolence and worsening hypoxemia, transfer to the MICU was deemed appropriate.

Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-5-8**] no diagnostic change.
Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.
Indistinct and engorged pulmonary vasculature is new from [**2137-5-8**], due to mild pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

# Acute on Chronic Hypoxia: Patient with chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia and presented with acute hypoxia to 70% on RA not improving with BiPaP.
Chronic etiologies include obesity hypoventilation, OSA, COP, and possibly diastolic CHF.
CXR notable for increase vascular congestion likely secondary to chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia as this has been shown to cause sodium retention due to aldosterone imbalance.
Since patient does not use supplemental oxygen at home to improve his hypoxia, and ?using BiPAP consistently, he was likely retaining more salt and water causing him to become more volume overloaded causing worsening hypoxia.
Fluid homeostasis in chronic obstructive lung disease.)
On ICU day 2 patient continued to have oxygen requirement and received an additional 60 mg IV lasix.
On transfer to medicine floor, total cumulative fluid balance was almost negative 6 L. Patient also had hypokalemia and was started on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
# Hypokalemia: On IV lasix plus aldosterone/renin imbalance in setting of chronic hyercapnia (see citation above and paper in chart).
# Metabolic Alkalosis: Chronic, secondary to OSA/obesity hypoventilation.
# LE Edema: Secondary to fluid retention from above process plus chronic lymphedema.
Pain was controlled with home oxycontin and oxycodone and IV dilaudid prn breakthrough.
He was also given triamconolone cream for venous stasis changes and legs were wrapped with ACE bandages as much as possible.
# Chronic anemia - Continued iron and B12.
# Depression - History of passive SI.
# Hyperlipidemia - Continued simvastatin.
# BPH  Continued finasteride and tamsulosin.
# Chronic Pain: on pain contract at [**Company 191**].
Patient also received IV dilaudid for lower extremity pain as needed to relieve pain from his lymphedema while he is being diuresed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with swelling in your legs and low oxygen levels as well as very low potassium levels.
We gave you potassium and medications to remove fluid from your legs and your lungs and your symptoms improved.
