Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2115-9-6**] after being admitted with shortness of breath in the setting of missed hemodialysis secondary to a clotted AV graft.
Her course was complicated by a PEA arrest following intubation from which she recovered.
At 10 pm last night, pt was visited by daughter, found in bed sweating with rapid shallow breathing, foaming in her mouth, and eyes looking down.
She was found to be non-responsive however, no abnormal movement of extremities noted.
U/A was found to be positive for a UTI and pt was given a dose of 500 mg PO levaquin.
On ROS, no SOB, CP or abd pain.
Denies any diarrhea or any other GI or GU complaints.
CAD s/p NSTEMI [**5-19**], s/p PTCA/stent LCX [**2113**].
Persantine MIBI [**4-22**] without symptoms or EKG changes.
MIBI images significant for severe fixed inferior defect, EF 58%.
DM type 2, on NPH.
CHF, with mixed systolic (EF 45-50%) and diastolic dysfunction.
Severe mitral regurgitation [**2115-6-20**] 7.
H/o multiple AVF clots, s/p thrombectomies, last in [**2115-1-8**] 9.
H/o GIB in the setting of coagulopathy and NSAIDs 10.
Eosinophilic pneumonia diagnosed [**4-22**], on chronic prednisone therapy.
Anemia [**2-20**] CRF 12.
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosed in [**2113-4-18**].
COPD with PFTs with FVC 0.69 (27%), FEV1 0.46 (24%), FEV1/FVC 92%.

Distant heart sounds.
Pertinent Results: EKG: NSR, 80, nl Axis, no ischemic changes.
CXR [**2115-9-24**]- No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 69 year old female, multiple medical problems, who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] admitted with SOB in setting of missed HD secondary to clotted AV graft, complicated by PEA arrest and intubation now presents w/ obtundation, found to be hypoglycemic in the field and now transferred to MICU for persistent hypoglycemia in the ED requiring D10 gtt and q1 FS checks.
Hypoglycemia: Differential diagnosis includes excessive insulin (most likely), missed meal, worsening renal failure with resultant decrease in insulin clearance, medication induced, sepsis, or an endocrinopathy.
However, she is slightly fluid overloaded.
Adrenal insufficiency possible, as pt on steroids chronically for h/o eosinophilic PNA, however, no hypotension or other symptoms.
Pt is on bactrim which can cause hypoglycemia, but no recent medication changes.
Sepsis is another possible cause.
Pt with evidence of UTI, elevated lactate but does not meet SIRS criteria.
Lactate was also monitored and remained elevated at 2.7.
Leukocytosis: Patient has a persistent leukocytosis thought to be secondary to chronic steroids.
Elevated Troponin: Patient noted to have a history of elevated Troponins, on this admission 0.23->0.18->0.20 which flat CK.
Likely secondary to history of CPR and renal disease.
There were no EKG changes from previous.
Calcium carbonate and Paricalcitol for secondary hyperparathyroidism were continued.
Metabolic gap acidosis: Likely secondary to ESRD and elevated lactate.
CAD s/p MI: Continued ASA, ACE, BB.
H/o eosinophilic pneumonia- Continued prednisone and bactrim prophylaxis while immunosuppressed (bactrim leading to hypoglycemia low on DDx.)
DVT- h/o DVT diagnosed in [**7-23**].
PPx- PPI per outpt regimen, bowel regimen, pain regimen tapered since patient no longer having chest pain from previous CPR.
