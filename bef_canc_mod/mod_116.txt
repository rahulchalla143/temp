Occlusive and nonocclusive lobar, segmental and subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli involving bilateral upper and lower lobes, with significant clot burden and possible right heart strain.
Left lower lobe small peripheral opacity likely represents a pulmonary infarct.
Stable right apical pulmonary scarring with calcifications, likely prior granulomatous disease.
Occlusive DVT in the right superficial femoral and popliteal vein, but not involving the common femoral vein.
No left lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 year-old woman presents with bilateral pulmonary emboli with evidence of right heart strain.
# Pulmonary emboli: Patient markedly hypoxic with evidence of R heart strain on CTA  secondary to multiple pulmonary emboli.
Given absence of hemodynamic instability and stable oxygenation, lysis was not performed.
Lower extremity ultrasound showed a persistent right-sided DVT.
Patient was transferred to the floor, started on warfarin and continued on heparin until INR > 2.0  Patient was weaned from oxygen and was chest pain free by the time of discharge.
Likely has some adrenal insufficiency related to that.
Given borderline hypotension and chronic prednisone use, pt was given stress dose steroids on presentation to the ICU.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Patient had a foley catheter in place during admission which was removed but she was noted to have a positive UA.
She will need a follow up CBC [**12-4**] to confirm resolution of mild leukocytosis.
