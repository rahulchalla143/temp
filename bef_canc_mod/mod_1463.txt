Severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Left sided filling pressure is elevated with no evidence of mitral stenosis.
There is moderate pulmonary hypertension (wedge tracing is confirmed by obtaining oxygen saturation).
Selective angiography of this right dominant system reveals that the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, the left circumflex artery, and the right coronary artery did not show flow-limiting obstruction.
Graft angiography reveals patent grafts to OM1 and RCA with competitive flow.

Small LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

MITRAL VALVE: Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade (however no subcostal views obtained).
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung.
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion but otherwise stable postoperative chest.
Went into rapid AFib on POD #3, heparin continued , and amiodarone drip started.Cardiology/EP consult done and diltiazem drip started.
