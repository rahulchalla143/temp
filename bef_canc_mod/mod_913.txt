History of Present Illness: HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 72 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p IMI [**2102**](LAD had 50% stenosis after D1, LCX had 70% OM2 stenosis, RCA with proximal DES) presents with chest pain 2 hours.
Per the patient, she was taking a shower when she noticed some chest tightness at 8:30am.
She took some nitroglycerin and her chest pain seemed to resolve.
15 minutes later the pain returned and continued to progress.
She described it as a severe pressure, substernal that radiated to both arms (L>R).
Her EKG revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads and reciprocal depressions in the lateral leads.
In the cath lab, she underwent angiography which showed no obstructive disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCX.
It did show 99% stenosis of the distal RCA secondary to a clot.
They also noticed a mid RCA lesion of approximately 90%.
In the CCU, the patient remained chest pain free.
She denies any symptoms and claimed she felt much better.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

ST segment depression of one to two millimeters in leads V1-V2 and ST segment depression of two millimeters in lead aVL.
This is consistent with a large area of nterolateral, inferior and posterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-7-2**] acute injury pattern in the inferior-posterior region is new.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segements.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a promient fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-4-10**], mild inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis is seen on the current study.
Cardiac catheterization in this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LCX, and LAD were without significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the mid-portion, and a 99% stenosis with thrombus in the distal portion.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 5% residual stenosis in the mid RCA.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo woman with h/o CAD (LAD had 50% stenosis after D1, LCX had 70% OM2 stenosis, RCA with proximal DES) presents with inferior STEMI due to late stent thrombosis (4 years later), now s/p BMS x 2 in mid and distal RCA.
# STEMI: Patient with inferior STEMI that was successfully treated with thrombectomy and PCI with 2 BMS placed one in the 99% occluded distal RCA and another in the 90% occluded mid RCA lesion.
Pt also with hypotension on presentation suggestive of cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved after PCI in mid and distal RCA.
This may also have been secondary to nitroglycerin.
TTE showed normal systolic global function (EF 55%) but with inferior hypokinesis c/w IMI.
The pt had some episodes of mild ectopy with a few runs of NSVT.
The patient remained CP free since the catheterization for the remainder of the admission.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: No active issuses.
Continued gabapentin for chronic pain.
Tylenol Ex Str Arthritis Pain 500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO three times a day as needed for pain: no substitutions.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for Chest pain: take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart, call 911 if you still have chest pain after 3 tablets.
Diag 280.0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Coronary Artery Disease .
Secondary: Rheumatoid Arthritis Gastric Ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack because the stent in your right coronary artery was partially clotted and because of a new blockage in the same artery.
Please stop smoking to prevent another heart attack and to make your new medicines more effective.
Take nitroglycerin for chest pain as described in the handout.
