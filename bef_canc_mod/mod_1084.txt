Admission Date:  [**2200-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: hematemesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TIPS  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13099**] is a 64 year old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 172, VL<48) on HAART, hepatitis B cirrhosis, and variceal bleeding recently who presented to an OSH with hematemesis.
He developed acute onset of abdominal pain last night, vomiting blood, fell and hit head.
He has not been on a beta blocker as an outpatient given history of bradycardia.
No further bleeding here.
In IR, patient also had 1.5 L of ascites fluid removed as well.
Just prior to IR, patient reportedly had small episode of hematemesis but said to be hemodynamically stable.
Per IR staff, he had stable vital signs and oxygenation throughout entire procedure.
On arrival to the ICU, he appeared to be in no apparent distress and his vital signs were: T 96.8F, BP 117/54, HR 77, RR 22 and O2 sat 100% on 6L NC.

RADIOLOGY: [**2200-3-18**] CT HEAD - FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures or edema.
There are no fractures.
There are calfications of the cavernous internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
CT A&P [**2200-3-18**] - INDICATION: 64-year-old male with upper GI bleed, referred for evaluation of portal venous anatomy prior to TIPS.
Prior ultrasound dated [**2200-3-9**] and angiography from attempted TIPS on [**2200-3-13**] were reviewed.
FINDINGS: Visualized lung bases demonstrate no acute abnormality, including no consolidation or effusion.
There are no pulmonary nodules or masses identified.
There are aortic valvular calcifications.
The liver is somewhat nodular in contour, with a cirrhotic appearance.
There is moderate simple ascites (without evidence of hemoperitoneum) and splenomegaly with the spleen measuring up to 14 cm in long axis, compatible with portal hypertension.
Thickening of the gastric folds may also reflect portal gastropathy.
On arterially phased imaging, the perfusion of the liver is markedly heterogeneous.
There are no arterially hyperenhancing lesions.
On delayed imaging, there are persistent geographic, somewhat linear regions of hypoattenuation, compatible with the sequelae of recent failed TIPS.
There are no additional focal liver lesions identified.
The superior mesenteric vein and proximal portal vein are widely patent with wall-to-wall contrast opacification.
However, in the mid portal vein, extending to the portal bifurcation and into the right and left intrahepatic portal branches, there is non-occlusive thrombus identified.
The intrahepatic portal branches, particularly on the right, are attenuated, which may reflect thrombus versus limited portal flow.
There is cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
The pancreas is mildly atrophic, without pancreatic ductal dilation or focal pancreatic lesions.
Kidneys enhance symmetrically and demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
The stomach demonstrates apparent fold thickening, which again may suggest portal gastropathy.
There is diffuse colonic wall thickening and edema, though evaluation is limited by underdistention.
While this may, in the proper clinical setting, reflects colitis, it is more likely indicative of portal hypertension given the associated findings above.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy identified.
The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease, with mural thrombus and irregularity.
BONE WINDOWS: There is spondylosis in the visualized thoracolumbar spine, without suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver, with evidence of portal hypertension, including ascites, splenomegaly, and gastric/colonic wall edema.
Non-occlusive thrombus within the mid portal vein extending into the intrahepatic right and left portal veins.
Patency of the hepatic arteries, with incidental note of replaced right hepatic artery arising off the superior mesenteric artery.
Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver on arterial phase images, with geographic, somewhat linear regions of persistent hypoattenuation within the right lobe, reflecting sequelae of recent failed TIPS.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with mural thrombus, and calcification and narrowing of the ostium of the mesenteric vessels, as above.
Aortic valvular calcifications.
Brief Hospital Course: This 64M with HIV/AIDS on HAART, HBV, cirrhosis c/b esophageal and gastric varices and recent presentation for variceal bleed s/p failed TIPS returns with hematemesis now s/p successful TIPS.
He had OSH EGD with confirmed varices.
He presented to ED with recurrent hematemesis with HCT drop from recent baseline of 28 to 18.
Bleed was immediately concerning for a recurrent variceal bleed in this complicated man with known esophageal and gastric varices.
He also had prior CMV viral inclusions on biopsies.Workup to date includes negative AMA, negative ANCA and negative Alpha 1 antitrypsin.
Ferritin not indicative of hemachromatosis and recent ceruloplasmin labs still pending.
HBV and HCV viral loads negative.
She states he has had recent undetectable viral load on current combination of medications.
Esopageal Variceal Bleed s/p Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for upper GI bleeding from your esophageal varices.
Please call the Liver Center if you have any difficulty scheduling your ultrasound.
