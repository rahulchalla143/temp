She was discharged from rehab last Tuesday (3 days ago) following her last hospital admission and ever since arriving home she states that she does not have any desire to eat or drink.
She denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, dysuria, diarrhea, shortness of breath or chest pain.
She denies being depressed although she endorses most symptoms of depression, including low energy, depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep problems, and lack of appetite appetite.
She has a shower bench, a manual wheelchair, a cane, and a walker but otherwise no accommodations nor help.
The patient was last admitted one month ago for diarrhea, pain and leg weakness.
This year she also had another admission for back pain where she was found to have a fracture in T12 with no cord compression, treated conservatively with TLSO.
On that admission she also had ischemia in the inferioposterior region of the heart.
She is following up with an ophtalmologist for treatment of her cataracts next month.
The review of system is mostly positive for pain (mainly back pain), leg weakness R>L (recent MRI with no cord compression), and depressive symptoms.
Also positive for dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and difficulties to see (cataracts).

No significant change in the mild-to-moderate compression fracture of L4 and mild depression of the superior endplate of L5 as before.
Partially imaged is an enhancing lesion of the right second rib, which may represent a fracture, but if there is concern for metastases, this could be better evaluated by either plain films or CT scan.
No intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hematoma.
Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
8 mm left lower lobe nodular density warrants 6 month followup to ensure stability or resolution.
5mm left renal lesion too small to characterize and cannot be classified as a cyst and small tumor is difficult to completely exclude.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 40 yo woman with AML s/p rel allo-SCT [**10-14**] with GVHD, recent T12 compression fracture, and unstable angina, admitted from [**Month/Year (2) **] for failure to thrive.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**10-17**] due to acute respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirement.
She was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and diuresed but cont.
She was treated empirically for hospital acquired pneumonia as well as PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] continued to have BiPAP dependency.
She did eventually remove the BiPAP due to discomfort and died later that night with her family present.
There seemed to be a strong component of major depressive disorder which was impeding proper rehabilitation and progress.
This was in part due to her advanced GVHD and vertebra fractures, but it was felt that she had some potential for improvement.
3/ PAIN: She was on numerous pain medications, and she did have severe back pain caused by her vertebral fractures as well as musculoskeletal chest pain and angina pain.
her pain was exacerbated by her depression and inactivity.
Anginal pain responded to 3 SL NTG.
Musculoskeletal pain responded to morphine IV.
4/ CARDIAC: the patient initially had daily complaints of angina-like chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes were persistently negative, and she had no significant EKG changes.
We found that on occasion her chest pain was actually not cardiac, as it was easily reproducible on palpation.
Thus, she had symptoms of both vardiac and non-cardiac chest pain and was treated accordingly.
She had numerous episodes of tachycardia to 120s and cardiology was consulted.
The patient continued to have episodes of chest pain in the ICU which were treated with SL nitroglycerin and eventually with morphine drip as above.
Plain films demonstrated new fractures and MRI confirmed these findings (see report above).
