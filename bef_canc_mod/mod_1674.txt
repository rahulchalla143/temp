The patient reports he called his PCP 5 days ago with symptoms of lower extremity swelling.
He denies subjective fevers, lower extremity edema, chest pain, worsening of baseline PND or orthopnea.
There he was found to have acute renal failure with BUN and Crn at 70 and 2.3.
He was also found to have borderline low blood pressure around 70/50.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or mild edema which were present previously in the lungs are clear.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
Rightward deviation of the trachea just above the thoracic inlet could be due to displacement by a tortuous vessel or an enlarged left thyroid lobe, but has not changed.
ECHO [**11-21**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-6-6**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, s/p two ETOH ablations, s/p left ventricular septal myomectomy with MVR and AVR 2 years ago, CHF with baseline NYHA class II-III, PAF, Mobitz II heart block, pacer dependent, HTN and obesity admitted for over-diuresis and renal failure, improved with gentle fluid repletion.
# Heart failure: The patient has a history of HOCM s/p myomectomy, AI s/p AVR and MR s/p MVR, paced.
The patient does not report a history of dietary indiscretion, however seems like prior to initiation of metolazone therapy he was having worsening heart failure symptoms.
LE edema was improved from baseline.
His lasix, lisinopril and metolazone were held given his renal failure but lasix and lisinopril were restarted on discharge.
His amiodarone was continued for management of his afib and warfarin was temporarily held given supratherapeutic INR, restarted when INR was in the therapeutic range.
# ARF: His ARF was likely secondary to over diuresis with metolazone and lasix.
Pt will require lab f/u to monitor for improvement of his renal function, may also require titration of diuretic meds to manage HF while preventing recurrent ARF.
# Gout: Home colchicine was temporarily held given renal failure but restarted on discharge.
# PVD: No ulcers present currently, venous stasis changes present.
