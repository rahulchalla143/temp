[**2133-5-24**]: EGD:  Esophagus: [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears with active bleeding.
Hemostasis achieved with epinephrine injection and BICAP cauterization Stomach: Normal stomach.
[**2133-5-28**] Left foot x-ray: Interval destruction of the fifth metatarsal head, fifth proximal phalanx and distal phalanx of the third digit consistent with osteomyelitis.
[**2133-5-27**] Echocardiogram: EF 30 %, The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2133-6-3**] Cardiac catheterization: Severe three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant system.
Left circumflex had a long 60% stenosis and the RCA had 70-80% sequential high grade stenosis.
Left ventriculography was not preformed given the renal dysfunction and recent echocardiogram showing EF of 30%.
Limited hemodynamics showed slightly elevated left ventricular filling pressures with LVEDP of 21 mm Hg.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 77 year old male with Type II DM, afib on Coumadin, PVD w/ chronic foot ulcers with resolved [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, demand ischemia resulting in NSTEMI s/p cardiac cath showing 3 vessel disease, shock liver, and osteomyelitis in metatarsal of left foot s/p 3rd and 5th toe amputation being treated with imipenem.
No further episodes of hematemesis occurred throughout his hospitalization.
He had melena early after his bleed which resolved.
His diet was advanced without incident and he had no epigastric pain or emesis.
2) Dry gangrenous toes/osteomyelitis: He had an oozing ulcer at left 5th metatarsal and several areas of dry gangrene worse at the 3rd and 5th toes.
Foot x-ray revealed osteomyelitis and swab of lesions showed Enterobacter clocae resistant to b-lactam and fluoroquinolones and he was started on imipenem on [**2133-5-28**].
He had revascularization and stenting of left AT and amputation of 3rd and 5th toes.
3) Acute blood loss/chronic anemia: Patient's baseline is HCT 32-35, and it was most likely decreased secondary to acute blood loss from UGI bleed.
Since he also has some superimposed iron deficiency anemia he will follow up as an outpatient for colonoscopy as he has not had one in over 10 years.
4) NSTEMI: In context of GIB he presented with persistent dynamic EKG changes (responsive to SL NTG) following volume resuscitation.
His cardiac catheterization this admission showed severe 3 vessel disease requiring CABG.
He has no further chest pain or new EKG changes.
5) Elevated LFTs: Most likely due to shock liver in the setting of acute blood loss and MI.
LFTs trended down and are now stable and liver ultrasound did not reveal any abnormalities.
6) Type II DM: Poorly controlled with high and lows.
7)Atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of acute upper GI bleed: After initial presentation rate has been well controlled with metoprolol XL 250 mg po q day.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Non-ST elevation MI 3.
HTN 3.
Type 2 diabetes 4.
Rheumatoid arthritis   Discharge Condition: Hemetemesis resolved, Hct stable, afebrile on imipenam, INR therapeutic on coumadin  Discharge Instructions: Please monitor for chest pain and monitor creatinine for worsening renal failure.
