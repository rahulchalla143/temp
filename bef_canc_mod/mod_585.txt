She endorses worsening pain and swelling of skin surrounding the ear, but denies any other ear pain.
She denies any drainage, and denies any fevers or chills at home.
She says taht the pain started last weekend, and had started out as a pmiple on her ear.
She has never had an infection like this before on her skin.
A CT non-contrast was performed which preliminarily is read as concerning for cellulitis along the left auricle root, extending superiorly, although early malignancy otitis externa is certainly of high concern.
She also had a positive U/A, although she does have a neurogenic bladder.
For her hyperkalemia she recieved Calcium gluconate, Dextrose, and 10 U human insulin.
She is in no acute distress, and feels her pain has improved greatly since starting antiobitics.

UA dirty though urine culture with fecal contamination, history of pan-resistant Klebsiella urine infections (sensitive only to Tetracyclie).
She denied any urinary or respiratory complaints though she has neurogenic bladder and straight caths herself.
Her CXR appeared normal without evidence of consolidation.
History of C. Diff in the past, but without diarrhea and had a negative C.Diff toxin.
Based on physical examination findings of cellulitis and ear involvement ED was concerned with Malignant external otitis.
[**Last Name (un) 17610**] often reported in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as elderly diabetics.
ENT was consulted and did not think her clinical picture was consistent with malignant otitis externa.
She was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn/Cipro initially for broad coverage.
ID was consulted given her history of multiple resistant bacteria in the past.
Patient with terrible access and so Vancomycin changed to Linezolid for health care associated MRSA and PO Vancomycin started given history of severe C.Diff infections.
AOCKD: On admission to MICU patient with Acute renal failure to Creatinine of 9.4 from baseline CRF of Cr=2.
FeNa in MICU 6.77%, consistent with ATN likely related to sepsis and hypotension.
Discharged on Lantus 3am 4pm and liberal HISS .
Anion Gap Acidosis: Likely secondary to new onset kidney injury (uremia) as well as mild lactic acidosis.
Systolic CHF (Chronic, LVEF 40% in [**6-/2113**]), no acute exacerbation.
Regional hypokinesis raises suspicion for ischemic etiology.
Atorvastatin 20mg started given hyperlipidemia and high risk of cardiovascular disease.
Lipids drawn prior to discharge and her LDL was 89, good as it is LDL<100 but goal is <70 given already reduced LVEF which likely ischemic in nature.
Avoided Spironolactone while in ARF and presented with hyperkalemia on admission, should readdress as an outpatient .
Anemia: Has known renal disease, with HCT initially at baseline of 25 but trended down to 21.7.
No signs of bleed during admission.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
Pain control:  Treated initially with Dilaudid PO, but had nausea so switched to oxycodone 5-10mg PO q6 hours PRN pain.
During admission discontinued morphine opiates because of renal failure and switched to Oxycontin 10mg PO BID which is equivalent MS Contin dose.
Disp:*1 tube* Refills:*0* 5. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of an infection of your ear and surrounding skin.
Your course was complicated by low blood pressure and acute renal failure.
After antibiotics and fluids your infection improved and your renal function started resolving.
This was switched because of your kidney failure - START Oxycontin 10mg twice daily, for chronic pain - START Linezolid 600 twice daily until [**4-22**] - START Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily until [**4-22**] - START Vancomycin by mouth every 6 hours until [**4-29**] - START Carvedilol 6.25mg by mouth twice daily, for blood pressure - You should talk to your primary care doctor about starting Atorvastatin 20mg Daily, for high cholesterol - START Nephrocaps once daily, for your kidney - START Bacitracin: Apply to ear twice daily - CHANGE Insulin Lantus to 3 units each morning and 4 units at night - CHANGE sliding scale: See attached - DO NOT Take Lisinopril until instructed by your Nephrologist - No other changes were made, please continue taking as previously prescribed.
