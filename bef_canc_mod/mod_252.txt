Admission Date:  [**2151-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-9-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: neck swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Fiberoptic intubation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with a h/o of DVT on coumadin and multiple myeloma with amyloid s/p allo-transplant in [**2143**] in remission until recent evidence of slow disease progression, who presents with chief complaint of pain with swallowing since yesterday evening, accompanied by hoarse voice.
She denies any difficulty breathing.
She states that she is able to swallow liquids with some difficulty but is unable to swallow solids.
Onset of symptoms was yesterday evening with sudden onset of neck swelling, preceded by a sore throat which has since resolved.
She states that the episode of neck swelling may have been preceded by some coughing, but otherwise is unable to identify a trigger for her symptoms.
She has had two prior episodes of epiglottitis/supraglottitis in [**2145**] and [**2149**] requiring intubation.
On arrival to the ED, her VS were: T98.9, HR 103, BP 134/71, RR 12, and SpO2 95% on RA with no evidence of respiratory distress.
She was scoped by ED resident and epiglottis was visualized; reported as non-inflamed, non-beefy, and non-exudative.
ROS: She currently has no problems voiding.
She has also had hematuria since yesterday morning.
Past Medical History: 1) Multiple myeloma stage III with amyloidosis dx'd in [**2142**], s/p melphalan, vincristine, adria and prednisone and then vincristine, doxorubicin and dexa, with recurrence followed by auto BMT and then mini-allo-BMT in 99 and again with recurrence had donor lymphocyte infusion from brother in [**2145**] 2) Osteopenia s/p zometa infusions 3) HTN 4) Bladder/tongue amyloid 5) DVT [**2142**] L IJ, L sup femoral, L popliteal 6) s/p tonsillectomy 7) Supraglottitis x 2 8) Hx of disseminated herpes in [**2146**] 9) Urge incontinence  Social History: She is married and lives in [**Location 3786**], 2 children, one grandson.
No masses or palpable lymphadenopathy.
No carotid bruits on auscultation.
No suprapubic or flank pain.
Skin: Multiple papular lesions with hyperpigmentation over lower back and abdomen with satellite lesions extending over similar areas as well as inner left thigh.
Pertinent Results: 62 F with multiple myeloma with amyloid s/p allo-transplant [**2143**], received donor lymphocyte infusion [**2151-2-5**], Coumadin on DVT, here with supraglottitis and elevated INR.
1) Supraglottitis: CT neck without contrast showed a large phlegmon with 80 percent supraglottal narrowing and edema, aretinoid edema.
She was given decadron, PPI, unasyn for epiglottitis, IVIG to help with infections because of her acquired hypogammaglobulinemia from multiple myeloma.
ENT emergently assessed the patient following admission and found her to have significant supraglottic edema, edematous aretinoids, with low threshold for additional swelling.
CT neck on [**3-1**] showed improvement in swelling but still unsafe to extubate.
Per ENT recommendations, she was treated with decadron, IV diphenhydramine, and IV ranitidine as empiric therapy for allergic angioedema.
Continue to monitor respiratory status.
Infectious causes of supraglottitis possible, as are non-infectious causes in this BMT patient such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and graft-versus host disease.
C1 esterase deficiency also possible.
4) Hematuria: Urology consulted and felt her hematuria to be possibly c/w urinary obstructive symptoms, likely secondary to elevated INR.
Renal US was negative for hydronephrosis or any abnormality identified within the kidneys.
Hematuria now resolved.
7) PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen   Brief Hospital Course: 62 F with multiple myeloma with amyloid s/p allo-transplant [**2143**], received donor lymphocyte infusion [**2151-2-5**], Coumadin on DVT, p/w with supraglottitis and elevated INR.
On arrival to the floor, her primary complaint was difficulty swallowing and "gurgly" voice since last night.
She denied any difficulty breathing.
CT of her neck performed on the evening of admission revealed a large phlegmon with supraglottal narrowing and edema, aretinoid edema.
She received a transfusion of IVIG given her hypoglobulinemia secondary to multiple myeloma.
ENT emergently assessed the patient following admission and found her to have significant supraglottic edema, edematous aretinoids, with low threshold for additional swelling.
CT neck on [**3-1**] showed improvement in swelling but still felt to be unsafe to extubate.
Ultimately, patient self-extubated again on [**3-2**] and at that point it was felt safe to monitor expectantly without reintubation.
Infectious causes of supraglottitis possible, as are non-infectious causes in this BMT patient such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and graft-versus host disease.
C1 esterase deficiency was ruled out with C1 esterase functional assay WNL.
Prior to discharge, she was discovered to have multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, and all anti-coagulation plans were aborted.
3) Subdural hematomas: On the evening of [**3-6**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] complained of headache with radiation to her neck.
CT head was performed and revealed bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left, predominantly composed of acute blood but also demonstrating subacute components.
An MRI of the head was performed which revealed no lesion or focus of the bleed and stable area of hemorrhage.
Prior to discharge, a repeat CT of the head was performed, which showed interval decrease in size of extra-axial collection of the left lateral posterior fossa.
4) Hematuria: Urology consulted and felt her hematuria to be possibly c/w urinary obstructive symptoms, likely secondary to elevated INR.
Renal US was negative for hydronephrosis or any abnormality identified within the kidneys.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Epiglottitis Subdural hematoma Supratherapeutic INR Hematuria Multiple myeloma h/o DVT   Discharge Condition: Neurologically intact, alert and oriented x 3, guarded for any changes in neurologic status  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for epiglottitis, and you were intubated to protect your airway.
You were found to have a subdural bleed in your head, likely due to spontaneous bleeding while on coumadin and/or heparin.
If you experience any neck swelling or difficulty bleeding, you should seek immediate medical attention.
You should come to the emergency room immediately if you experience any changes in your vision, balance, memory, or alertness.
