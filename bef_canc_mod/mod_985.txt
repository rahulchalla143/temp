Stable appearance of the transplanted liver with markedly dilated portal veins.
No thrombus is present.
Mild-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
Development of plate-like atelectasis left lower lobe.
Kidneys without hydronephrosis and nonspecific stranding.
Segmental wall thickening and mural edema of the sigmoid colon, nonspecific in the setting of ascites.
Mild uncomplicated colitis cannot be excluded.
No rim-enhancing lesions, pneumatosis or extraluminal air.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Increased intrinsic signal abnormality within the L2-3 disc with surrounding endplate signal changes since the previous MRI of [**2161-9-19**].
Subtle soft tissue prominence is also identified, but no definite fluid collection is seen.
No evident paraspinal soft tissue prominence seen.
These findings could be due to advancing degenerative change or due to low-grade infection.
Multilevel degenerative changes are identified as above with spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 levels as well as at L2-3 level.
Right-sided pleural effusion, unchanged compared with the previous study.
No reaccumulation of the retroperitoneal fluid collection which was previously drained.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 56 year old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis/HCC s/p liver transplant ([**2156**]) with recurrent decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, diabetes mellitus type II, who was admitted for acute on chronic low back pain and was found to have coag-negative staph bacteremia and L2-3 discitis / osteomyelitis.
# GPC Bactermia: He has had several prior episodes of bacteremia requiring removal of his HD catheter.
CT abdomen pelvis on [**2161-11-4**] showed no acute findings concerning for infection.
Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible low grade discitis at L2-3.
His continued bacteremia was concerning for a persistent source of infection.
TTE and TEE showed no evidence of endocarditis or paravalvular abscess.
Gallium and bone scans showed no evidence of infection except for the region of discitis at L2-3.
He has subsequent clinical deterioration with new low grade fevers to 100.0 on [**2161-11-23**] and 100.1 on [**2161-11-26**], blood culture positive for GPCs on [**2161-11-24**], and worsening back pain with new radiation to the buttocks.
Lumbar spine plain film on [**2161-11-26**] showed progressive destructive changes.
Lumbar spine MRI with contrast on [**2161-11-27**] showed increased collapse of the superior endplate of L3 and an epidural soft tissue mass spanning L2 and L3, which most likely reflects a phlegmon and causes moderate to severe canal encroachment.
# Left Flank Erythema: He had significant leakage from a prior paracentesis site noted on [**2161-11-17**] with some flank swelling from subcutaneous fluid.
He has continued to have symptoms in this area.
Abdominal wall US on [**2161-11-28**] did not identify any drainable fluid collections.
# Back pain: He has acute on chronic back pain, which was his initial reason for presenting to the ED.
Prior MRI on [**2161-9-20**] showed lower lumbar levoscoliosis with severe spinal canal stenosis and severe degenerative disc, endplate, and facet joint disease.
Spine Xray on admission did not show any acute fracture.
CT abdomen and pelvis did not show any acute changes.
A Pain Service consult was called and did not believe that a procedural intervention would be helpful, though TENS may be useful as an outpatient.
Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible low grade discitis at L2-3.
Later gallium and bone scans were consistent with an infection at this location.
His back pain on [**2161-11-21**] was significantly worse after walking to the bathroom and he required additional pain meds for the first time in many days.
His back pain has worsened since then with new radiation to the buttocks.
# Altered mental status:  He was in grade III encephalopathy on transfer to the liver service, stuporous and unable to give more than single word answers to questions.
His initial MS changes were most likely due to medication effects (received Dilaudid 1 mg IV and Lorazepam 3 mg IV total over 24 hours for back pain).
Infection was likely contributing, particularly given his associated leukocytosis with left shift and persistent GPC bacteremia.
Baseline hepatic encephalopathy from from decompensated liver disease was also a likely contributor.
Diagnostic paracentesis on admission showed no evidence of SBP, and subsequent therapeutic paracentesis has also showed no evidence of SBP.
# Hyponatremia:  He was hyponatremic on admission with Na 125, which largely resolved after HD.
It is likely due to his underlying cirrhosis, but SIADH from severe pain may also have played a role.
He has been mildly hyponatremic at various times during his admission.
# ESLD:  He was transplanted in [**2156**] for HCV cirrhosis, with subsequent HCV recurrence and cirrhosis of the transplanted liver.
# Adrenal Insufficiency: He has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is on chronic Hydrocortisone 10 mg PO QAM and 5 mg PO QHS.
# Diabetes mellitus, type II:  He was previously well controlled on his home regimen of NPH 55 units [**Hospital1 **] and Humalog sliding scale.
He had an early session on [**2161-11-5**] prior to HD catheter removal and an HD holiday.
With his recurrent bacteremia on [**2161-11-24**], his new tunneled catheter was pulled on [**2161-11-28**].
Difficulty weaning off ventilator for one week due to fluid overload.
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] course # 2: On the floor, patient was initially afebrile with no leukocytosis.
He was continued on linezolid and ciprofloxacin was started empirically for SBP prophylaxis.
There was a pararenal collection of fluid which was drained and culture negative.
Multiple paracentesis were negative for infection, but given continual leukocytosis, fever, and mental status changes, patient was kept on linezolid, ceftriaxone, and po vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage.
His continued to develop encephalopathy and lactulose doses had to be closely titrated.
Transplant Surgery/SICU course  Patient was transferred again to the ICU on [**1-10**] under the transplant team for worsening lactic acidosis up to 12.6.
He had a CT scan demonstrating no evidence of bowel ischemia and stable ascites.
Linezolid was d/c'd for possible association with lactic acidosis and was changed to tigecycline for SBP coverage.
Upon transfer to the ICU pt had mild bloody emesis, so an NGT lavage was performed and was positive.
An EGD on [**1-11**] demonstrated hypertensive gastropathy with friable mucosa, but no local site to intervene.
He needed to be intubated for the EGD and was kept intubated for aspiration risks given the amounts of blood in the stomach.
