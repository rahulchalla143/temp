Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with Mast Cell Degranulation presented with recurrence of MCD in setting of R wrist pain and swelling, with worsening airway edema.
# Mast Cell Degranulation: The patient's symptoms were similar to prior episodes, some of which have been associated with infections, but worse airway edema than she normally had so she admitted first to the MICU and was intubated for airway stabilization.
The pt described Mast Cell Degranulation attacks as always treated with IV Dilaudid, Lorazepam and Benadryl and when these medications were tapered to PO dosing the pt complained that her  pain was not being treated appropriately.
The pt reports that she was not able to drive herself home secondary to chest/epigastric pain from Mast Cell crisis, so she re-presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was readmitted.
Repeat EKG and monitoring on telemetry revealed no adnormalities, and since the chest pain had been constant since prior admission, with normal cardiac enzymes repeated 3 times, cardiac enzymes were not re-sent.
Pt was advised not to drive while taking Ativan, Dilaudid, or Benadryl.
# Right Wrist Cellulitis: Pt did not have any additional complaints about her wrist and on physical exam she had no signs of cellulitis.
# HTN: Pt's diltiazem was re-started following extubation and it was titrated up to her home dosage.
