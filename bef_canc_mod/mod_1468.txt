Per his wife, he was admitted at [**Hospital 7912**] from [**Date range (1) 106698**] for respiratory distress complicated by intubation.
He was treated for COPD exacerbation and CHF with steroids, nebs and lasix.
The evening of discharge he reports not feeling well with pain in his sinuses.
She states that he did not have chest pain but he took nitro which makes her think that he may have but did not tell her.
He stated that he felt warm and felt warm to her but she did not take his temperature.
He had shortness of breath after going to the bathroom and took a nebulizer treatment as well as ativan.
The monitor showed sinus tach.
He was given combivent MDI via ETT, IV morphine gtt for management of agitation and discomfort and Lasix 20mg IV x 1.
After discussion with the [**Hospital3 **] ICU and cardiology teams, the decision was made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management of his critical AS and respiratory failure.
He was put on a small amount of levophed for hypotension which was turned off on arrival to the ICU.
Prior discharge summary from [**Hospital3 **] reports that he was admitted for COPD exacerbation complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation.
He had a small PTX after central line placement which resolved by x-ray.
He had a blood transfusion for a HCT of 25 which was complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and ?TRALI but was extubated within 24 hours.
Per the discharge summary he was briefly on antibiotics for bilateral infiltrates but these were stopped when the infiltrates resolved.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2142-3-29**]  Results  Measurements  Normal Range Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity:  *3.1 m/sec  <= 2.0 m/sec Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient:  *38 mm Hg  < 20 mm Hg Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient:  20 mm Hg  Findings This study was compared to the prior study of [**2142-3-28**].
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-3-28**], velocities across the aortic valve have decreased slightly.
RESISTANCE 838   FICK **VALVULAR STENOSIS AORTIC VALVE GRADIENT {mmHg} 33.23 AORTIC VALVE AREA {sq-cm} 0.99  **PTCA RESULTS   AORTIC BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY  PTCA COMMENTS: Initial baseline studies confirmed severe aortic stenosis with a  calculated valve area of 0.8mm2.
With moderate difficulty, the aortic valve was crossed using a straight 0.035in wire through a 4 French [**Doctor Last Name **]-1 catheter.
After bedside transthoracic echocardiography was performed and documented mild aortic regurgitation, aortic balloon valvuloplasty was repeated with the same balloon.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe Aortic Stenosis with a calculated valve area of 0.8mm2.
There were elevated left and right sided filling pressures with a PCWP of 31mmHg and an RVEDP of 19.
The central aortic pressure was mildly elevated at 156/69 with a mean of 102mmHg.
Aortic root aortography revealed mild aortic regurgitation with a mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
Mild aortic regurgitation with a mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Evidence of apical translucency suggestive of emphysema or a bullous disease.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient had known severe aortic stenosis, which was confirmed with an echocardiogram demonstrating an aortic valve area of 0.8cm2.
He tolerated the procedure well and had no compliations associated with the procedure.
His respiratory distress was thought to be multifactorial due to decompensated heart failure in the setting of critical aortic stenosis and possibly COPD exacerbation.
There was no evidence of pneumonia on imaging.
# Hypotension: The patient transiently required vasopressor support for hypotension in the Emergency Department.
# Positive blood culture: Patient had one positive blood culture growing Coag (-) staph that was thought to be a contaminant as the patient had no signs or symptoms of infection.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tab Sublingual q 5 minutes as needed for chest pain.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
