Admission Date:  [**2142-5-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-5-18**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old resident of the [**Hospital3 **] Center, with a past medical history of a left middle cerebral artery stroke from a left atrial myxoma, history of breast cancer status post mastectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis with recurrent pneumonias.
Earlier on the night of admission, the patient was noted to have increasing shortness of breath and oxygen saturations in the 80s despite nebulizers.
A chest x-ray revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate, with her urinalysis being positive.
While in the Emergency Room, she became increasingly wheezy and labored, which improved with nebulizers and 20 mg of intravenous lasix.
Left atrial myxoma status post embolus in the left middle cerebral artery, right hemiparesis and aphasia 2.
Hypertension 3.
Admitted in [**2141-8-29**] with pneumonia and right pleural effusion 4.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis (no pulmonary function tests documented) 5.
Diverticulosis, history of colonic polyp removal 6.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy in [**2133**] 7.
Hiatal hernia 9.
History of C. difficile infection 11.
Previous left proximal humeral fracture  MEDICATIONS: 1.
The neck showed accessory muscle use, no jugular venous distention.
The neck was supple, without meningismus, no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs showed diminished breath sounds and poor air movement bilaterally, with end inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination demonstrated tachycardia, regular, unable to hear rubs, murmurs or gallops.
No peripheral edema.
A urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.010/moderate blood/negative nitrates, 31 red cells, 56 white cells, occasional bacteria, and no epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray demonstrated questionable scarring of the right upper lung, with haziness in the right upper lobe fields.
CT of the chest taken in [**2141-8-29**] demonstrated right pleural effusion with consolidation.
An electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus tachycardia at 108, low voltage in limb leads, and no ischemic changes, no changes from previous electrocardiogram taken in [**2141-8-29**].
The patient had continued coverage with levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
Also the patient was treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with nebulizers and intravenous Solu-Medrol.
By day three of the hospital admission, pressors were weaned off, but the patient had periodic episodes of shortness of breath and agitation, treated with Haldol.
The patient underwent a CT angio on [**5-9**], which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Noted to have decreased mental status and less responsiveness following anxiolytics and morphine sulfate.
Head CT on [**5-9**] showed the old left MCA stroke, but no acute process.
The patient also underwent a swallowing study, which was positive for aspiration, and had to have a nasogastric tube placed in order to start feedings.
The patient was also noted to have decreased platelets, and heparin and Zantac were stopped as possible antiplatelet agents (antiheparin antibodies were sent, which were negative).
Infectious Disease:  The patient was noted to have a proteus mirabilis urinary tract infection, generally pansensitive except to ciprofloxacin.
Multiple cultures, including stool, urine, blood and a left intravenous catheter tip remained no growth to date, however, urine samples taken three days prior to discharge demonstrated urine cultures positive for yeast.
This was felt to be a result of extensive antibiotic use, and no treatment for yeast urinary tract infection was indicated at that time.
At the time of discharge, the patient was scheduled to have four additional days of ceftriaxone to treat the proteus urinary tract infection as well as proteus sepsis (cultures taken early on during the patient's admission demonstrated one out of four blood culture bottles positive for proteus.
