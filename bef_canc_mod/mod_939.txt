Admission Date:  [**2136-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-10-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for respiratory failure and delirium.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular central line placement Intubation for mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 64M with h/o AF, DM and HTN and no h/o CAD or CHF, which was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-5**] with dyspnea.
He had been experiencing chills, dry cough, and low-grade fever during the previous week.
He became frightened, and attempted to drive himself to the hospital, whereupon he had an MVA with a stationary object and hit his head.
Afterwards c/o neck pain attributed to whiplash.
In the ED, he was febrile to 101.5F, with CXR demonstrating cardiomegaly, perihilar vascular congestion and possible R infiltrate.
A subsequent CTA was negative for PE, though was a limited study, and extensive airspace disease was seen c/w ARDS vs PNA vs CHF.
He was also noted to have RLE cellulitis which, per the family, has been present for at least 5 years, and LENIs were checked, which were negative for DVT.
Head CT reportedly showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
He experienced worsening tachycardia and intermittent hypotension.
Repeat CXR demonstrated progressive infiltrates, and pt became increasingly hypoxic.
A TTE was done, demonstrated mildly reduced LV function with septal paradox, mild-mod reduced RV function of unclear etiology, and evidence of caval plethora, though pt was on PEEP.
Initial ddx for these findings included pulmonary HTN with decompensated RV or possible myocardial contusion from the MVA.
He was extubated without difficulty after 36 hours, and was satting well on 2L NC, but found to have striking delirium.
He continued to be hypertensive to 180s, and with worsening radiographic CXR findings in spite of clinical improvement.
Also with rising transaminitis with AST/ALT in 500s at time of transfer.
In the context of fever and mental status changes, consideration was given to performing LP; however, due to inadequate neurology coverage at [**Hospital3 6592**], pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival, initial labs significant for hypernatremia of 154, hypokalemia at 3.3, BUN/Cr 32/1.5, INR 5.4.
Past Medical History: 1) Atrial fibrillation, s/p cardioversion [**2132**], recurrent 2) Diabetes mellitus 3) HTN 4) Chronic "leg cellulitis", for which he uses triamcinolone cream.
5) h/o Bell's palsy [**2131**] 6) s/p MIBI [**2132**] with no perfusion defects, EF 35% by SPECT, global mild HK   Social History: Quit smoking 4ya.
No h/o drug abuse.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Initial VS: T: 99.0F BP: 179/88 HR: 80 RR: 20 SaO2: 98% 5L NC Gen: Agitated, obsese Caucasian male, lying in bed in limb restraints x 4 HEENT: PERRL, oropharynx very dry, no exudates.
No scleral icterus.
Neck: Supple, no meningismus, denies pain on passive flexion, extension, or rotation of head.
CV: [**Last Name (un) 3526**] [**Last Name (un) 3526**], II/VI apical SEM, no rubs/gallops.
No carotid murmurs.
Lungs: Coarse breath sounds throughout, crackles at bases and mid-way up both lung fields.
Abd: Obese, soft, NT/ND, no HSM, hypoactive BS Extr: 1+ LE edema bilaterally.
No cords palpated, though there is a subcutaneous nodule at right shin Skin: No rashes, though pt has several ?lipomas - on R face, R upper back, R shin.
Pertinent Results: OSH Data: [**1-5**] vanc trough 9.1 [**1-5**] BCx: No growth [**1-6**] UCx: No growth .
Increased markings and density in bilateral perihilar regions since [**1-9**] exam, extending to lower lung zone on right.
[**1-6**] chest CTA: Limited study due to bilateral effusions and infiltrate.
No emboli from visulized portions, though difficult to assess in periphery.
Also mod pleural fluid in posterior chest bilaterally.
No evidence of aortic dissection.
[**1-6**] head CT: Right maxillary sinusitis, otherwise normal head CT .
[**1-5**] LENI: No evidence of RLE DVT.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function  (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2136-1-19**] 5:07 AM Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in overall severity since [**1-18**].
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and mediastinal vascular engorgement has worsened.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
Infectious w/u has been unrevealing: CSF showed elevated total protein, but was otherwise insignificant.
On discharge, pt's mental status had returned to baseline as he was alert and oriented, conversant, without confabulations, not combative or agitated.
## Respiratory failure [**2-10**] PNA and CHF exacerbation: Apparently complication of severe pneumonia with some pulmonary edema [**2-10**] positive fluid balance from CHF.
CXR with moderately severe pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, but remaining stable.
On discharge, afebrile and normal WBC count.
No clear etiology.
No events on tele secondary to elevated calcium.
## Hypertensive urgency: Pt has remained hypertensive with SBP in 160-180 range.
- DC'd captopril given renal insufficiency and pt already on [**Last Name (un) **] - titrated metoprolol, goal to maintain MAP >60 for adequate end organ perfusion - continued on losartan, labetalol, amlodipine, HCTZ .
Long-term diabetes and HTN contributing to elevated Cr.
Hypovolemic from overdiuresis may have resulted in intravascular volume depletion.
- monitor fluid balance and urine output - monitor renal function as patient on lasix and HCTZ - renally dose meds .
Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic inflammation.
## Abnormal LFTs/?
pancreatitis: Pt developed transaminitis and had elevations in pancreatic enzymes at OSH.
In ICU, liver enzymes continued to improve, no abdominal pain.
He was transiently hypotensive at OSH, so liver and pancreas dysfunction could represent may have been secondary to hypoperfusion.
Metformin discontinued due to renal insuffiency and risk of lactic acidosis, as well as contraindication in patient's with CHF -- amaryl and byetta restarted on discharge .
- PIV .
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
