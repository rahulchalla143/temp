)Respiratory Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: 69yo woman with PMH as below which includes CAD s/p MI/CABG, A-fib on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2128-2-13**] with fever, shortness of breath and cough.
She was diagnosed with a LLL pneumonia and initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithro.
Her respiratory status worsened, she was transferred to their ICU and intubated for respiratory failure.
Echocardiogram showed a normal EF and BNP was equivocal making cardiogenic pulmonary edema less likely as a cause for her resp failure.
Her status improved until [**2128-2-22**] when she became acutely hypotensive and was noted to have a drop in hematocrit from 34 to 25 with new abdominal distention.
CT revealed a large abdominal/pelvic mass thought to be a large hematoma and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt.
ICU course was remarkable for episodes of hypertension requiring labetalol and nitroglycerin gtts.
Surgery had been consulted for the hematoma and recommended only monitoring.
Blood cultures from [**2-26**] were [**2-3**] positive for VRE from an arterial line.
Antibiotics were altered on [**3-2**] from Vanco to linezolid given the continued fevers and antibiotic resistance profile of the enterococcus.
The patient's mental status waxed and waned in the ICU prompting a head CT that was negative for bleed on [**2-26**].
The ICU team was called to evaluate the patient today secondary to worsening mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
There had been concern for possible CHF as the cause of her declining respiratory status on the floor and was diuresed with 20mg iv furosemide x 2 on [**3-2**] and 20mg iv furosemide x 1 on [**3-1**].

No evidence of acute infarction.
Apparent sinus mucosal thickening likely due to her previous intubated state.
Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification.
Minimal chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts.
Patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs, probably representing edema due to CHF.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusion.
Consolidative opacity in left lower lobe, which can represent early pneumonia, however, this can also be edema.
Somewhat nodular opacities in right loer lobe, which cannot be further evaluated with the presence of edema.
Low density lesion in the kidney as described above.
2) New upper lobe infiltrates right greater than left.
[**3-9**] C-Spine No fracture or malalignment is identified of the cervical spine.
Degenerative changes are noted at multiple levels, most prominent in the lower cervical spine.

There is mild to moderate loss of intervertebral disc space at C5/6 and [**7-6**].
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
EMG [**3-4**]   Complex, abnormal study.
Clinically, this is consistent with an acute quadriplegic or critical illness myopathy.
Notably, there are, additionally, severe abnormalities of activation involving both upper and lower extremities, which indicate the presence of a superimposed central or upper motor neuron process contributing, in large part, to the patient s weakness.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-3-13**] Stable CT appearance of the brain, allowing for limitations due to head motion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
IVC GRAM/FILTER [**3-14**] Successful placement of retrievable recovery IVC filter inferior to the level of the renal veins via right common femoral access  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C [**3-14**] ) A large, extraperitoneal heterogeneous mass representing a hematoma is seen arising from the left rectus abdominis muscle posteriorly.
Additionally, there is a smaller hematoma within the right rectus abdominis muscle.
No free fluid is seen within the abdomen.
2) Nonspecific areas of parenchymal consolidation are seen within the left lung base, which likely represent aspiration.
Several foci of ground glass opacity tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] changes may represent non-specific inflammatory change.
Echo [**3-15**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2128-3-3**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
[**2128-3-13**] Lower Ext U/S No evidence for DVT  [**2128-3-13**] CXR 1) Increased left lower lobe opacity, which can represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
2) Mild CHF versus volume overload.
Hematoma: Surgery was consulted and felt that the mass was likely a hematoma, which would require close monitoring due to concerns over infection.
Initially, the mass caused the patient to become hypotensive while lying on her R side, which resolved by discharge.
HTN: The patient remained fairly hypertensive following admission, and at one point required a NTG and then labetolol drip.
Respiratory failure: Pt was extubated without complications.
Course on Floor: [**0-0-0**]  In summary, this is a 69yo female with hx of respiratory failure in the MICU, CAD, Afib( was on Coumadin), RA, HTN, and r adrenal adenoma presents who from OSH w/ PNA, supratherapeutic INR, and abdominal mass concerning for rectus sheath hematoma.
Neuro: MS slowly improving, still displaying signs of delirium but intermittently lucid and following commands.
MS change possibly secondary to lacunar stroke, embolus from AFIB, or benzos/opiates given for purpose of intubation.
Could be secondary to resolving hematoma or infected A-line.
[**2-26**] cx were positive for staph and enterococci.
Portable Chest xray on [**2128-3-2**] showed a resolving PNA in LLL.
On [**2128-3-3**], patient displayed respiratory distress with ABG CO2 of 64.
Subsequently the patient displayed decreased resp ability and was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2128-3-3**].
Given the patient's tachycardia and dyspnea, a r/o PE CTA was ordered which was positive for PE.
The CTA also revealed evidence of bilateral upper lobe infiltrates.
Of note the patient had intermittent periods of hypoxia thought to be secondary to agitation.
A CXR on [**3-11**] revealed no change from prior studies, only a slight exacerbation of the LLL atelectasis present in prior films.
Neuro: Neurology was consulted on [**2128-3-3**] and felt that patient's mental status decline was secondary to a toxic-infectious-metabolic etiology.
The MRI revealed no evidence of infarctions.
On physical exam neurology also reported the patient as being areflexic/ quadriplegic with a positive babinski sign on the right side.
The patient was placed in a soft [**Location (un) 2848**] J Collar and MRI of the Cervical Spine was ordered in order to rule of spinal cord compression.
Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and report of difficult intubation, and an inconclusive spine MRI, a CT myleogram was ordered which revealed possible C4-C5 compression .
The etiology of the quadraplegia was also thought to be secondary to ICU neuropathy.
A C-Spine CT and C-SPine xray revealed no fractures, stenosis, or compression of the cervical spine.
Only degenerative changes were displayed.
There is a question of enlarged septum that will require follow up as an outpatient.
Therefore it is possible that mild CHF is contributory to her pulmonary status.
Chest CT on [**2128-3-5**] revealed some degree of CHF with bilateral ground glass opacities, pulmonary edema, a small left pleural effusion and L base consolidation which could be edema.
Throughout the hospital course after transfer from the MICU, the patient occassionaly became tachycardic into the 110s-120s.
Serial EKGs revealed no evidence of MI, ischemia, or arrythmia.
However, there was a small troponin leak of .04 during this period.
It was thought that fever could be secondary to empyema, but CT ruled out.
On [**3-7**] she had a positive UA and as a result the foley catheter was changed and UA repeated, which was negative.
The patient remained afebrile until the afternoon of [**3-11**] when she spiked a temp of 101 which subsequently resolved.
HTN: Patient has labile HTN being controlled on HCTZ, Metropolol and Captopril.
MICU Course [**3-12**]- [**3-16**]  This is a 69yo female with hx of respiratory failure in the MICU, CAD, Afib( was on Coumadin), RA, HTN, and r adrenal adenoma presents who from OSH w/ PNA, supratherapeutic INR, and abdominal mass concerning for rectus sheath hematoma.
She was tx to the floor on [**2128-3-1**] and tx back to the MICU on [**2128-3-3**] for decreased respiratory effort secondary to dose of dilaudid.
Patient returned to floor on [**2128-3-5**] and subsequently retransfered to the MICU for respiratory distress, mental status changes and a fever on [**2128-3-12**].
Neuro: MS slowly improving, still displaying signs of delirium but intermittently lucid and following commands.
Neuro suggests MS change secondary to ICU neuropathy or benzos and opiates given during intubation.
Neuro reports that MS secondary to toxic-metabolic-infectious process.
Some degree of MS change thought to be secondary to UTI which developed during floor course [**Date range (1) 108273**].
Patient was given haldol prn overnight for hallucinations and is now on standing seroquel.
On [**2128-3-21**] patient was AOX3 but demonstrated some degree of paranoia .
Fever: Patient remained afebrile while in ICU .
UCX on [**3-21**] was positive for Klebsiella Pneumo sensitive to Meropenem.
CVS: CT Chest shows CHF with mild Pulmonary edema.
CXR on [**3-18**] showed LLL PNA vs atelectasis.
Heme: During MICU course ([**Date range (1) 109553**]), patient had abdominal CT revealing increasing abdominal hematoma, with HCT drop of 10.
While no DVTs or Pelvic thrombosis were noted on abd/pel CT or lenis, IVC filter placed and patient now off heparin and coumadin.
Patient s/p transufsion for HCT drop while in MICU.
Resp: Sat'ing well on room air, weaned slowly from oxygen, has history of bilateral PE was on heparin/coumading, now with IVC filter secondary to HCT drop and abdominal hematoma.
Need to keep HOB elevated as risk of aspiration PNA.
CXR on [**3-18**] revealed LLL PNA vs atelectasis slightly increased from prior studies.
[**3-18**] bilateral lower ext u/s revealed no evidence of DVT .
