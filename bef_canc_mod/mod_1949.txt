She has had approximately 14 episodes of diarrhea per day and these have become less frequent today.
Also had nausea but no vomiting.
Pt states she has been feeling more fatigued since these symptoms started and has had a nonproductive cough for 2 days.
Also endorses chills and decreased appetite.
CXR was consistent with volume overload and suggestive of RML pna.
Renal was consulted and recommended emergent HD for hyperkalemia with associated EKG changes.
On the floor, the patient has a slight headache, but otherwise is asymptomatic.
Her nausea has resolved and her diarrhea is improved.

Otherwise, the widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
Unchanged small left pleural effusion, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 F w/ ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant in [**2173**] on HD (TRS) through LUE AVF since [**2193**] who presented with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea admitted to ICU for emergent dialysis for volume overload and hyperkalemia.
The patient had resolution of her hyperkalemia and volume overload after HD and was transferred to the floor.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient was found to have K 7.4 with prolonged QRS and LBBB.
Hyperkalemia felt most likely due to missing HD on day prior to admission.
Underwent emergent dialysis with normalization of her potassium level and QRS narrowing back to baseline.
# Volume overload: Likely related to missing HD due to acute illness.
Oxygen requirement of 2L was no longer needed after removal of excess fluid.
Due to patient's anuria, she is dependent on HD and importance of maintening dry weight can not be emphasized more clearly.
# Hypoxia: Oxygen requirement of 2L on admission.
Due to chest x-ray suggestive of questionable right middle lobe pneumonia, was started on vancomycin, cefepime and levaquin in setting of report of chills and cough for 2 days prior to admission.
Similar opacity on prior films has fluctuated with volume status.
Given lack of leukocytosis and fever as well as resolution of oxygen demand after HD, antibiotics were discontinued upon transfer to the floor.
She remained afebrile with minimal intermittant cough, felt to be non-infectious in nature.
# Diarrhea: Symptoms improved over hospital course.
Lack of fever or leukocytosis, and benign abdominal exam, made C. diff unlikely, so this was not checked.
#Troponinemia: Likely related to renal failure in the setting of HD.
Patient denies chest pain.
# HLD: Continued statin.
# Depression: Continued Celexa.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: * INR - GOAL 3.0-3.5 for mechanical valve.
PO once a day as needed for constipation.
12. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Senna Concentrate 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day as needed for constipation.
19. epoetin alfa  Injection at dialysis   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyperkalemia Subtherapeutic INR   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to electrolyte abnormalities after you missed a dialysis session due to a gastrointestinal illness.
Here, you underwent urgent HD to correct your high potassium and signs of fluid overload.
