DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Perforated appendicitis, status post appendectomy and exploratory laparotomy, hypovolemia, acute renal failure HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman who had complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for two to three days prior to admission.
The abdominal pain continued to progress and localized to the right lower quadrant.
The patient had no history of bloody bowel movements or otherwise change in bowel habits.
No masses or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Significant tenderness in the right lower quadrant with positive peritoneal signs.
No focal or sensory motor deficits.
Admission CT revealed a focal area of fat stranding, free fluid and extraluminal gas in the right lower quadrant.
These findings are consistent with a perforated appendicitis or other perforated viscus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy and was found to have a perforated gangrenous appendix.
There were no complications during the operation.
Later in the evening, on postoperative day number one, the patient had issues with a subjective feeling of shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray showed elevation of both hemidiaphragms.
Her subjective symptoms of shortness of breath and objective slight decrease in oxygen saturation returned with the chest physical therapy, Albuterol nebulizers, and ambulation.
There were also some difficulties with electrolyte maintenance.
It was decided not to continue the patient on outpatient antibiotics given her white count and the fact that she had been afebrile for more than 24 hours prior to discharge.
