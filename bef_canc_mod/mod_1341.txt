no m/r/g b/l diffuse rhonchi, +exp wheeze +midline laparatomy scar, bandage in place.
no hepatomegaly.
No focal lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of transplanted liver with patent hepatic vasculature.
ECHO 1.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
2.There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-7-29**], the pericardial effusion appears slightly increased   Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo m w/ Hep C/HCC cirrhosis, HIV, recurrent c diff, s/p liver xplant in [**1-21**] with extended post-transplant course, transferred for mild resp distress.
Pt's respiratory distress initially improved dramatically with aggressive chest PT.
infiltrate assoc w/ R pleural effusion and elev wbc.
ARF - ulytes c/w prerenal etiology.
Altered mental status- felt to be [**12-20**] liver dz, renal failure, and pna.
S/p liver transplant -prograf held following initial transfer due to elev levels.
Diarrhea/c diff- on transfer was on standing loperamide and vancomycin taper.
on  transfer loperamide held, pt w/o diarrhea.
pt non-compliant with NGT placement.
EGD consistent with cultiple acute superficial ulcers 3-10mm were found in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum.
There were stigmata of recent bleeding.
Pt was aggressively fluid resusciated and only transiently required pressors.
A dialysis catheter was placed in the attempt to remove fluid as pt anasarcic and in persistent renal failure.
