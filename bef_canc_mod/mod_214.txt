The pt reported that for the last several months she had intermittent dizziness predominantly when she was turning or leaning to the right side.
She reported that every now and then she falls down when she turns her whole body or only her head to the right side.
She also reported a cough over the prior several days that was a little bit more than usual and was productive of yellowish sputum.
She denied any SOB, CP, myalgias, arthralgias, fever, chills or nightsweats.
She also denied any abdominal pain or change in her bowel habits, except for one episode of loose stools yesterday.

The patient's boyfriend reported also increased somnolence and decreased po intake over the week PTA.
ROS: negative for CP, SOB, abdominal pain, constipation, f/c/ns, weight loss, changes in the color of the urine or stool.
She was started on Levophed after receiving 3L NS without significant response in her BP, and she received 4mg of Dexamethasone.
A CXR was read as normal, however a repeat one after CVL placing was concerning for pulmonary congestion.

STUDIES: [**3-4**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.
As on prior, linear atelectasis versus scar noted at the right lower lung.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no pneumonia or heart failure.
There is atelectasis at the lung bases.
No focal consolidation or pulmonary edema is noted .
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Otherwise, probably no significant change.
Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Low voltages in the precordial leads.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2186-3-7**] 9:34 AM This study is limited due to marked rotation of the patient.
Scar or atelectasis in the bases bilaterally are very mild and unchanged.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis are new.
Cardiomediastinum is unchanged but note is made that the patient is very rotated.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2186-3-10**] 10:08 AM Opacification at the left lung base has improved, consistent with clearing atelectasis or even earlier aspiration.
Linear atelectasis persists at the right base.
Feeding tube passes to the region of the pylorus or proximal duodenum and, as before I see no weighted tip at the end of the tube which I discussed with the house officer caring for this patient to exclude separation of the tip.
CT BRAIN PERFUSION  [**2186-3-9**] 1:21 PM CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute infarction.
No fracture is identified.
CT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps appear normal with no evidence of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow, or reduced blood volume.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenoses.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
THE HEART WAS MONITORED BECAUSE DISORDERS OF HEART RHYTHMS [**Month (only) **] PRODUCE NEUROLOGICAL COMPLAINTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS SEIZURES, WHEN SYMPTOMATIC, [**Month (only) **] PRODUCE CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS.
FINDINGS: ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow background with most frequencies  ranging up to 6.5-7 Hz, and there were still frequent bursts of generalized delta slowing.
No epileptiform features or electrographic seizures were seen in this segment of the recording.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clear epileptiform features.
They showed some rhythmic background activity and movement artifact, but there were no electrographic seizures.
It showed the same moderately encephalopathic background at the beginning.
The background was a bit better, but there were some bursts of generalized slowing.
There was some movement artifact around the time of the  pushbutton activation, but there was no electrographic seizure.
By video, the patient appeared to arouse somewhat from sleep and have some head and chest motions as if choking or coughing.
The EEG showed  movement artifact but no electrographic seizure.
They did not show evidence of electrographic seizure.
Routine sampling and automated detections showed no epileptiform  features.
It showed a mildly slow encephalopathic background at the beginning, with some improvement over the day.
There was some superimposed faster activity as well.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were occasional bursts of generalized delta slowing with a bifrontal emphasis.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and additional bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no clear focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
A tachycardia was noted.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2186-3-11**] 8:25 AM BRAIN MRI: There is no evidence of mass, midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Mild prominence of sulci is noted.
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
No evidence of acute infarct on diffusion images.
IMPRESSION: No abnormal enhancement or acute infarct identified.
No other aneurysms greater than 3 mm in size are seen.
There is no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo female with hypothyroidisim, MDS v. ETOH bone marrow toxicity, history of frequent falls and possible seizure disorder who presented with complaint of frequent falls and dizziness and found to have early urosepsis.
On the floors she developed progressive weakness with R arm tremor and L facial droop and worsened mental status, with likely seizure observed with R-sided gaze deviation on [**3-9**].
# Frequent Falls/weakness/AMS- The patient has chronically had frequent falls, and had been evaluated in past and thought her falls were due to peripheral neuropathy from ETOH.
While on the floors she initially had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] generalized weakness on exam with intermittent R arm tremor, and intention tremors and possible L facial droop.
At that point she was thought to be either encephalopathic from infection, withdrawal and/or electrolyte disturbance (she had low magnesium) or having seizure, but it took some time to obtain an EEG.
She was monitored on a CIWA scale but this was discontinued due to low suspicion after a few days.
On [**2186-3-9**] she had what appeared to be a seizure on [**2186-3-9**] with R gaze deviation and brief period of unresponsiveness.
She had a negative Head and Neck CT/CTA w/wout contrast.
MRI head/c-spine showed incidental finding of 3mm ACOM aneurysm, otherwise no focal findings.
EEG 24hrs showed no seizures, but some encephalopathic background.
However, given her response to dilantin it is felt she has a seizure disorder which likely explains her falls.
# Neck stiffness/HA: The patient had neck stiffness and HA throughout the hospital course.
Per neuro recs we added flexeril as well as a soft cervical collar for comfort.
She was negative for influenza.
She did spike a fever to 100.6 on evening of [**3-9**], but CXR was negative for pneumonia (was at aspiration risk) and she was not started on antibiotics.
She has been afebrile since.
# Hyperthyroidism: The patient had tremors and slight proptosis with low TSH and increased Free T4.
# ARF: The patient developed ARF on admission which was likely prerenal in the context of early sepsis and poor po intake.
# Elevated Tylenol level on admission: The patient reported taking Propoxy-N/ADAT on the day of admission which brought her level outside the range of toxicity, no NAC was administered.
Macrocytosis likely due to ETOH, recent B12 WNL.
Pt has had swallowing difficulties in the past.
She had weakness/difficulty swallowing early in hospitalization (failed S+S and triggered [**3-7**] after choking on pancakes).
The patient was hypoalbuminemic, no proteinuria, likely due to malnutrition.
# PPX: Hep sc, bowel regimen, PPI (chronic) .
# Dispo: Rehab with outpatient neuro f/u .
Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for neck stiffness.
Urinary tract infection 3.
Generalized weakness 4.
Acute renal failure 7.
Macrocytic anemia   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vitals stable, A+Ox3, occasionally neck contracted to R (able to be repositioned)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of weakness and frequent falls.
You were found to have a fever and UTI which was treated for 3 days with antibiotics.
You were observed to have a seizure with R-sided eye deviation that resolved with ativan and dilantin.
