He originally presented to his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week h/o fatigue, nausea, and a 12lb weight loss over a one week period.
He further reports intermittent RUQ abdominal pain over the past week.
A RUQ U/S was performed which showed a slightly increased common bile duct diameter, but was otherwise unremarkable.
An MRCP was then performed which showed a suspicious lesion at the head of the pancreas which is concerning for pancreatic carcinoma.
no other children.
Family History: Father with liver cirrhosis from ETOH use   Physical Exam: VS - 98.7 108/60 80 16 100%RA General - lying in bed, pleasant caucasion male, jaundiced HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, icteric Neck - supple, no JVP CV - RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at LUSB Chest - good air sounds b/l; minimal scattered wheezes throughout Abd - soft, NT/ND, no caput, no hepatosplenomegaly, large healed midline scar Ext - no edema; + clubbing of fingers bilaterally Skin - jaundiced   Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2192-2-9**] U/S (at OSH) - findings suggests fatty infiltration of the liver.
small granuloma within the spleen.
[**2192-2-9**] MRCP (at OSH) -  no evidence of gallstones, borderline dilatation of common bile duct and mild dilatation of the pancreatic dict without ductal stones seen.
abnormal heterogeneous enhancing infiltrative changes are seen in the enlarged pancreatic head and uncinate process.
these changes could represent pancreatic carcinoma, but differentiation from changes due to chronic pancreatitis is difficult.
Findings most consistent with pancreatic carcinoma.
There is no biliary or pancreatic duct dilatation.
There is an accessory right hepatic artery which is encased by tumor.
No evidence of distant metastases.
Diffuse atherosclerosis.
There is marked mural thrombus present within the proximal SMA, but the distal SMA is patent.
No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Multiple foci of fat necrosis primarily involving peripancreatic adipose tissue.
presented from an outside hospital for further workup of a newly-diagnosed pancreatic mass.
A CT-A scan done here at the [**Hospital1 18**] identified a low density mass at the uncinate process; accessory R hepatic artery was encased by tumor but no evidence for distant mets.
Surgery was consulted, and an ERCP, which had been pending, was postponed to proceed with the Whipple procedure without a formal tissue diagnosis.
also presented with a transaminitis.
also presented with a normocytic anemia.
Iron studies most consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation:  Fe low normal, decreased TIBC, increased ferritin.
Because the pt's hematocrit drifted lower while in the hospital, he was transfused with 2 units PRBCs the day before surgery, which he tolerated without incident.
Post-operatively, patient became hypotensive and febrile to 103.
Epidural was stopped and patient was transitioned to a PCA for pain control.
On the evening of POD 2 patient developed increased work of breathing and de saturations into 80's.
CXR was obtained and showed bilateral lower lobe processes concerning for aspiration pneumonia vs. ARDS and pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema.
All urine and blood cultures were without growth.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued as patient required frequent suctioning for excessive mucus production.
His diet was advanced without complications.
