Admission Date:  [**2120-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-9-18**]   Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post recent coronary artery bypass graft in early [**Month (only) **] with multiple complications including atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, multiple pulmonary emboli, and poor graft flow necessitating subsequent percutaneous coronary revascularization.
He has a recent diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the lip with nodal metastases.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**Hospital3 3834**] for further management of severe C-difficile colitis and left lingular pneumonia.
The patient had been undergoing rehabilitation and receiving his radiation treatment for his head and neck cancer while residing at [**Hospital6 25759**] Home.
He had been noted to be lethargic over the course of his stay with poor appetite and occasional nausea and vomiting.
He had recently been treated for a urinary tract infection with antibiotics.
On [**9-5**], the patient noted increasing abdominal pain, distention, nausea and vomiting, accompanied by fever to 103 degrees Fahrenheit.
He also became hypotensive and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital3 3834**].
He had an extensive workup there, which ultimately revealed severe C-difficile colitis.
He also suffered some mild myocardial damage with a small troponin leak of .7 with precordial T wave inversions.
He had no evidence of perforation on his CT scan.
The patient was also determined to have a pneumonia involving the lingula, with sputum proving positive for MRSA.
Over the course of his stay at [**Hospital3 3834**] he became afebrile and eventually weaned off of pressors.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management of his C-difficile colitis and pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120-7-13**] complicated by poor graft flow necessitating percutaneous coronary revascularization, postoperative atrial fibrillation and pneumonia.
Squamous cell cancer of the lip with metastasis to the submandibular nodes.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A chronically ill appearing elderly white male with labored respirations.
HEENT sunken face, a large scab lesion was noted over his lower lip.
He had a right subclavian line recently placed without signs of obvious infection.
Lungs diffuse bilateral inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi, there was coarse crackling noted bilaterally throughout the lung fields.
2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
Abdomen was markedly distended with absent bowel sounds.
He was tender to palpation over the left lower and upper quadrants without guarding or rebound.
Chest x-ray showed left lingular infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management of his C-difficile colitis and left sided pneumonia.
He was treated with antibiotics, including oral Vancomycin and intravenous Flagyl for C-difficile as well as intravenous Vancomycin for treatment of his MRSA pneumonia.
He was also placed on Zosyn for empiric converge in case of transmural injury of the bowel leading to translocation of enteric pathogens.
He had a repeat CT scan of the abdomen performed, which showed a diffuse colitis, consistent with his history of C-difficile colitis.
There was no evidence for bowel wall perforation.
His stool culture was repeatedly positive for C-difficile infection.
It was determined that there was no immediate indication for colectomy or surgical exploration.
The patient had a tenuous respiratory status over the course of his hospitalization.
He had abundant secretions with weak cough requiring intermittent suctioning and chest physical therapy.
He showed evidence for a worsening respiratory acidosis by arterial blood gas measurement.
The patient opted for DNR/DNI status and his wishes were honored accordingly so he continued to receive intermittent suctioning and nebulizer treatments as well as broad antibiotic coverage.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary embolus.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip with metastasis.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
