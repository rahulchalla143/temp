Her wound was open with pustular exudate and granulation tissue.
Infectious disease consult suggested that the wound was the most likely cause of her infection, given a normal urinalysis, chest xray, and negative stool c. diff toxin.
Her inability to heal the left [**Known lastname 6024**] stump was likely related to constant weight bearing.
She was then transferred to the ICU for post-op monitoring, and then transferred to the floor for pain management.

CHRONIC ISSUES: # pain control - phantom limb pain as well as surgery pain.
PCA pump used while admitted for pain control.
# diabetes mellitus type 1 - glucose was difficult to control while inpatient given her variable PO intake.
# sCHF - no evidence of heart failure on this admission.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**], you were admitted for an infection in your left leg.
We discussed your leg with the [**Known lastname 1106**] surgeons and the infectious disease specialists, who felt that your infection was severe and that you would need another surgery.
Initially you were transferred to the ICU for monitoring, and then transferred back to the floor.
We managed your pain with patient controlled analgesia and that transitioned you to oral pain medications.
There was concern of an infection in the bone biopsy that was sent from your surgery, so you were sent home on IV antiobiotics  Medications: continue your home medication regimen as prescribed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] START Vancomycin orally 125mg every 6 hours for 21 days START Vancomycin IV 500mg every other day for 7 doses starting [**8-24**] STOP lisinopril  Followup Instructions: Department: INTERNAL MEDICINE When: TUESDAY [**2114-8-28**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10491**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10492**] Building: LM [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: INFECTIOUS DISEASES When: [**2114-9-6**] - 11:00am With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 32437**],MD  Name: [**Last Name (LF) 1391**], [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Location: [**Hospital1 **] Address: [**Doctor First Name **] STE 5C, [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 718**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**] When: Wednesday, [**2113-9-12**]:45AM                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10491**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 10495**]
