The patient has a history of throat cancer and status post surgery and radiation therapy.
The patient denies abdominal pain and nausea but does admit to lack of appetite.
He says his clothes are fitting loosely and has apparently lost a lot of weight in the last month or two.
Of note, the patient has old pacemaker wires in his abdomen which may complicate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
The patient is also on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and reportedly has not taken his Coumadin in three days.
The patient undergoes hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday which should be continued while in the hospital.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 15% by echocardiogram in [**2108-12-21**].
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis three times per week).
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction times two, with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the circumflex.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
History of ventricular tachycardia; status post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis secondary to amiodarone toxicity.
Status post throat cancer for which he was treated with radiation therapy.
History of colon cancer, status post colectomy.
Peripheral vascular disease with chronic lower extremity ulcer.
He has no history of tobacco, and no current alcohol use.
Chest had bibasilar crackles, and a pacemaker was noted in the right upper chest wall.
Extremities revealed bilateral pitting edema.
Venous stasis changes bilaterally.
The patient had a dressing over the left lower leg.
His toes were cool with nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
There were no electrocardiogram changes concerning for digoxin toxicity, and the patient was asymptomatic.
It was felt by the team that he was severely dehydrated due to poor oral intake over the past few weeks.
On [**3-8**], status post dialysis, the patient became hypotensive to the 70s and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit briefly for further monitoring.
The patient was admitted back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**3-10**] for hypotension refractory to intravenous fluids.
There was some confusion as to his volume status, not being clear whether he was dehydrated or volume overloaded, and with his low ejection fraction, he had been pushed off the Starling curve.
The patient initially was stable on the floor but was noted to have increasing tachypnea over [**3-17**] and [**3-18**].
An arterial blood gas was done and revealed an acidosis with a pH of 7.22, a PCO2 of 50, and a PO2 of 129 on 4 liters nasal cannula.
A STAT chest x-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion, and when compared with previous x-rays was read as increasing bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
Other issues during this hospitalization included his nutritional status.
This was changed to Nepro on [**3-19**] due to his renal failure.
There were no complications.
Infectious Disease issues included continuation of Flagyl, levofloxacin, and vancomycin for his left lower extremity ulcer.
End-stage renal disease.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%.
Peripheral vascular disease with chronic left leg ulcer infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
