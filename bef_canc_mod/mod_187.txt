Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year-old male with a history of CAD, seizure disorder, remote PE off of anticoagulation, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease with left BKA, Interstitial lung disease NOS with radiographic evidence of emphysema and is on 2L Home O2, who presents with fall with resultant head injury and loss-of-consciousness, followed by chest discomfort upon regaining consciousness.
Prior to loss-of-consciousness, patient denied any presyncope/lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort.
He awoke spontaneously approximately at 19:15 and noticed a sharp epigastric discomfort, [**5-25**], non-radiating, associated with nausea and shortness of breath, that was relieved 30 minutes later after taking 1 sublingual nitroglycerin.
Patient continued to have severe pain in his left-lower extremity stump.
He had another episode of chest discomfort at 03:00 on [**2128-4-11**] that resolved in 45 minutes with 3 sublingual nitroglycerin.
Subsequently, this morning, because the pain in his left-lower extremity continued to persist and was severe, patient called his brother who [**Name2 (NI) 4662**] him to the emergency room.
He was found to have acute renal failure, creatinine 0.9=>3.6 and was given 2 litres of normal saline.
Given the head trauma, CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology.
Also, patient had transaminitis and gall bladder ultrasound was performed.
VQ scan was performed given history of PE and inability to perform CTA due to renal insufficiency.
He was given 1 dose of levofloxacin 750mg for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray.
He reports that he has had no chest pain since [**4-10**].
He denies SOB but does report DOE after [**12-17**] blocks.
He denies PND and orthopnea (but chronically useas 2 pillow at night).
He denies ankle edema.
He reports pain in his L BKA.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Interstitial lung disease - Per [**5-/2127**] discharge summary, clinically diagnosed due to persistent hypoxia.

Family History: Noncontributory, sister with history of ruptured cerebral aneurysm at age 48.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98.8 BP:107/70 HR:86 RR:12 O2Sat:92% on 5L NC GEN: Chronically ill-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, TTP in epigastrium, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: left BKA stump markedly tender, no oedema, warm, good capillary refill.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
IMAGING: ECG: Sinus rhythm at 94 bpm, normal axis and intervals, normal R-wave progression, Q-waves in inferior leads, Biphasic T-waves in precordial leads same compared to prior dated [**2127-10-22**].
Diffuse reticular density at both lung bases which might represent interstitial lung disease.
No focal consolidation is noted.
Lingular atelectasis is unchanged.
VQ Scan ([**2128-4-11**]):  IMPRESSION: In absence of ventilation imaging and known chest radiograph findings the perfusion abnormalities are indeterminate/intermediate probability for PE.
Head CT ([**2128-4-11**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound with no focal hepatic lesions or fatty infiltration identified.
Mild splenomegaly, unchanged.
L Knee Films ([**4-11**]): IMPRESSION: Little change in the below-the-knee amputation with patchy demineralization about the knee.
EEG ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing.
This constellation of findings is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bubble study could not be interpreted due to poor windows.
The right ventricle is dilated and hypokinetic.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Chronic right ICA occlusion, level unknown.
They can also be due to small vessel infarction, demyelinating disease, infection including Lyme disease, and occasionally seen in patients with migraine headaches.
No renal mass lesion or hydronephrosis.
Findings most consistent with diffuse osteopenia in this patient status post below-the-knee amputation.
No displaced fracture.
Mild patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritic change.
Small joint effusion.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
PASP was severely elevated at 71 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis.
Severely elevated right heart pressures and pulmonary hypertension.
Equalization of left and right sided filling pressures with possible restrictive vs. constrictive physiology.
No pulmonary embolism.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Spiculated nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, with interval growth.
This is concerning in the background of centrilobular emphysema and is too small to biopsy.
A short interval followup is recommended.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An atrial septal defect (or any intracardiac or extracardiac shunt) cannot be excluded on the basis of this study due to the technically suboptimal nature of the images.
Brief Hospital Course: # Fall/Loss of consciouness: The patient reported that he fell at home when reaching toward a top shelf in his apartment, and it sounded to be mechanical.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology, MRI/MRA Head showed no evidence of acute infarct but did show multiple periventricular FLAIR hyperintensities, for which the differential diagnosis is broad (no cause, small vessel infarction, demyelinating disease, infection including Lyme disease, and occasionally seen in patients with migraine headaches).
There were no events on telemetry to suggest an arrhythmia.
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but did show slow and disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures (Ddx: medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection).
TTE attempted twice, but quality was suboptimal: bubble study could not be interpreted due to poor windows, LV systolic function appears grossly normal (LVEF >55%), RV is dilated and hypokinetic, no significant valvular abnormality seen.
He again had hypotension in the MICU after aggressive diuresis with SBP down to 60-70 but asymptomatic.
There was no evidence of bleeding and no localizing signs or symptoms of infection.
His WBC ranged 5.4-10.4, and his blood cultures showed no growth.
He then developed further volume overload likely from aggressive volume resucitation given his hypotension on admission.
TTE [**2128-4-12**] did not show evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure, LVEF >55%.
Cardiac Catheterization showed possible restrictive/constrictive physiology.
His Lasix was held during this admission because of his hypotension, and he was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about when this should be restarted.
He has a history of asbestos exposure and a history of possible interstitial lung disease, however there was no evidence of interstitial lung disease on Chest CT [**10-22**].
CTA chest was initially deferred given his ARF and recent contrast load with catheterization.
In the MICU, he would desaturate overnight requiring a face mask, likely due to central apnea.
He was intermittently hypoxic to 80s but asymptomatic during the day.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 51, mean PCWP 20), possible restrictive/constrictive physiology.
TTE showed TR gradient elevated to 42 mm Hg.
CTA Chest on [**2128-4-15**] showed no pulmonary embolism, left lower lobe pneumonia, mild pulmonary edema, and spiculated nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, with interval growth.
The patient remained afebrile with no leukocytosis and no evidence of infiltrate on CXR, so the team elected not to treat the possible PNA on CTA chest.
# NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD s/p 1v CABG in [**2111**] (SVG -> RCA), known occluded RCA and SVG->RCA graft on Cath in [**1-20**] and RCA fills with collaterals, and s/p PCI to LAD (3.0x23 Cypher) in [**8-20**] and OM1 (2.5x15 Vision-BMS) in [**5-22**].
He reported some chest discomfort around the time of his fall at home.
He had a bump in troponin from 1.85->2.14 after the catherization but his CK remained normal (69-84).
# Acute renal failure/Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's Cr was up to 3.6 on admission from a baseline of 0.6-0.8.
His FeUrea was 14%, and this was thought to be prerenal renal failure with a likely component of contrast nephropathy.
Renal ultrasound showed no renal mass lesion or hydronephrosis.
Left knee films showed little change in the below-the-knee amputation with patchy demineralization about the knee.
CT of the LLE showed diffuse osteopenia status post below-the-knee amputation, no displaced fracture, mild patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritic change, and small joint effusion.
Orthopedics was consulted and determined that the patient had a nondisplaced lateral cortex supracondylar femur fracture that was not operable.
There was difficulty controlling the patient's pain, as he became somnolent on some of the long-acting pain medications.
The chronic pain service was consulted.
This was thought to be secondary to shock liver.
# Seizure disorder: The patient had an EEG which showed no clearly epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
# Peripheral neuropathy: He was continued on his home dose of Gabapentin 800 mg tid.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**3-21**] hours as needed for itching.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tab Sublingual as directed: Take 1 tab under the tonuge every 5 minutes for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Mechanical Fall NSTEMI Acute Renal Failure Shock Liver Acute on Chronic Heart Failure Left Femur Fracture Emphysema Pulmonary Hypertension Hypothyroidism .
SECONDARY: PVD Seizure disorder Peripheral Neuropathy   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness/dizziness, weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, fever >101.5, or any other symptoms that concern you call your primary care physician or return to the ED.
Your Lasix was held during this admission because of low blood pressure.
