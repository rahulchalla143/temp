She came to the emergency room with some drainage and erythema around her wound and the question was whether this was a superficial cellulitis or a deep infection.
Due to concern that the infection could be deep, the patient was taken to the operating room for I&D.
Past Medical History: osteosarcoma right proximal femur hypomagnesemia hypokalemia status post right colectomy hypertension H. pylori osteoporosis thalassemia minor paroxysmal atrial tachycardia hepatic hemangioma parathyroid adenoma Grave's Disease  PSH: right proximal femur resection with APC reconstruction [**2160**] partial colectomy [**2160**] partial thyroidectomy [**2157**] parathyroid adenomectomy TAH [**2136**]   Social History: lives alone, avid ballroom dancer and walker denies alcohol denies tobacco   Family History: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer  Physical Exam: Patient presented with erythema surrounding her wound and drainage from the wound.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE RODS.
SENT TO FOCUS [**2161-10-29**] FOR IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES.
**FINAL REPORT [**2161-10-31**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2161-10-25**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
The wound continued to improve in appearance with vac therapy and subsequent debridement.
Cultures grew out P. acnes as well as another gram positive rod that was unable to be identified at an outside lab.
However, this was thought to be causing mild myelosuppression.
As a result, she underwent a successful vancomycin desensitization and has had no difficulty with vancomycin.
