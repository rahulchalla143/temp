Admission Date:  [**2113-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-8-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R-PICC [**8-10**]--removed prior to sending to rehab GJ Tube [**8-17**] via IR guidance-->sutures are to be removed in 10 days.
History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 86 year-old man with afib, prostate CA, recent non-traumatic SDH s/p Burr hole & left craniotomy [**2113-6-20**], who presents with newly noted right sided weakness at rehab.
He underwent b/l thoracentesis, which showed transudative effusion.
He was dx'd with C.diff and VRE urinary tract infection, which are being treated with PO vanco & linezolid respectively.
He was noted to have acute onset of right facial droop, pocketing food in the right side of his mouth.
There was concern that he might have "increased" right-sided neglect with the possibility of non-specified right-sided vision loss.
Prelim read on Head CT showed slight decrease in extent of SDH; however, there was e/o some acute bleed.
acute pulm edema.
Labs showed increase in trop from below assay to 0.36, though ck not elevated.
Unable to provide addn'l ROS due to severe dysarthria/resp distress.
Past Medical History: -non-traumatic SDH s/p Burr hole ([**6-27**]) then left craniotomy ([**2113-7-21**]) - Systolic/Diastolic CHF; TTE [**7-28**] w/ mild global left ventricular hypokinesis, LVEF = 40-45 %.
Restrictive filling abnormality.
RV moderately dilated w/ focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
-Moderate MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] pleural effusion, s/p thoracentesis, diagnosed [**Month (only) 216**] [**2112**] -HTN -Hyperlipidemia -Atrial Fibrillation, now with ventricular pacemaker -Prostate ca presently undergoing work-up for cryotherapy -s/p bilateral cataract surgery -recent C.diff, started on coverage with oral vancomycin [**2113-8-5**]  -VRE UTI   Social History: Patient is a retired architectural engineer.
Family History: Father had lung cancer at age 68.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.9 F BP 138/56 P 89 RR 28 SaO2 100% on NRB General: thin elderly man, sl uncomfortable appearing laying in bed HEENT: left-sided healing craniotomy scar, sclerae anicteric, dry MM, with thrush seen on roof of mouth Neck: mildly limited passive ROM, but no nuchal rigidity, no bruits Lungs: occcasional wheezes with cough, decreased breath sounds at bases CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: cool dry, no significant edema with stockings in place, pedal pulses appreciated Skin: no rashes .
Neurologic Examination (per neuro note--agree w/ exam): Mental Status: Sleepy, inattentive, can occasionally respond appropriately to some basic questions, though it is very difficult to understand, given severe dysarthria, language is non-fluent and dysarthric, following some commands appropriately cooperative with exam when able, but appears to be neglecting right side of space Cranial Nerves: Optic disc margins sharp; may have homonymous hemianopsia on right side of space, though difficult to tell.
Pupils ~4 mm, surgical, unreactive, and irregular bilaterally.
Extraocular intact vertically, but both eyes appear to be looking left, left eye appears somewhat exotropic, both eyes crossed midline with occulocephalics.
Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.
Motor: Normal bulk and reduced tone throughout.
No tremor, no asterixis.
Cannot comply with formal testing, able to hold left arm and leg anti-gravity for at least 10 sconds.
Coordination: Left FNF without dysmetria, unable to do perform on right.
- Repeat ECG peri-resp distress: likely afib; more pronounced TWI in V3-6, and inferior leads.
CT head, non-contrast: No evidence of ischemia although MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
Interval decrease in left subdural collection.
However, small amount of superimposed acute subdural bleeding cannot be excluded, but there is no mass effect.
ECHO [**8-11**] Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**8-17**] IMPRESSION: There is a moderate-to-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced base of tongue retraction and bolus propulsion with moderate-to-severe pharyngeal residue remained.
Episodes of penetration were noted to occur consistently after the swallow across all consistency trial.
Cued and reflexive cough were effective in clearing penetration but unable to create gross aspirated material.
[**2113-8-15**] HEAD CT: IMPRESSION: Stable left hemispheric mixed-density extra-axial fluid collection.
No new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 86 year-old man with non-traumatic SDH s/p Burr hole then left craniotomy, recently resumed on ASA and subcutaneous heparin, atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker, C.diff and VRE urinary tract infection, who presented with acute onset of right-sided weakness, and developed acute respiratory distress shortly following arrival to [**Hospital1 **].
Suspect pt may have mucus plugged/aspirated, particularly as he has been having difficulty clearing secretions due to thick secretions from severe dehydration.
He had thick secretions and severely dry MM which contributed to thick mucous plugs.
EKG w/ some increase in ST-depression & T-wave inversions in precordial (V3-6) & inferior leads.
These EKG findings may be due to non-ischemic changes, possibly cerebral T waves or post-pacing repolarization changes.
He is V-paced without further incident or EKG changes.
# Right sided wkness/?neglect: acute onset.
Also, possible that pt has old stroke & is unmasking deficits in setting of UTI/cdiff infections.
Most likely related to severe dehydration, hyponatremia, infection-UTI & C-diff.
Pt significanly improved on [**8-11**] with R sided weakness resolving and prior to discharge resolved.
He did not have any seizures during this admission.
EEG was done and per neuro did not show seizure activity.
# Subdural Hematoma: repeat CT following respiratory event stable from admission CT. Pt has e/o of stable hematoma, pt denies HA, visual changes, interactive and following commands appropriately.
Per neuro there was no active bleed and no acute stroke.
# Hyponatremia: most likely hypovolemic process given pt's severely dry MM & Urine specific gravity is high.
# Cdiff: ?
# UTI: cx data from OSH indicates pt had VRE in urine sensitive to Linezolid & nitrofurantoin.
Urinary retention: Pt developed urinary retention on [**8-14**], foley replaced.
?DM: on ISS in MICU, continue to follow FS closely may be in setting of stroke, stress response.
# Precautions: VRE/C-DIFF/aspiration .
# Dispo: Rehab  Medications on Admission: -Augmentin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days, started [**2113-8-7**] for 7d, unclear indication -Aspirin 81 mg daily -Heparin 5000 units SQ TID -Calcium carbonate 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Citalopram 15 mg q am -Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Folic acid 1 mg daily -Ipratropium Neb q 6 hours -Lisinopril 5 mg daily -Metoclopramide 5 mg TID -Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Midodrine 2.5 [**Hospital1 **] -Phenytoin 300 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Salmeterol/fluticasone INH [**Hospital1 **] -Albuterol INH q 4 hours prn dyspnea -Senna 8.6 mg po BID prn constipation -Vancomycin 125 mg QID started [**2113-8-5**] for C. diff -Casodex, held on [**2113-8-7**] for worsening LFTs   Discharge Medications: 1.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: [**12-21**] nebs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for dyspnea or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -R sided weakness -Dehydration -Hyponatremia -VRE-UTI -C-diff -Mucous Plugging .
You had a Urinary Tract infection and C-diff diarrhea from cultures taken from your rehab facility.
A new stroke could not be ruled out as you could not get an MRI to confirm.
If you have worsening weakness, difficulty speaking, walking, incontinence of urine, consfusion, headaches, visual changes or other worrisome symptoms please call your physician or go to the emergency room.
Your coumadin was held due to concern for bleeding-do not restart this, you were continued on aspirin.
