Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 63878**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] because you had low blood pressure and pain in your chest.
The low blood pressure was most likely from taking more pain medication than you are prescribed.
In the future, if your pain becomes difficult to control please contact your pain specialist; adjusting your own pain medications can be life threatening.
The chest pain with deep breaths that you presented with is likely a remnant of the pneumonia you had previously.
You had no fevers off of antibiotics, making it unlikely that you have a persistent infection.
