The patient had been evaluated in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**2119-6-10**] for mental status changes and was seen by neurosurgery who felt that his symptoms were secondary to a UTI.
He had a CT and plain film of his head that showed no discontinuity of the LP shunt with no acute intracranial hemorrhage and slight increase in size of the 3rd and 4th ventricles.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient in the ED and felt that his symptoms were not neurologic or secondary to meningitis.
CXR initially showed NAD but on repeat showed ?RLL infiltrate.
Repeat UA mildly positive with 6-10 WBC, 0 epithelial cells.

There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
The appearance of regions of old infarct and periventricular white matter hypoattenuation are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is unchanged to slight increase in size of the third ventricle without change within the lateral ventricles.
There is also the appearance of mild increase in dilatation of the fourth ventricle.
The pulmonary artery is patent without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is a conglomeration of lymph nodes in the mediastinum, which are borderline enlarged and unchanged when compared to the prior study dated [**2116-6-16**].
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
Bilateral dependent airspace consolidation likely represents aspiration pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
There are scattered hazy nodules within the right middle lobe and right upper and right lower lobe, the largest one measuring 7 mm in the right lower lobe.
Bilateral dependent airspace consolidation likely represents aspiration pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
Unchanged right anterior mediastinal mass likely residual thyroid.
Borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and unchanged when compared to prior study.
Coronary artery disease.
Scattered hazy nodules within the right lung, the largest one measuring 7 mm in the right lower lobe.
There is a dense left lower lobe consolidation, as well as patchy but extensive consolidations in the mid right lung and both lower lung fields, markedly progressed since the prior study.
There is no definite effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Considerable progression of bilateral pulmonary opacities, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
There has been interval increase in perihilar haziness.
Compared to the film from two hours prior there is a new right lower lobe infiltrate.
There is left basilar atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: New right lower lobe infiltrate.
Increased vascular engorgement.
Findings concerning for pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # Impression: The patient is an 80 year old male with a history of dementia, SAH with left ICA aneurysm s/p coiling c/b hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt, PAF, dementia, DMII who presents from his nursing home with hypoxia, fever, hypotension and right lower extremity pus at heel concerning for sepsis now on dopamine/vancomycin and zosyn day 1.
Change in mental status:  Patient was admitted initially with change in mental status thought to be due to to infection.
There was initial concern for infection of his VP shunt, but felt unlikely per neurosurgery.
He then became hypotensive and was transferred to the MICU.
While there he was on a dopamine drip and broad spectrum antibioticss as well as IV fluids.
Mental status rapidly improved with treatment of infection as well as restarting his outpatient dementia medications.
Infection: Initially had fever to 105.5 in the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ER, had leukocytosis on admission.
Likely infection source was either pneumonia or his right heel ulcer.
These were covered with vancomycin/ zosyn and then transitioned to levofloxacin and clindamycin (changed to ceftriaxone and clindamycin, given that heel ulcer was growing MSSA resistant to levofloxacin and had recently finished a course of levofloxacin).
It was thought that meningitis was even more unlikely given the rapid resolution.
Aspiration pneumonia: found to be initially hypoxic and had evolving chest x-ray that showed signs of aspiration.
Additionally he had signs of aspriation seen.
Dementia  Has baseline dementia.
Anemia  Had hematocrit drop with aggressive IV fluids and remains stable.
However, found to have low ferritin and was started on ferrous gluconate  Renal insufficiency  Initially elevated creatnine that improved with IV fluids.
Will continue while infected but may not need it after his infection is cleared and may again be diet controlled.
Hypothyroid - Follow up as outpatient as TSH elevated to 5.3.
Continue levothyroxine for now at 188 mcg and recheck TSH after acute infection resolves for follow up in [**12-27**] weeks.
History of paryoxysmal atrial fibrillation - Currently in not in afib.
Also not on ASA/coumadin with a history of intracranial bleed.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis likely secondary to heel infection aspiration pneumonia .
Dementia Hypertension Diabetes history of SAH history of endocarditis   Discharge Condition: improved BP, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with infection in your heel and lungs.
You should continue your antibiotics for at least 10 days and call the doctor if you have any fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or vomiting, worsening mental status, or low oxygen or any other concerning symptoms.
