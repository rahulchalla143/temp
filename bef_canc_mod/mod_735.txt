Pt had been previously admitted 1 month ago for afib management and was started on quinidine as renal function did not allow for initiation of dofetilide.
Weight increased from 219 to 236 pounds, with worsening leg swelling and dyspnea on exertion.
On ROS, pt denied any interval chest pain, although did experience palpitations with chronic afib, and denied any infectious symptomatology.

AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2139-10-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2139-10-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-10-12**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is distal septal and apical akinesis suggested.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No deep venous thrombosis in left common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
3.4-cm septated fluid collection corresponding to the palpable abnormality in the left lateral ankle, a finding that is of uncertain significance but could represent hematoma, synovial cyst or infectious collection, among other entities.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 11:52 PM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-30**] through earlier in the day: Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion have worsened today consistent with cardiac decompensation though moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged and there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
There are no focal abnormalities in the lungs to suggest pneumonia.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 1:52 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little change.
Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with fullness of the pulmonary vessels and a dual-lead pacemaker device in place.
No evidence of acute pneumonia.
Left upper lobe and lingular pneumonia.
Multiple small peribronchial nodules likely from chronic small airways disease.
Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is not possible on this noncontrast study, and if clincally indicated, VQ scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
Multinodular thyroid with calcifications.
The patient head overlie the lung apices, thus evaluation of pneumothorax cannot be obtained precisely, although no evidence of large pneumothorax is present.
The cardiac size is mildly enlarged but unchanged compared to [**2139-10-7**].
Brief Hospital Course: 70F h/o DM2, atrial fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 45-50%), and CRI with volume overload.
Her diuretic regimen was titrated while on the floor with good response initially, but she continued to have worsening renal failure.
In the PACU, she was unable to lie down flat because of respiratory discomfort.
Her oxygen saturation recovered, but she was transferred to the MICU given her tenuous respiratory status.
# Possible acute diastolic CHF exacerbation - cardiac vs renal in etiology.
Concerning increase in Cr reported from outside labs, pt continues to make good urine according to patient, obstruction seems unlikely.
She suffered worsening pulmonary edema in the days before the tunneled catheter was placed and she was nearing HD.
# Respiratory distress:  Patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation in the PACU, and was noted to vomit while supine.
During that time, patient was also noted to be hypertensive with EKG changes suspicious for ischemia, giving rise to the suspicion that patient possibly experienced acute diastolic failure leading to pulmonary edema.
Follow-up sputum Gram stain demonstrated Gram-positive rods and cocci, as well as Gram-negative rods.
Acute desaturation was therefore considered likely triggered by mucus plugging [**2-6**] hospital-acquired PNA (although pt was chronically on prednisone 25mg daily [**2-6**] presumed psittacosis without Bactrim ppx, her desaturation was considered unlikely related to PCP).
Because little fluid was removed via HD ultrafiltration, chronic diastolic dysfunction was considered to be a less likely contributor.
Because of pt's vomiting, pt was also noted to be at risk for possible aspiration pneumonitis or PNA.
Further ultrafiltration was unable to be performed given low blood pressures.
Upon transfer to the floor, pt's furosemide was continued given difficulty in managing outpatient fluid status.
# Acute mental status change:  Patient was noted to have acute mental status change upon transfer post-op to the MICU.
This was felt likely [**2-6**] multifactorial contributions from anesthesia, acute hypoxia and hypercarbia, and infection.
# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was initially continued on her home regimen of aspirin, metoprolol, and simvastatin, with no ACE inhibitors in the setting of her renal dysfunction.
During patient's acute desaturation in the PACU post op, EKGs were concerning for possible ischemic change given patient's background of coronary artery disease.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative, and repeat EKGs showed no significant change.
Cardiology was consulted but had low suspicion that patient had experienced an acute ischemic event.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was not anti-coagulated given her history of hematuria, and was continued on metoprolol and quinidine for rate control.
# LLE lesion: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a painful, erythematous, floculent nodule on the lateral aspect of her LLE.
An ultrasound showed a fluid collection, but aspiration of the lesion was unsuccessful.
She remained afebrile throughout the course of this lesion, which lasted roughly a week.
Medications on Admission: Furosemide 120mg daily (from 120mg TID prior to last hospitalization) Spironolactone 25mg daily Metoprolol 100mg TID [**Known lastname **] 325mg daily Simvastatin 20mg daily Prednisone 25mg daily Omeprazole 20mg daily Insulin (NPH 40 [**Hospital1 **]), Humalog sliding scale Iron Caltrate Vicodin PRN  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ventricular fibrillation from respiratory failure .
