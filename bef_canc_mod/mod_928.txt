UGIB: She reported hematemesis and melena on admission to the MICU but NG lavage was negative.
EGD the following morning showed grade 1 non-bleeding varices and signs of gastritis and portal gastropathy.
Abdominal pain: She complained of diffuse, crampy abdominal pain of 3 days duration on admission, however, she later reported that the pain had been occurring for weeks and had recently increased in intensity and duration.
This was possibly due to liver inflammation or pancreatitis.
Her lipase was mildly elevated to 78 on admission and remained elevated in the 60s throughout admission, however, this could be attributed to her advanced liver disease and she had no other s/s suggestive  of pancreatitis besides abdominal pain.
RUQ ultrasound with doppler showed cirrhosis, patent portal veins, and no evidence of pancreatitis.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed which showed no SBP.
Pt got an MRI/MRV of abdomen to further eval pain, because she was already scheduled for it as an outpatient [**1-19**] prior ultrasound being unable to visualize flow to left lobe of liver.
In house u/s showed patent vasculature, however, and MRI showed no definite area of thrombus.
MRI also showed large duodenal varices.
Upon further questioning she admitted that she had seen a gynecologist s few months ago who noted an abnormality on her bimanual exam and suggested she follow up with a transvaginal ultrasound, which she had not done yet.
Pt also admitted she no longer gets her period, so a pregnancy test was done and was negative.
Pt was stable so she was discharged and encouraged to follow up with her gynecologist for the transvaginal ultrasound to rule out gynecologic causes of abdominal pain or masses, such as fibroids.
Thrombocytopenia: She has chronic thromobocytopenia from her cirrhosis.
Pt was placed on ceftriaxone for SBP ppx while in house and switched to ciprofloxacin to complete the 5d course after discharge.
10. clotrimazole 10 mg Troche Sig: One (1) troche Mucous membrane five times a day as needed for yeast infection.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Autoimmune Hepatitis GI Bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had an MRI to evaluate your abdominal pain, and it did not show a reason why you were having pain, or any evidence of blood clots in your abdomen.
