NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Extensive prevertebral/retropharyngeal soft tissue density from C2-3 through C7-T1, which could reflect edema and phlegmon in the setting of infection, though an infiltrative soft tissue mass/neoplasm cannot be excluded by imaging.
No focal rim-enhancing fluid collection.
An MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation of this abnormality.
Healed fracture deformity at C7-T1 with residual anterolisthesis.
Layering non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
Nonspecific 4-mm ground-glass nodules at the lung apices, with incompletely visualized consolidation laterally in the left upper lung, which could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.
CXR [**2157-11-25**]: IMPRESSION: New bibasilar opacities, which given the clinical history are suspicious for aspiration, possibly developing pneumonia.
The most substantial pulmonary abnormality is the collapse of more than half of the left lower lobe, with no bronchial obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions are presumably interrelated, but none has a substantial respiratory or hemodynamic effect.
Small region of consolidation in right middle lobe, could be contusion from chest tube insertion.
Fluid opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells as well as the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx is likely associated with intubation.
Redemonstrated is diffuse induration of the cervical fat planes as well as soft tissue swelling of the prevertebral space that demonstrates homogeneous enhancement.
There is no cervical fluid collection or ring enhancement pattern that would raise the suspicion for abscess.
Incompletely imaged fracture deformity of the C7-T1 level which appears unchanged from the priors.
IMPRESSION: Stable diffuse prevertebral soft tissue swelling with no evidence of drainable abscess.
The lungs demonstrate minimal plate-like atelectasis in the superior portions of the bilateral lower lobes.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Minimal bilateral atelectasis, but no pneumothorax.
Initially the patient took a small swallow of Omnipaque and trace aspiration was noted.
No holdup identified.
There is slight irregularity of the posterior wall of the oropharynx (1:[**Numeric Identifier 13949**]).
No leak identified.
Tertiary contractions noted of the mid and distal esophagus consistent with presbyesophagus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of leak following contrast swallow.
Trace aspiration noted.
There is mild-to-moderate intermittent aspiration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
Severe residue within the hypopharynx is seen with all consistencies.
There is a large anterior osteophyte seen at C2-C3, which impinges upon the esophagus.
There is slight prominence the posterior soft tissues as better demonstrated on the CT of the neck from [**2157-11-27**].
Slight irregularity to the posterior esophageal wall upon swallowing is suggestive of a small diverticulum (23/297).
Small esophageal Zenker diverticulum.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o M with history of chronic dysphagia, presents with worsening dysphagia, stridor, and respiratory distress, on imaging found to have soft tissue infection in retropharyngeal space as well as pneumonia and R. pleural exudative effusion.
# Respiratory distress/Stridor - Patient presented with stridor, found to have upper airway edema, intubated in the ED.
Considered infectious causes, oral flora from recent tooth extraction, esophageal perforation from recent endoscopy.
CT neck showed retropharyngeal edema, likely infectious, but no drainable collection.
Levaquin switched to meropenem once patient's UA showed pyuria as he has a history of resistant UTI.
Repeat CT showed very focal, circumferential area of inflammation limited to trachea, not extending past vocal cords.
A MRI was performed to better evaluate for fluid collection, and confirmed that there was no drainable collection.
He had no stridor and protected his airway without issue after extubation.
# Dysphagia: Patient has a history of chronic dysphagia which was exacerbated by the retropharyngeal space infection.
He was evaluated by speech/swallow and had a video oropharyngeal swallow study which showed aspiration and penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids,osteophytosis, and a small esophageal Zenker diverticulum.
# Pleural effusion - CT scan of neck noted large R. pleural effusion.
Chest tube was placed and drained ~900cc exudative fluid with pH 7.1, but low amylase.
CXR after chest tube placement showed no persistent focal infiltrate.
On the day of extubation, the chest tube was removed and there was no pneumothorax on chest xray.
#UTI: Patient with E. coli UTI.
# Sepsis ??????
On presentation, patient was hypotensive and febrile with leukocytosis.
Radiographic evidence R. pleural effusion, concerning for pneumonia, especially aspiration given recent dysphagia.
Also initial concern for mediastinitis [**1-19**] esophageal rupture.
Patient transiently required levophed for pressure support.
# Afib/Bradycardia - History of afib with RVR, but recently rate controlled in the 70s.
Could have beeen in the setting of propofol, though bradycardia persistent after propofol stopped.
Warfarin held in the acute setting for potential procedures.
Patient does have history of C spine injury s/p [**2157**]0 years ago.
Per orthopedic spine team, this is a chronic issue and there is no concern for spinal cord compression.

Secondary: Atrial fibrillation C-spine fx with loss of urinary bladder function Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of difficulty swallowing.
It was found that you had swelling in the tissues of your neck secondary to an infection.
You will not need to have another CAT scan of your neck at this time.
You also had a pneumonia and some fluid in your lung which was drained.
Lastly, you had a urinary tract infection which was treated with an antibiotic.
In regards to your neck, imaging showed that you have an old small fracture in your neck from the fall you had 10 years ago.
