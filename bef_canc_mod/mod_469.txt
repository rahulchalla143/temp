The patient states that she was completely asymptomatic, denying any lightheadedness, dizziness, or chest pain.
The patient states that since her father died last week she has had some stomach upset with cramping and diarrhea as well as poor p.o.
She denied any recent abdominal pain, fever, or [**Male First Name (un) 1658**]-colored stools.
The patient was noted to have baseline hypotension with the systolic blood pressure normally in the 90s.
Alcoholic cirrhosis and fibrosis, diagnosed in [**2100-8-30**], complicated by IVC stenosis, status post stent placement in [**9-2**].
History of anemia of chronic disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with bilateral breast reduction scars noted.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm, tachycardiac, no murmurs.
Abdomen:  Distended, with visibly distended bands on the surface of the abdomen.
The patient declined palpation secondary to recent paracentesis.
The patient was noted to have hypoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  There was 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2100-12-14**] secondary to hypotension as well as hematocrit down to 23.8.
She was then transferred back to the unit on [**2100-12-23**] after worsening renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3 and decreased urine output.
There, she was given aggressive IV fluids and placed on Levophed for increased blood pressure and increased urine output.
Her urine output initially improved with a decrease in creatinine but has since dropped back down to 0-60 milliliters per hour of urine output off of the Levophed.
She was also with encephalopathy and receiving Lactulose.
She was pan cultured for recurrent temperature spikes including a repeat paracentesis and was started on empiric vancomycin and Diflucan for yeast noted in her urine.
A NG tube was placed and the patient was started on tube feeds but this was subsequently held secondary to increased residuals.
On [**2100-12-29**], a meeting was held with the patient's son, [**Name (NI) **], to discuss the fact that there were no realistic therapeutic interventions available for her worsening sources and oliguria.
She received free water IV fluid for hypernatremia and her sodium went down from 155 to 150.
Lactulose and had a rectal Foley in place.
Renal failure.
Urinary tract infection.
