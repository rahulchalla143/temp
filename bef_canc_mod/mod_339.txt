CT Neck [**11-11**]: FINDINGS: There are small level II and IIb lymph nodes bilaterally.
There is no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
There are no abscesses.
No enhancing masses are identified.
IMPRESSION: No abscess or enhancing mass.
CT Head [**11-11**]: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There are no fractures.
There is an acute left 6th rib fracture.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.
Left 6th rib fracture.
Sinus tachycardia.
There appear to be modest non-specific ST-T wave changes but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Since the previous tracing of [**2121-3-28**] there may be no significant change but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.
There is a left-sided central venous catheter with the distal tip in the proximal SVC.
No gas seen within the mediastinum to indicate a significant esophageal injury.
Again seen is a subacute fracture of the left sixth rib posteriorly which is unchanged and demonstrates some callus.
No focal infiltrates or pleural effusions are seen.
This finding has been discussed with clinical staff.
Since previous tracing of [**2122-11-11**], sinus tachycardia absent and low amplitude T waves improved.
Since previous tracing of the same date, sinus tachycardia now present.
Mass with stricture of the distal espophagus just proximal to the GE junction, suspicious for esophageal cancer.
No evidence of free leakage of contrast in the mediastinum.
Since previous tracing of [**2122-11-13**], sinus tachycardia absent.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 33230**] is a 44 year old man with h/o EtOH abuse and withdrawal, admitted with increased white blood cell count, increased lactate level, and fever, presumed to be sepsis of unknown etiology.
# Lactic acidosis- His elevated lactate was initially feared to be secondary to sepsis.
He was not on any medications that would be suspected to cause lactic acidosis.
His osmolar gap was 4.9, which would not be consistent with methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication.
Sepsis workup as below.
# Fever/?sepsis: He was febrile in ED and met criteria for sepsis with elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and fever.
He endorsed recent history of odynophagia although he was unable to differentiate between esophageal pain and pharyngeal pain.
Possible sources of his sepsis were thought to include neck abscess, pharyngitis (viral, Strep, GC), esophagitis, pneumonia.
CT neck showed no abscess.
# Chest pain: He gave a history of 4 days of vomiting prior to admission.
He saw a small amount of blood in vomitus in his last episode.
This small amount of blood was felt likely secondary to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear in the setting of multiple episodes of vomiting.
He initially endorsed occasional substernal pain with swallowing pills.
On [**11-13**], he began to have more severe chest pain with swallowing pills.
He had a particularly acute episode after attempting to eat regular diet.
During that episode, he appeared to be in severe pain, and was tachycardic and hypertensive.
He had no ischemic changes evident on his ECG.
His pain was somewhat improved with morphine.
His differential was thought to include esophagitis secondary to vomiting, esophageal Candidiasis with palatal petechiae, Boerhaave's.
# Dysphagia/chest pain: barium swallow performed and showed mass with stricture of the distal espophagus just proximal to the GE junction, suspicious for esophageal cancer.
GI was consulted, and the EGD showed esophagitis and gastritis.
# Altered mental status: Initially very somnolent on arrival to the MICU.
No meningismus.
CT head negative for acute intracranial process.
As his mental status rapidly improved, his somnolence was felt to be most likely secondary to Valium administered in the ED.
# EtOH withdrawal: He has a history of severe withdrawals requiring a Versed drip on one admission and periodic Valium tapers as an outpatient.
# Liver disease.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophagitis, gastritis Lactic acidosis   Discharge Condition: Stable, able to tolerate PO, walking, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nausea, vomiting, fever, sore throat, elevated lactic acid levels in the blood, and elevated blood alcohol levels.
In addition, you had an EGD that showed gastritis and esophagitis, inflammation of your upper GI tract.
If you experience worsening trouble swallowing, difficulty breathing, worsening nausea or vomiting, chest pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
