Bibasilar ground-glass opacification may represent basilar atelectasis; however, infectious process or aspiration cannot be completely excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical setting.
Gallbladder wall is calcified placing the patient at risk for gallbladder cancer.
Thickening along the medial wall of the gallbladder is unchanged from prior.
Hyperdense 6-mm foci in the distal common bile duct raise concern for choledocholithiasis or soft tissue.
New hypodensities in the left lobe of the liver concerning for abscess/infection or metastases.
These can be further evaluated on ultrasound or MRCP.
Moderate perinephric stranding is slightly worse compared to [**2194-2-27**] and is more prominent on the left versus the right, non-specific, but could relate to acute renal failure.
Again noted is pre-sacral fluid collection containing air which is slightly increased compared to [**2194-2-27**] and shows increased air within the collection.
A second walled-off air collection noted adjacent to the larger pre-sacral fluid collection is new since [**2194-2-27**].
Small bowel appears mildly dilated with no definite transition point identified.
Mild perihepatic fluid and mild mesenteric stranding.
[**2194-9-16**] ERCP: Obstruction in the lower third of the biliary tree either from stone or a stricture.
[**2194-9-19**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: repeat ordered to assess interval change in size of multiple liver abscesses 1.
Two larger intrahepatic collections in the left lateral liver are similar to that seen on [**2194-9-16**], with deeper segment III lesion having more liquified appearance and more superficial segment II lesion having more semi-solid appearance, each also with associated few small satellite lesions.
No definite new lesion seen.
Small perihepatic ascites is increased compared to [**2194-9-15**].
However, no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is seen in the supratentorial region.
New, moderate sized lytic lesion in the left frontal bone with some soft tissue component, most likely representing metastatic lesion given the history, with less likely possibility of infection.
[**2194-9-27**] TTE: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from previous examination, and bibasilar atelectasis.
Additional probable superimposed consolidation and changes of aspiration pneumonitis at the left lung base.
A pigtail catheter in a left lobe abscess has been partially withdrawn and now side holes are located outside of the collection.
Moderate left-sided hydronephrosis with ileal conduit in place.
Prior right partial nephrectomy; no definite evidence of recurrent disease on this non-contrast CT although retroperitoneal lymph nodes remain borderline.
Focal gallbladder wall thickening and punctate calcification, which could represent porcelain gallbladder or changes of focal adenomyomatosis.
Secretions filling the right lower lobe bronchus.
Essentially unchanged left lobe liver abscesses.
Gallbladder wall thickening with calcification of the gallbladder is concerning.
Presacral abscesses as shown interval organization, but appears essentially unchanged in size from the prior exam.
Limited non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating stable appearance of the intrahepatic catheters with residual abscesses, with interval improvement in intrahepatic bile duct dilation and pneumobilia.
Interval increase in the small amount of perihepatic ascites as well as bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] is a 67 yo man with history of rectal cancer and RCC, CAD and COPD.
He presented with chest pain and was ultimately found to be in septic shock.
Florid leukocytosis with bandemia and elevated LFT's were noted on admission with evidence of dilated CBD on CT abdomen.
Emergent ERCP ([**9-16**]) was done on admission and showed CBD stricture with frank pus.
As described below, CT also showed liver abscesses which were drained by IR and required repeat drainage and catheter placement given reaccumualtion.
He remained afebrile while off pressors.
Blood Cx grew pan-sensative E. Coli species and Abx switched to Zosyn.
LIVER ABSCESSES: Multiple hypodensities seen in the left lobe of the liver on CT were concerning for abscesses.
A ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of two of the abscesses was pursued on [**2194-9-16**] and showed frank pus (see report for further details of anatomy; no cytology sent due to low volume of aspirate).
Blood cultures ([**4-6**] vials from admission) as well as cultures from one of the abscesses grew pan-sensitive E coli as noted above.
Drains stayed in place until [**2194-10-17**] when they were pulled even though follow-up CT still showed residual liver abscess.
Stayed on this regimen until [**10-22**] when Abx switched to amoxicillin/clavulonic acid due to developing neutropenia and concern for antibiotic toxicity as the cause.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient was intubated on admission for his ERCP.
It was felt that he likely had flash pulmonary edema complicating his extubation attempts and needed to be reintubated each time.
Pt then developed a hospital acquired pneumonia and required brief re-intubation in setting of acute respiratory distress.
He did not have further respiratory issues during the hospitalization and was quickly weaned off oxygen to room air.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] was anuric for ~36-48 hours after admission, likely from dense ATN in the setting of profound septic shock (he was on three pressors for several days).
His creatinine subsequently decreased but remained elevated around 2.5-2.7.
He then had another episode of elevated creatinine to 4-5 range and decreased urine output, again felt to be due to ATN in the setting of acute GI bleed.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/AFLUTTER: He had Afib with RVR and atrial flutter that began in setting of sepsis.
He was cardioverted x 2 which only resulted in converting to sinus rhythm for a short period of time.
He still had episodes of tachycardia to the 120's in atrial flutter and repeat cardioversion was planned.
However, in the setting of GI bleed and concern over dangers of any anticoagulation, the electrophysiology service elected to not perform either cardioversion or flutter ablation.
At time of discharge pt still with mildly elevated HR 100-110s on 75mg of QID PO metoprolol tartrate.
GI BLEED and DIARRHEA: He was transferred to the floor on [**10-3**] and had another episode of hypotension.
He continued to have profuse guaiac-positive watery diarrhea and had a few episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
Pt underwent an extensive work-up for causes of infectious and non-infectious diarrhea while still in the ICU, all of which ended up being negative including multiple samples sent for C. diff tox.
Pt continued to have large volume stool output through his ostomy and was started on loperemide and metamucil to reduce this output.
COAGULOPATHY: He had an elevated INR, and PTT on admission likely related to sepsis.
He also had significant reduction in platelets.
He was started on coumadin for his atrial flutter and his INR increased to 4.1.
He then had BRBPR as above and his INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Coagulation parameters normalized but the decision was made not to further anticoagulate him acutely [**2-4**] to the GI bleed.
One-two weeks after resolution of the GI bleed pt had some bright red blood oozing from the rectum which was brief and self-limited.
This was attributed to the anal fissures which had been noted on colonoscopy and as a result of this second episode of bleeding decision was made to hold even anticoagulation with aspirin for pt's afib/aflutter until pt stable as an outpatient.
GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: On admission, pt had anion gap acidosis likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure.
His gap closed with treatment of underlying infection.
Because of the temporal relation to the initiation of these two medications and no other medication addtions, neutropenia was attributed to medication cause and antibiotics switched to augmentin.
2) PRESACRAL FLUID COLLECTION: He had multiple abdominal CT scans that showed a presacral fluid collection that was stable in size compared to previous.
3) LYTIC LESION: Patient had CT head while in the MICU which showed a new, moderate-sized lytic lesion in the left frontal bone with some soft tissue component that was felt to represent a metastatic lesion.
He has a history of renal cell carcinoma and colon cancer in the past and the source of this lesion was not entirely clear.

You were admitted to the hospital with a gallbladder infection and bacteria in your blood.
You developed a pneumonia in the ICU and briefly required re-intubation to support your breathing.
You had an episode of bleeding from your gut which required blood transfusions to stabilize.
Some small damaged areas were identified that may have been where your bleeding started.
Because of your GI bleed you were not put on blood thinners for your abnormal heart rhythm.
Because you continued to have large amounts of watery output from your ostomy you were started on intravenous nutrition as we were concerned you were not absorbing enough nutrients.
