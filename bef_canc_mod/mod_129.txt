Admission Date:  [**2110-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-5-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Benadryl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Pressors (medications to support blood pressure) Thoracentesis ([**5-23**])   History of Present Illness: 84 yo M h/o systolic CHF (EF 20-25% in [**3-20**]), HTN, afib on warfarin, CKD (baseline Cr 2.1), DM2, and L MCA CVA who presented with anemia from nursing home.
He was recently d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission [**Date range (1) 12479**] for generalized weakness attributed to CHF exacerbation.
There was reportedly no evidence of acute bleeding at his NH.
Exam revealed guaiac positive stool with melena.
Head CT initially raised some concern for SAH but upon reviewing, neurosurg considered the findings old infarct without hemorrhage.
ECG showed slow afib with no ischemic changes.
He received one dose of vanc and zosyn, 2L of fluid with improvement in BP and therefore got a femoral line placed with initiation of norepinephrine.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2110-4-15**] to [**2110-4-25**] for CHF exacerbation.

Evolution of the right parietal infarct with development of cortical serpiginous hemorrhage (laminar necrosis).
The differential diagnoses include infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies.
Interval increase in a moderate right and small left pleural effusion with right lower lobe consolidation (likely aspiration).
No fractures are identified, although this assessment is suboptimal due to positioning and patient's size.
Multiple metallic clips overlie the partially visualized pelvis suggesting lymph node dissection.
Focal calcifications adjacent to the medial cortex of the proximal femoral shaft are of unknown etiology but doubtful clinical significance.
Within this limitation, there is no evidence of new acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
Again identified is an area of hypodensity in the right parietal lobe (2B, 31) consistent with evolving infarct.
There is a thin rim of cortical hyperdensity surrounding this area likely representing hemorrhage in the setting of laminar necrosis, unchanged.
Progression of expected encephalomalacia is also identified.
Diffuse periventricular white matter hypodensities compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes are unchanged.
There has been interval resolution of opacification of the nasopharynx.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
Evolving right parietal infarct with areas of laminar necrosis and serpiginous areas of hemorrhage, unchanged.
No evidence of DVT.
Video Swallow [**5-20**]: A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the Speech Pathology service.
Multiple consistencies of oral barium were administered and passed freely beyond the oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
A small amount of penetration and aspiration was noted with thin liquids.
Right ankle XR [**5-20**]: Three views of the right ankle and three views of the right foot demonstrate a large amount of lower extremity edema with soft tissue swelling about the ankle and foot of unclear etiology.
Aside from the soft tissue swelling in the foot, no osseous abnormality identified within the foot.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
There is no pneumothorax.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased, now layering predominantly laterally along the right chest wall.
Associated right basilar atelectasis has also increased.
Increased right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
Small amount of atelectasis at right lung base.
No further pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on coumadin transferred from OSH with respiratory failure and hypovolemic shock s/p stabilization with course c/b delirium, aspiration pneumonia, deconditioning and dehydration.
# Respiratory.
Initial respiratory failure likely related to acute on chronic systolic CHF complicated by aspiration pneumonitis with development of aspiration pneumonia.
Several days thereafter, the patient was noted to be tachpneic with leukocytosis which improved with treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia.
In addition, he was noted to have an increasing pleural effusion for which he had thoracentesis for 1.3L noted to be serous and transudative in nature likely related to CHF.
# Shock/UGIB.
This was attributed to hypovolemic shock given large hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools.
Patient has known upper GI AVMs and EGD during this admission showed gastritis with dried blood in the stomach.
No active site of bleeding was located.
No new stroke on CT head on admission, however evolution of encephalomalacia was noted, development of cortical serpiginous hemorrhage (laminar necrosis) in area of old RMCA in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
RLE weakness (also edematous), however this was deferred given no change in management (Pt.
was not deemed a candidate for anticoagulation given lifethreatening GIB, despite a very high risk for a recurrent CVA (CHADS = 6, ~ 20% risk of CVA within a year).
# Delirium.
Encourage frequent reorientation and monitoring for further mental status insults.
[**Last Name (un) **] was thought to be related to pre-renal physiology.
Patient was off coumadin in the setting of acute GI bleed.
# Stage 3, Chronic systolic CHF.
# RLE edema, pitting to hip.
No DVT on R LE ultrasound.
No pain evident w/ flex/ext/abd/add/rotation and plain films of hip and ankle were unrevealing.
Etiology of this was unclear and may well have a dependent component.
DDx also includes intramuscular bleed, but no echymoses on exam and HCT is stable.
# Diabetes.
# HTN.
Longstanding hypertension treated with carvedilol.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: -GI Bleeding in setting of Supratherapeutic INR -Hemorrhagic Shock -Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 3) -Aspiration Pneumonia -Pleural Effusion -Hypernatremia -Delirium .
SECONDARY: -Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (EF 20-25%) -Atrial Fibrillation -Right Parietal CVA   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with anemia secondary to bleeding as well as renal failure.
You were found to have a supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin; your elevated INR likely contributed to your bleeding.
You experienced shock and respiratory compromise and required intubation and intesive care in the Coronary Care Unit.
You were evaluated by neurosurgery and neurology given the finding likely old bleeding in your head.
You had some confusion that was likely associated with hypernatremia (high sodium) as well as a pneumonia.
Your sodium was corrected and your pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics.
Return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, new confusion or changes in mental status, dizziness, weakness, loss of function of a limb or difficulty initiating movements, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, sweating or any other symptom that intuitively concerns you.
