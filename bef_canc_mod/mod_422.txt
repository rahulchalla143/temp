Admission Date:  [**2125-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**] Chief Complaint: Ulceration of right hallux with bone exposure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Amputation of rigth hallux   History of Present Illness: :  68 yo male is direct admit who is to undergo surgery on Friday.
At last visit, he underwent a percutaneous flexor tenotomy  on hallux to try and relieve tension causing the increased pressure on the toe.
Localized erythema noted surrounding the ulcer.
No purulence noted.
No malodor noted.
Over lateral aspect fo right forefoot, macerated, superficial wound noted.
No cellulitis or lymphangitis noted.
New superficial ulcer dorsal PIPJ of [**3-17**]?
Digit, not probe to bone, no purulence or cellulitis.
Pertinent Results: [**2125-2-15**] RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: Since [**2124-7-14**], there has been increased osteolysis and irregularity of the margins of the prior fifth metatarsal amputation site, seen on ly on the AP view.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of irregular margins of the fifth metatarsal osteotomy site.
Abnormal myocardial perfusion.
Severe perfusion defect of the inferior wall which is mildly reversible at the apex.
Global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior wall with a calculated ejection fraction of 39%.
[**2125-2-16**] ART EXT: FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation shows monophasic waveforms diffusely and bilaterally, those at the PT level are absent bilaterally.
The volume recordings demonstrate diffuse waveform widening and extremely low amplitude at the metatarsal levels bilaterally.
There is likely SFA/popliteal disease and definite tibial disease bilaterally.
No evidence of tumor recurrence, status post left upper lobectomy.
Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
Nonspecific interstitial changes of the lung bases likely represent scarring or fibrosis.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
LMCA had a 50% tapering distal lesion that was calcified and unchanged from prior angiogram in [**2123**].
RCA was a dominant vessel that was proximally occluded with robust L->R collaterals.
Pressure wire measurement across the LMCA showed an FFR of 0.83 at maximal hyperemia which was consistent with a hemodynamically non-significant lesion.
Limited hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated systemic pressures and no aortic valve gradient.
Abdominal aortography showed patent aorto-bifemoral bypass without iunflow lesions.
Two vessel coronary artery disease (mild to moderate).
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo with DM, CAD s/p stents, HTN, Hyperlipidemia here with elective amputation for osteo of foot but was found to be hypoxic and p-mibi now showing moderate.
Repeat CXR was consistent with emphysema, and MDI was started.
Repeat CT of chest without contrast did not show any evidence of recurrent lung cancer.
CAD: As a pre-op clearance, a P-mibi was done and showed severe perfusion defect of the inferior wall which is mildly reversible at the apex and a moderate, reversible defect of the inferolateral wall.
For this abnormal finding, the patient undwernt cath which reveals stable lesions compared to the previous cath in [**2123**] and no intervention was done.
The patient likely has diastolic dysfunction.
h/o lung adenocarcinoma: CXR showed irregular parenchymal densities in R lung and vague opacity in L para-aortic area.
CT of chest without contrast however did not reveal any evidence of recurrence.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease +/- iron deficiency anemia in the setting of chronic ulcer/osteomyelitis.
The patient was transfused 2 units in the setting of hypoxia and anticipated surgery and hct increased appropriately.
On admission, pt noted to have a complex medical history.
Pt noted to have non-palpable pulses.
NIAS obtained and pt found to have poor perfusions rate.
# [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Pt had a failing right limb of aortobifemoral and right femoral dorsalis pedis vein graft.
There were no complications.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tab Sublingual prn as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*60 tab* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 8300**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis of right hallux   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Go to an Emergency Room if you experience new and continuing nausea, vomiting, fevers (>101.5 F), chills, or shortness of breath.
Also go to the ER if your wound becomes red, swollen, warm, or produces pus.
If you experience clear drainage from your wounds, cover them with a clean dressing and stop showering until the drainage subsides for at least 2 days.
Please take an over the counter stool softener such as Colace or a gentle laxative such as Milk of Magnesia if you experience constipation.
No weight to right forefoot and toes.
