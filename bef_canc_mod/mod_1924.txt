male with pmh significant for CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2163**], chronically occluded RCA with L->R collaterals, dilated cardiomyopathy of [**11-5**]% presenting to his outpatient Cardiologist with several weeks of lethargy, and found to be bradycardic with HR in the 30's.
EKG in office showed Junctional bradycardia at a rate of 30, blood pressure 60/palp.
He was given atropine 2mg with increased Hr to 40's, and then transferred to the ED.
He developed an increased oxygen requirement with O2 saturation 60-70% on NRB.
Head CT was performed to rule out CVA as cause of bradycardia and was found to be negative for acute bleed.
Patient was also found to be in acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.5 from baseline 2.5.
In the ED his rhythm alternated between sinus and junctional bradycardia.
Per medical records, the patient has been hospitalized several times in the past for both acute on chronic congestive heart failure and acute renal failure attributed to poor forward flow from CHF.
On [**1-13**] the patient had increased creatinine detected on routine labs, which resulted in a decrease of his bumex from 4mg to 3mg PO BID.
Per wife, patient has had increased confusion over past three days, in addition to abdominal pain and diahrrea.

**  An 86 man with a history of CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 15%, presented with junctional bradycardia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension.
Hypotension was likely secondary to systolic congestive heart failure.
BNP elevated at >24 000 was consistent with this.
No arterial line or central line was placed because of elevated INR 7.9 on admission.
Peripheral dopamine and fluid boluses were initially given to maintain MAP >60.
He became hypertensive with frequent ectopy.
#Bradycardia: On admission he was fluctuating between sinus and junctional bradycardia.
Contributions likely included hypoxia, hypothermia, and acute renal failure.
Cardiac ischemia was on the differential as well, but EKG without ischemic changes and elevated troponin likely [**2-23**] renal failure.
#Respiratory Status:  He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure in ED, was 70% on NRB.
CXR with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of CHF.
He was not diuresed because of hypotension.
This was likely secondary to exacerbation of congestive heart failure with low cardiac output with a possible component of overdiuresis.
[**Month/Day (2) **] lytes showed a pre-renal state.
Renal was consulted and saw no need for CVVH or HD.
His wife was reporting three days of confusion, abdominal pain and diahrrea.
Sputum grew staph aureas.
# Coronaries: History of CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2163**], and chronically occluded RCA with L->R collaterals.
EKG was without ischemic changes, troponin was elevated, likely secondary to renal failure, but CK was normal and there was low suspicion for acute ischemia.
#Bullous Pemphigoid: Minocycline and hydroxyzine were in setting of acute illness.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q6H (every 6  hours) as needed for itchiness.
