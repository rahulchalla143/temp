History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86-yo-woman with history of atrial fib presents w/ dyspnea.
She was feeling well until 2-3 days ago, when she developed cough productive of scant sputum with devlopment of wheezing.
Patient denied at that time any recent fever, chest pain, increased LE edema, leg pain.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation: on coumadin Sick sinus syndrome: has required temporary pacer for skin surgery previously HTN Hyperlipidemia Chronic venous stasis Squamous cell carcinoma: right medial calf, s/p excision [**11-19**], positive margins on 1st and 2nd excision attempts, needs XRT to area 6 weeks after the wound heals.
UTI: last culture w/ enterobacter resistant to all but bactrim and meropenem rectal ulcers: possibly from constipation and straining History of C diff colitis Anemia: from blood loss after GI bleed, last HCT 25-30 in [**11-19**]  Urge incontinence Depression Colon adenoma in [**2141**]: last colonoscopy in [**2143**], no polyps s/p hysterectomy   Social History: Husband recently died from terminal liver disease.
No TOB, EtOH, or other drugs.
OP: MM dry appearing Neck: JVP approx 8cm Chest: Patient with significant expiratory wheezing diffusely with inspiratory crackles at both bases.
3-4cm surgical ulcer over right lower extrmiety.

[**2150-1-31**] CXR: Compared with one day earlier, the right suprahilar patchy opacity is more extensive and patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is also more pronounced.
Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region and right is unchanged.
No effusion is identified.
No pneumothorax is seen.
More extensive patchy opacities in the right perihilar and right cardiophrenic regions.
[**2150-1-31**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo female with history of afib with SSS on coumadin, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents from ALF with worsening dyspnea, treated in MICU for NSTEMI, CHF and PNA.
# NSTEMI:  In the setting of her acute illness the patient suffered an NSTEMI with Trop increasing from <.01 to peak of 0.77, since trending downward.
However, given NSTEMI exacerbated by afib with RVR and history of likely tachy-brady, EP consulted as well.
She was subsequently diuresed and started on broad spectrum coverage abx (Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl) given fever on admission and course pulmonary exam.
With above treatment patient's fever curve improved as did her resp status.
Of note, she did have LLE swelling on admission which has since resolved, but LENIs neg for DVT.
Likely [**1-16**] diastolic dysfunction.
She was initially diuresed aggressively, but her diuretics were discontinued when she appeared clinically euvolemic, if not mildly dry [**1-16**] to decreased PO intake.
She was not covered for hospital acquired infection (gram negatives and MRSA), but doubt that based on clinical status and CXR findings.
She has remained afebrile without leukocytosis since initiation of abx.
Her pulmonary exam remains rhonchorus and she has not been able to clear her secretions well.
Although predominantly rhonchorus on exam, she did have intermittent wheezing.
She was continued on advair, albuterol/atrovent nebulizers, which have improved her bronchospastic symptoms and exam findings.
Likely a demand picture in setting of afib with RVR, PNA, and CHF with resultant hypoxia in the unit.
Atrial fibrillation: Known history of a. fib with history of likely SSS, previously requiring temporary pacing.
Hematuria:  While on the heparin gtt, she developed hematuria via her foley 1 day prior to admission.
There were no clots.
Her foley catheter was discontinued and her UA did not reveal evidence of infection.
She was able to void without difficulty and she denied urinary symptoms.
Should be monitored at rehab given anticoagulation and recent hematuria.
ARF:  She had a very mild bump in her creatinine to 1.2 (BL creatinine nml) just prior to discharge and clinically on exam appeared to be dry with dry MM.
Her diet has since been restarted and she was given a small fluid bolus (given known CHF and recent aggressive diuresis).
Given concern for aspiration pneumonia, she was evaluated by speech and swallow twice during this stay and was cleared to take PO (ground and thin liquids) diet without evidence of aspiration.
#  On [**2150-2-10**], primary team was notified that patient had a bed at [**Hospital 100**] rehab and she was discharged there.
However, upon arrival to [**Hospital 100**] rehab, transport team was informed that there was no bed available.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia Tachy-brady syndrome Atrial fibrillation Non ST-elevation MI Hematuria Congestive heart failure .
Secondary: Depression Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening cough, weight gain of greater than 3 pounds, worsening blood in your urine, discomfort urinating, or inability to void, fevers/chills, blood in your stool or any other symptoms that concern you.
