Approximately 2 wks ago, pt developed worsening SOB and was admitted to [**Location (un) 745**] and started on ABx for PNA along with steroids as treatment for COPD exacerbation.
He developed some numbness and tingling in his left thumb and was transferred back to [**Location (un) 745**] for further evaluation.
Orthopedics was consulted and he was diagnosed with anterior interosseus palsy.
He was then discharged back to the NH and developed acute SOB and hypoxia on the day of admission.
He was given steroids and ABx and was subsequently found to have a PE and started on a heparin gtt.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of PNA and PE.
Denies any N/V/D or abdominal pain.
Positive for orthopnea and PND.
Chronic LE lymphadema.
SOB with minimal activity.
Denies dysuria but admits to urinary frequency and urgency.
Past Medical History: COPD Atrial fibrillation (one brief episode recently, started on digoxin) HTN BPH Hypothyroidism s/p partial thyroidectomy CAD (per records, no h/o MI or cardiac cath) h/o Klebsiella, MRSA, Pseudomonas infections .

Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2106-3-9**] 09:45PM   WBC-18.8* RBC-4.14* HGB-11.7* HCT-35.2* MCV-85 MCH-28.3 MCHC-33.3 RDW-14.5 [**2106-3-9**] 09:45PM   NEUTS-96.5* LYMPHS-2.2* MONOS-1.2* EOS-0.1 BASOS-0.1 [**2106-3-9**] 09:45PM   PLT COUNT-227 [**2106-3-9**] 09:45PM   PT-11.7 PTT-100.6* INR(PT)-1.0  RADS: CT chest: VERY LIMITED STUDY DEMONSTRATING EVIDENCE FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN THE LEFT LUNG.
RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATES CONSISTENT WITH PNEUMONIA.
SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.
Transferred to Floor from ICU, stable on transfer and only one episode of desat following near aspiration of small food particle.
Minimal reserve.
HCT stable, no further tachycardia, enzymes stable.
no new issues from floor stay.
#Pulmonary embolism: Per OSH records, CT with evidence of PE (L lung) and RLL PNA which most likely explains worsening SOB/DOE.
Continued steroids to complete a quick taper for COPD exacerbation.
Started heparin gtt for PE and transition to coumadin.
Pt continued to be afebrile, with CXR showing consolidation in same location as previous PNA from 2wks ago (RUL), so because of decreased suspicion of PNA, abx were discontinued.
Also, per Pulm, no IVC filter recommended (lymphedema near absolute contraindication to IVC filter given risk of obstruction; no data to support IVC filter in COPD or cardiomyopathy).
-no evidence of volume overload on exam but pt has a h/o diastolic dysfunction, low suspicion for CHF exacerbation.
# Anemia: Hct in low 30s on admission, stable, no known h/o anemia from prior.
Normocytic, likely mild ACD (slightly low TIBC, transferrin; normal B12, folate).
Pt currently asx, but continues to be guaiac positive (rectal exam did not demonstrate any masses).
-follow Hct -cont guaiac checking stools (still G+ [**3-11**]).
# HTN -monitor BP, consider increasing dose if BPs still elevated.
# BPH/increased urgency/frequency: Likely due to BPH, not likely UTI given neg UA/UCx, but may be due to prostatitis or incomplete bladder emptying or detrussor instability.
-continue Proscar and Flomax -d/w urology who had no further recs, f/u urology for additional exam and PSA as outpt.
# Hypothyroidism - home dose of Synthroid  while in house.
# FEN - cardiac diet - replete lytes PRN .
# Access - PIV .
