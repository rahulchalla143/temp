Admission Date:  [**2115-6-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-6-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-10-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 73 year old gentleman with a history of mitral regurgitation, hypertension and chronic anemia.
He was recently admitted in [**2115-4-21**], to [**Hospital1 69**] after ten days of chest pain and shortness of breath.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
On chest x-ray he was found to be in congestive heart failure as well as showing cardiomegaly.
The patient ruled out for an myocardial infarction at that time.
During that admission also, the patient began to have complaints of visual field disturbances.
An MRI was obtained which showed a left occipital stroke thought to be due to embolic events from his atrial fibrillation.
Chronic fatigue syndrome.
History of gastrointestinal bleed attributed to NSAIDs.
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia times five years.
Status post ear surgery.
Chronic headache times 35 years.
Chronic anxiety disorder.
Cerebrovascular disease with a facial droop.
Known cerebral small vessel disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Heart is irregularly irregular with III/VI murmur.
Chest x-ray with no acute disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2115-6-11**] for a mitral valve annuloplasty and a left heart Maze's procedure.
The patient was transferred on Milrinone for a decreased ejection fraction by echocardiogram seen in the Operating Room.
The patient's coagulopathy was corrected and the patient was subsequently taken back to the Operating Room for re-exploration for bleeding.
The patient remained on Milrinone and the patient had been begun on amiodarone for bursts of atrial fibrillation.
A chest x-ray was obtained on postoperative day number one which showed what appeared to be a bilateral pleural effusion.
Chest tubes put out minimal amounts and the patient had developed large amounts of secretions being suctioned from his endotracheal tube.
The bronchoscopy showed mild white secretions bilaterally.
The patient continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation and continued on amiodarone and Milrinone.
It was noted that the patient had a rising BUN and creatinine.
The patient was started on a heparin drip for his continued atrial fibrillation.
The patient had varying amounts of agitation on transfer to the floor which was thought to be withdrawal of patient's preoperative benzodiazepine dosing.
The patient continued to be tachycardic and in atrial fibrillation.
The patient began working with Physical Therapy.
On postoperative day number eight, it was noted that while the patient had rate controlled atrial fibrillation at rest, the patient had rapid atrial fibrillation with ambulation.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Extremities are warm and well perfused without edema.
Sternal incision is clean and dry.
Sutures are intact without erythema or drainage.
Chest x-ray shows persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.
Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair.
Atrial fibrillation status post Maze's procedure and status post cardioversion.
Postoperative renal insufficiency.
