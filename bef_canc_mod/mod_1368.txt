A 2-cm diameter irregularly marginated peripheral nodular opacity in the right upper lobe.
This could represent a peripheral area of infection from either bacterial or fungal etiology.
Differential diagnosis includes primary pulmonary neoplasm, pulmonary infarction, and contusion.
Large right and small left pleural effusions; large amount of ascites and anasarca.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the lungs as well as dependent areas of consolidation coexisting with atelectasis.
These findings are likely due to widespread pulmonary infection; aspiration pneumonia should be considered.
New moderate pericardial effusion.
Acute right anterior rib fractures without evidence of pneumothorax.
These are likely due to recent CPR.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated s/p PEA arrest and CPR x2.
A CT scan was done which revealed a large right sided pleural effusion and diffuse ground glass opacities most consistent with infection.
An Echo revealed worsening pulmonary artery hypertension.
She developed a tachyarrythmia and then a brady arrythmia that appeared junctional and eventually ventricular.
