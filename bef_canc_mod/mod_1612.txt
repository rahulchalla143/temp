His BP at [**Last Name (un) 4068**] dropped to the 80s, with tachycardia to the 120s.
He had an EGD on the night of admission which did not show a clear source of bleed.
In addition there was an initial question of duodenal varices.
Had abdominal ultrasound with dopplers which was unremarkable and without evidence of portal hypertension making duodenal ulcers unlikely.
It did show duodenal ulcer.
Pt subsequently had a stable Hct and was transferred to the floor.
He underwent a colonoscopy which showed diverticui in the sigmoid and descending colon as well as internal hemorroids.
The capsule study was not capturing but during the procedure but he was found to have a small bleeding AVM that was clipped and cauterized.
Thus it was felt his bleed could have been due to this AVM and further pursuit of a capsule study during this hospitalization was felt unneccessary.
# Carotid stent/atherosclerosis: Both the pts asa/plavix were initially held in setting of bleed.
#Fever-Pt had a fever to 101.9 2 days prior to discharge.
He was asymtomatic and did not have an elevation in his WBC.
A U/A was negative, blood cultures were sent (NGTD on day of discharge) and a CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.
No further intervention felt necessary.

Secondary HTN Squamous cell CA of soft palate s/p XRT/Chemo   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have a low blood count and had some bleeding from your colon.
You had some procedures done to identify the site of bleeding.
You have an ulcer in your stomach and were started on a medication called Pantoprazole to help reduce stomach acid.
In addition you were found to have some diverticuli in your colon as explained while you were here which likely contributed to the bleed.
Your Plavix was held because it causes thinning of your blood and makes the bleeding worse.
If you have any ongoing lightheadedness, dizziness, bleeding from below, chest pain or shortness of breath, please call your doctor or return to the ER.
