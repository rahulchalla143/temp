At the OSH emergency department, she was ill-appearing, hypotensive, and afebrile, with a leukocytosis to 22 with 15% bandemia and 70% polys; her creatinine was 1.7.
Four of four blood cultures grew gram positive cocci, as well.
She subsequently developed respiratory distress overnight with an arterial blood gas of 7.2/14.5/95 and was intubated.
Chest X-ray at the OSH was consistent with ARDS vs volume overload.
An MRI of the right hand showed no definite fluid collection.

Relevant Studies: CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2125-4-16**]): Poorly defined nodular opacities in right upper and left mid lung zones, concerning for septic emboli or fungal infection.
There are no other pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is a small right pleural effusion with associated atelectatis.
Lung windows revea severe emphysematous changes.
There are multiple bilateral, scattered varying- sized rounded and irregular non-cavitating focal pulmonary opacities, predominantly with a peripheral location.
In the left posterior paraspinal musculature just deep to the trapezius muscle extending inferiorly from the C1 level , there is a rim enhancing multiloculated fluid collection concerning for abscess.
In the region of the lower thoracic spine there is an apparent encapsulated prevertebral fluid collection adjacent to the right pleural effusion, and with low but slightly higher [**Doctor Last Name **] density than the free pleual effusion.
No gas is present within this effusion but The vertebral bodies at this level (probable T8.9 and 10) demonstrate a mixed sclerotic/ lytic pattern and findings are concerning for osteomyelitis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] T-SPINE W &W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-4-17**]): There are signs of extensive osseous abnormality of the mid thoracic spine with a prevertebral collection associated with bone and interspace abnormality.
This is most suspicious for infection and abscess formation.
There is also an adjacent pleural effusion, and extension of an infectious process into this space should be considered.
An area suspicious for large abscess collection is also identified in the subcutaneous musculature of the posterior back extending from roughly C7, 8 cm inferiorly into the thoracic region, to about T5.
Abnormality at the C1-2 junction is also identified and though this could represent degenerative change, but infection cannot be excluded in this location.
TEE ([**2125-4-17**]): No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral valve abscess is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no abscess of the tricuspid valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST ([**2125-5-22**]): Pulmonary arteries appear well opacified and there is no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
Again seen are several mediastinal lymph nodes, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.
There is no evidence of pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
New linear/nodular opacities seen on series 2, image 34, possibly represents atelectasis.
Also seen is a smaller irregular peripheral opacity, best seen on series 3, image 55.
Again seen is a paraspinal abscess collection anterior to the mid thoracic region.
Soft tissue inflammation is also seen in this area.
There is no evidence of free fluid or free air within the abdomen.
Scattered mesenteric lymph nodes again seen, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Degenerative changes also again noted within the spine, most notably at the L5 level.

An initial incision and drainage of the right hand abscess had been performed at the OSH.
Here, she was started on vancomycin with gentamycin at synergistic dosing for gram positive cocci on outside hospital cultures.
She was aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids, with Levophed for additional pressure support.
She received a course of Xigris and stress dose steroids.
When cultures showed MSSA on HD #2, vancomycin was changed to nafcillin.
Gentamycin was stopped after 5 days of synergistic dosing.
There was concern for line infection.
Left and right internal jugular central catheters placed since admission were removed, as well as her arterial line.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
A chest X-ray showed pulmonary nodules, prompting a follow up CT of the chest.
This showed nodular opacities consistent with septic emboli.
In addition, it showed two fluid collections, one involving the vertebral bodies of T8-T10, and another in the left paraspinal muscles extending inferiorly from C7.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a left iliopsoas abscess.
The orthopaedic spine team was consulted, and an MRI of the spine was obtained for further delineation of these lesions.
The MRI confirmed osteomyelitis of the T9 vertebra, and showed a fluid collection abutting the spine in addition to a fluid collection subcutaneously on the back.
The orthopaedic spine service recommended a conservative approach with CT guided drainage of the paraspinal fluid collection.
The infectious diseases team agreed with a strategy of attempting to treat each locus of infection discretely and attempt drainage.
However at this point, the infection appeared fairly disseminated and there was some concern that the infection would be difficult to eradicate.
The pulmonary nodules were felt to not be accessible by bronchoscopy, and not large enough for percutaneous drainage.
The patient underwent successful CT guided drainage of the superficial abscess on the back, in addition to the paraspinal fluid collection (with a pigtail catheter left in place for drainage).
Plans were made for CT guided drainage of the parascapular abscess.
However, the scan showed no drainable fluid in the parascapular region.
The T8-T10 paraspinal fluid collection was persistent, but slightly improved.
Incidentally, however, it showed bilateral shoulder effusion.
She subsequently defervesced, and was afebrile x 1 week prior to discharge.
Pain control: She was initially placed on a morphine PCA for pain control, but had difficulty operating the PCA.
She was changed to a fentanyl patch with IV Dilaudid boluses for breakthrough.
On discharge, her pain was well controlled on 25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch with 8mg PO Dilaudid Q2h for breakthrough pain.
Respiratory failure: The patient had developed respiratory failure at the OSH and arrived on mechanical ventilation.
This was thought secondary to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in the setting of sepsis.
She was maintained on TPN throughout her hospitalization for short gut syndrome.
Her Crohns was otherwise stable, without any complaints of abdominal pain.
Cardiac: She had a mild troponin T leak ~ 0.7, with a peak CK-MB of 95.
An initial TTE showed a depressed EF.
Anemia: Patient had a stable anemia with iron studies consistent with chronic inflammation.
In addition to treatment of her underlying infection and pain control described above, she was given anxiolytics as needed.
Acidosis/hyperkalemia: The patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis on admission.
There were no ECG changes.
Prophylaxis: She received heparin in her TPN for DVT prophylaxis.
