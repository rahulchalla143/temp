For approximately two weeks, the patient has been experiencing cough, fevers, and shortness of breath upon exertion.
The patient's cough has only occasionally been productive of sputum.
He has recently been immunosuppressed on prednisone and azathiporine for ulcerative colitis.
He reportedly also has CHF, but does not have cardiology notes in our system, and has never been hospitalized for his heart failure and does not take diuretics.
The patient has further not experienced any swelling in his lower legs over the past two weeks.
The patient denies any changes to his GI symptoms over the past two weeks.
His primary nephrologist saw him today and noted that he was dyspneic with a saturation of 87% on room air and sent him to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
A chest X-ray showed a new opacity at the right lung base, so the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
The patient was capable of answering short questions without being short of breath.
Past Medical History: 1. ulcerative proctitis with evidence of ulcerative colitis [**3-/2151**] - pt currently on Azathioprine started [**12/2153**] 2. bladder cancer diagnosed in [**2139**] 3. s/p radical cystectomy & neobladder operation in [**2139**].
4. non-small cell lung cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemo, surgery & x-ray therapy.
5. s/p Left thoracotomy, LUL lobectomy, left chest wall resection, ribs one through four.
Severe pneumonia [**1-/2154**] complicated by AFib/RVR and MICU admission for hypoTN due to RVR, hypoxia 8.
He smoked one pack a day but quit 12 years ago after his bladder diagnosis.
Family History: One sister with osteoporosis and diabetes.
No known kidney problems in the family.

Mild right ventricular dilitation with preserved free wall motion.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Labs on discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: 74yo Russian speaking M with h/o ?CHF (normal stress test [**2151**], normal EF), lung cancer s/p LUL lobectomy and radiation, bladder cancer s/p radical cystectomy, UC on Prednisone/Azathioprine presented 1 wk ago with productive cough of green sputum, fevers, and dyspnea on exertion for [**3-15**] wks, found to have PNA.
Community acquired-pneumonia: Complicated by chronic immunosuppression on Prednisone and Azathiprine.
Presented with productive cough and fever of 10 day duration, and likely opacity at right lower lung base.
The patient's son reports no history of aspiration or choking.
Given nodal agents that dropped his blood pressure, so given IVF's to maintain pressure but then had some element of flash edema with hypoxia, so sent to MICU where Diltiazem was initiated and converted him to NSR.
Pt still noted to have paroxysms of AFib on the floor, symptomatic if very rapid to >140, but tolerable if lower; lower rates were tolerated, and overall AFib was controlled.
On discharge, home Atenolol was stopped in favor of Diltiazem, and of note pt without known h/o low EF or infarct; had normal mibi scan in [**2151**].
Hypoxia: Initially with 4-5L O2 requirement that worsened prompting MICU transfer but by call out, this was eventually able to be weaned down to RA successfully.
The patient is not on home diuretics, though he evidently has some level of dyspnea on exertion at baseline.
Disp:*1 inhaler* Refills:*0* 14. codeine-guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough for 5 days.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe community acquired pneumonia Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Hypoxia Hypotension Ulcerative colitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with a severe pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics.
Because you were fairly sick, you developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate.
This was complicated by low blood pressure and hypoxia and you were briefly in the ICU.
START Guaifenesin-Codine 5 mL every 6 hours as needed for cough 8.
