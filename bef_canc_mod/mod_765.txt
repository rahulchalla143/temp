In this patient with known achalasia and dilated esophagus, there is no change in the appearance of the dilated distal esophagus which contains ingested debris.
There is no sign of aspiration.
No large pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated distal esophagus as seen previously containing ingested food contents.
No signs of aspiration.
Please refer to prior CT torso for full descriptive details of esophageal abnormalities.
Discharge: **EGD with small bowel enteroscopy: Mucosal laceration with contact bleeding was noted in the lower third of the esophagus.
Evidence of free sloughing of epithelium and contact bleeding was seen at the lower esophagus.
Tortuous and massively dilated esophagus; moderate amount of liquid and solid food found in the mid to lower esophagus.
This may be reflective of underling esophagitis in setting of chemical/acid irritation from fluid retention within esphagus, and may be a contributing factor to bleeding.

# UGI Bleed Patient has h/o recurrent GIB with multiple admissions, including recent ICU admission.
Presents with with HCT of 22 and hypotension with documented melenic guaiac positive stools and elevated BUN concerning for upper GI source of bleeding.
The patient [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] EGD on [**7-21**] which showed a mucosal laceration with contact bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.
There was a small amount of bright red blood oozing from the underlying tissue.
Given suboptimal study with copious food/fluid in the whole esophagus and proximal stomach, the patient was placed on a clear liquid diet with plan for repeat enteroscopy attempt  and capsule placement.
He received 3 units of PRBCs and about 4L of fluid during the first 24hours of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course with HCT increase from 22 to 27.
# Hypotension Baseline from previous records: 110-130 sbps.
Hypotension is secondary to hypovolemia in setting of acute blood loss.
Patient does have elevated WBC but suspicion for infection is very low at this time.
On the medical floor, his antihypertensives were not reintroduced prior to discharge, given persistent borderline to low BPs.
# Acute blood loss anemia Patient with HCT 40 baseline in [**12/2111**] prior to onset of GIB.
Found to have significant iron deficiency with ferritin of 5 on [**6-25**].
# Leukocytosis Patient with WBC or 24.5 on admission.
He is afebrile with no localizing symptoms of infection.
# CAD Patient with h/o STEMI ([**2112-1-29**]) s/p DESx2 to LAD, angioplasty with clot retrieval from Diagonal.
Post-MI LVEF 30% with apical akinesis, but recent TTE in [**2112-3-8**] with LVEF 55-60% and apical hypokinesis.
No concerning EKG changes or symptoms.
As he had no large volume GIB overnight, he was continued on ASA 81mg and clopidogrel 75mg daily.
# HTN Home regimen of lisinopril 5mg daily and metoprolol ER 50mg daily were held in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypotension and acute GIB.
His SBP was 98-120 on the day of discharge without evidence or symptoms of orthostasis or chest discomfort.
His tamsulosin was also held due to low blood pressures.
# Achalasia: increased pantoprazole to [**Hospital1 **].
Evidence of esophagitis on evaluation, s/p prior myomectomy.
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
8. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: #Acute upper GI bleed due to esophageal irritation #Acute blood loss anemia #h/o Achalasia s/p myomectomy  Secondary: Coronary artery disease, s/p STEMI [**12/2111**] Hyperlipidemia BPH   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you know, you were admitted due to a low blood count that we feel is related to irritation in your esophagus.
While this is not directly related to your prior surgery, it is likely that increased acid levels with reflux to your esophagus will continue to make this worse.
***  It is also important that you avoid foods that make you have your discomfort in your chest/esophagus, as you noted to us.
These foods are likely increasing the irritation, and can put you at increased risk of having another bleeding episode.
Changes to your medications: -Increase your pantoprazole from once to twice daily -Please HOLD your blood pressure medications lisinopril and metoprolol until you see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] due to low blood pressures (100s) while you were in the hospital.
-Please HOLD your tamsulosin until you see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], due to the same low blood pressures while you were in the hospital.
