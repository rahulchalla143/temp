The patient initially presented in [**7-1**] for fevers and rigors and was found to have a subdiaphragmatic abscess and underwent IR drain placement with cultures demonstrating polymicrobial growth including Bacteroides and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluconazole subsequently changed to amox/clav.
She was readmitted in mid-[**Month (only) 216**] for persistent nausea, and cultures then demonstrated polymicrobial growth with budding yeast speciated as [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Krusei.
On [**7-16**], she underwent open left colectomy with colorectal anastamosis and diverting loop ileostomy, with stool noted in the abscess.
Her post-operative course was then complicated by a prolonged [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for volume overload requiring mechanical ventilation and a left-sided watershed CVA, and was ultimately discharged to rehab on [**2160-8-13**] with persistent weakness on vanco, meropenem, and micafungin with plan for continuation of antibiotics for at least 7 days after drain was pulled.
The patient was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the [**Last Name (un) **]-rectal service on [**8-16**] for altered mental status.
Her current hospital course has been notable for intermintent delirium described as being ambulatory to being difficult to control.
Two nights ago, she received 12.5 trazodone, and EEG yesterday was noted to have persistent epileptiform activity concerning for status epilepticus.
LUQ drain was subsequently removed, and CT guided aspiration of midline and RUQ fluid collections unsuccessful.
Also of note, the patient also developed a new 3L O2 requirement yesterday.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer requested for status epilepticus and fevers.

No seizure activity since [**8-22**] at 18:00.
Likely secondary to chronic or new infarcts seen on MRI (ischemic vs. embolic from carotids vs. lupus vasculitis).
Also multiple strokes and seizure bring up the possibility of a CNS vasculitic etiology such as lupus cerebritis or ACLA syndrome ??????
C3/C4 wnl, dsDNA negative.
Potential sources include: evolving pneumonia, abdominal source given recent history and temporal association with drain removal.
The patient was noted to have some increased adjitation and a urinalysis and urine culture was sent on [**2160-9-9**] which showed possible VRE, infectious disease was consulted and it seemed as though the specimen was possibly contaminated, her foley catheter was removed and a repeat UA was then sent which again showed enterococus.
It was decided that at the recommendation of infectious disease to give the patient a one time dose of fofomycin 3gm by mouth and follow-up in 48 hours with a urinalysis and culture.
On discharge urinalysis continued to show small amount bacteria moderate leukocytes.
The patient was started on linezolid by mouth for possible VRE in the urine.
Given complete R carotid occlusion and L partial occlusion, pt likely needs the blood pressure for cerebral perfusion so we will maintain SBPs 120.
# DM 2: Per recommendation by geriatrics the patient was started on the following insulin regimen.
Last dose on [**2160-9-17**] was 37.5mg and she needed an addition 6.25mg with minimal effect.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Electrical status on EEG.She was given PHT and Keppra and was found to have new strokes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being discharge to rehab from your long hospitalization after your Laparoscopic converted to open extended left colectomy with colorectal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy for surgical managment for perforated diverticulitis with abscess.
When you were admitted to the hospital, you were being watched closely and there was a morning that you became unresponsive and you were found to be having siezures.
You were transferred to the intensive care unit and after many images and tests of your brain and neurologic work-up it was determined that you had a stroke, and this was the cause of your siezures.
