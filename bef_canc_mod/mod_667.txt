No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
Stable old right temporal lacunar type infarct.
Velocities in the proximal and mid TIPS have decreased compared to prior.
Apparent interval increase in velocity in the posterior TIPS may be secondary to turbulence.
Cirrhotic liver with small gallstone as described.
[**2179-11-26**] CXR: Right basilar alveolar opacity and right pleural effusion increased, still small, suggesting pneumonia in the clinical context.
Minimal left pleural effusion is unchanged.

Confusion: Likely [**3-13**] Hepatic Encephalopathy as pt's relative reports he is non-compliant with lactulose at home.
Pt has a  h/o DT with persistently elevated CIWA during the first 4 days of this admission.
Thus, withdrawl was also likely contributing to some confusion as could benzos used to treat withdrwal.
He had a temp to 103 reportedly in ED and was put on Ceftriaxone for presumptive SBP.
Fever in ED could have been [**3-13**] agitation, EtOH withdrawl and/or acute alcoholic hepatitis.
There was thought to be too little ascitic fluid to tap.
CXR showed likely aspiration PNA and the pt was put on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
EtOH Cirrhosis s/p TIPS: MELD on admission 22.
4. h/o depression- Initially help amitryptyline while pt sedated but this was restarted prior to discharge.
Hepatic Encephalopathy 2.
Alcoholic Cirrhosis 4.
Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
Depression 3.
Thrombocytopenia  Secondary Diagnosis:   Discharge Condition: Stable.
This was likely due to both encephalopathy as well as alcohol withdrawal.
