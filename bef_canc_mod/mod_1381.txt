RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2149-4-4**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
ECHO [**2149-3-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated aortic root.
Bronchoscopy showed evidence of mid-tracheal stenosis about [**7-30**] mm in diameter.
She was emergently intubated, fibrooptically and was taken to the OR for emergent rigid bronchoscopy with baloon dilatation of her tracheal lesion (up to 16 mm).
She was able to only tolerate brief episodes of wean to CPAP but with apnea, she was placed back on vent settings.
Sediment with many hyaline casts and only occaisional RTEs.
Plan to prevent further renal insults and let tubules recover and avoid IVF (has a lot edema), lasix only if needed for pulmonary edema since she should autodiurese.

Swelling, erythema noticed in LUE.
US showing thrombosis in the left basilic vein, around PICC line (basilic vein is not considered a deep vein).
With anxiety, she required intermittent sedation and with hypoxia during these episodes, also required to be placed back on vent.
